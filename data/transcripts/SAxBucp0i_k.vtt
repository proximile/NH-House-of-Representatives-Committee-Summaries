with that
 
00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
based on our rich discussion that we had
 
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
when representative tucker was here and
 
00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 align:start position:0%
presented the bill before the committee

we have decided that we would like to
take

take
 
00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
an additional look and work further with
 
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
the bill based on some of the concepts
 
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
that we had heard in committee
 
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
around various areas of the concept of
 
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
time to travel so with that
 
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
i'll call representative tucker
 
00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
forward and i'll allow her a couple of
 
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
moments to talk with us and talk about
 
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.830 align:start position:0%

made copies of
 
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.390 align:start position:0%
the bill
that

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
and then sent to ols
 
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
for review
 
00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 align:start position:0%
and they made some recommendations
 
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
which we accepted
 
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
in response to the discussion that came
 
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
up the other day when we made the
 
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.550 align:start position:0%
up the other day when we made the
presentation

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
when director wimsat was here
 
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
we went through and made further changes
 
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
which we feel are discussable
 
00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
and i have given copies to everyone in
 
00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
the audience
 
00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 align:start position:0%
as well as members of the committee
 
00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.550 align:start position:0%
as well as members of the committee
um

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
maybe not to
 
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
is that mr representative bixby do you
 
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
have one that this has the
 
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.509 align:start position:0%
have one that this has the
annotated

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.710 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
so i hope that the
 
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 align:start position:0%
and i did not send this version
 
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
to office of legislative services
 
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
because i was afraid they would get
 
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
bogged down if we kept
 
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
making too many changes so my intention
 
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.349 align:start position:0%
making too many changes so my intention
was

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 align:start position:0%
to listen to the feedback from committee
 
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
members today
 
00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 align:start position:0%
and see whether you like these words
 
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
or don't
 
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
or other changes
 
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
and i gather there may be other people
 
00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
talking to today we can hear what they
 
00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
have to say
 
00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:33.990 align:start position:0%
have to say
and

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
possibly come up with
 
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.189 align:start position:0%
possibly come up with
further

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:40.230 align:start position:0%
further
changes

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
which then would go to a well asked for
 
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.230 align:start position:0%
which then would go to a well asked for
their

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.950 align:start position:0%
their
assistance

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
i'd let
 
00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 align:start position:0%
our drafting attorney
 
00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 align:start position:0%
know that
 
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 align:start position:0%
and she wished me well
 
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
so that's where i am uh
 
00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 align:start position:0%
i think we have slimmed and trimmed
 
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
the build
 
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
a lot
 
00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:05.759 align:start position:0%
and that it's a better bill
 
00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh representative bixby made some
 
00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
changes not only
 
00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:11.510 align:start position:0%
changes not only
that

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
read more easily but
 
00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 align:start position:0%
seems to me it's important on this bill
 
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
more so than other kinds of bills
 
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
to have it so that
 
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
residents of the state
 
00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 align:start position:0%
can tell what it means
 
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
and so the fact that it reads more
 
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
easily and is understandable
 
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
is a really important contribution
 
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:36.200 align:start position:0%
is a really important contribution
so

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.749 align:start position:0%
so

[Music]
 
00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
having this work session
 
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
great thank you for coming up here i
 
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
will um first open it up to the
 
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
committee members here just so that we
 
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
all are aware
 
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.270 align:start position:0%
all are aware
um

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
the the folks here have the ability to
 
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
participate as well as but these are the
 
00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
only members up here who have a voting
 
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:01.600 align:start position:0%
capability representative bixby is here
 
00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
as well but
 
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
no he has no voting capabilities so
 
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
so with that i'll open it to the
 
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
committee members if you have questions
 
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
i'll recognize myself for a moment if i
 
00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:21.830 align:start position:0%
i'll recognize myself for a moment if i
may

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
may
 
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.029 align:start position:0%
may
um

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:23.990 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 align:start position:0%
i did have a couple of questions with
 
00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 align:start position:0%
regard to
 
00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:28.710 align:start position:0%
regard to
um

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
the original testimony that you had made
 
00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
i had a chance to review
 
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
the link that you had provided with the
 
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
epa's source water protection area
 
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.749 align:start position:0%
epa's source water protection area
document

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:39.759 align:start position:0%
document
 
00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:41.510 align:start position:0%
document
here

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
and so i did have a question on
 
00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:45.430 align:start position:0%
and so i did have a question on
the

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
s the setback time frame i've noticed in
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
some places and states they have a six
 
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
year setback
 
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
some have a five year setback and and so
 
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
for the five years how did you determine
 
00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
that five years was
 
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
what what you would prefer and i know
 
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
you had made mention to neighboring
 
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
states that some sometimes have more
 
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:07.830 align:start position:0%
states that some sometimes have more
um

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
stringent i i think that uh
 
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
we were trying to strike a compromise
 
00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
years around a well head
 
00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:25.759 align:start position:0%
there were as i recall
 
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
two five and ten years
 
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
and so that the five represented
 
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
a medium
 
00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.950 align:start position:0%
a medium
and

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:39.759 align:start position:0%
we've not seen anything or dr finkel has
 
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 align:start position:0%
not in his research which has been quite
 
00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:42.870 align:start position:0%
not in his research which has been quite
extensive

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
extensive
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
found anything that leads us to believe
 
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
that there's a perfect
 
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
answer but that is why we did that it
 
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
seemed like a
 
00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:53.670 align:start position:0%
seemed like a
very

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
do i see dr finkel
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
today no alas no okay thank you he is
 
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
however listening to the streaming
 
00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
and is on the other end of a telephone
 
00:08:15.189 --> 00:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
and cell phone and is texting if he
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:22.879 align:start position:0%
and i can read his
 
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
text in return if
 
00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:27.039 align:start position:0%
if i misstate something
 
00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:33.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
representative homula
 
00:08:38.469 --> 00:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
i had a question about the the boxed
 
00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039 align:start position:0%
adequate and representative
 
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
on-site field testing is that does that
 
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
need to be i understand it was used to
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
to clarify in section b
 
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.470 align:start position:0%
to clarify in section b
um

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:53.829 --> 00:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
does that need to be explained more
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
usually when there's
 
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
descriptive words you know adequate and
 
00:08:59.509 --> 00:08:59.519 align:start position:0%
representative is that an understood
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
like a scientifically understood
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
uh two two words
 
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
i think it is uh representative means of
 
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
course it has to be more than one
 
00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.630 align:start position:0%
course it has to be more than one
um

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.870 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:20.839 --> 00:09:22.630 align:start position:0%
 
a

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
view of
 
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
our department of environmental services
 
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
that this is this will lead to
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
reasonable discussion
 
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
between the agency
 
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
and uh an applicant
 
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
and that this is a reasonable
 
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
this is what that agency is to be doing
 
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
given the
 
00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
overall guidelines of the law itself if
 
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
it passes
 
00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.389 align:start position:0%
it passes
[Music]

00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
the distinction of before we had some
 
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
things that
 
00:09:59.269 --> 00:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
caused difficulty and concern on des as
 
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
part of
 
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
that required going on to private
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
property so we've eliminated entirely
 
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
the need to go on to
 
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
private property that's why the on-site
 
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:14.870 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
when i boxed it or
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
adam boxer who whoever one of us boxed
 
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.389 align:start position:0%
adam boxer who whoever one of us boxed
it

00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:21.910 align:start position:0%
it
um

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:24.640 align:start position:0%
we felt that was a discussable
 
00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.590 align:start position:0%
we felt that was a discussable
uh

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
and i have not
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
heard back i have high hopes that
 
00:10:32.389 --> 00:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
director wimsat can be here today
 
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
i sent him of course a copy
 
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
and have not
 
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
heard back as to any opinions on
 
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
these boxed areas
 
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:41.910 align:start position:0%
these boxed areas
and

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
obviously this is someone who will want
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
to pay attention to okay
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
and again the only reason i'm asking is
 
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
i just wonder who gets to decide
 
00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
adequate you know i like to when we're
 
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
looking at things i like to make sure
 
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.750 align:start position:0%
looking at things i like to make sure
that

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
there's no question when people read
 
00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.550 align:start position:0%
there's no question when people read
that

00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.430 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:10:59.430 --> 00:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
what that that might entail and i'm
 
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering who gets to decide what's
 
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:04.949 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering who gets to decide what's
adequate

00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:04.959 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
i i think it's really des and they get
 
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
but based off of this
 
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
i mean they will they will make up what
 
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
is on a case-by-case basis is what i
 
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
understand okay
 
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
all right so there's apparently as you
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
deal with these various topics
 
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh the des deals with there is uh back
 
00:11:26.829 --> 00:11:26.839 align:start position:0%
and forth with
 
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
applicants okay
 
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
all right thank you i'm just again the
 
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
reason i'm kind of getting to that is i
 
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
i wonder if you have somebody who's
 
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
trying to do a project and they have a
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
different idea of what adequate means is
 
00:11:40.949 --> 00:11:40.959 align:start position:0%
there are we opening any door for
 
00:11:40.959 --> 00:11:42.870 align:start position:0%
there are we opening any door for
quibbling

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
quibbling
 
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
you see i think i have this um
 
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
on the second page
 
00:11:50.949 --> 00:11:50.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
yep i see it there thank you in lines 12
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
to 13 i'll read it just because it is
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
we added three words adequate and
 
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:02.629 align:start position:0%
we added three words adequate and
representative

00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
so the des would be able to advise
 
00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
applicants to conduct the minimal amount
 
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
of testing
 
00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:10.959 align:start position:0%
needed to roughly estimate
 
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
whether the soils and bedrock at the
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
site are very porous
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
or very impermeable
 
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
des has indicated that it would not need
 
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
to do rule making to further define
 
00:12:25.509 --> 00:12:25.519 align:start position:0%
these three words but could work with
 
00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry i should have went
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
straight to there first
 
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
well the whole point of boxing it was so
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
we would end up discussing it so you're
 
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
just right on target
 
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
all right so my comment is actually not
 
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
limited to just the specific piece of
 
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
legislation but in general when a
 
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:50.720 align:start position:0%
statute is
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
set forth for a department to
 
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:55.190 align:start position:0%
set forth for a department to
uh

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
to be the you know
 
00:12:59.910 --> 00:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
to act on
 
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
it is the department is
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
empowered to
 
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
make the decisions relative to that
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
statute so in this case
 
00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
the department would be the uh arbiter
 
00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
of what is adequate and
 
00:13:13.279 --> 00:13:14.949 align:start position:0%
of what is adequate and
representative

00:13:14.949 --> 00:13:14.959 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
and but that but putting those words in
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
gives it a little bit more clear
 
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
guidance in terms of
 
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.470 align:start position:0%
guidance in terms of
uh

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.670 align:start position:0%
uh
they're

00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.470 align:start position:0%
they're
saying

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
well if it's going to be representative
 
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
and representative is
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
you're probably aware that this is is in
 
00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
fact a
 
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
technical term
 
00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:35.839 align:start position:0%
that involves um
 
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
having enough samples to
 
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh cover the the
 
00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:41.990 align:start position:0%
uh cover the the
um

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:44.069 --> 00:13:44.079 align:start position:0%
the the options and the data that's
 
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
needed so um
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
on a you know on a half acre site which
 
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't probably have but on a half
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
acre site one test well may be
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative but
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
on a
 
00:14:00.629 --> 00:14:00.639 align:start position:0%
on a 200 acre site then clearly you're
 
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
going to need to have more test wells
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
than that in order to
 
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh get a representative sample of the
 
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh of what the soil the hydro
 
00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:13.279 align:start position:0%
hydrological conditions are
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
around the entire area so uh so by
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
putting that in it just really clarifies
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
that yes this is in the purview of the
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
follow up if i may thank you
 
00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:28.959 align:start position:0%
representative bixby
 
00:14:28.959 --> 00:14:30.389 align:start position:0%
representative bixby
um

00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
representative tucker did you have any
 
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
discussion too
 
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
regarding sort of the one mile so if
 
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
we're thinking of things in a circle
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
um and one mile out and then five miles
 
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
out when we're talking again about
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
representative testing
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
is there a requirement further to be
 
00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.430 align:start position:0%
is there a requirement further to be
done

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
at a cadence of one mile three miles and
 
00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:53.839 align:start position:0%
then five miles or anything like that or
 
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
is it just
 
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
again to representative bixby's point at
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
the discretion of the department i think
 
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
it's at the discretion of the department
 
00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.470 align:start position:0%
it's at the discretion of the department
and

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
and what is considered uh
 
00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
which obviously over time changes
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
representative bixby i'd just like to
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
point out that in the
 
00:15:23.829 --> 00:15:23.839 align:start position:0%
uh in the draft that uh with the boxes
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
on it that we're discussing
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
uh it does not indicate at any point
 
00:15:28.079 --> 00:15:29.030 align:start position:0%
uh it does not indicate at any point
that

00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.470 align:start position:0%
that
the

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
department would have the option of
 
00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
requiring test wells that were not on
 
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
property owned by the
 
00:15:40.629 --> 00:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
uh by the applicant
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
so um so the
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
essentially uh there are
 
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
there's a distinction made in it between
 
00:15:50.629 --> 00:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
the actual land
 
00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
solid waste disposal area which is uh
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
going to be probably less than the area
 
00:15:59.350 --> 00:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
that is owned by the applicant
 
00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.310 align:start position:0%
that is owned by the applicant
and

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%
uh i would assume that uh normal
 
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
hydrological testing would involve
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
doing uh testing around the
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
circumference of the uh of the test area
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
of the disposal area
 
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
probably in that area that's not
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
disposable area but
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
is sort of around the perimeter
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
um but that's
 
00:16:22.959 --> 00:16:23.910 align:start position:0%
um but that's
that's

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:16:25.749 --> 00:16:25.759 align:start position:0%
a little bit of an assumption on my part
 
00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
but i i think that uh yeah and i'm not
 
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
sure they could probably clarify that
 
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that ownership is
 
00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:34.839 align:start position:0%
necessarily the
 
00:16:34.839 --> 00:16:36.389 align:start position:0%
necessarily the
the

00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
best word to use it may be that someone
 
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
has permission
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
from someone or is paid for permission
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
to go on land
 
00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
that someone else owns
 
00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:49.759 align:start position:0%
that they would intend to buy if it
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
meets the qualifications
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
and so it's
 
00:16:56.069 --> 00:16:56.079 align:start position:0%
it's the
 
00:16:56.079 --> 00:16:57.509 align:start position:0%
it's the
that's

00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
that's really
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
depends on the
 
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
what the applicant has to prove to an
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
agency that they have the right
 
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
to seek a permit
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
and that may or may not include actual
 
00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:15.199 --> 00:17:17.270 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
i just think since this is recorded that
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
it's important to make those
 
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:29.919 align:start position:0%
senator bixby so so in this so um i
 
00:17:29.919 --> 00:17:30.950 align:start position:0%
senator bixby so so in this so um i
guess

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
guess
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
the because the applicant may be
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
not purchasing the land until they have
 
00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.510 align:start position:0%
not purchasing the land until they have
the

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh until it's established that it be
 
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
actually makes sense then it would be a
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
matter of
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
having the right to access yes i i as a
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
reporter i cover planning board meetings
 
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
in other towns
 
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh from where i live and represent and
 
00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
this is a very typical thing of someone
 
00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
seeking a subdivision
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
to build houses
 
00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
very often
 
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
go through
 
00:18:05.669 --> 00:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
the process before they actually the
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
developer makes the purchase
 
00:18:10.549 --> 00:18:10.559 align:start position:0%
uh to make sure that all will work out
 
00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:13.039 align:start position:0%
and there there's legal ways to say that
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
you have the right to go on property and
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
to dig and test and
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
so forth and that it's all with the
 
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
owner's permission that this is being
 
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
done with the understanding
 
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
i'll recommend myself for another
 
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
question again too on line 14 excuse me
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
on line five
 
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
um when we're talking about um any leak
 
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
or spill or other failure
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
i just was curious to know
 
00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:47.830 align:start position:0%
i just was curious to know
um

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
what what types of failures that would
 
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
to talk about that further
 
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
this is on line five correct of the
 
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
of the that that was the word that those
 
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
were the words that omlas suggested
 
00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
and i think that
 
00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
other failure
 
00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
is sort of an omnibus
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
term that
 
00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
it would be something that des considers
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
a failure
 
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
but it was
 
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
in case it wasn't a leak or a spill
 
00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
if it was a rip or i don't know what
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
else but it's to make it so it covers
 
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
what people
 
00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
would generally agree is a failure
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
is there anybody from the department
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:51.669 --> 00:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
representative contra
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for taking
 
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
my question um a couple things that i
 
00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:00.440 align:start position:0%
was just looking at it says that the
 
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
five-year clock starts
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
when the groundwater
 
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
so i guess my question is is
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
that the setback distance would be in
 
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
effect for five years
 
00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.310 align:start position:0%
effect for five years
um

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:25.909 --> 00:20:25.919 align:start position:0%
not that at any time should any
 
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
groundwater or any lake or anything be
 
00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh contaminated
 
00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:30.710 align:start position:0%
uh contaminated
um

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
but i'm wondering why that's very
 
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:39.200 align:start position:0%
the five-year clock would start when
 
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
groundwater at the landfill site first
 
00:20:43.029 --> 00:20:43.039 align:start position:0%
became contaminated
 
00:20:51.909 --> 00:20:51.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:54.799 align:start position:0%
i can um representative bixby yeah i can
 
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh address that to some extent so um
 
00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.630 align:start position:0%
uh address that to some extent so um
the

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:21:02.549 --> 00:21:02.559 align:start position:0%
uh in in the bill itself it doesn't
 
00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:06.950 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
the the question was um
 
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
having some way of including
 
00:21:17.029 --> 00:21:17.039 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:21:17.039 --> 00:21:17.909 align:start position:0%
in the
uh

00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:17.919 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
in the legislation a way of indicating
 
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
what the point of the legislation was
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
why would one bother to track the
 
00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:26.559 align:start position:0%
transfer the
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
the ground the movement of groundwater
 
00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
in the first place
 
00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
and another way of dealing this
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
with this might be
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
take it out of
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
remove it from that location
 
00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:42.799 align:start position:0%
and then have a
 
00:21:42.799 --> 00:21:44.789 align:start position:0%
and then have a
uh

00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
an introductory sentence or two
 
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
saying the intent of this legislation is
 
00:21:49.919 --> 00:21:50.870 align:start position:0%
saying the intent of this legislation is
to

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
make sure that if any landfill is you
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
know for any landfill that is put in
 
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.470 align:start position:0%
know for any landfill that is put in
place

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
that uh if there were uh that there
 
00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:00.799 align:start position:0%
would be a
 
00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
buffer time of at least five years
 
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
if any leak or spill were detected
 
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh so the the location of that in that
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
sentence is not
 
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
critical but the the idea is that
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh there
 
00:22:19.029 --> 00:22:19.039 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
the way the the the
 
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
the point of having a setback is
 
00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:26.559 align:start position:0%
to make sure that if something goes
 
00:22:26.559 --> 00:22:27.590 align:start position:0%
to make sure that if something goes
wrong

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
00:22:30.549 --> 00:22:30.559 align:start position:0%
then valuable resources won't get messed
 
00:22:30.559 --> 00:22:31.350 align:start position:0%
then valuable resources won't get messed
up

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.390 align:start position:0%
up
and

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.549 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:34.559 --> 00:22:35.909 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:22:35.909 --> 00:22:35.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:35.919 --> 00:22:36.710 align:start position:0%
and
the

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.830 align:start position:0%
the
uh

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh and i based on uh previous testimony
 
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
from representative tucker it seems to
 
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
make sense that five years would be a
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount of time
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
to say okay if there is a spill then in
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
that amount of time
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
technical methods could be come out
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
could be established to
 
00:22:57.990 --> 00:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
deal with the problem
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
if the
 
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh if if that if the spill moved
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
in like 60 days then there's no way that
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
would be able to be caught and given the
 
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
complications sometimes of dealing with
 
00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:12.799 align:start position:0%
technical stuff even you know a year or
 
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
two years might not be sufficient to
 
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
deal with it but five years would be
 
00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
so the idea is that
 
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
when we
 
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
when we figure out what the setback is
 
00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:24.070 align:start position:0%
when we figure out what the setback is
for

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh a
 
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
landfill from a resource we want to make
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
sure we have time to deal with
 
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
problems that might occur
 
00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.830 align:start position:0%
problems that might occur
and

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
so so that's why
 
00:23:42.149 --> 00:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
uh that's why five years and
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
i'm i think it might actually make sense
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
to move that phrase of any leak or spill
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
or other failure to a different part
 
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
simply because the fact that you had a
 
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
question about it says that it didn't do
 
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
the job of explaining that's why we're
 
00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
doing this legislation in the first
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
place so i think perhaps an in
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
sort of an initial
 
00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:04.870 align:start position:0%
sort of an initial
purpose

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
sentence for
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
for this um
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
this section might make more sense
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
00:24:13.919 --> 00:24:14.870 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
kaplan

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
kaplan
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
this might be a follow-up question for
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative bixby or for uh
 
00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
representative tucker i'm not sure but
 
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh when you mention the five years
 
00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
without the clock any mention of a clock
 
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
does that presume that it's the duty of
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
the owner to have some sort of
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
you know permanent
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
sites for testing
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
to be able to detect any leak or is that
 
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
or is that something that's in the rule
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
making or where does that work
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
what what
 
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
you know what would force the landfill
 
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
owner to
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
to maintain some sort of testing
 
00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:47.919 align:start position:0%
capability to know when that clock it
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
i think that's all part of the
 
00:24:57.029 --> 00:24:57.039 align:start position:0%
permitting process is that they agree to
 
00:24:57.039 --> 00:24:58.710 align:start position:0%
permitting process is that they agree to
conditions

00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:01.039 align:start position:0%
and that's des's job to make sure that
 
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
they do
 
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps not as clear in new hampshire as
 
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
some places just how often that is
 
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
they again have the department has
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
discretion to set conditions
 
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
representative bixby yes i i i kind of
 
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
wish that uh there were some of here
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
from des to
 
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
clarify this but i believe that director
 
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
wimsat mentioned in
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
his testimony
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
something like you know they currently
 
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
have a four to six month yes
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
testing period so there are i think
 
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
there already is uh a requirement for an
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
established landfill to have
 
00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
uh test wells
 
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh around the perimeter in order to um
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
to identify
 
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
any spill when it occurs that's right
 
00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
clause so that everybody knows it's
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
every four months or every six months my
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
understanding is from his testimony is
 
00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.750 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
contra

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
contra
 
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559 align:start position:0%
again um i'm just reviewing this and new
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire is is
 
00:26:29.909 --> 00:26:29.919 align:start position:0%
has a lot of water
 
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh in the state i mean every city in
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
town except for one has
 
00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:38.799 align:start position:0%
water a body of water in it
 
00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
and i understand that it's the greater
 
00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
of 200 feet or x times 5 feet based on
 
00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.710 align:start position:0%
of 200 feet or x times 5 feet based on
velocity

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
velocity
 
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm not a geologist and i don't
 
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
understand how
 
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
the velocity with water flows and
 
00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.750 align:start position:0%
the velocity with water flows and
everything

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
but how will this affect
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:00.799 --> 00:27:02.149 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:03.919 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
we can anticipate with the landfills
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
that we now have operating
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
and an extension to the permit at
 
00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.149 align:start position:0%
and an extension to the permit at
carbury

00:27:16.149 --> 00:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
carbury
 
00:27:18.149 --> 00:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
most likely
 
00:27:18.159 --> 00:27:19.110 align:start position:0%
most likely
we

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
really don't have a crisis of immediate
 
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
need for new landfills
 
00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.190 align:start position:0%
need for new landfills
but

00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:27:28.149 --> 00:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
obviously we will need some in the next
 
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
50 years
 
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
there it's a huge state and
 
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
there is no thought that there will not
 
00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.549 align:start position:0%
there is no thought that there will not
be

00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:38.559 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative tucker i'd like
 
00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:47.750 align:start position:0%
thank you representative tucker i'd like
to

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
also further clarify it is my
 
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
recollection as well that your bill and
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
the subsequent amendment would not
 
00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
affect any already existing inoperation
 
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
landfills who may seek her mature
 
00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
for expansion that's right it's um
 
00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:10.190 align:start position:0%
i think it's uh it's on line
 
00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:11.590 align:start position:0%
i think it's uh it's on line

nothing in this paragraph she'll be

construed to prohibit the expansion of

any landfills
 
00:28:20.789 --> 00:28:20.799 align:start position:0%
that are in operation
 
00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
at the time this act takes effect
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you

thank you
is

representative kaplan
 
00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
this is just a you know curiosity
 
00:28:33.269 --> 00:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
question in the course of your research
 
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
i know this is not retroactive this bill
 
00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.230 align:start position:0%
i know this is not retroactive this bill
but

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
the existing landfills in new hampshire
 
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
how many of these how many of them would
 
00:28:41.669 --> 00:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
meet this
 
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
requirement in your legislation do you
 
00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:48.470 align:start position:0%
requirement in your legislation do you
know

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
carbry is the very best example i i'm
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
really kind of i i live in
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
a town of randolph and represented it's
 
00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
a member of the consortium that
 
00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
the municipal consortium that runs
 
00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
mount carberry and i've toured it a
 
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
couple of times and been you know very
 
00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:09.909 align:start position:0%
couple of times and been you know very
impressed

00:29:09.909 --> 00:29:09.919 align:start position:0%
impressed
 
00:29:09.919 --> 00:29:10.710 align:start position:0%
impressed
but

00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.590 align:start position:0%
but
the

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of clay and the number
 
00:29:18.789 --> 00:29:18.799 align:start position:0%
of years they have shows that they found
 
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely a
 
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
marvelous place
 
00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
to put that
 
00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:24.830 align:start position:0%
to put that
and

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:28.389 --> 00:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
um there are undoubtedly other such
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:39.110 align:start position:0%
 
is

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
in excuse me i'll recognize myself for a
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
anything that's limiting
 
00:29:54.389 --> 00:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
the ability for a landfill if if
 
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
if it were cited
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
and there were a failure of some sort
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
time to travel
 
00:30:07.029 --> 00:30:07.039 align:start position:0%
is is implemented
 
00:30:08.789 --> 00:30:08.799 align:start position:0%
is there anything in your estimation
 
00:30:08.799 --> 00:30:09.669 align:start position:0%
is there anything in your estimation
that

00:30:09.669 --> 00:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
the landfill operator
 
00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
already has currently in place that
 
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
would work in conjunction with this
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
for monitoring protection
 
00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.590 align:start position:0%
for monitoring protection
yeah

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:24.630 align:start position:0%
yeah
they

00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
the the state is monitoring
 
00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.990 align:start position:0%
the the state is monitoring
uh

00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding is and it could be
 
00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:33.909 align:start position:0%
my understanding is and it could be
faulty

00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919 align:start position:0%
faulty
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
um is that again
 
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
if there is something goes wrong
 
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
relationship between des and the
 
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh operator
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
where they have you know they have to
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
come up with the operator has to come up
 
00:30:52.389 --> 00:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
with a plan and then it has to be
 
00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
approved by ds
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
before it's implemented to make sure
 
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
that it is
 
00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:00.950 align:start position:0%
that it is
state-of-the-art

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.470 align:start position:0%
 
remedy

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
remedy
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
and this again is a case by case this is
 
00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
an agency operator
 
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.070 align:start position:0%
an agency operator
um

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.350 align:start position:0%
um
matter

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
matter
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:17.669 --> 00:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
i mean that's true of all remediation
 
00:31:17.679 --> 00:31:19.350 align:start position:0%
i mean that's true of all remediation
projects

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
and it's i think we're going to see this
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
play out
 
00:31:23.039 --> 00:31:23.750 align:start position:0%
play out
with

00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
all kinds of issues in the state with
 
00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.470 align:start position:0%
all kinds of issues in the state with
other

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039 align:start position:0%
with with chemical and other
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
pollutants in which
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
people are
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out just what is most
 
00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.029 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out just what is most
effective

00:31:39.029 --> 00:31:39.039 align:start position:0%
effective
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
and will remedy the problems that's been
 
00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.990 align:start position:0%
and will remedy the problems that's been
identified

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
identified
 
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:52.549 --> 00:31:52.559 align:start position:0%
representative bixby yeah i'd just like
 
00:31:54.389 --> 00:31:54.399 align:start position:0%
to comment on something that we haven't
 
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
touched on yet the
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
the um the original had the phrase uh
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
d shallow or deep groundwater and the uh
 
00:32:05.509 --> 00:32:05.519 align:start position:0%
page with the
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
the recommend
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
the recommended revision with the boxes
 
00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:11.919 align:start position:0%
has that changed to overburden slash
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
till and bedrock and i think that's a
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
significant improvement because it
 
00:32:16.559 --> 00:32:17.430 align:start position:0%
significant improvement because it
really

00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.870 align:start position:0%
really
clarifies

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
clarifies
 
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
what the physical characteristics of the
 
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
of the different levels are
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
so i think i feel that that that
 
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
that revision makes it much clearer and
 
00:32:32.789 --> 00:32:32.799 align:start position:0%
and should work so i brought a little
 
00:32:32.799 --> 00:32:34.789 align:start position:0%
and should work so i brought a little
graphic

00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:34.799 align:start position:0%
graphic
 
00:32:34.799 --> 00:32:37.750 align:start position:0%
graphic
yes

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
is this the same one that you emailed to
 
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
the committee representative
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much i'll submit
 
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
this to the clerk for the record
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.269 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
um

00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
yes i had to have a color printer
 
00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
i put where it should be blue
 
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.110 align:start position:0%
i put where it should be blue
and

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:11.519 align:start position:0%
i am just locating mine here so yes i
 
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
see in your
 
00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:14.710 align:start position:0%
see in your
um

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
in the schematic cross section that you
 
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
provided to us that it is talking about
 
00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
the various types of rock till clay
 
00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.590 align:start position:0%
the various types of rock till clay
um

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
and obviously even granite here in the
 
00:33:28.789 --> 00:33:28.799 align:start position:0%
granite state and how that water can
 
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
change excuse me that soil can change
 
00:33:33.990 --> 00:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
the groundwater flow based on the
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
density of the soils
 
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
um and i believe that that's what this
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
table is trying
 
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
to show correct
 
00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:44.559 align:start position:0%
is that it's going you have shallow
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
wells being dug and then deeper ones to
 
00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:48.559 align:start position:0%
address those cross sections for the
 
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
going down to the bedrock correct
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
fractured red rock or non-fractured
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:04.389 --> 00:34:04.399 align:start position:0%
and there's no question that this is
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
the kind of wording which we'll
 
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
certainly want director wimsat and
 
00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:09.829 align:start position:0%
certainly want director wimsat and
others

00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
others
 
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh expertise to make sure that we all
 
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.149 align:start position:0%
uh expertise to make sure that we all
understand

00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
what it means
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
and that really is this is the feedback
 
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
we need to know whether
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
it is clearer
 
00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
representative kaplan
 
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean just along those lines uh
 
00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
representative tucker is there i know
 
00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:42.399 align:start position:0%
you probably don't have the answer to
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
this but it would be good to know is
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
there any intermediate layers where the
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
speed of groundwater flow could be
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
faster than the over
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
you know the overburden or the bedrock
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
is there an intermediate layer that they
 
00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
need to be concerned about as well
 
00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
that well i i i think this is where des
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
you know it is already part of the
 
00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
applicant's process so they have a lot
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
of experience with
 
00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
one thing that i had been looking at
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
sort of as a guiding document of sorts
 
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.270 align:start position:0%
is the
epa's

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
epa's
 
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
delineation of source water protection
 
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
areas and it seems like you had
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
referenced that a couple of times
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
and i did have some questions um about
 
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
we are working with other local and sort
 
00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
of regional
 
00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.230 align:start position:0%
of regional
um

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
entities like
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
cooperative extensions or anything of
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
the like that would be used to help
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
monitor situations and areas
 
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:52.069 align:start position:0%
monitor situations and areas
um

00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
it was mentioned in the epa document
 
00:35:56.069 --> 00:35:56.079 align:start position:0%
that that is one strategy so that might
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
be a question for director winsat
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
and i was just curious as far as
 
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
continual monitoring or anything like
 
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
that if that is something that is being
 
00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.670 align:start position:0%
that if that is something that is being
done

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:10.829 --> 00:36:10.839 align:start position:0%
well all over the state we have closed
 
00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
landfills and they have test wells i
 
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
know my little town
 
00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:20.079 align:start position:0%
had had what was known as the dump
 
00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:22.079 align:start position:0%
and that had to be
 
00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:23.510 align:start position:0%
and that had to be
remediated

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
remediated
 
00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:25.839 align:start position:0%
and test wells put in and part of our
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
yearly budget
 
00:36:29.349 --> 00:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
i'm sure this is true all over the state
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
is to pay for the testing
 
00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
not inexpensive
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
and it it's going to take place for
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
50 years
 
00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:43.599 align:start position:0%
and so all over the state we have
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
people testing
 
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
closed landfills or what used to be
 
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
dumps things that never had the lining
 
00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.030 align:start position:0%
dumps things that never had the lining
and

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
because they don't have the lining
 
00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:56.870 align:start position:0%
because they don't have the lining
there's

00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
more possibility
 
00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.470 align:start position:0%
more possibility
of

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
contamination and so they are being
 
00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
tested all over the state
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
so somewhere we could dip into that
 
00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.430 align:start position:0%
so somewhere we could dip into that
knowledge

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
i will find out where we're supposed to
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative homola
 
00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:23.839 --> 00:37:24.870 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
tucker i just had a quick question do
 
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
you know if uh with the current
 
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
currently cited landfills that we have
 
00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:31.670 align:start position:0%
currently cited landfills that we have
here

00:37:31.670 --> 00:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
are is there any um
 
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
is there any data out there that
 
00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
actually discusses groundwater around
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
them as far as
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
looking at x feet per year now
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
is that that's a part of is there any
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
data out there that says
 
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
say this this landfill some of the
 
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
fastest moving water around that
 
00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:54.079 align:start position:0%
landfill is this many feet per year does
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
anything like that any of that data
 
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
exist so we can compare that
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
well we have i think we've concluded
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
the mount carberry i'm sorry
 
00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:08.079 align:start position:0%
i think mount carberry we have okay
 
00:38:08.079 --> 00:38:09.750 align:start position:0%
i think mount carberry we have okay
and

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
i thought that was in my original
 
00:38:13.589 --> 00:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
testimony but i could be wrong it might
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
be and i maybe perhaps i missed it i'm
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
just wondering if you have if you had
 
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
that that stat or anything like that
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
just so what i'm looking at is i was
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
looking at the obviously the 200 feet or
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
x times
 
00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.470 align:start position:0%
x times
uh

00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
x times five feet
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm just wondering here we go thank
 
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
you on page three
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
of a four-page document
 
00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.150 align:start position:0%
of a four-page document
uh

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
of this one
 
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
it was my original testimony i have
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
copies of it if anyone would okay i have
 
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
it in my bag then okay so let me just
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
rather than merely talking about the
 
00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
theoretical however i'm going to present
 
00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
two actual examples of the years to
 
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
cause harm concept
 
00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
as documented in coast county which of
 
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
course i represent
 
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
the application pending at des for an
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
expansion of the existing landfill at
 
00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
mount carberry provides data showing
 
00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
that contaminated groundwater from the
 
00:39:11.829 --> 00:39:11.839 align:start position:0%
site would take quote
 
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
60 to 150 years
 
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
to reach a tributary of the androscoggin
 
00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:18.150 align:start position:0%
to reach a tributary of the androscoggin
river

00:39:18.150 --> 00:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
river
 
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
the velocity was found to be about
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
50 feet per year there
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
it is located in appropriate soils and
 
00:39:27.599 --> 00:39:31.510 align:start position:0%
it is located in appropriate soils and
bedrock

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
i have then
 
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
i did go on to compare it to the
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
site where the application has been made
 
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
in dalton
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
where the applicant
 
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
estimated the groundwater flows at that
 
00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:55.270 align:start position:0%
estimated the groundwater flows at that
site

00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
site
 
00:39:59.670 --> 00:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
at 9.5 feet per day or faster
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
if des code setback remains at 200 feet
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
from a water body
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
then the agency might only have as
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
little as 21 days to notice and respond
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
to a leak
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
at a site where groundwater flows this
 
00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:22.710 align:start position:0%
at a site where groundwater flows this
quickly

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
follow up if i may i'll recognize myself
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
um so to that to that end i also am
 
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
curious to know
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
um there are many other
 
00:40:34.309 --> 00:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
monitoring techniques in addition to
 
00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
time to travel and i'm curious to know
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
would would would would there ever be a
 
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
time where more than one
 
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
monitoring technique would be necessary
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
depending on a circumstance are you
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
there being
 
00:40:54.069 --> 00:40:54.079 align:start position:0%
multiple methods i think that the
 
00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
the plus of using this
 
00:40:57.119 --> 00:40:58.470 align:start position:0%
the plus of using this
approach

00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
approach
 
00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns of des
 
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
is that they
 
00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
end up as an agency spending a lot of
 
00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
times on projects that don't go forward
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
and that's true whether it's northern
 
00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.790 align:start position:0%
and that's true whether it's northern
pass

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
pass
 
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.630 align:start position:0%
pass
large

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
large
 
00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
residential developments there are all
 
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
kinds of things where des is tied up and
 
00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:24.079 align:start position:0%
is spending expertise on projects that
 
00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
don't go forward
 
00:41:25.839 --> 00:41:26.710 align:start position:0%
don't go forward
so

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
finding a way to
 
00:41:29.359 --> 00:41:30.870 align:start position:0%
finding a way to
sift

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
sift
 
00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:32.839 align:start position:0%
the wheat from the chaff
 
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
early was an enormous plus because
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
naturally there's a financial
 
00:41:39.359 --> 00:41:42.069 align:start position:0%
naturally there's a financial
consequence

00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:42.079 align:start position:0%
consequence
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
and having an agency tied up with things
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
that don't go forward
 
00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
you end up paying the salaries of people
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
who you know don't end up with a product
 
00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:53.839 align:start position:0%
at the end so
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
very much i think
 
00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.030 align:start position:0%
very much i think
uh

00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:59.190 --> 00:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
dr finkel and others were looking for a
 
00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
scientific way to
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
approach this problem
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
that would make it so that des would be
 
00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.510 align:start position:0%
that would make it so that des would be
relieved

00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
relieved
 
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
of having to spend a lot of time
 
00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
on projects
 
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
that were located in places that
 
00:42:19.109 --> 00:42:19.119 align:start position:0%
ultimately would be found to be
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
not suitable or sensible for a landfill
 
00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
site so that's the big plus of this
 
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
approach is
 
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
it's used elsewhere issues in states
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
it's used by the federal government
 
00:42:33.599 --> 00:42:34.870 align:start position:0%
it's used by the federal government
and

00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
it lends itself to an early appraisal
 
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not
 
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
it's a good place to do something
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
i'll ask another follow-up around that
 
00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:47.670 align:start position:0%
i'll ask another follow-up around that
area

00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.109 align:start position:0%
area
um

00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:49.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:49.119 --> 00:42:50.950 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
there's the director thank you um so so
 
00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
my other to that end i guess
 
00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
is it your intent through this piece of
 
00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
legislation then for time to travel to
 
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
be the initial testing mechanism
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
used and is that stated clearly in the
 
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
language that is the first
 
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
preferred method
 
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
with regard to your
 
00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
yes it's a shift from
 
00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:29.200 align:start position:0%
a one size fits all 200 feet that we now
 
00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:30.870 align:start position:0%
a one size fits all 200 feet that we now
have

00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
it is it would be the
 
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
first step and if you didn't pass i
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
think in my testimony i called it the
 
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
exam if you couldn't pass this you
 
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:59.190 --> 00:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
vernal pools wetlands all kinds of
 
00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:00.390 align:start position:0%
vernal pools wetlands all kinds of
things

00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.990 align:start position:0%
things
some

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
more than others
 
00:44:03.599 --> 00:44:05.510 align:start position:0%
more than others
and

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
this really is addressed to
 
00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
the concept of worrying about the
 
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
groundwater that
 
00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:15.349 align:start position:0%
groundwater that
is

00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
where the greatest potential for harm
 
00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:19.270 align:start position:0%
where the greatest potential for harm
to

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
water resources
 
00:44:25.109 --> 00:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
lies and that is why it is addressed
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
and that is why
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of time was spent by a collection
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
of people to find something
 
00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:34.839 align:start position:0%
that answered all the
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
requirements that were given by
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
house members and senate members
 
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
in previous efforts
 
00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
to find
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
ways to improve the state's
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
and when i heard it
 
00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
i knew we
 
00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
we really had something that was
 
00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:00.870 align:start position:0%
we really had something that was
doable

00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
doable
 
00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:02.630 align:start position:0%
doable
understandable

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
understandable
 
00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.309 align:start position:0%
understandable
transparent

00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
transparent
 
00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
and scientific
 
00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
and it's pretty hard to find something
 
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
that beats
 
00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.270 align:start position:0%
that beats
those

00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm really here and i'm thrilled
 
00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
to see director wim wimsat has arrived
 
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
i'm here to get feedback from you we
 
00:45:25.109 --> 00:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
want to polish up this bill
 
00:45:25.119 --> 00:45:25.910 align:start position:0%
want to polish up this bill
i

00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
spoke briefly with the chairman of your
 
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
committee before the meeting and he said
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
you know there's plenty of time we can
 
00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
have work sessions
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
we want to get this right so i'm looking
 
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
for feedback
 
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to give way to
 
00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
director said thank you thank you
 
00:45:48.550 --> 00:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
representative for your generous time
 
00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
before us and answering all of those
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
questions that we did have and for those
 
00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
of us here who did have questions i
 
00:45:56.069 --> 00:45:56.079 align:start position:0%
believe rep homeland maybe had one for
 
00:45:59.190 --> 00:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
the director initially
 
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
i was just i was just curious how
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
in the statement adequate and
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative on-site field testing i
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
was just curious how adequate would be
 
00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.230 align:start position:0%
was just curious how adequate would be
defined

00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
defined
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
is that a
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
maybe what's the thought process behind
 
00:46:15.270 --> 00:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
that just so i'm just trying to find a
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
way i want to make sure that whatever
 
00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
whatever gets considered it's not
 
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
setting up a point to quibble with
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
between say that the potential project
 
00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
and des
 
00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
and so that's what i'm just trying to
 
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
understand is
 
00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
you know can you make the word adequate
 
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:58.309 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
good morning director website good
 
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
morning and on my apologies i was uh
 
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
stuck in another hearing and could not
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
escape so i came here as soon as i was
 
00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:08.230 align:start position:0%
escape so i came here as soon as i was
available

00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:10.870 align:start position:0%
available
um

00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:14.309 --> 00:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
gripson of hamlet for your question um
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
i think the language regarding uh
 
00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:20.079 align:start position:0%
adequacy uh actually i just forgive me i
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
just want to take a look at it one more
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:43.109 --> 00:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
but i don't see that language in there
 
00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
that's because this is something that we
 
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
added oh this is a
 
00:47:50.829 --> 00:47:50.839 align:start position:0%
point of discussion i thank you
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah so um
 
00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
i i guess uh you know we we
 
00:47:59.829 --> 00:47:59.839 align:start position:0%
many of the requirements that des
 
00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
administers have to do with uh
 
00:48:03.829 --> 00:48:03.839 align:start position:0%
relatively technical scientific
 
00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:06.720 align:start position:0%
evaluations we rely on
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
applications and materials that are
 
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
often prepared by
 
00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
professional engineers and professional
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
geologists and there's a certain amount
 
00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:14.710 align:start position:0%
geologists and there's a certain amount
of

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:14.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
back and forth that occurs to evaluate
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
you know various requirements and
 
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
whether or not something has been
 
00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:24.230 align:start position:0%
whether or not something has been
submitted

00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
submitted
 
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
meets the standard if you will
 
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
adequate is is a tough word
 
00:48:30.309 --> 00:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
representative is a word that we
 
00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
commonly use the idea is that when you
 
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
do a sample or when you evaluate
 
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
something you're evaluating
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
a representative sample of it so
 
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's a term that we can we can
 
00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
work with i guess if uh
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
in this particular example we're looking
 
00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:45.270 align:start position:0%
in this particular example we're looking
at

00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:46.710 align:start position:0%
at
um

00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
in a hydrogeologist doing you know
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
probably a soil boring and then looking
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
at soil conditions
 
00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
in the aquifer beneath the proposed
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
landfill site
 
00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
and then trying to determine is that
 
00:48:59.990 --> 00:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
of course the question is what scale is
 
00:49:03.670 --> 00:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
it representative on right so certainly
 
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
um if uh if we know through the work
 
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
that's been done at a given site
 
00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
the site is largely
 
00:49:12.309 --> 00:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
sand and gravel
 
00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
of a certain quality but there are a few
 
00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
clay lenses then if a hydrogeologist
 
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
went in
 
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
and then got a sample from that clay
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
lens and tried to represent that it was
 
00:49:23.510 --> 00:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative of the whole site we
 
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
would take exception to that and i think
 
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
this language would give us the basis to
 
00:49:29.349 --> 00:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:49:31.349 --> 00:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
what i do think it is a little bit you
 
00:49:31.359 --> 00:49:32.870 align:start position:0%
what i do think it is a little bit you
know

00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:34.240 align:start position:0%
in the context of this bill we're
 
00:49:35.829 --> 00:49:35.839 align:start position:0%
looking at what's the five-year travel
 
00:49:38.150 --> 00:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
time of a particle of groundwater if you
 
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
will from the site to a given surface
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
water and as i testified before i just
 
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
don't want it to be lost in the
 
00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.390 align:start position:0%
don't want it to be lost in the
conversation

00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's geology is very varied
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
it's with the our aquifers and the
 
00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
materials in our aquifers are not
 
00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
homogeneous they're very they could
 
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
their sand and gravel and silt and clay
 
00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
and all those things
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
in certain cases they're very
 
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
homogeneous maybe you know everything
 
00:50:05.349 --> 00:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:07.109 --> 00:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
surface water may be a uniform sand and
 
00:50:09.270 --> 00:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
gravel but in other cases it may not be
 
00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:11.109 align:start position:0%
gravel but in other cases it may not be
so

00:50:11.109 --> 00:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
i i do just want to restate the concerns
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
i had before that um
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
if you're trying to evaluate that travel
 
00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:19.190 align:start position:0%
if you're trying to evaluate that travel
distance

00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
distance
 
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
using only on-site sampling to do that
 
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
is going to have some limitations it's
 
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
going to basically it could bios you one
 
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
way or the other
 
00:50:30.790 --> 00:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
based on whether the soils beneath the
 
00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:31.990 align:start position:0%
based on whether the soils beneath the
landfill

00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
that are representative of the site
 
00:50:36.150 --> 00:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
are more or less permeable than the
 
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
soils that the groundwater would travel
 
00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559 align:start position:0%
to after it leaves the site but that's
 
00:50:41.349 --> 00:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
again that's that's the will of the
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
legislature how it wants to address this
 
00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
bill but i i just what i don't want to
 
00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
do is make it sound like the agency
 
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
believes that on-site sampling alone can
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
and precise
 
00:50:58.390 --> 00:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
estimate of travel time because we're
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
not it's not clear that it can it may in
 
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
certain settings but in other settings
 
00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
it may not so i just wanted to make sure
 
00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
that folks are clear about that
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative kaplan
 
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
yeah i have a similar question about the
 
00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:12.150 align:start position:0%
yeah i have a similar question about the
uh

00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:14.309 --> 00:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
the one of the other boxes in the
 
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
amendment which is having to do with uh
 
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
the different layers of
 
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
soil overburden slash till and in
 
00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:22.549 align:start position:0%
soil overburden slash till and in
bedrock

00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
bedrock
 
00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
so the testing would have to take place
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
in both of those layers is there any
 
00:51:29.109 --> 00:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
possibility of there being some kind of
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
intermediate layer which would be of
 
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
concern it's it's certain
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
again going to the sort of heterogeneity
 
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
and complexity of new hampshire's
 
00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
geology there are sites where
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
there's a distinct
 
00:51:43.510 --> 00:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
what we would all sort of think of as a
 
00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
classic water table aquifer where it's
 
00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:47.839 align:start position:0%
relatively permeable sand and gravel and
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
there's a certain water level in that
 
00:51:49.599 --> 00:51:50.630 align:start position:0%
there's a certain water level in that
unit

00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
unit
 
00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
and then you can describe it you know
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
pretty simply
 
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
then there could be what we call a
 
00:51:56.790 --> 00:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
confining unit there could be a layer of
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
clay below that and some tighter you
 
00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
know silty sandy materials beneath that
 
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
that are bounded by that clay layer and
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
the underlying bedrock in a way that
 
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
means that that kind of operates and
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
behaves as its own separate aquifer
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
groundwater flow velocities are
 
00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:13.589 align:start position:0%
groundwater flow velocities are
different

00:52:13.589 --> 00:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
um you know maybe even flow directions
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
are different
 
00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
um that that's and and potential in in
 
00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
terms of uh
 
00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:21.750 align:start position:0%
terms of uh
the

00:52:21.750 --> 00:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:23.680 align:start position:0%
the uh the head value you know in a
 
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
confined aquifer like that you can have
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
vertical upward gradients you can have
 
00:52:29.589 --> 00:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
on any number of things and then of
 
00:52:31.829 --> 00:52:31.839 align:start position:0%
course you have the bedrock aquifer and
 
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
that can differ too there can be some
 
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
units of bedrock that are very tight
 
00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
relatively unweathered and unfractured
 
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
that don't move much water
 
00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:42.319 align:start position:0%
other you know surfacial bedrock may be
 
00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
very weathered and move groundwater a
 
00:52:45.990 --> 00:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
certain way but then as you get deeper
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
into the rock it moves
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
through a fracture system so
 
00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
and again i'm not sure that helps answer
 
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
your question but the reality is geology
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is very complex
 
00:52:58.870 --> 00:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
having said that i think that when we
 
00:53:00.309 --> 00:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
look at a landfill and we look at how
 
00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
it's cited and and
 
00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:03.750 align:start position:0%
it's cited and and
constructed

00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
constructed
 
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
if you you it's reasonable to have if to
 
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
imagine a release from the liner system
 
00:53:12.390 --> 00:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
and to make a reasonable
 
00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
assumption about what unit that
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
contamination would migrate through and
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
where it might go after that so there
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
are thing there are
 
00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
there is work that can be done
 
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
evaluating a specific site
 
00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
that um can tell you a lot about um how
 
00:53:31.589 --> 00:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
contaminants would move from the
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
landfill site
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
so i again i i don't want to by saying
 
00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:53:38.069 --> 00:53:38.079 align:start position:0%
geology is complex i don't want to make
 
00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
you think that we think that it's just
 
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
impossible that it's anybody's guess
 
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's not the case there there
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
are things that we assumptions we can
 
00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:45.670 align:start position:0%
are things that we assumptions we can
make

00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
based on learning a lot about the
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
aquifer and the formation that it's
 
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
contained in
 
00:53:53.109 --> 00:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
and knowing where the landfill how it
 
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
would be constructed and where it would
 
00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
be in that formation we can make some
 
00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable assumptions about
 
00:54:00.790 --> 00:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
the most plausible
 
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
and and fastest groundwater migration
 
00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.430 align:start position:0%
and and fastest groundwater migration
options

00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
options
 
00:54:06.790 --> 00:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
representative bixby yes so um i'm
 
00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
wondering if the
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
the language of
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
adequate and especially representative
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
would allow you to require
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh in the case that there are
 
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
you have say the as you pointed out a
 
00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:24.549 align:start position:0%
you have say the as you pointed out a
potential

00:54:24.549 --> 00:54:24.559 align:start position:0%
potential
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
within that overburden
 
00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:27.589 align:start position:0%
within that overburden
a

00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%
gravelly layer and then a
 
00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:33.200 align:start position:0%
silt layer or clay layer
 
00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:34.150 align:start position:0%
silt layer or clay layer
by

00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
with that term representative allow you
 
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
to require
 
00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:38.390 align:start position:0%
to require
that

00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
the test uh
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
the test site
 
00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:43.270 align:start position:0%
the test site
evaluate

00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
evaluate
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
both the gravity and the the
 
00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
depth or layer i think so i mean i think
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
what our geologists would do is they'd
 
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
look at what we know about the formation
 
00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
and they would make certain assumptions
 
00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
about how groundwater would flow and how
 
00:54:59.190 --> 00:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
contaminants might be transported and
 
00:55:00.549 --> 00:55:00.559 align:start position:0%
they would look for the applicant to
 
00:55:00.559 --> 00:55:01.670 align:start position:0%
they would look for the applicant to
provide

00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
representative sampling and analysis of
 
00:55:06.549 --> 00:55:06.559 align:start position:0%
those portions of the aquifer that where
 
00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
they believe that that migration was
 
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
most likely to occur
 
00:55:12.309 --> 00:55:12.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative kombra
 
00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh thank you
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
director for taking my question um just
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
listening to your testimony when we're
 
00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
talking about citing a landfill just so
 
00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
i understand this um and all the
 
00:55:32.470 --> 00:55:32.480 align:start position:0%
complexities of our geography here in
 
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
if we're if they're looking at a
 
00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
particular site
 
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
based on your testimony it sounds like
 
00:55:41.589 --> 00:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
you have to do testing
 
00:55:41.599 --> 00:55:42.630 align:start position:0%
you have to do testing
also

00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:55:44.630 --> 00:55:44.640 align:start position:0%
offsite of where that
 
00:55:46.789 --> 00:55:46.799 align:start position:0%
is that not true or are you
 
00:55:48.549 --> 00:55:48.559 align:start position:0%
because you need to see how that
 
00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
groundwater is going to flow if they
 
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
have a 200 acre site
 
00:55:53.829 --> 00:55:53.839 align:start position:0%
you know and then
 
00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
you know there's another parcel you know
 
00:55:58.549 --> 00:55:58.559 align:start position:0%
some land next to that uh do you have to
 
00:56:00.309 --> 00:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
look at how that groundwater interacts
 
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
with the groundwater of the site
 
00:56:05.190 --> 00:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
under the current law and rules there
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
isn't necessarily a requirement to do
 
00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:14.470 --> 00:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
understanding that the the setbacks are
 
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
are numerical um there's not a there's
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
not a requirement to evaluate the
 
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
groundwater velocity to determine
 
00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:21.430 align:start position:0%
groundwater velocity to determine
whether

00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:21.440 align:start position:0%
whether
 
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
a particular um you know surface water
 
00:56:25.109 --> 00:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
body is going to be impacted under
 
00:56:28.549 --> 00:56:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
i am going to also ask a follow-up uh
 
00:56:33.190 --> 00:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
around that
 
00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:34.549 align:start position:0%
around that
um

00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:37.349 --> 00:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
would there be any circumstance where
 
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
off-site testing would be voluntary you
 
00:56:41.750 --> 00:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
would request that
 
00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
folks were you would like to test an
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
area or the applicant is also sending
 
00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
that when they're providing the
 
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
application to you folks
 
00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:51.589 align:start position:0%
application to you folks
what

00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
because you you do state that it's not
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
in statute to require the off-site
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
testing is there a mechanism that you
 
00:57:00.069 --> 00:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
can seek that outside testing through
 
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
voluntary means
 
00:57:05.430 --> 00:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
well if i guess if if we were evaluating
 
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
you know obviously when we evaluate a
 
00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
landfill application we're evaluating
 
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
against the rules and the law that
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
governs our decision-making process
 
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
if they're a question were a question
 
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
that we could not answer
 
00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:18.309 align:start position:0%
that we could not answer
adequately

00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
adequately
 
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
that we felt required some kind of
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
off-site data then we would ask for it
 
00:57:26.069 --> 00:57:26.079 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to go too far down a
 
00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
hypothetical but you know if we believe
 
00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
that we needed that information to
 
00:57:30.319 --> 00:57:31.430 align:start position:0%
that we needed that information to
answer

00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:57:32.789 --> 00:57:32.799 align:start position:0%
a particular question that we're
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
required under the law to answer in
 
00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
order to make a permit decision then we
 
00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
would do everything we could to make
 
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
sure we got that information
 
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:42.799 align:start position:0%
just so folks know we are running up
 
00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
against a hard stop of 11 o'clock
 
00:57:45.359 --> 00:57:46.470 align:start position:0%
against a hard stop of 11 o'clock
um

00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
i'd like to further discuss with our
 
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work group where we are
 
00:57:52.950 --> 00:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
if we feel we should proceed with
 
00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
another work session if we've not fully
 
00:57:59.430 --> 00:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
answered all of our questions
 
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to hear from you folks
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
rep stapleton welcome again
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
rep stapleton is also on the
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session so i
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
turn to you first and then we'll kind of
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:15.670 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
i feel like the questions that that
 
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
that i had today were answered i think
 
00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:21.109 align:start position:0%
that i had today were answered i think
that

00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
i think the clarification of this for
 
00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
the discussion was very helpful uh i
 
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
think that this
 
00:58:29.109 --> 00:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
i think it clarified a lot in the
 
00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
00:58:32.069 --> 00:58:32.079 align:start position:0%
and i think that it also
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
uh put in some standardized language
 
00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh that eliminates any kind of
 
00:58:37.440 --> 00:58:39.109 align:start position:0%
uh that eliminates any kind of
misunderstandings

00:58:39.109 --> 00:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings
 
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
representative bixby did you have
 
00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
thoughts as well yeah um i've just been
 
00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
sort of uh making sort of scratched
 
00:58:52.069 --> 00:58:52.079 align:start position:0%
notes here on a what we could have as a
 
00:58:54.150 --> 00:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
preamble sentence to
 
00:58:57.109 --> 00:58:57.119 align:start position:0%
clarify the purpose of the uh of the
 
00:58:57.119 --> 00:58:58.230 align:start position:0%
clarify the purpose of the uh of the
section

00:58:58.230 --> 00:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:59:00.789 --> 00:59:00.799 align:start position:0%
so that we can move that of any leak
 
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:03.680 align:start position:0%
spill or other failure away from the the
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
middle there and make it clear that you
 
00:59:07.829 --> 00:59:07.839 align:start position:0%
know this is the purpose of this section
 
00:59:07.839 --> 00:59:08.549 align:start position:0%
know this is the purpose of this section
is

00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:08.559 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
to prevent to to
 
00:59:10.799 --> 00:59:12.069 align:start position:0%
to prevent to to
uh

00:59:12.069 --> 00:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
make it possible for remedial action to
 
00:59:17.190 --> 00:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
take place if there's a in the case of a
 
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:26.309 --> 00:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
so at this time then would the motion
 
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
then be
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
to continue
 
00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
i don't think we need emotion oh thank
 
00:59:31.359 --> 00:59:33.270 align:start position:0%
i don't think we need emotion oh thank
you

00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
to would you also like to continue
 
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:36.799 align:start position:0%
working on this through another work
 
00:59:36.799 --> 00:59:39.349 align:start position:0%
working on this through another work
session

00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not sure that we need another
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
work session uh i if i
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
if i draft this and send it around to
 
00:59:48.470 --> 00:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:49.349 align:start position:0%
the committee
uh

00:59:49.349 --> 00:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
and then and
 
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
people are generally agreeable to it
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
then i think we might be able to just uh
 
00:59:59.109 --> 00:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
draft an amendment and then go have a
 
01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
brief work session before to pass it out
 
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
of subcommittee before
 
01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
so representative pearl chairman
 
01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:11.270 align:start position:0%
so representative pearl chairman
chairman

01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
that's it that's all right
 
01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
madam chair if i may
 
01:00:16.549 --> 01:00:16.559 align:start position:0%
you may
 
01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:18.559 align:start position:0%
i i think um probably the best
 
01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
suggestion is you guys can
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
you know look at some language and we'll
 
01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
schedule another work session for you to
 
01:00:26.150 --> 01:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
sort of finalize
 
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
your and put your thoughts together and
 
01:00:29.589 --> 01:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
it doesn't necessarily have to be next
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
week again we've got a bit of time on
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
this because we've got into the i think
 
01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
it's march 10th is our our cut off date
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
of getting it out of the full committee
 
01:00:40.309 --> 01:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
so you've got a little time if you want
 
01:00:40.319 --> 01:00:41.030 align:start position:0%
so you've got a little time if you want
to

01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
sort of think about things and then we
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
can schedule another work session when
 
01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
representative bixby so um i think we
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
may actually be able to pull this
 
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
together reasonably effectively but i
 
01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
think in terms of using our term our our
 
01:00:59.670 --> 01:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
time more efficiently i'm not as
 
01:01:01.589 --> 01:01:01.599 align:start position:0%
sanguine about coming out of the next
 
01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
session with a
 
01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh an amendment that's ready to go
 
01:01:08.549 --> 01:01:08.559 align:start position:0%
so uh i think and i think would make
 
01:01:10.549 --> 01:01:10.559 align:start position:0%
sense for us when it gets around to to
 
01:01:12.549 --> 01:01:12.559 align:start position:0%
doing the next uh
 
01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
when it comes around to exacting i think
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
we should figure out doing the two that
 
01:01:18.309 --> 01:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
we have not yet exact
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh at the same time
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
i think this this one probably won't be
 
01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:30.789 --> 01:01:30.799 align:start position:0%
sorry yes representative tucker before
 
01:01:30.799 --> 01:01:31.750 align:start position:0%
sorry yes representative tucker before
we

01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the line
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
if you all do your work if you could
 
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
then send it to me i will send it to ols
 
01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:42.069 align:start position:0%
then send it to me i will send it to ols
because

01:01:42.069 --> 01:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative bixby i i think actually
 
01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:52.559 align:start position:0%
what probably makes sense is for this
 
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
for the action for the amendment to come
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
out of our committee
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
01:01:59.589 --> 01:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
uh so that is essentially signaling that
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
this is the committee amendment uh
 
01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely but so so which means which
 
01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
means we just need to make sure it goes
 
01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
to all right so i'm new to this yes so
 
01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
so uh so
 
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
we will so our committee will make sure
 
01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
that it goes to ols
 
01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:15.839 align:start position:0%
okay but you'll you'll send it back to
 
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
us somewhere along the way before we go
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
to oil so before we uh we will do the
 
01:02:24.069 --> 01:02:24.079 align:start position:0%
sincere private sponsor we always pay
 
01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
the courtesy of to the sponsors of the
 
01:02:27.029 --> 01:02:27.039 align:start position:0%
bill of
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh circulating proposed amendments uh
 
01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
including you on that circulation and
 
01:02:35.109 --> 01:02:35.119 align:start position:0%
then but we will submit the
 
01:02:35.119 --> 01:02:35.990 align:start position:0%
then but we will submit the
the

01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
amendment to ols
 
01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:40.799 align:start position:0%
representative bixby i think i am going
 
01:02:43.349 --> 01:02:43.359 align:start position:0%
to create a second work session out of
 
01:02:45.029 --> 01:02:45.039 align:start position:0%
this i would like to make sure that we
 
01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:47.039 align:start position:0%
are answering the questions and if there
 
01:02:49.109 --> 01:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
is anything that we still have for the
 
01:02:49.119 --> 01:02:50.549 align:start position:0%
is anything that we still have for the
director

01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:50.559 align:start position:0%
director
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
once we review everything here and if
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative tucker has any other
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
comments so i think that's what we will
 
01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.270 align:start position:0%
comments so i think that's what we will
do

01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:03:02.309 --> 01:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
um and so seeing that the time is
 
01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:05.839 align:start position:0%
1105 sorry mr chair
 
01:04:02.950 --> 01:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:07.430 align:start position:0%
 
sure

01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:07.440 --> 01:08:51.829 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:08:51.829 --> 01:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:51.839 --> 01:09:46.709 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:09:46.709 --> 01:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:46.719 --> 01:09:49.829 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:09:49.829 --> 01:09:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:51.749 --> 01:09:51.759 align:start position:0%
all right good morning everyone it uh
 
01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
we're a little bit late getting going
 
01:09:55.110 --> 01:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
it's 11 10 but
 
01:09:56.950 --> 01:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to convene the
 
01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee for
 
01:10:02.390 --> 01:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
for uh animal protection subcommittee
 
01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
and we are here to work on house bill
 
01:10:07.430 --> 01:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
1186 relative to companion animals
 
01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
this bill has
 
01:10:18.149 --> 01:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
we've had a slight work
 
01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
a brief work session on it and this one
 
01:10:22.709 --> 01:10:22.719 align:start position:0%
is so that we can be a little more
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
extensive in what we're looking at we
 
01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
heard testimony from
 
01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
many of the people that had concerns
 
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
with the bill about mandating
 
01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:34.550 align:start position:0%
with the bill about mandating
they

01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
having the animals in the same facility
 
01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
as the
 
01:10:39.189 --> 01:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
you know the people that it could cause
 
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
issues with hotels or community centers
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
with the compatibility of animals so i
 
01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
passed out two uh
 
01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
two things rep gallagher had put
 
01:10:51.550 --> 01:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
together an amendment through ols
 
01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
032h which i handed out to the committee
 
01:10:55.350 --> 01:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
and i put some on the back table there
 
01:10:57.189 --> 01:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
for anyone who's interested
 
01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
and the second one is some language that
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
i've been working with the akc
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
on a little bit of different language
 
01:11:09.510 --> 01:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
that sort of
 
01:11:11.189 --> 01:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
addresses the concerns and issues that
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
i think we all heard during the uh
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
during the testimony
 
01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
about the trailers and the volunteers
 
01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
and how they're not covered under health
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
so if it's okay with the committee i
 
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.350 align:start position:0%
so if it's okay with the committee i
think

01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
i'd like to actually work off this
 
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
language that i gave you to start with
 
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
certainly we can i think it covers a lot
 
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
of what uh rep gallagher was trying to
 
01:11:40.870 --> 01:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
do in his amendment as well
 
01:11:43.430 --> 01:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
and but i i think this gives
 
01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:44.719 align:start position:0%
to me it seemed to be a little more
 
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
clear as to what we were trying to
 
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
accomplish so if that's all right with
 
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
the committee we'll start there and
 
01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
we'll certainly
 
01:11:52.149 --> 01:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
kind of let it go to where uh to
 
01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:58.870 --> 01:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
so if you've had a chance to review the
 
01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:00.470 align:start position:0%
so if you've had a chance to review the
language

01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:02.390 align:start position:0%
language
here

01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
that i that i passed out
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
again there's this is sort of two-fold
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
in what it's trying to accomplish
 
01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
so during a declared state of emergency
 
01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
containing an evacuation order any hotel
 
01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
or community shelter which shelters
 
01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
evacuated persons shall allow the
 
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
disaster animal response trailers on
 
01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
site to accommodate any companion animal
 
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
belonging to such evacuated persons
 
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
the key point with that is
 
01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
forcing the hotel to have them in the
 
01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:35.110 align:start position:0%
forcing the hotel to have them in the
hotel

01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
hotel
 
01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
and that was a major concern that we
 
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
were hearing it's just
 
01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:39.830 align:start position:0%
were hearing it's just
would

01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:12:41.189 --> 01:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
they would have to provide room
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere in their parking lot so that
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
in essence the the animals and
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
their owners would be on the sort of
 
01:12:50.070 --> 01:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
like the same campus they wouldn't be in
 
01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
the same room necessarily but they would
 
01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
all be on the same site you kind of look
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
i think what we'll do is just kind of
 
01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
take this in pieces is there
 
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
any thoughts from the committee on
 
01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
that part of the language
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative bixby um
 
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
i like this idea it claire i i think it
 
01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
um deals with my major objection i'm
 
01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.430 align:start position:0%
um deals with my major objection i'm
wondering

01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh who is in charge of
 
01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
making those
 
01:13:26.630 --> 01:13:26.640 align:start position:0%
trailers available for the purpose
 
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
so it is my understanding that there are
 
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
four trailers already in new hampshire
 
01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:33.110 align:start position:0%
four trailers already in new hampshire
and

01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:35.669 --> 01:13:35.679 align:start position:0%
the second part of this bill deals with
 
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
the sort of like the emergency response
 
01:13:40.229 --> 01:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
team they would be the ones manning the
 
01:13:40.239 --> 01:13:44.149 align:start position:0%
team they would be the ones manning the
trailers

01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
as far as who would be making them there
 
01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
i would assume that would fall under
 
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
dhhs just as in to make sure that just
 
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
as they're housing the people they would
 
01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that these trailers would be
 
01:13:55.510 --> 01:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
available for
 
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
in in a state of emergency just like
 
01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
they would the shelters for the people
 
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
so i assume it would fall under the same
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
purview right i i'd like to get some
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
clarification on that just just since we
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i think we saw in
 
01:14:12.630 --> 01:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
some of the um
 
01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:13.350 align:start position:0%
some of the um
the

01:14:13.350 --> 01:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:14:16.229 --> 01:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
uh bill the laws from other states that
 
01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh mr tory
 
01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh pointed out to us
 
01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
was that there's a certain degree of
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
variation in terms of how that
 
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility is meted out in different
 
01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:27.590 align:start position:0%
responsibility is meted out in different
states

01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:28.390 align:start position:0%
states
and

01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
i'd like to make sure that there is
 
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
some way of assigning the responsibility
 
01:14:36.149 --> 01:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
for doing that uh in new hampshire as
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
well as just hoping that there are some
 
01:14:37.679 --> 01:14:40.390 align:start position:0%
well as just hoping that there are some
trailers

01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
so if i'm understanding correctly your
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
your question is who's responsible for
 
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
making sure the trailers are on site yes
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
who who's responsible for making them
 
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
making sure they're on site and that
 
01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
they exist and that there's a sufficient
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
any further representative so on the
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
topic of sufficient numbers so there's
 
01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
nothing in here that would say like so
 
01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
there's four of them right now maybe
 
01:15:07.669 --> 01:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
there's half dozen in the future
 
01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
but we have a big evacuation and there's
 
01:15:10.709 --> 01:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
there's just not enough of them
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
available like that's that's just a
 
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
resource issue there would be no mandate
 
01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
on the the evacuation site
 
01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
to take in animals if there was no
 
01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
available trailer is that correct
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
correct okay and i i think that's
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
you know it just would make sure they
 
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
would have to make the accommodation to
 
01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
have the trailers on site a place for
 
01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
them if they're going to be an
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
evacuation site then they'd have to make
 
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
a spot somewhere on site for these
 
01:15:36.870 --> 01:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
trailers there will be no negative
 
01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
repercussions for them if no if no
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
trailer was available to be put on
 
01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:41.990 align:start position:0%
trailer was available to be put on
correct

01:15:41.990 --> 01:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's the way i read it yes okay
 
01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
representative stapleton
 
01:15:51.430 --> 01:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:53.430 --> 01:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
this um
 
01:15:55.189 --> 01:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
amount of animals
 
01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh comply with local ordinances there on
 
01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
line nine
 
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
are there a variability of numbers of
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
animals that can be contained by
 
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
residents throughout our state
 
01:16:11.669 --> 01:16:11.679 align:start position:0%
or is that a uniform
 
01:16:11.679 --> 01:16:13.590 align:start position:0%
or is that a uniform
number

01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
because i i know that
 
01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
there are some people who
 
01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
are not licensed
 
01:16:22.630 --> 01:16:22.640 align:start position:0%
for for dog
 
01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:23.750 align:start position:0%
for for dog
shelters

01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
shelters
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
but they have more animals than they're
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
really allowed by ordinances they just
 
01:16:32.149 --> 01:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:32.159 --> 01:16:33.030 align:start position:0%
 
any

01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
any research or background that we've
 
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
had in the committee and other
 
01:16:39.669 --> 01:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
information other bills relative to how
 
01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
we stand ordinance wise in the state on
 
01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:44.239 align:start position:0%
that sort of a thing
 
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of any research that's
 
01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
been done at least not in my time here
 
01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
i think we all know that certain
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities have
 
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
limiting restrictions on
 
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
well i do know what chickens
 
01:16:59.110 --> 01:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
specifically that there are and
 
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know that i'm
 
01:17:03.669 --> 01:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
aware of dogs and cats as far as the
 
01:17:05.189 --> 01:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
municipality is concerned but they may
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
exist that's something we could
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
certainly look into but i think by
 
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
having that statement
 
01:17:12.149 --> 01:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
in the bill that if there are if such
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
ordinances exist that we wouldn't be
 
01:17:15.910 --> 01:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
causing a situation where they'd be in
 
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
violation of that
 
01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative aaron question um
 
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
just as a different
 
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
something different um
 
01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:25.350 align:start position:0%
something different um
i'm

01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:17:27.189 --> 01:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
wondering is there somewhere in statute
 
01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
where we define
 
01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
what constitutes an evacuation
 
01:17:32.950 --> 01:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
you could be evacuated for a lot of
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
that's a great question i don't have the
 
01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
answer for it
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay that might be one we need to look
 
01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:45.430 align:start position:0%
okay that might be one we need to look
into

01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
well i think during a declared state of
 
01:17:49.830 --> 01:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
emergency in the first place it would
 
01:17:52.390 --> 01:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
have to be a declared state of emergency
 
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
containing an evacuation order so that
 
01:17:56.229 --> 01:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
would have to be part of that state of
 
01:17:56.239 --> 01:17:58.630 align:start position:0%
would have to be part of that state of
emergency

01:17:58.630 --> 01:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
what would you need for a definition on
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
that or what would you be looking for
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
well yeah i guess
 
01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
i guess if it's in an evacuation order
 
01:18:21.189 --> 01:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
do we have a statute that specifies what
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
how how an evacuation order
 
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
is defined or is it defined somewhere
 
01:18:29.669 --> 01:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
i i'm certain that it is that
 
01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
representative bixby yeah i i don't know
 
01:18:35.270 --> 01:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
what the rsa is but i know that in order
 
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
for there to be a declared state of
 
01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
emergency there really has to be some
 
01:18:43.189 --> 01:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
rsa that allows the governor to declare
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
the emergency
 
01:18:44.719 --> 01:18:45.590 align:start position:0%
the emergency
and

01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:18:48.470 --> 01:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
i think that the
 
01:18:50.229 --> 01:18:50.239 align:start position:0%
this is the way this is phrased here
 
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
during during a declared
 
01:18:53.910 --> 01:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
state of emergency containing an
 
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
evacuation order so that is sort of
 
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
narrowing what sort of state of
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
emergency it is so we had a state of
 
01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
emergency for covid but there was no
 
01:19:04.950 --> 01:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
evacuation order associated with that
 
01:19:07.590 --> 01:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
right so uh so i think what we need to
 
01:19:09.189 --> 01:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
do is
 
01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh find out uh what the
 
01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh what the statute that is used to
 
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
declare a state of emergency is
 
01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
and then cite that in in the in the
 
01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
language and i i'm pretty sure that mr
 
01:19:24.630 --> 01:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
tory might be able to help with it
 
01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:26.070 align:start position:0%
tory might be able to help with it
okay

01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
anything for uh representative von
 
01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:28.470 align:start position:0%
anything for uh representative von
polinski

01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
polinski
 
01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
so i i hate the nitpicking part of this
 
01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
but i guess it's kind of our job here so
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
you mentioned chickens uh i think we all
 
01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
know people who keep chickens in
 
01:19:39.669 --> 01:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
enclosures on their property now they
 
01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
don't tend to keep them in the house
 
01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
um but is there some should we and i
 
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
have to assume there's some sort of
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
issue with
 
01:19:48.630 --> 01:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
keeping chickens in close proximity with
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
snakes and dogs and everything else on a
 
01:19:50.159 --> 01:19:51.669 align:start position:0%
snakes and dogs and everything else on a
trailer

01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
trailer
 
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
is there is there a need to define this
 
01:19:56.630 --> 01:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
a little closer as far as in a home so
 
01:19:59.270 --> 01:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
you'll find that companion animals
 
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
does give definitions and chickens or
 
01:20:03.669 --> 01:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
can be considered livestock in statute
 
01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
so i only threw that out because i do
 
01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
know that there are communities that
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
limit chickens i don't know if there are
 
01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:10.719 align:start position:0%
communities that limit companion animals
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
they're very well maybe but i'm not
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
aware of them off the top of my head so
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
sorry i sort of confused it by
 
01:20:17.830 --> 01:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
interjecting chickens no you're really
 
01:20:18.790 --> 01:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
confused they really just kind of
 
01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%
brought up a sure question
 
01:20:22.629 --> 01:20:22.639 align:start position:0%
they are livestock by statute okay thank
 
01:20:25.590 --> 01:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
anything further on this part uh
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative bixby okay this is really
 
01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
picky and it's sort of for final
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
drafting but uh
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
the any hotel or shelter uh which that
 
01:20:38.950 --> 01:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
should be a vat
 
01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:39.750 align:start position:0%
should be a vat
and

01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:40.629 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:20:40.629 --> 01:20:40.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:43.030 --> 01:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
just just so we don't fail to catch that
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
later on sure
 
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's why it's always good to
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
have an english major on it i mean i
 
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
assume you don't want the gory details
 
01:20:54.709 --> 01:20:54.719 align:start position:0%
on why what the difference is
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
we'll save that for the next work
 
01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
session i have two other spots too that
 
01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
need fixing that's fine
 
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
rsa 21-p colon 41
 
01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
vi there should be also a c after that
 
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
in parenthesis because it's part c that
 
01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
we're referencing there
 
01:21:14.629 --> 01:21:14.639 align:start position:0%
i will take you at your word on that
 
01:21:16.709 --> 01:21:16.719 align:start position:0%
since i haven't looked at it that's okay
 
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
i'm telling you and then i trust you and
 
01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
that's your first mistake
 
01:21:23.910 --> 01:21:23.920 align:start position:0%
um and then on the last line it says
 
01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
other animal kept an enclosure that
 
01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
might typically be found in a home yep
 
01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:32.229 align:start position:0%
might typically be found in a home yep
okay

01:21:32.229 --> 01:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
all right so you've jumped ahead into
 
01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
the other parts representative stapleton
 
01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
i was just thinking
 
01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:40.639 align:start position:0%
on that line 10
 
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
other animal kept in an enclosure that
 
01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
might typically
 
01:21:47.430 --> 01:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
be found in a home
 
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
um would it be helpful to have add the
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
word typically and lawfully found in a
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
home i mean you know people buying
 
01:21:57.189 --> 01:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
pythons and alligators and who knows
 
01:21:58.870 --> 01:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
what else
 
01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:00.229 align:start position:0%
what else
and

01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes you only come across these
 
01:22:04.070 --> 01:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
things in states of emergency when
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
public services are
 
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
01:22:09.189 --> 01:22:09.199 align:start position:0%
and that's a rarity but
 
01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
put the message out there that lawful
 
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
ownership is
 
01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:21.430 align:start position:0%
ownership is
affirmed

01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
i understand your point because somebody
 
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
could have a bengal tiger there but i
 
01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
mean i guess those wouldn't typically be
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:34.709 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:22:34.709 --> 01:22:34.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
okay so we all set on that first part do
 
01:22:44.870 --> 01:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
we want to move on to the
 
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
come on up to the mic if you'd like that
 
01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
way the folks who are listening online
 
01:22:58.149 --> 01:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
can hear you
 
01:22:59.910 --> 01:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
we don't want anybody to miss anything
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
so no that i'm not entitled to speak so
 
01:23:04.229 --> 01:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the opportunity
 
01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
i would just say that um
 
01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
hey kurt just for the record why don't
 
01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
you say who you are oh i'm kurt aronberg
 
01:23:11.270 --> 01:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
i'm the state director of the humane
 
01:23:14.310 --> 01:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
society of the united states thank you
 
01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
we support the intent of this bill um
 
01:23:20.629 --> 01:23:20.639 align:start position:0%
the changes made in your changes mr
 
01:23:20.639 --> 01:23:21.990 align:start position:0%
the changes made in your changes mr
chairman

01:23:21.990 --> 01:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
i i would say
 
01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
vastly make the make these two bills
 
01:23:29.430 --> 01:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
very very different the language
 
01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
um there are no there are not sufficient
 
01:23:34.149 --> 01:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
depending on the size of the evacuation
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
we don't know what that would be
 
01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:40.070 align:start position:0%
we don't know what that would be
obviously

01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
depending on
 
01:23:41.679 --> 01:23:43.430 align:start position:0%
depending on
emergency

01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
01:23:45.189 --> 01:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
i guess it's dart shelters that you're
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
depending on
 
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
i would not necessarily say that in a
 
01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
large scale emergency would be in any
 
01:23:53.590 --> 01:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
way sufficient and i would recommend
 
01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:54.550 align:start position:0%
way sufficient and i would recommend
that

01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
there be some accommodation for
 
01:23:59.830 --> 01:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
to say must allow trailers or another
 
01:24:02.629 --> 01:24:02.639 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation
 
01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
something some language like that
 
01:24:08.629 --> 01:24:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
you'd be able to do it in one town maybe
 
01:24:12.790 --> 01:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
in the gym there but
 
01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
next door would not if they could make
 
01:24:16.629 --> 01:24:16.639 align:start position:0%
some reasonable accommodation in another
 
01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:18.719 align:start position:0%
room or another building
 
01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
i think that would be improve this build
 
01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
your language immensely
 
01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
so you're suggesting uh
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
after she'll allow disaster
 
01:24:30.550 --> 01:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
excuse me disaster animal response
 
01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:31.830 align:start position:0%
excuse me disaster animal response
trailers

01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
trailers
 
01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
you would like to add or other
 
01:24:36.629 --> 01:24:36.639 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodations on-site that
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
would be my okay
 
01:24:41.030 --> 01:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not married to that language in any
 
01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
way because i just came up with it and
 
01:24:46.229 --> 01:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
i'm not a lawyer mr chair i think
 
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
that kind of makes sense because maybe
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
people would want to put up a tent
 
01:24:53.669 --> 01:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
to keep an animal in sure that needs to
 
01:24:55.110 --> 01:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
have maybe
 
01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
not be in a contained building but
 
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
maybe needs to have more fresh air or
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's just something that would even be
 
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
able to be erected more temporarily
 
01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:07.430 align:start position:0%
able to be erected more temporarily
okay

01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
certainly a good point thank you thank
 
01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
you for watching appreciate it
 
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
anybody else certainly anybody in the
 
01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
audience that's here if you want to
 
01:25:17.669 --> 01:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
chime in just get my attention we're
 
01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
anything further on this first part
 
01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
before we move on
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none we can always
 
01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
circle back if
 
01:25:31.910 --> 01:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
another thought comes to mind
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
so the second part during such emergency
 
01:25:36.629 --> 01:25:36.639 align:start position:0%
any volunteer trained by the department
 
01:25:38.790 --> 01:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
of health and human services disaster
 
01:25:41.110 --> 01:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
animal response team who is assisting
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
evacuated persons and companion animals
 
01:25:46.310 --> 01:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
shall be considered an emergency worker
 
01:25:51.189 --> 01:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
under rsa p21 rsa21p416
 
01:25:51.199 --> 01:25:55.590 align:start position:0%
under rsa p21 rsa21p416
c

01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:59.030 --> 01:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
so the important part of this is
 
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
at least from my understanding i got
 
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
briefed on this a bit this morning
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
because i didn't quite understand it
 
01:26:05.669 --> 01:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
originally from the bill when they were
 
01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
talking about liability it seemed to me
 
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
like we were looking to absolve these
 
01:26:13.110 --> 01:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
workers from having any liability like
 
01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
if something happened to an animal you
 
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
know that they couldn't be sued for that
 
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
because animals are property by statute
 
01:26:22.390 --> 01:26:22.400 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that wasn't the
 
01:26:24.629 --> 01:26:24.639 align:start position:0%
intent it's it's more about protecting
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
the person that's doing this like if
 
01:26:29.669 --> 01:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
they're bitten or i don't know could be
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
stepped on or whatever thing might
 
01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
occur that caused them a health issue
 
01:26:38.550 --> 01:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
so what they're looking for with this
 
01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
the intent is to protect that person and
 
01:26:42.709 --> 01:26:42.719 align:start position:0%
make them basically provide workers
 
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
compensation benefits it's the easiest
 
01:26:47.910 --> 01:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
way that i could put it so that if
 
01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
the person that's trained is bitten by a
 
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
dog or scratched by a cat and gets an
 
01:26:54.629 --> 01:26:54.639 align:start position:0%
infection that they have the ability to
 
01:26:56.470 --> 01:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
get the appropriate medical care covered
 
01:26:59.110 --> 01:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
by the state not their personal health
 
01:27:00.629 --> 01:27:00.639 align:start position:0%
insurance which they might run into
 
01:27:01.990 --> 01:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
concerns with
 
01:27:03.430 --> 01:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
so this
 
01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
addresses that
 
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
attempts to anyway at least the way we
 
01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
worded it hopefully it addresses that
 
01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
and provides them the protection that
 
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
they would need in you know and
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
guarantees them the health care that
 
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
they would need in the event that they
 
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
were harmed
 
01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:18.709 align:start position:0%
were harmed
during

01:27:18.709 --> 01:27:18.719 align:start position:0%
during
 
01:27:20.709 --> 01:27:20.719 align:start position:0%
fulfilling this
 
01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
being a member of the emergency response
 
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
team for the animal shelter
 
01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
does everybody understand where i'm
 
01:27:29.430 --> 01:27:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
any uh any thoughts or questions yeah i
 
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
just like something that i i think that
 
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's um important
 
01:27:38.070 --> 01:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
i'm glad the language is here that it's
 
01:27:39.990 --> 01:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh that it's volunteer trained by the
 
01:27:42.149 --> 01:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
department of health so so that there is
 
01:27:42.159 --> 01:27:43.350 align:start position:0%
department of health so so that there is
actually

01:27:43.350 --> 01:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
so we know who we're dealing with
 
01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:52.950 align:start position:0%
so we know who we're dealing with
yes

01:27:52.950 --> 01:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:54.070 align:start position:0%
 
any

01:27:54.070 --> 01:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
tweaks that you need to
 
01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
further tweaks you need to see there are
 
01:28:04.390 --> 01:28:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
the last portion the number maximum
 
01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
number of animals per family entering
 
01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
the hotel or community shelter shall
 
01:28:12.709 --> 01:28:12.719 align:start position:0%
comply with local ordinances for the
 
01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
purpose of this section companion animal
 
01:28:16.629 --> 01:28:16.639 align:start position:0%
means a dog cat or other animal kept in
 
01:28:18.390 --> 01:28:18.400 align:start position:0%
an enclosure that might typically be
 
01:28:21.189 --> 01:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
found in a home or typically or lawfully
 
01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
be found in a home we'll have to play
 
01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
with that as to how you want to on it
 
01:28:24.239 --> 01:28:25.270 align:start position:0%
with that as to how you want to on it
but

01:28:25.270 --> 01:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:28:29.110 --> 01:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly open to that change
 
01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
any any further
 
01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
thoughts or comments on that i think
 
01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:38.629 --> 01:28:38.639 align:start position:0%
yeah representative
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
i guess my only ques my only point might
 
01:28:43.510 --> 01:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
be that a word smithing thing and just
 
01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
made those last two sentences make more
 
01:28:45.199 --> 01:28:46.149 align:start position:0%
made those last two sentences make more
sense

01:28:46.149 --> 01:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh before the the
 
01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
volunteering so like the volunteers
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
would be the last part and
 
01:28:53.830 --> 01:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
because we're talking about the animals
 
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
and the first part and we're talking
 
01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
about the animals in the third part
 
01:28:59.110 --> 01:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
and then the second part is is the
 
01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
volunteers uh i mean it's it's it
 
01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:02.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't really make a whole lot of
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
difference but that's what occurred to
 
01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
me when i was reading it i can see your
 
01:29:09.430 --> 01:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:11.189 --> 01:29:11.199 align:start position:0%
would everybody agree be in agreement
 
01:29:12.149 --> 01:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:29:12.159 --> 01:29:19.669 align:start position:0%
with that
yes

01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:21.030 --> 01:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
okay i also have a comment
 
01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
representative erin thank you
 
01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:25.430 align:start position:0%
representative erin thank you
um

01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
do we need to specify anywhere here that
 
01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:31.790 align:start position:0%
the owner is responsible for
 
01:29:31.790 --> 01:29:34.470 align:start position:0%
the owner is responsible for
[Music]

01:29:34.470 --> 01:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:29:36.870 --> 01:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
feeding these animals or caring for
 
01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
these animals
 
01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
who ultimately is going to be caring for
 
01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
these animals in this
 
01:29:47.830 --> 01:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:51.110 --> 01:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
there's obviously going to have to be
 
01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
food provided or
 
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
bales of hay or something i don't know
 
01:29:55.440 --> 01:30:00.390 align:start position:0%
bales of hay or something i don't know
but

01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm just getting text in it on
 
01:30:05.669 --> 01:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
so yes there is prescribed authority for
 
01:30:09.430 --> 01:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
the gov governor to declare and issue
 
01:30:11.110 --> 01:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
orders sorry that was in response to the
 
01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
earlier part oh i do i actually do i had
 
01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
found the section that that has to do
 
01:30:18.629 --> 01:30:18.639 align:start position:0%
what constitutes an evacuation and that
 
01:30:21.669 --> 01:30:21.679 align:start position:0%
section 4 colon 45
 
01:30:25.189 --> 01:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
roman numeral 3 uh item c
 
01:30:25.199 --> 01:30:26.149 align:start position:0%
roman numeral 3 uh item c
so

01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
i can give you that
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
we can we can add that into the text as
 
01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
as part of you know referring to that
 
01:30:34.149 --> 01:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go out on a limb here i
 
01:30:35.669 --> 01:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
think the answer to your question is
 
01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
i'll have to confirm it as i believe
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
these trailers would be stock to
 
01:30:40.950 --> 01:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
appropriately care for the animals that
 
01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
are there but i'll have to confirm that
 
01:30:45.350 --> 01:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
okay because that is a good question i i
 
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
don't think there would be a requirement
 
01:30:49.350 --> 01:30:49.360 align:start position:0%
placed okay hold on we're getting it
 
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
trailers have food and et cetera and are
 
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
set up for i know they're set up for
 
01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
medical care too so they would be
 
01:30:56.070 --> 01:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
stocked to take care of the animals that
 
01:30:58.709 --> 01:30:58.719 align:start position:0%
were there okay and
 
01:30:58.719 --> 01:30:59.510 align:start position:0%
were there okay and
do

01:30:59.510 --> 01:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
i mean do we care for purposes of the
 
01:31:05.189 --> 01:31:05.199 align:start position:0%
statute who is paying for that or who is
 
01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
i think that would be part of the
 
01:31:08.790 --> 01:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
emergency response team set up just like
 
01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
it would be in the shelter okay gotcha
 
01:31:14.390 --> 01:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:16.709 --> 01:31:16.719 align:start position:0%
representative bixby okay so if we add
 
01:31:18.950 --> 01:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
the bit about uh other reasonable
 
01:31:18.960 --> 01:31:20.390 align:start position:0%
the bit about uh other reasonable
accommodation

01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
accommodation
 
01:31:21.669 --> 01:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
would that
 
01:31:23.990 --> 01:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
also have that uh
 
01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.350 align:start position:0%
also have that uh
food

01:31:25.350 --> 01:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
food
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
that's a good question and i could see
 
01:31:34.470 --> 01:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
how that could get dicey
 
01:31:35.830 --> 01:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
let's think let me think about that a
 
01:31:37.110 --> 01:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
little bit we can certainly talk about
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
that representative stapleton
 
01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:41.669 align:start position:0%
that representative stapleton
um

01:31:41.669 --> 01:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:43.830 --> 01:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
do we need a time period
 
01:31:46.070 --> 01:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
disaster takes place these animals are
 
01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
scooped up and put in hotel parking lots
 
01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:49.590 align:start position:0%
scooped up and put in hotel parking lots
trailers

01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
trailers
 
01:31:51.830 --> 01:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
suitable accommodations
 
01:31:55.030 --> 01:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
are there existing statutes or you know
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
in the case of a flood in the house is
 
01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
wiped out there's no place to go back
 
01:32:03.590 --> 01:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
for the residents or the animals
 
01:32:05.430 --> 01:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
at what point
 
01:32:08.229 --> 01:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
does the coverage by state and emergency
 
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
fund cease and personal responsibility
 
01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
take take place
 
01:32:16.629 --> 01:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
i think my standard answer to with that
 
01:32:18.229 --> 01:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
would be the same as the person in the
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
hotel room
 
01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
that the animals would follow that same
 
01:32:21.679 --> 01:32:23.110 align:start position:0%
that the animals would follow that same
course

01:32:23.110 --> 01:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
course
 
01:32:25.189 --> 01:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
and i'm certain that there's some type
 
01:32:26.870 --> 01:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
of specifications on that but i don't
 
01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
know them off the top of my head but i
 
01:32:30.790 --> 01:32:30.800 align:start position:0%
think the intent of this bill would be
 
01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
to give the animals that same
 
01:32:35.110 --> 01:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
time of care during that evacuation
 
01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
order as the person in the hotel is
 
01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:38.310 align:start position:0%
order as the person in the hotel is
having

01:32:38.310 --> 01:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:32:46.950 --> 01:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm getting updates that's why i'm
 
01:32:51.189 --> 01:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
stopping here because
 
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
stacy ober from the akc is listening in
 
01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
and providing you some information she
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to come in today so
 
01:32:59.430 --> 01:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
donations would come in during emergency
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
via animal welfare organizations too
 
01:33:04.149 --> 01:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
i guess that's standard protocol that
 
01:33:04.159 --> 01:33:10.070 align:start position:0%
i guess that's standard protocol that
happens

01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:12.070 --> 01:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of what
 
01:33:14.709 --> 01:33:14.719 align:start position:0%
i came in with um i'm certainly not
 
01:33:17.110 --> 01:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
trying to discount the uh the work that
 
01:33:18.790 --> 01:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
rep gallagher did as well but i think
 
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
this sort of takes his and builds upon
 
01:33:24.550 --> 01:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
i originally was having a difficult time
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
getting my head around this
 
01:33:30.629 --> 01:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
and the concerns that were raised in
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
testimony which is why i reached out and
 
01:33:34.870 --> 01:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
asked for a little a little help on
 
01:33:37.350 --> 01:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
putting some of this together because
 
01:33:39.189 --> 01:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
i just couldn't seem to figure out how
 
01:33:40.629 --> 01:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
we were going to balance that but i
 
01:33:40.639 --> 01:33:41.590 align:start position:0%
we were going to balance that but i
think

01:33:41.590 --> 01:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:42.629 align:start position:0%
think
having

01:33:42.629 --> 01:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
having
 
01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
the accommodation to have the trailers
 
01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
there rather than trying to have them in
 
01:33:48.229 --> 01:33:48.239 align:start position:0%
the hotel solves one of the real major
 
01:33:53.669 --> 01:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:55.590 --> 01:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
anything else that you all want to talk
 
01:33:59.669 --> 01:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
about or add on representative stapleton
 
01:34:00.790 --> 01:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
yeah i
 
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
this is an important bill
 
01:34:04.950 --> 01:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
an important thing to consider
 
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
you know when i was out campaigning it
 
01:34:09.669 --> 01:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
was like every fourth house had a pet
 
01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
dog animal
 
01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
and i was actually surprised to the
 
01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:15.110 align:start position:0%
and i was actually surprised to the
extent

01:34:15.110 --> 01:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
extent
 
01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
of pet ownership and care in our state
 
01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
and in our country
 
01:34:23.830 --> 01:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
and it got to be
 
01:34:25.669 --> 01:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
that realization took me to start
 
01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
bringing around milk bone dog biscuits
 
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
on my campaign walk
 
01:34:31.270 --> 01:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
to make friends with the dog and that
 
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
was good for a vote maybe you know
 
01:34:35.830 --> 01:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:34:38.390 --> 01:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
their number out there and
 
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
and stores are marketing increasing
 
01:34:43.590 --> 01:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
amounts to uh pet foods and pet
 
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
accessories and so forth so it's a it's
 
01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
a big issue
 
01:34:50.709 --> 01:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
when we have a disaster
 
01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
it certainly is and from my
 
01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
understanding again i haven't personally
 
01:34:55.830 --> 01:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
experienced this but information that
 
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
was conveyed to me that
 
01:34:59.910 --> 01:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
in many cases you know most of the
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
people during an evacuation order will
 
01:35:03.910 --> 01:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
have someplace else they can go you know
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
a friend
 
01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
a family you know another town another
 
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
state whatever they're out of the area
 
01:35:10.229 --> 01:35:10.239 align:start position:0%
that's affected and
 
01:35:12.229 --> 01:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
and a lot of those animals can go along
 
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
with them but this will affect a small
 
01:35:16.390 --> 01:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
amount of the community that doesn't
 
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
have that option and obviously the
 
01:35:21.990 --> 01:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
larger the the extent of the evacuation
 
01:35:24.149 --> 01:35:24.159 align:start position:0%
the more people it would it would
 
01:35:25.830 --> 01:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
potentially bring in
 
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
i mean we're thankfully up here we're
 
01:35:32.229 --> 01:35:32.239 align:start position:0%
we're not usually um impacted by like
 
01:35:33.990 --> 01:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
large hurricane areas like new orleans
 
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:35.679 align:start position:0%
had and things like that they certainly
 
01:35:36.629 --> 01:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
had a
 
01:35:39.830 --> 01:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
extremely large area that was evacuated
 
01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire isn't really conducive to
 
01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:43.360 align:start position:0%
having that type of an emergency but we
 
01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
could certainly have something else but
 
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
i think this is a good step toward
 
01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
recognizing that this potential exists
 
01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:50.709 align:start position:0%
recognizing that this potential exists
and

01:35:50.709 --> 01:35:50.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
i think we're making good strides toward
 
01:35:54.629 --> 01:35:54.639 align:start position:0%
getting something in statute to take
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
care of that and those dog biscuits do
 
01:35:59.430 --> 01:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
make a good emergency snack too if you
 
01:36:06.770 --> 01:36:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:10.709 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

01:36:10.709 --> 01:36:10.719 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:36:13.510 --> 01:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
mr chair i have to just say um
 
01:36:15.510 --> 01:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
my son lives down in florida and they
 
01:36:17.430 --> 01:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
had a hurricane
 
01:36:20.070 --> 01:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
that they had to evacuate from
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:36:24.629 --> 01:36:24.639 align:start position:0%
he and his partner have a pet turtle
 
01:36:26.550 --> 01:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
rather large one
 
01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:27.430 align:start position:0%
rather large one
and

01:36:27.430 --> 01:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:29.360 align:start position:0%
they had to they had to leave the area
 
01:36:31.430 --> 01:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
and as they were going to another place
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
that was out of the hurricane zone
 
01:36:36.229 --> 01:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
of course they took their turtle with
 
01:36:37.350 --> 01:36:37.360 align:start position:0%
them and
 
01:36:39.430 --> 01:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
it wasn't easy to find a hotel that
 
01:36:41.430 --> 01:36:41.440 align:start position:0%
would allow them to bring their turtle
 
01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
inside with them
 
01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
so something like this is really kind of
 
01:36:48.629 --> 01:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:48.639 --> 01:36:51.109 align:start position:0%
 
definitely

01:36:51.109 --> 01:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
definitely
 
01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
anything further from the committee
 
01:36:53.910 --> 01:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
before we uh
 
01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh i'm thinking
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
along the same lines as what was
 
01:37:03.270 --> 01:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
discussed at the end of the last
 
01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that we can
 
01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%
i think i think we're fairly close with
 
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
this language honestly we can probably
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
wordsmith this and
 
01:37:12.870 --> 01:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
we'll just have to have a brief work
 
01:37:15.430 --> 01:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
section to go over our
 
01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
final draft and make a recommendation
 
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
out to the full committee
 
01:37:21.430 --> 01:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
representative bixby yeah i i'd agree
 
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:37:25.109 --> 01:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
having gone over this i'm i'm much
 
01:37:27.990 --> 01:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
more sanguine about the chances of
 
01:37:30.149 --> 01:37:30.159 align:start position:0%
getting something put together in
 
01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable time
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the work that you did
 
01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
in advance well i won't take credit for
 
01:37:38.149 --> 01:37:38.159 align:start position:0%
much of it i i sort of got it onto paper
 
01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
and i think again i will i will thank
 
01:37:41.910 --> 01:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
stacey ober she's sort of the brains
 
01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
behind drafting a lot of this but
 
01:37:45.990 --> 01:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
in explaining it to me so i understood
 
01:37:47.430 --> 01:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
it because
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
that was a bit of a challenge this
 
01:37:50.950 --> 01:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
morning i
 
01:37:52.229 --> 01:37:52.239 align:start position:0%
didn't have a lot of sleep because of
 
01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
snow plowing duties so i appreciate her
 
01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:55.210 align:start position:0%
snow plowing duties so i appreciate her
patience

01:37:55.210 --> 01:37:55.220 align:start position:0%
patience
 
01:37:55.220 --> 01:37:58.629 align:start position:0%
patience
[Laughter]

01:37:58.629 --> 01:37:58.639 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
all right so i guess what we'll do then
 
01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:00.790 align:start position:0%
all right so i guess what we'll do then
is

01:38:00.790 --> 01:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:01.669 align:start position:0%
is
we'll

01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
we'll
 
01:38:03.590 --> 01:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
get a i'll try and get a draft together
 
01:38:06.070 --> 01:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
making all these changes and um i'll
 
01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:07.360 align:start position:0%
individually send it to you all
 
01:38:09.030 --> 01:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
obviously so that we're not having a
 
01:38:10.870 --> 01:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
work session offline and you can take a
 
01:38:12.629 --> 01:38:12.639 align:start position:0%
look at it and then when on our next
 
01:38:15.270 --> 01:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
next work session we'll
 
01:38:17.109 --> 01:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
take a look at the changes and see if
 
01:38:18.149 --> 01:38:18.159 align:start position:0%
it's anything we need to do
 
01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
representative bixby yeah i propose that
 
01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
we do the work session after our full
 
01:38:24.790 --> 01:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
house session next week and not not in
 
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
not next week but
 
01:38:28.629 --> 01:38:28.639 align:start position:0%
following that so that we're not getting
 
01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
a conflict there yeah i don't i don't
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
think we'll schedule any for next week
 
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
since we do have two days already in
 
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
house session so
 
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
my feeling is since we're not under the
 
01:38:38.470 --> 01:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
gun with any of these that we'll we'll
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
skip next week and
 
01:38:41.590 --> 01:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
i'll check have to check the
 
01:38:42.870 --> 01:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
calendar but
 
01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh the availability of the room but
 
01:38:47.910 --> 01:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
typically tuesdays are available so
 
01:38:49.350 --> 01:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
i will confirm and we'll put a
 
01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
notification in the calendar but i i'm
 
01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
agreeing with you that i don't think it
 
01:38:56.070 --> 01:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:58.550 --> 01:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
anything further
 
01:39:00.629 --> 01:39:00.639 align:start position:0%

01:39:02.629 --> 01:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
audience that anything you want to add
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%

01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%

01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
close out this work session on health
 
01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
