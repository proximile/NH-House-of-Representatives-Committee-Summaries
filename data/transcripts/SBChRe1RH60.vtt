00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
the left clocks got
 
00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:03.679 align:start position:0%
9 30 so
 
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
we'll start the uh
 
00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
so for the the folks in attendance and
 
00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:09.679 align:start position:0%
the millions around the world this is
 
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee hearing on house bill
 
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
397 in reference to the interstate
 
00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:15.679 align:start position:0%
compact for the placement of children
 
00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee is also attended by
 
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
children and family laws this is a
 
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
substantial part of this
 
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
so we've done a we've i've asked for a
 
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
joint subcommittee on this and the
 
00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 align:start position:0%
chairman of that committee is with us
 
00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.150 align:start position:0%
chairman of that committee is with us
today

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
so the gist of this is
 
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire and
 
00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
if i butcher this
 
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
representative rice absolutely jump in
 
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
here is the state of new hampshire has a
 
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
compact already for the placement of
 
00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 align:start position:0%
children that is clearly not working
 
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
so this portion of senate bill 397
 
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
addresses the a new compact that is
 
00:00:59.349 --> 00:00:59.359 align:start position:0%
underway and being formed and
 
00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:00.470 align:start position:0%
underway and being formed and
the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 align:start position:0%
bill outlines
 
00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
the guts of what that compact looks like
 
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
we're also
 
00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh here to discuss an amendment that was
 
00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
brought forward to this that is
 
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily necessary to make parts
 
00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
of this work for us
 
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
and i will
 
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 align:start position:0%
open this with chairman rice and she can
 
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
what's going on
 
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much so i just wanted
 
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
to i think that the compact really
 
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
speaks for itself
 
00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 align:start position:0%
you know times are changing and evolving
 
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
and we need to keep up with those
 
00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 align:start position:0%
changes hence the need for a new
 
00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.389 align:start position:0%
changes hence the need for a new
compact

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 align:start position:0%
compact
 
00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 align:start position:0%
i think one of the most important parts
 
00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
of this is the amendment
 
00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:47.830 align:start position:0%
of this is the amendment
that

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
for lines
 
00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 align:start position:0%
12 through 15 especially
 
00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
that this will help protect
 
00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
children who are being taken across
 
00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
straight lines or children coming from
 
00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
another state
 
00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 align:start position:0%
had a case so that we can make sure
 
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
they're being put in safe
 
00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
environments so that we can make sure we
 
00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
don't have another harmony montgomery
 
00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.949 align:start position:0%
don't have another harmony montgomery
yep

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
now as uh
 
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
for those of you that don't know when it
 
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
this is a go or no go situation in
 
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
reference to this
 
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
we we don't have the ability to modify
 
00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 align:start position:0%
the terms of the compact we're either in
 
00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
or out
 
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that we saw during
 
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing initially on
 
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
house bill 390 or senate bill 397
 
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh there were some questions in
 
00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
reference to what happens with the
 
00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 align:start position:0%
current compact
 
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
in reference to moving into the new
 
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
compact and one of the things that was
 
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
reiterated is that we don't exit the
 
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
current compact until the new compact
 
00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
it takes effect so it's not going to
 
00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
leave the state of new hampshire in a
 
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
dead zone if you will where we're
 
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
outside of a compact
 
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
the the the compact in reference here
 
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
does have a high threshold of 35 states
 
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
that is a substantial
 
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
that's about triple honestly of what
 
00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
most compacts are but because of the
 
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
nature of
 
00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
the topic the situation that we're in
 
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
and the fact that the united states
 
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
moves children um across state lines
 
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.869 align:start position:0%
moves children um across state lines
readily

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 align:start position:0%
readily
 
00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 align:start position:0%
the bar does need to be
 
00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
at this level
 
00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony from the oplc in
 
00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
reference to them supporting
 
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh the original bill at the time they
 
00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 align:start position:0%
were not aware of the
 
00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:38.149 align:start position:0%
were not aware of the
uh

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
carson amendment
 
00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
and if uh since i have oplc gut people
 
00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:43.350 align:start position:0%
and if uh since i have oplc gut people
here

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 align:start position:0%
has your opinion on that changed
 
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
no fantastic wonderful
 
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
and i we do have john williams who's the
 
00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 align:start position:0%
health and human services liaison he's
 
00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 align:start position:0%
also here
 
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 align:start position:0%

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.309 align:start position:0%
and everything's still cool with you
guys

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
guys
 
00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
yeah all right dcyf as well wonderful
 
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
that's great having everyone on board at
 
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
this state bureaucracy is
 
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily helpful here so that
 
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
that also tells me that
 
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
we don't have um there shouldn't be any
 
00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
surprises at least with this part of
 
00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
this does anybody else in the
 
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee representative marsh
 
00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 align:start position:0%
yes i just want to say that we the
 
00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
current interstate compact for the
 
00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 align:start position:0%
protection of children dates from 1960.
 
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
that's when they first started working
 
00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
on it
 
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
about 60 years ago the world has changed
 
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
in 60 years and clearly there are issues
 
00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
that remain to be addressed i am totally
 
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
supportive of the state of new hampshire
 
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
adopting this compact at this time
 
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
because we're not quite at the threshold
 
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
where it would come into effect we are
 
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
we would be
 
00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
uh in the group who would be able to
 
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
possibly modify the terms of this
 
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
compact so there is an advantage to the
 
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
state in adopting it at this time i'm
 
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
totally on board with uh supporting uh
 
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh 0-9-3-2-s i'm not sure
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
we can adopt the senate amendment as uh
 
00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 align:start position:0%
part of the house and because of that
 
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
question i did ask ols if nobody else
 
00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 align:start position:0%
had drafted this as a house amendment to
 
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
do so in my name i have not yet received
 
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
sure yeah that's that's fine
 
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 align:start position:0%

compact versus the old compact and how

thing but
 
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 align:start position:0%

services
 
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the question
 
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
happy to happy to try to explain a
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
little bit further so the current
 
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
compact as representative marsh
 
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned um was adopted in 1965. um
 
00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759 align:start position:0%
obviously the world has changed quite a
 
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
bit but specifically the challenges with
 
00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
the current compact there's there's a
 
00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
handful of them um
 
00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
one first and foremost is that in the
 
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
close to six years since it's passed
 
00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
many states have changed certain
 
00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
provisions or decided that certain
 
00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
provisions don't apply to them so it's
 
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
no longer actually
 
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
operating as a uniform compact across
 
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
all the states in fact that's one of the
 
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
things that happened here in new
 
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:36.790 align:start position:0%
things that happened here in new
hampshire

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
there's a new hampshire supreme court
 
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.350 align:start position:0%
there's a new hampshire supreme court
case

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
way that it was drafted did not apply in
 
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire which is
 
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
what um led to it was a case called
 
00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:53.919 align:start position:0%
alexis oh led to the situation where
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
you had um the ability or really the
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
prohibition on doing a home study when
 
00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
placing a child with a parent out of
 
00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:01.759 align:start position:0%
state that's what the amendment um seeks
 
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
to redress was that specific change
 
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
but moreover it doesn't have clarity as
 
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
to what types of placements to which it
 
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.270 align:start position:0%
to what types of placements to which it
applies

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 align:start position:0%
applies
 
00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
so it just talks about placing children
 
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
out of state but there's not clarity is
 
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.110 align:start position:0%
out of state but there's not clarity is
that

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
when a parent sends a child to a
 
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
treatment facility on the other on
 
00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
another state line some states say yes
 
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
some states say no does it apply when
 
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
child protection gets involved and is
 
00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
placing a child with a parent across
 
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
state lines some states say yes some
 
00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
states say no
 
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
furthermore there's no dispute
 
00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
resolution process spelled out so if you
 
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
have two states who disagree how it's
 
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to operate there's no way to
 
00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
actually resolve that issue
 
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
the new compact addresses all of those
 
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.029 align:start position:0%
the new compact addresses all of those
things

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
creates a new regulatory body as
 
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
representative marsh mentioned which
 
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
would we would be able to be part of the
 
00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
initial representative regulatory body
 
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
to draft those more specifics um which
 
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
is great
 
00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:49.919 align:start position:0%
and the uh short term amendment that we
 
00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
seek in here the one that would trigger
 
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
immediately and then be repealed when
 
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
the full compact passes closes that
 
00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
loophole that i talked about with the
 
00:07:58.869 --> 00:07:58.879 align:start position:0%
alexa oh case
 
00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:00.879 align:start position:0%
you have silenced mr williams that's
 
00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:06.469 align:start position:0%
you have silenced mr williams that's
amazing

00:08:06.469 --> 00:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for that that's that's um
 
00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
that's extraordinarily helpful
 
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
as we don't have the terms of the
 
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
current compact in front of us
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
are you good with that mark yeah yeah
 
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.589 align:start position:0%
are you good with that mark yeah yeah
okay

00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:08:21.599 --> 00:08:22.469 align:start position:0%
okay
perfect

00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
so with that with the the serenation of
 
00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
a cell phone um
 
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
i will i will add that you know we've
 
00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.550 align:start position:0%
i will i will add that you know we've
unfortunately

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
we as the government react to things
 
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
we try to be proactive but
 
00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
in a lot of cases it takes an
 
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunate event to really push
 
00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
something forward and
 
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
there is no doubt that's the situation
 
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
that we're in right now but i also
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
think that we are not overreacting or
 
00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959 align:start position:0%
knee-jerk reacting to that situation
 
00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:09.519 align:start position:0%
we've this is this has been a problem
 
00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:11.509 align:start position:0%
we've this is this has been a problem
that's

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
been ongoing for a while this is nothing
 
00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:15.680 align:start position:0%
that has just now happened and i think
 
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.470 align:start position:0%
that has just now happened and i think
that

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know the the situations that have
 
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
occurred in in manchester really
 
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
um highlight the need for us to
 
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
to kind of move this forwards
 
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
you know place it on the front burner if
 
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
you will so
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
um with that if there's no other
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
concerns or questions by anyone
 
00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
and any and i'm gonna i know it's a
 
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittee hearing but any of my
 
00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
agency guys everybody's good
 
00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:41.519 align:start position:0%
then then i will close the subcommittee
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
hearing on this um mr chairman before
 
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
you do that do you want a motion if you
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
would like representative marsh i think
 
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
you know where i would move just so the
 
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is on the record that we
 
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
move ought to pass with an amendment
 
00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:56.080 align:start position:0%
that would be the house equivalent of uh
 
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
amendment zero nine three two s which we
 
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
are yet to get back from okay so from a
 
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
procedural standpoint because this
 
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee hearing only touches on the
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
child placement section
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
we could do that for the amendment since
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
it's specific to that part the whole
 
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
bill itself
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
because it's in two parts we're going to
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
have to we'll just have to do it as a
 
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
whole committee then reward it whatever
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
you believe appropriate okay so yeah i'm
 
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
i would second um
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
a favorable motion of accepting the
 
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
932 s or as it will be
 
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
replaced into a house version with the
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
exact same language
 
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
do we have any discussion specifically
 
00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:40.959 align:start position:0%
on the carson
 
00:10:42.389 --> 00:10:42.399 align:start position:0%

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
do i need to hold off representative
 
00:10:58.829 --> 00:10:58.839 align:start position:0%
mcguire for a minute
 
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.600 align:start position:0%

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440 align:start position:0%

just as a subcommittee it'll take a
second

so when you're discussing 277 as a
 
00:28:53.679 --> 00:28:55.430 align:start position:0%
so when you're discussing 277 as a
subcommittee

00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
and the amendment which i had
 
00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:01.360 align:start position:0%
euler's draft is in front of everybody i
 
00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.710 align:start position:0%
euler's draft is in front of everybody i
think

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
it's an amendment 2022-1695-h
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
by myself this is the amendment to the
 
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
bill this is the work of
 
00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:15.830 align:start position:0%
bill this is the work of
um

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh our work from the previous
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on this bill so we
 
00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039 align:start position:0%
incorporated all the changes
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
suggested by the stakeholders
 
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
some of the changes are converting the
 
00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
licenses to permanent licenses
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
striking the dates
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
moving some dates around from the
 
00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559 align:start position:0%
beginning of the year to mid-year so if
 
00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
future legislature needs to make changes
 
00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:51.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
any comments
 
00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
please representative goalie thank you
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
mr chair uh looking at this amendment
 
00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
i'm still trying to figure out where
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
this language came from because it
 
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
wasn't in the notes i have
 
00:30:06.149 --> 00:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
in discussing changes what i had in
 
00:30:08.789 --> 00:30:08.799 align:start position:0%
discussing the change was replacing
 
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
section one with the amendment that was
 
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
provided by oplc which i think we should
 
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
all have a copy of
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
um i don't see that in the bill
 
00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.950 align:start position:0%
um i don't see that in the bill
um

00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
yeah let me go into the details of that
 
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
so the lawyer who is drafting it has
 
00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
some difficulty
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
with the language proposed and he said
 
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
he needs to pull in some other language
 
00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:34.480 align:start position:0%
and the conversion of the
 
00:30:38.789 --> 00:30:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:38.799 --> 00:30:39.610 align:start position:0%
 
h2

00:30:39.610 --> 00:30:39.620 align:start position:0%
h2
 
00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:44.149 align:start position:0%
h2
[Music]

00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
it so the language from the amendment
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
from the oplc is
 
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
we live on page two where the conversion
 
00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:11.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:50.549 --> 00:31:50.559 align:start position:0%
so during initial subcommittee we had
 
00:31:50.559 --> 00:31:52.470 align:start position:0%
so during initial subcommittee we had
testimonies

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
testimonies
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
from um
 
00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.470 align:start position:0%
from um
see

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
nursing homes
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
so they were happy with the amendment
 
00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:02.559 align:start position:0%
they came back they looked at it
 
00:32:02.559 --> 00:32:03.509 align:start position:0%
they came back they looked at it
um

00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:04.870 --> 00:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
youth camps
 
00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.789 align:start position:0%
youth camps
representatives

00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
they were happy with it and
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
lindsay courtney also looked it over
 
00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:12.830 align:start position:0%
lindsay courtney also looked it over
she's

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
she's
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
happy so i believe all the stakeholders
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
still have an issue uh if you go to page
 
00:32:29.919 --> 00:32:30.710 align:start position:0%
still have an issue uh if you go to page
one

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:31.750 align:start position:0%
one
lines

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
lines
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
22 to 24.
 
00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.789 align:start position:0%
22 to 24.
um

00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
i i don't understand why
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
these individuals do not have to uh
 
00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:42.799 align:start position:0%
continue uh to provide continuing
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
education when
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
licensees here in new hampshire have to
 
00:32:47.669 --> 00:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
have continuing education
 
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
so we're setting a subclass of
 
00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.870 align:start position:0%
so we're setting a subclass of
individuals

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
that don't have to meet the requirements
 
00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire licensees do
 
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
i think it should say they have to
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
maintain continuing education credits uh
 
00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
20 yes thank you 22 through 24 to me
 
00:33:04.149 --> 00:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
looks like it deals with emergency
 
00:33:04.159 --> 00:33:05.909 align:start position:0%
looks like it deals with emergency
licenses

00:33:05.909 --> 00:33:05.919 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
which we are converting
 
00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:11.919 align:start position:0%
so for the emergency license itself
 
00:33:14.789 --> 00:33:14.799 align:start position:0%
whatever the emergency rules were
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
should remain in place but once they
 
00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
convert to permanent then they'll be
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
under the
 
00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.990 align:start position:0%
under the
oplc's

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
oplc's
 
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
control where they got to go through the
 
00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
okay can i get a just a
 
00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:31.519 align:start position:0%
reference to someone from oplc
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:45.509 --> 00:33:45.519 align:start position:0%

00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
professional licensure
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
director courtney is is unavailable
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
today i know you she was here previously
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
um but i just had a couple questions on
 
00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.230 align:start position:0%
um but i just had a couple questions on
this

00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.870 align:start position:0%
this
um

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.389 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
emergency licenses
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
so i understand it was this would give
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
us the option anybody that was
 
00:34:08.879 --> 00:34:10.470 align:start position:0%
us the option anybody that was
previously

00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
previously
 
00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.750 align:start position:0%
previously
licensed

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
we would have the if they approached us
 
00:34:14.629 --> 00:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
or we would have the option to issue
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
that emergency license again how long
 
00:34:19.589 --> 00:34:19.599 align:start position:0%
would that emergency license
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
i i don't see that here
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
previously the emergency license you
 
00:34:34.869 --> 00:34:34.879 align:start position:0%
know was only good while we had the
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
state of emergency and they expired at
 
00:34:38.470 --> 00:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
that time
 
00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.310 align:start position:0%
that time
um

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
we've extended that now um and we have a
 
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
group of licenses that will expire in
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
may this year
 
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
so is the intent that
 
00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
these individuals would be licensed
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
june june 30th 2023 the page three okay
 
00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you the second
 
00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599 align:start position:0%
question i had was uh
 
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
section four
 
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
the senior nursing students
 
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh again this was very successful we had
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
senior nursing students that were
 
00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
licensed during that emergency period
 
00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
but they were only licensed i believed
 
00:35:23.829 --> 00:35:23.839 align:start position:0%
and they had to take their nursing exam
 
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
so the language here appears to be you
 
00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
know they could as long as they're
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.069 align:start position:0%
 
items

00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
items
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
they would have a permanent license but
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
it doesn't
 
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
indicate anywhere
 
00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh you know the requirement that they
 
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
would still have to pass their nursing
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
exams at that point
 
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
if they did not pass their nursing exam
 
00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
i believe they did not become licensed
 
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:02.870 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
and then the last question i had was
 
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
section 8
 
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
states the
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
emergency licenses
 
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
shall be converted to a permanent
 
00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:19.750 align:start position:0%
shall be converted to a permanent
license

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:26.790 --> 00:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
it states the emergency licenses shall
 
00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
expire in june 30th 2023 again just
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
looking for clarification
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
between those two
 
00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:39.990 align:start position:0%
between those two
sections

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.190 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:58.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:36:58.710 --> 00:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
so the intent here is to convert them
 
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
and place them under the oplc's
 
00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.790 align:start position:0%
and place them under the oplc's
jurisdiction

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:08.069 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
right

00:37:08.069 --> 00:37:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
is that something new plc is comfortable
 
00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.470 align:start position:0%
is that something new plc is comfortable
with

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
the order
 
00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:29.839 align:start position:0%
i guess again just
 
00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
we would be comfortable and did support
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
converting emergency license to
 
00:37:35.589 --> 00:37:35.599 align:start position:0%
permanent license if they had been
 
00:37:35.599 --> 00:37:36.870 align:start position:0%
permanent license if they had been
previously

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
previously
 
00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.790 align:start position:0%
previously
uh

00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:40.720 align:start position:0%
but again it looks like the last section
 
00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.069 align:start position:0%
but again it looks like the last section
is

00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:37:43.829 --> 00:37:43.839 align:start position:0%
emergency temporary licenses would
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
expire in june 2023 aren't those two
 
00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
different things
 
00:37:49.829 --> 00:37:49.839 align:start position:0%
they're either going to expire in june
 
00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
2023 or they're automatically converted
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
if there is a conflict in the language
 
00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:09.030 align:start position:0%
if there is a conflict in the language
if

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
if that's the question
 
00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:15.190 align:start position:0%
if that's the question
um

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
mr chairman yes please
 
00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
i i sort of understood it that this is
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
just extending the emergency and that
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
the conversion is you then get an actual
 
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
so it's a little bit of apples and
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
oranges to say well you don't
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
regular rule things in this emergency
 
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
extension it's not really
 
00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:42.079 --> 00:38:44.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:47.109 --> 00:38:47.119 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is that applied
 
00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:49.839 align:start position:0%
to all the emergency
 
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
licenses that were
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
issued for
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
health care it appears to me section 8
 
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
emergency licenses issued during the
 
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
coba 19 pandemic
 
00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
on or before january 31st 2022
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
shall not be deemed to have lapsed upon
 
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency expiration and
 
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
shall be converted to a permanent
 
00:39:11.359 --> 00:39:12.790 align:start position:0%
shall be converted to a permanent
license

00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
so again the hundreds of licenses that
 
00:39:15.119 --> 00:39:16.390 align:start position:0%
so again the hundreds of licenses that
were

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
temporary emergency this would
 
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
automatically we would have to we would
 
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
go back in the system get that list and
 
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
they would all be converted to
 
00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:25.430 align:start position:0%
they would all be converted to
a

00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
permanent license automatically is my
 
00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
understanding and again now you go down
 
00:39:31.599 --> 00:39:32.630 align:start position:0%
understanding and again now you go down
30

00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
30
 
00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
to 31
 
00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.470 align:start position:0%
to 31
one

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
and it appears to say you know those
 
00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
same emergency
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
temporary health healthcare licenses
 
00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:44.550 align:start position:0%
temporary health healthcare licenses
remain

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
remain
 
00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.230 align:start position:0%
remain
temporary

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
temporary
 
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
and they expire in june 30th 2023.
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
all right don't those it's it's one or
 
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
the other
 
00:39:57.589 --> 00:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
isn't it wouldn't it well
 
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
i believe this gives time to the oplc to
 
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
convert them and the time is next
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
again i'm just giving you a
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
clarification if that if that's the
 
00:40:09.349 --> 00:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
intent um right
 
00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
right i believe that's the intent here
 
00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:14.630 align:start position:0%
right i believe that's the intent here
yeah

00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
so it gives a year
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
and and again to do so it appears by the
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
language they shall be converted they
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
don't have to work again it would be on
 
00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:26.069 align:start position:0%
don't have to work again it would be on
oplc

00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
00:40:26.079 --> 00:40:26.870 align:start position:0%
oplc
to

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
do the research convert them and whether
 
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have to request
 
00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
that they'd liked a permanent license
 
00:40:35.109 --> 00:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
we're just going to go back to that list
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
you had an emergency license you're now
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
going to get a permanent license in the
 
00:40:38.079 --> 00:40:38.870 align:start position:0%
going to get a permanent license in the
mail

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
mail
 
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
or you know right we'll contact them
 
00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:41.349 align:start position:0%
or you know right we'll contact them
okay

00:40:41.349 --> 00:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:40:44.309 --> 00:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
clarifying that that's the intent yeah
 
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
they could have requested it before now
 
00:40:48.630 --> 00:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
but they didn't
 
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
so we were
 
00:40:50.829 --> 00:40:50.839 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
problem that does make sense if the
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
intent is again to give us time
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
up through another year to convert them
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
that that makes sense
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
i guess the only open issue would be the
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
nursing students i just want to be clear
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
if they become licensed
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
during their senior year which again the
 
00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
intent of that and it worked very well
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
to get them you know working under a
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
you know a license
 
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
you know while they're finishing school
 
00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
i i think there needs to be some
 
00:41:23.589 --> 00:41:23.599 align:start position:0%
notation or provision that they still
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
need to pass their
 
00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
nclex exam
 
00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
you know and if they don't their license
 
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
revoked until they passed it you know
 
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
you can take it multiple times but i
 
00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
believe that's how the
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
that temporary license worked during the
 
00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
state of emergency which which did work
 
00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.430 align:start position:0%
state of emergency which which did work
well

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.160 align:start position:0%
okay can we get a confirmation that they
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
must pass an exam today
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
or what what it is we're asking them to
 
00:41:49.839 --> 00:41:51.190 align:start position:0%
or what what it is we're asking them to
do

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.470 align:start position:0%
do
like

00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
do yeah please
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't these senior nursing students
 
00:41:58.950 --> 00:41:58.960 align:start position:0%
of a year ago already have passed or
 
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
i believe so so uh representative you're
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
to answer your question uh this
 
00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
provision for senior nursing students
 
00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
actually ended an act
 
00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
sing it again
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
so i believe you're right the ones that
 
00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
already were in this program would have
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
already taken their exam passed be
 
00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
licensed so this is opening that that
 
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
door again so someone who was a junior
 
00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.550 align:start position:0%
door again so someone who was a junior
student

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
student
 
00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
could not have
 
00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
had an emergency license to be now
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
extended only the senior students who
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
would have either passed or failed
 
00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:38.790 align:start position:0%
would have either passed or failed
already

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
is it
 
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
so is this really a problem
 
00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
the way i i read this again this would
 
00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
be new students that are within five
 
00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
months of their
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh the date of
 
00:42:54.790 --> 00:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
application or graduation already have
 
00:42:56.069 --> 00:42:56.079 align:start position:0%
an emergency
 
00:42:56.079 --> 00:43:01.589 align:start position:0%
an emergency
license

00:43:01.589 --> 00:43:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
i guess i didn't understand that here
 
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
so the intent of this and again i'm
 
00:43:10.829 --> 00:43:10.839 align:start position:0%
asking the intent of this
 
00:43:10.839 --> 00:43:12.550 align:start position:0%
asking the intent of this
is

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
those that previously had that
 
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
who were seniors
 
00:43:19.829 --> 00:43:19.839 align:start position:0%
got an emergency license have presumably
 
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
already passed or failed correct and you
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
can't probably create new senior nursing
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
students that have an emergency license
 
00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
because the emergency has expired
 
00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
so are we talking about some kind of
 
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
my my understanding of this was just
 
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
again by me reading this is that this
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
provision would be opened a second time
 
00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
for for senior nursing students who have
 
00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
an emergency order i i didn't i didn't
 
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
believe that that that was the
 
00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:52.950 align:start position:0%
believe that that that was the
requirement

00:43:52.950 --> 00:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:43:55.349 --> 00:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
so clarification would be useful
 
00:43:55.359 --> 00:43:56.710 align:start position:0%
so clarification would be useful
yes

00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
again i'm not sure
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
um you know what the the intent was
 
00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:05.109 align:start position:0%
um you know what the the intent was
there

00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:05.119 --> 00:44:06.550 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
i gotta look at the original
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:47.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
line six says five months from the date
 
00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
of application
 
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
what is the date
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
and when is the application submitted
 
00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
would you know
 
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
you know prior to their their graduation
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
date again midway through that their
 
00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
senior year or final year of their their
 
00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
nursing program
 
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
that's that's always been in place they
 
00:45:23.589 --> 00:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
is it because this this is all falling
 
00:45:29.910 --> 00:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
under this 310 a1i emergency license
 
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
process so that
 
00:45:35.589 --> 00:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
any of this only applies
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
or new light new
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
new applications would only apply again
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
under an emergency
 
00:45:45.030 --> 00:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
situation so seniors this year
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
could not apply for that because we're
 
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
not in an emergency situation is that
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
what representative bailey is
 
00:45:52.079 --> 00:45:53.910 align:start position:0%
what representative bailey is
indicating

00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
indicating
 
00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:57.829 align:start position:0%
indicating
okay

00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
okay again just looking for clairvoyance
 
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't know either that's the
 
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
intent question
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
high school students that fought with
 
00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
davey crockett are entitled to a texas
 
00:46:09.030 --> 00:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
pension except there are no such thing
 
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.190 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
i i would yes i would thank you
 
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
because we were within the same chapter
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
so representatives would would that
 
00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
clarify it for the oplc that we're
 
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
talking about the students who have
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
gone through the emergency license
 
00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
um that is the intent that that would
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
make sense
 
00:46:43.829 --> 00:46:43.839 align:start position:0%
i don't know if we need a change in the
 
00:46:43.839 --> 00:46:45.670 align:start position:0%
i don't know if we need a change in the
amendment

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
that's stated but i guess it's for the
 
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
um full committee to discuss if we
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
we um
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
we have it under section 310
 
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
which is the emergency license processes
 
00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:06.950 align:start position:0%
which is the emergency license processes
anyway

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:08.470 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
i'll representative golly please
 
00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i
 
00:47:14.950 --> 00:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
still would like to follow up from
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
oplc as to
 
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not these individuals that
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
are giving licenses
 
00:47:22.549 --> 00:47:22.559 align:start position:0%
are just handed the license or they
 
00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
taking the exam like every other
 
00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
licensed nurse here in the state of new
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire had to take before they got
 
00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:29.839 align:start position:0%
their license
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
we're talking about section 4 against
 
00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
the nursing students senior nursing
 
00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
it's just saying they are giving a
 
00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
license they don't have to do continuing
 
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
ed like
 
00:47:44.069 --> 00:47:44.079 align:start position:0%
every other licensed individual has to
 
00:47:44.079 --> 00:47:44.790 align:start position:0%
every other licensed individual has to
do

00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
they have given been given a lot of
 
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:57.510 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
did the emergency licenses that were
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
issued did did they have expired dates
 
00:48:04.829 --> 00:48:04.839 align:start position:0%
on them
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
so the emergency licenses that were
 
00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.349 align:start position:0%
so the emergency licenses that were
issued

00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
issued
 
00:48:12.549 --> 00:48:12.559 align:start position:0%
besides the nursing students
 
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
have been extended by law through may
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
next next the end of this next month
 
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
but the way the the nursing student uh
 
00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
senior nursing students to get them
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
working that was specifically tied to
 
00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency
 
00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:28.950 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency
um

00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
and we are not issuing those at this
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
time those did expire i believe in
 
00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
january of this year
 
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
so again the way this is written if you
 
00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
look at the first paragraph it doesn't
 
00:48:42.150 --> 00:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
to me it didn't the amendment didn't
 
00:48:45.109 --> 00:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
take into consideration a new state of
 
00:48:45.119 --> 00:48:46.470 align:start position:0%
take into consideration a new state of
emergency

00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
the opening paragraph paragraph says the
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure and
 
00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:51.750 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure and
certification

00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
certification
 
00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:53.270 align:start position:0%
certification
um

00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
may issue emergency license to the
 
00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
following applicants i don't think this
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
and again i think this is is the intent
 
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
of this was to
 
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
you know get people working in the
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
healthcare professions and and eliminate
 
00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
barriers to workforce and
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
you know authorized us to expedite that
 
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
process to get health care workers
 
00:49:13.910 --> 00:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
working even going forward on a
 
00:49:15.990 --> 00:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
temporary basis say you know somebody's
 
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
moving here from out of state
 
00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
um they have an active license in
 
00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
another state and until they
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:49:24.069 --> 00:49:24.079 align:start position:0%
you know can
 
00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
fulfill all the requirements for a
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
regular license they could work for up
 
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
to you know a temporary period i i
 
00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
believe that was the intent here and we
 
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
certainly support that
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:42.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:44.559 align:start position:0%
representative fellows i
 
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
it may be that i don't understand
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
everything that's going on but if we
 
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
didn't touch
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
existing statute
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
would the only
 
00:49:56.319 --> 00:49:57.270 align:start position:0%
would the only
um

00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:00.549 --> 00:50:00.559 align:start position:0%
issue that was raised that we might want
 
00:50:02.069 --> 00:50:02.079 align:start position:0%
to deal with
 
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
be that last paragraph on page two that
 
00:50:06.549 --> 00:50:06.559 align:start position:0%
has to do
 
00:50:09.829 --> 00:50:09.839 align:start position:0%
um it it it says it includes more but
 
00:50:09.839 --> 00:50:10.790 align:start position:0%
um it it it says it includes more but
but

00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
should we just try to deal with like the
 
00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:18.079 align:start position:0%
camp nurses and just write one paragraph
 
00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:19.839 align:start position:0%
related to that
 
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
it's just a thought i don't know the
 
00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:33.670 align:start position:0%
it's just a thought i don't know the
answer

00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:35.190 align:start position:0%
 
nurses

00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
nurses
 
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
are happy with the amendment so they
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
will be taken care of
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
other professions or especially part of
 
00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
the problem is like what we've got here
 
00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
has conflicts has conflicts within it
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
so i was trying to
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
i think at this point the question is do
 
00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
senior nursing students do they go
 
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
and do they pass the test
 
00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
that's really the only sticking point
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
everything else all the regular licenses
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
do have continuing education
 
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
requirements and their policies
 
00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with that
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
so once they convert it they are under
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
the purview of the office right
 
00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
so i don't think there's a problem with
 
00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:34.630 align:start position:0%
so i don't think there's a problem with
that

00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
some of the licenses were converted most
 
00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:39.829 align:start position:0%
some of the licenses were converted most
already

00:51:39.829 --> 00:51:39.839 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh they were not converted
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
already but again they the temporary
 
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
emergency license have been extended
 
00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
through may
 
00:51:51.589 --> 00:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
of this year next third year first yep
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
yeah um so unless we do
 
00:51:54.319 --> 00:51:55.349 align:start position:0%
yeah um so unless we do
something

00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
you know here or otherwise those will
 
00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:58.710 align:start position:0%
you know here or otherwise those will
end

00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
end
 
00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
may 30th
 
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
so this again uh you know extends those
 
00:52:10.069 --> 00:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:13.829 --> 00:52:13.839 align:start position:0%
and it says again we will convert
 
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
all of those emergency licenses to
 
00:52:20.549 --> 00:52:20.559 align:start position:0%
permanent licenses automatically
 
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
it would give us my understanding based
 
00:52:23.829 --> 00:52:23.839 align:start position:0%
on the questions earlier it would give
 
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
us the one year until june 30th 2023 we
 
00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
would have the year to convert those
 
00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
licenses to a permanent status but it
 
00:52:35.430 --> 00:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
would again would be automatic
 
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
as soon as we process them
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair now i think i
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
understand where we are
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
the original bill
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
specifically dealt with extending
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
and correct me if i'm misreading this
 
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
those letters that were
 
00:52:55.109 --> 00:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
issued under the emergency to
 
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
continue through 2024 originally and
 
00:52:59.349 --> 00:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
with the getting their licenses which
 
00:53:00.870 --> 00:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't any part of this bill that's
 
00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
before us so this section is
 
00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
reinstating the emergency which
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
i don't think we need to do that's all
 
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
we're looking to do is extend the
 
00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:10.559 align:start position:0%
licenses that were issued under the
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
emergency order from what we were
 
00:53:13.589 --> 00:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
talking about because they extended may
 
00:53:15.270 --> 00:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
31st so i don't know why we have this
 
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
language in front of us reinstituting
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure we're doing that but we are
 
00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:26.559 align:start position:0%
converting them
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
to permanent licenses
 
00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
i see it as opening that whole program
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
back up and anyone who's a senior
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
nursing student can once again apply for
 
00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
an emergency license by putting this
 
00:53:38.069 --> 00:53:38.079 align:start position:0%
back in when we're looking just to
 
00:53:43.510 --> 00:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
representative bailey if you're on the
 
00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:46.710 align:start position:0%
representative bailey if you're on the
microphone

00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:47.670 align:start position:0%
microphone
yeah

yeah
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
that was my understanding that you'd
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
have to already have an emergency
 
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
not emergency license there's no
 
00:53:57.119 --> 00:54:00.230 align:start position:0%
not emergency license there's no
emergency

00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:01.750 align:start position:0%
 
correct

00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
i don't i'm not sure we have that power
 
00:54:11.430 --> 00:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
i i didn't write this i'm sorry
 
00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:12.870 align:start position:0%
i i didn't write this i'm sorry

anybody else from
[Music]

00:54:23.109 --> 00:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
the public wants to speak
 
00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:27.109 align:start position:0%
the public wants to speak
or

00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%

00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
is it like a computer thing that there
 
00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
should be some ands and oars in there
 
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
you know always you have an emergency
 
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
license and you're a graduated senior
 
00:54:44.789 --> 00:54:44.799 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:54:44.799 --> 00:54:48.470 align:start position:0%
you know
and

00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:50.789 --> 00:54:50.799 align:start position:0%
absolutely it needs to stay for people
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
who who as of such and such a date
 
00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:54.870 align:start position:0%
who who as of such and such a date
have

00:54:54.870 --> 00:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
are operating with an emergency license
 
00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
and then say except for the student
 
00:55:01.119 --> 00:55:02.470 align:start position:0%
and then say except for the student
nurses

00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
nurses
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
they get extended perhaps this gentleman
 
00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
has shown a hole in this island would
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
you yeah
 
00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:10.799 align:start position:0%
would it i'm sorry again just to clarify
 
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
at this time there are no emergency
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
student nursing licenses active
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
those expired in january of this year
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
so we don't want to create new ones
 
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
again i don't i don't know the intent or
 
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
you know who submitted this but if the
 
00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
intent is to open that door again i do
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
think some additions should be added
 
00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
or if the intent was
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
just copy in previous language and if
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
there was a misunderstanding that there
 
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
was some student nurses
 
00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:39.910 align:start position:0%
was some student nurses
currently

00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
currently
 
00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:42.559 align:start position:0%
with an emergency license i i'm not sure
 
00:55:44.549 --> 00:55:44.559 align:start position:0%
what would you strike out to make it
 
00:55:44.559 --> 00:55:48.549 align:start position:0%
what would you strike out to make it
right

00:55:48.549 --> 00:55:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:50.069 --> 00:55:50.079 align:start position:0%
to me the simplest thing would be to
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
take that section out if if the
 
00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:54.720 align:start position:0%
if the intent was
 
00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:56.150 align:start position:0%
if the intent was
section

00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:57.589 align:start position:0%
section
four

00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:55:57.599 --> 00:55:58.390 align:start position:0%
four
um

00:55:58.390 --> 00:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:01.109 --> 00:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
somebody thought there was currently
 
00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:06.549 --> 00:56:06.559 align:start position:0%
so again this is a this is an empty set
 
00:56:08.549 --> 00:56:08.559 align:start position:0%
there are no senior nursing students
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
under the reference they expired in
 
00:56:12.309 --> 00:56:12.319 align:start position:0%
january of this year so anybody under
 
00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
that provision
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
so and again there's been some
 
00:56:19.589 --> 00:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
discussion i i and i i would say
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
we we are open to
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
continuing that for
 
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
senior nursing students in that final
 
00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
year but i i if that's the intent
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
you know i think that needs to be
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
clarified in there um
 
00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
you know with the provision that you
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
know oplc may you know
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
may issue these licenses if people apply
 
00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:42.549 align:start position:0%
may issue these licenses if people apply
um

00:56:42.549 --> 00:56:42.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:44.549 --> 00:56:44.559 align:start position:0%
and meet these
 
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:48.799 align:start position:0%
and uh and again note that they they
 
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
need to pass that nursing exam because
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
at that point they would only be
 
00:56:54.069 --> 00:56:54.079 align:start position:0%
eligible for this until they took out
 
00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:00.789 --> 00:57:00.799 align:start position:0%
one thought is that by the time this
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
bill gets passed
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
that um college for this year will be
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
over so when it says senior students we
 
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
will be this will be applying to the
 
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
students that are juniors right now
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
because the seniors right now they're
 
00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:19.750 align:start position:0%
going to be
out

00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:22.549 align:start position:0%
out
so

00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:24.789 --> 00:57:24.799 align:start position:0%
representative bailey our microphone
 
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
it was actually sort of issued to the
 
00:57:28.230 --> 00:57:28.240 align:start position:0%
students of last year
 
00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:30.309 align:start position:0%
students of last year
right

00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:57:32.230 --> 00:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
there's already none of these people
 
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
that are seniors under the emergency
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
order that was last year you know
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
and again it was directly tied to the
 
00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:48.870 align:start position:0%
 
previously

00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
there has been there was some confusion
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
there was there was questions there's
 
00:57:56.069 --> 00:57:56.079 align:start position:0%
some thought that this continued on but
 
00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
the temporary licenses of the emergency
 
00:58:00.390 --> 00:58:00.400 align:start position:0%
licenses the key provision in there was
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
people had to have a license from
 
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
another state
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
that was verified when we gave them that
 
00:58:07.829 --> 00:58:07.839 align:start position:0%
senior nursing students didn't have that
 
00:58:09.910 --> 00:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
so when these were converted you know or
 
00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
pushed out
 
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
you know and allowed to continue they
 
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
weren't included in that because they
 
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
didn't have an active license so again
 
00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
that ended in january of this year a few
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
months ago thank you
 
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
just mechanically would you have to just
 
00:58:25.990 --> 00:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
individually we have to re revisit this
 
00:58:27.750 --> 00:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
with a version in which that paragraph
 
00:58:29.349 --> 00:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
is struck out
 
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
um uh mr clark do you want to if you
 
00:58:35.270 --> 00:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
save you for a few words
 
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe the microphone no no yeah
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
for the public online
 
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
and i forget about that too yeah
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
robert clegg i'm with legislative
 
00:58:51.599 --> 00:58:52.710 align:start position:0%
robert clegg i'm with legislative
solutions

00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
solutions
 
00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
um i i'm not sure that you need to do
 
00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
much of anything because if you look at
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
line 32 or 31 and 32
 
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
the licenses they're talking about is
 
00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
anything that was issued on or before
 
00:59:08.470 --> 00:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
january thirty one twenty twenty two
 
00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:09.270 align:start position:0%
january thirty one twenty twenty two
so

00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:10.390 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:59:10.390 --> 00:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
i i think you've covered it that
 
00:59:15.589 --> 00:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
if there's anybody that's was a senior
 
00:59:17.030 --> 00:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
nursing student
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
and was given an emergency who hasn't
 
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
taken that test yet would still have to
 
00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
take it but
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't think that there's as
 
00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
much confusion as we like it's a long
 
00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:27.829 align:start position:0%
much confusion as we like it's a long
bill

00:59:27.829 --> 00:59:27.839 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:59:30.549 --> 00:59:30.559 align:start position:0%
but when i start at the very beginning
 
00:59:32.309 --> 00:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
it says notwithstanding any of the law
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
the the the um office of professional
 
00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
license and certification may issue
 
00:59:39.589 --> 00:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
emergency license to the following
 
00:59:41.349 --> 00:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say they shall it says they
 
00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
may so if office of
 
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
licensing finds that there's a situation
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the state of new
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire they don't have to but i think
 
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
that line 32 on page two sort of says it
 
00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
all if you didn't have it before january
 
00:59:59.349 --> 00:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
1 of 2022
 
01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry january 31st
 
01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
you're not included in this legislation
 
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you i think that clarifies it
 
01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
because that's exactly the date
 
01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
the pc representative was referring to
 
01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
and that's by when the student nurse
 
01:00:20.549 --> 01:00:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:20.559 --> 01:00:22.549 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:24.069 --> 01:00:24.079 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i'm happy with that
 
01:00:24.079 --> 01:00:25.270 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i'm happy with that
explanation

01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
explanation
 
01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
because the window is very small
 
01:00:27.599 --> 01:00:30.470 align:start position:0%
because the window is very small
yeah

01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:38.230 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
should we vote on on the amendment
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
do we have time to vote on the amendment
 
01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
to move forward as a subcommittee that's
 
01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:51.030 --> 01:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.990 align:start position:0%
all right

01:00:55.349 --> 01:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
i think i'm satisfied with the
 
01:00:57.030 --> 01:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
explanations and i would like to move
 
01:00:59.670 --> 01:00:59.680 align:start position:0%

01:09:20.139 --> 01:09:20.149 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:20.149 --> 01:09:28.950 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
we should speak to your second
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%

history of this statute of corner
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
testimony so it looks like it's not
 
01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
needed so we should just go ahead with
 
01:09:51.349 --> 01:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%

discussion

01:09:57.910 --> 01:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:58.870 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:09:58.870 --> 01:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
i'd like to say that it
 
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
since it's been there for so long the
 
01:10:07.910 --> 01:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
amount has become
 
01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
fairly trivial
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
and so it's not really providing much
 
01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.350 align:start position:0%
and so it's not really providing much
protection

01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
protection
 
01:10:16.550 --> 01:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
and since it's never been needed
 
01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
you know let's just to get rid of it
 
01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%

pretty much uniformly used so
 
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
this is not a case where
 
01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
our neighbors are not
 
01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
functioning under
 
01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
a condition that is foreign to new
 
01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:54.870 --> 01:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
the other thing is the
 
01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
if you look at the 8 000 hours of the
 
01:15:58.870 --> 01:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
apprentice program that is also
 
01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
something that is familiar in the in the
 
01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
region so
 
01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
that's the gist of this it's it's
 
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
relatively simple and
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:12.550 --> 01:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative pierce harrison
 
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
01:16:21.990 --> 01:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
you explain the difference between the
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
language that's in there now and where
 
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:24.790 align:start position:0%
language that's in there now and where
this

01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
not really
 
01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
i can't i didn't write it um as far as
 
01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
can you be more specific representative
 
01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
well i don't have an electrician's
 
01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
license me neither so
 
01:16:48.390 --> 01:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know exactly
 
01:16:50.550 --> 01:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
what we require now
 
01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
but well it's in the it's in the the
 
01:16:54.070 --> 01:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
amendment strikes out
 
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
the current well
 
01:16:57.430 --> 01:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
true which is my issue
 
01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
like i don't understand what was wrong
 
01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
with the current language that says the
 
01:17:04.550 --> 01:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
other states licensing
 
01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
must be substantially equivalent or
 
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
higher to
 
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
ours well the only thing i can say and
 
01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
as we've seen throughout the volumes and
 
01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
volumes of laws that exist in the state
 
01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire substantially
 
01:17:22.630 --> 01:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
is up for interpretation i think this
 
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
language here is very definitive
 
01:17:32.630 --> 01:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
and it would take away an interpretable
 
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
idea i believe one of the next
 
01:17:37.669 --> 01:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
testifiers will explain some of the
 
01:17:37.679 --> 01:17:39.669 align:start position:0%
testifiers will explain some of the
difficulties

01:17:39.669 --> 01:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
difficulties
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
but yes representative platt
 
01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
yes i'm no electrician but i'm a power
 
01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:45.669 align:start position:0%
yes i'm no electrician but i'm a power
engineer

01:17:45.669 --> 01:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
engineer
 
01:17:48.229 --> 01:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
could one of the
 
01:17:51.189 --> 01:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies between states is uh
 
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
have to do with what version of the
 
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
national electrical code has been
 
01:17:56.709 --> 01:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
adopted by the state the massachusetts
 
01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
might be one code ahead of us for
 
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
instance you are as a guy who at one
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
time worked for the nfpa i can tell you
 
01:18:06.630 --> 01:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
that that that is um that is true with a
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
lot of standards in this particular case
 
01:18:11.189 --> 01:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
there are folks behind me that
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
this guts the original intent of the
 
01:18:23.189 --> 01:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
senate bill uh does it not with uh
 
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
children's environmental health day so
 
01:18:28.149 --> 01:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
that no longer exists correct completely
 
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
and totally rewrites it and how does the
 
01:18:31.510 --> 01:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
center feel about that
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
the feelings of the senate are
 
01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
yes we don't worry about intentions
 
01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
representative platt we have enough
 
01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:51.510 --> 01:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:18:52.630 --> 01:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
01:18:55.030 --> 01:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
representative pearson
 
01:19:09.430 --> 01:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:10.630 --> 01:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:19:12.550 --> 01:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
my name is uh will infantine
 
01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
in addition to
 
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
being one of your fellow representatives
 
01:19:21.669 --> 01:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
i am the public member of the
 
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
electrician's board
 
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
i am not an electrician uh there are
 
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
other electricians behind me that will
 
01:19:29.189 --> 01:19:29.199 align:start position:0%
be speaking
 
01:19:29.199 --> 01:19:30.790 align:start position:0%
be speaking
um

01:19:30.790 --> 01:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:33.350 --> 01:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
we are the electricians board is
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:40.630 --> 01:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
for a number of reasons right now we
 
01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
have 21 states that are involved with
 
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
reciprocation which allows
 
01:19:47.189 --> 01:19:47.199 align:start position:0%
other electricians to come into new
 
01:19:47.199 --> 01:19:48.630 align:start position:0%
other electricians to come into new
hampshire

01:19:48.630 --> 01:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
get their licenses and such
 
01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:52.310 align:start position:0%
get their licenses and such
um

01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
but some states just don't want to play
 
01:19:57.510 --> 01:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
nice in the sandbox i was involved
 
01:19:59.110 --> 01:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
recently with a case
 
01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh where they contacted me an
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
individual had been a master electrician
 
01:20:06.790 --> 01:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
for 20 years in the state of new jersey
 
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
he was more than qualified
 
01:20:11.189 --> 01:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
he's moving his family to new hampshire
 
01:20:12.950 --> 01:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
and we wanted him
 
01:20:14.709 --> 01:20:14.719 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the rules of new jersey
 
01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
are such that we could not accept
 
01:20:17.679 --> 01:20:20.790 align:start position:0%
are such that we could not accept
his

01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:23.189 --> 01:20:23.199 align:start position:0%
either a number of years or schooling or
 
01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
whatever because of
 
01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:26.719 align:start position:0%
because the new because of things that
 
01:20:28.709 --> 01:20:28.719 align:start position:0%
new jersey wouldn't do so unfortunately
 
01:20:30.310 --> 01:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
we walked him through the process and he
 
01:20:32.229 --> 01:20:32.239 align:start position:0%
had to take some of the testing which
 
01:20:34.149 --> 01:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
are required in new hampshire which he
 
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
passed very quickly and came
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
so we don't like the fact that these
 
01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
things go on
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
but all the states don't want to
 
01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
get involved with this reciprocation
 
01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:48.470 align:start position:0%
get involved with this reciprocation
and

01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:49.350 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
amendment while it was just stated by
 
01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
representative pearson uh
 
01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
you know hey make it easier it's more
 
01:20:56.239 --> 01:20:57.430 align:start position:0%
you know hey make it easier it's more
specific

01:20:57.430 --> 01:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:20:58.950 --> 01:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
well there's the other side of the coin
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
of that we have cases where people come
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
in front of the board and ask
 
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
that they be able to
 
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
obtain their license in new hampshire
 
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
when they haven't
 
01:21:12.149 --> 01:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
met this criteria that we we currently
 
01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
have the 8 000 hours which is the
 
01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
criteria for an electrician in new
 
01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire because they were maybe in the
 
01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:17.990 align:start position:0%
hampshire because they were maybe in the
military

01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
military
 
01:21:19.189 --> 01:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
someone who was an electrician at
 
01:21:19.199 --> 01:21:20.229 align:start position:0%
someone who was an electrician at
seabrook

01:21:20.229 --> 01:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
seabrook
 
01:21:21.830 --> 01:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
nuclear power plant
 
01:21:23.510 --> 01:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay they hadn't been a licensed
 
01:21:25.669 --> 01:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
electrician but we as a board could make
 
01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
a decision that they had more than
 
01:21:28.629 --> 01:21:28.639 align:start position:0%
enough qualifications to be able to
 
01:21:30.629 --> 01:21:30.639 align:start position:0%
obtain their license and the board
 
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
approved that
 
01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
so it does give us the flexibility
 
01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
that we have now and this would take
 
01:21:39.430 --> 01:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:41.350 --> 01:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
obviously it's well intended and i can
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
understand the logic of someone wanting
 
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
to put that through
 
01:21:46.629 --> 01:21:46.639 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't always work out that way
 
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
so it would hinder us in some
 
01:21:51.590 --> 01:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
some situations
 
01:21:55.270 --> 01:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
this comes up in connecticut and i'm
 
01:21:58.470 --> 01:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
going to let an electrician speak to
 
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
this also the questions about
 
01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:03.590 align:start position:0%
this also the questions about
um

01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:05.590 --> 01:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
you know what other the criteria now
 
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
again i'm not an electrician
 
01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
so i'd like them to speak on some of the
 
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
questions that were asked
 
01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:13.669 align:start position:0%
questions that were asked
previously

01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
previously
 
01:22:13.679 --> 01:22:14.390 align:start position:0%
previously
now

01:22:14.390 --> 01:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:22:16.709 --> 01:22:16.719 align:start position:0%
my last comment is going to be we would
 
01:22:18.629 --> 01:22:18.639 align:start position:0%
love to take all
 
01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
obviously new hampshire is a great place
 
01:22:21.910 --> 01:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
to work and we could use as many
 
01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
electricians as want to come to our
 
01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
great state
 
01:22:28.709 --> 01:22:28.719 align:start position:0%
so we'd be happy to work on that but we
 
01:22:30.629 --> 01:22:30.639 align:start position:0%
don't think this is the right way
 
01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
so thank you madam chairman thank you
 
01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
how many states did you say are in that
 
01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:35.910 align:start position:0%
how many states did you say are in that
compact

01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
compact
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
or agreement 21 21 thank you there's 19
 
01:22:41.270 --> 01:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
and then there's another different pact
 
01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
that we have with vermont and
 
01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:44.390 align:start position:0%
that we have with vermont and
massachusetts

01:22:44.390 --> 01:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
01:22:46.470 --> 01:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
okay for a total of 21. we have some
 
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
questions for you representative marsh
 
01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:22:54.669 --> 01:22:54.679 align:start position:0%
uh when i look at
 
01:22:57.189 --> 01:22:57.199 align:start position:0%
rsa319c7 the licensing requirements it
 
01:22:59.430 --> 01:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
looks like new hampshire applicants are
 
01:23:01.350 --> 01:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
required to have 8 000 hours as an
 
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
apprentice and to pass an examination
 
01:23:05.430 --> 01:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
and this would allow somebody coming
 
01:23:07.270 --> 01:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
from another state to get a license with
 
01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
8 000 hours and an active license are
 
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
there any states where one does not have
 
01:23:14.229 --> 01:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
to pass an examination to get that
 
01:23:24.390 --> 01:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
you know there probably are
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
but i'm i'm
 
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
i think i have the answer but i don't
 
01:23:32.870 --> 01:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not 100 sure and i know an
 
01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:34.719 align:start position:0%
individual standing behind me sitting
 
01:23:36.709 --> 01:23:36.719 align:start position:0%
behind me will have that answer so i
 
01:23:38.149 --> 01:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
respectfully just
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm glad to listen to the next
 
01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:41.750 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm glad to listen to the next
person

01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
all right any other questions
 
01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
representative lackas
 
01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
my question is is there
 
01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
anyone um
 
01:23:54.550 --> 01:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
well you gave one example but is there
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
actually is there anyone who you under
 
01:23:58.470 --> 01:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
the current law you would not be able to
 
01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
license if you wanted to
 
01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
but you would be able to if this
 
01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:14.229 --> 01:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
probably someone that had the 8 000
 
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
hours and failed the test
 
01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
well i said if they if they wanted to
 
01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
i think it would be both ways it has to
 
01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
be equal to or or equivalent or higher
 
01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
now there may be a situation where the
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
board would look at someone who had more
 
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
hours than requiring maybe in some other
 
01:24:33.990 --> 01:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
these other 21 states the criteria to
 
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
get an electrician's license is higher
 
01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
so we would accept that
 
01:24:39.189 --> 01:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
again there was another situation where
 
01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
we had a former police officer who had
 
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
had an electrician's license but he had
 
01:24:45.510 --> 01:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
not been involved in the trade nor had
 
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
he had a license for more than 10 years
 
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
so our rules say no you really can't you
 
01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
have to go back and take some schooling
 
01:24:53.669 --> 01:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
but because of who this gentleman was
 
01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
and just amazing resume we allowed him
 
01:24:59.910 --> 01:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
to take i think 2000 hours or something
 
01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
uh take the upgraded courses and and do
 
01:25:04.229 --> 01:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
something which the board is allowed to
 
01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
make those decisions
 
01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:07.110 align:start position:0%
make those decisions
um

01:25:07.110 --> 01:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
where this wouldn't allow us to do that
 
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:14.870 align:start position:0%
you can't
sorry

01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:25:16.229 --> 01:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
i'm not on it
 
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
well i only introduced it for the
 
01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:18.470 align:start position:0%
well i only introduced it for the
committee

01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
all right go ahead representative pierce
 
01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
i said person ask this question my
 
01:25:24.629 --> 01:25:24.639 align:start position:0%
question is i just is this going to is
 
01:25:24.639 --> 01:25:25.510 align:start position:0%
question is i just is this going to is
this

01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
the rhodes amendment here is this going
 
01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:28.310 align:start position:0%
the rhodes amendment here is this going
to

01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:29.910 align:start position:0%
to
um

01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:32.709 --> 01:25:32.719 align:start position:0%
the 21 states that have reciprocation is
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
currently is this going to
 
01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:36.719 align:start position:0%
cause a problem with that or jeopardize
 
01:25:40.629 --> 01:25:40.639 align:start position:0%
the current arrangement that the states
 
01:25:42.149 --> 01:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
currently have
 
01:25:44.229 --> 01:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
it very well could because once you put
 
01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
this 8 000 hours in play and if that
 
01:25:49.510 --> 01:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
gets changed across the country with
 
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
those states whether it goes up to 9 000
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
or or or to 7 000 or whatever and then
 
01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:59.830 --> 01:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
situation where we're no longer
 
01:26:02.149 --> 01:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
equal or better
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
it could
 
01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
not now but you know five ten years from
 
01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
now we're sitting around and people
 
01:26:10.070 --> 01:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
forgot about if this passes and all of a
 
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
sudden we're no longer
 
01:26:13.510 --> 01:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
deal with that reciprocation another
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
thing massachusetts is very strange and
 
01:26:18.550 --> 01:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
again i'd love let someone behind me
 
01:26:20.709 --> 01:26:20.719 align:start position:0%
speak about it we don't know how this is
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
going to affect the state where we have
 
01:26:24.149 --> 01:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
probably the the biggest reciprocation
 
01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:32.070 --> 01:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions
 
01:26:34.470 --> 01:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much thank you
 
01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh good morning madam chairman and uh
 
01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:47.510 align:start position:0%

um i am the electrician that if you have
 
01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
questions i can hopefully answer some
 
01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:53.350 align:start position:0%
questions i can hopefully answer some
questions

01:26:53.350 --> 01:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
um i'm currently uh working in
 
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
connecticut i live in winchester i have
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
a two-hour commute
 
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
i've been a electrician for 40 years
 
01:27:07.830 --> 01:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
i got my journeyman license in 1986
 
01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
and i had to have the schooling and in
 
01:27:10.870 --> 01:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
connecticut you're required to have
 
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
eight thousand hours
 
01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
i also took it a step further i actually
 
01:27:16.709 --> 01:27:16.719 align:start position:0%
have twelve thousand hours and i have a
 
01:27:19.990 --> 01:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh unlimited contractor's license
 
01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:20.790 align:start position:0%
uh unlimited contractor's license
the

01:27:20.790 --> 01:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:22.870 align:start position:0%
the
um

01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
lately you know everybody's having a
 
01:27:27.189 --> 01:27:27.199 align:start position:0%
hard time trying to get workers
 
01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
and we have qualified licensed uh
 
01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:31.350 align:start position:0%
and we have qualified licensed uh
people

01:27:31.350 --> 01:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
that live here in the state
 
01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
that may be licensed somewhere else
 
01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
holding active licenses that i think
 
01:27:38.950 --> 01:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
that would certainly help the labor
 
01:27:40.229 --> 01:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
labor force
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
um i would certainly like to work in new
 
01:27:42.239 --> 01:27:43.350 align:start position:0%
um i would certainly like to work in new
hampshire

01:27:43.350 --> 01:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
you know unfortunately um it's not super
 
01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
easy to get a license
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
you know the reciprocal agreements that
 
01:27:52.229 --> 01:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
they do have in 21 states
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
the comment was made
 
01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
excuse me about playing well in the
 
01:27:59.430 --> 01:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
sandbox and basically i think
 
01:28:01.669 --> 01:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
that comes down to well connecticut
 
01:28:03.189 --> 01:28:03.199 align:start position:0%
won't reciprocate and take a new
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire license because connecticut
 
01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't reciprocate with anybody because
 
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
you know that's the way it is down here
 
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
so because connecticut won't reciprocate
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
with new hampshire we're not going to
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
take connecticut licenses in my opinion
 
01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:28:20.790 --> 01:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
it's low-hanging fruit this is a great
 
01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get somebody like myself
 
01:28:24.870 --> 01:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
with 40 years in the trade
 
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
never had i got a number unblemished
 
01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:28.950 align:start position:0%
never had i got a number unblemished
record

01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
record
 
01:28:31.830 --> 01:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
been very active in my trade and be able
 
01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
to come in and do my work and practice
 
01:28:36.149 --> 01:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
my craft right here in the great state
 
01:28:40.950 --> 01:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you have you applied to the board
 
01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
for a license
 
01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
i know i have not
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:28:52.870 --> 01:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for your
 
01:28:54.719 --> 01:29:01.669 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for your
testimony

01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:21.669 --> 01:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:23.110 --> 01:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
good morning committee members i'm adam
 
01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
chairman my name is stephen rancourt i'm
 
01:29:26.470 --> 01:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
a licensed electrician in the state of
 
01:29:27.750 --> 01:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
since 1986 i believe as well and i've
 
01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
been uh i'm here representing the
 
01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
electrical contractors business
 
01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
association as well
 
01:29:36.709 --> 01:29:36.719 align:start position:0%
on behalf of this bill
 
01:29:38.149 --> 01:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
first like to say that we oppose this
 
01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
bill as written while we understand the
 
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
intentions and we'll be more than
 
01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
willing to work towards a
 
01:29:44.709 --> 01:29:44.719 align:start position:0%
some sort of solution with the committee
 
01:29:47.030 --> 01:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
if need be um
 
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
we could do that but there's a lot of
 
01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:49.669 align:start position:0%
we could do that but there's a lot of
things

01:29:49.669 --> 01:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
that are wrong this bill and i respect
 
01:29:55.350 --> 01:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
uh the previous testimony from scott and
 
01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:56.229 align:start position:0%
uh the previous testimony from scott and
um

01:29:56.229 --> 01:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
he seems from what he mentioned for
 
01:29:59.590 --> 01:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
qualifications he's qualified i've been
 
01:30:01.110 --> 01:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
going to the electricians board meeting
 
01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
for almost 20 years now
 
01:30:04.390 --> 01:30:04.400 align:start position:0%
and the board
 
01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
is very
 
01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:06.390 align:start position:0%
is very
um

01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:06.400 --> 01:30:07.510 align:start position:0%
um
flexible

01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
flexible
 
01:30:09.510 --> 01:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
with people in their in their experience
 
01:30:11.910 --> 01:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
and what it has a value for and how it
 
01:30:13.350 --> 01:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
can translate to being able to get a
 
01:30:15.189 --> 01:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
reciprocal so i would i would say that
 
01:30:16.390 --> 01:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
that would be should have been the first
 
01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
step before trying to change the laws of
 
01:30:20.229 --> 01:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
our state is maybe applied to the board
 
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
and see if they denied him first before
 
01:30:25.030 --> 01:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
we change our law so i think with his
 
01:30:26.470 --> 01:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
experience he'd find he'd have a very
 
01:30:28.629 --> 01:30:28.639 align:start position:0%
favorable outcome but i can't speak for
 
01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
the board but i have been there many
 
01:30:31.110 --> 01:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
meetings and they take experience
 
01:30:33.110 --> 01:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
especially with military and other
 
01:30:34.870 --> 01:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
experience and they count that towards
 
01:30:36.709 --> 01:30:36.719 align:start position:0%
that accreditation the way this is
 
01:30:38.310 --> 01:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
written right now
 
01:30:40.629 --> 01:30:40.639 align:start position:0%
it says 8 000 hours in the
 
01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
approved program
 
01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
the approved program connecticut
 
01:30:45.350 --> 01:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
massachusetts maine vermont new
 
01:30:47.110 --> 01:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire could be all different
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
but also 8 000 hours is usually speaking
 
01:30:52.950 --> 01:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
about ojt or practical field experience
 
01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
and then there's additional hours of
 
01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
schooling right now in the state of new
 
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire there's 600 hours of schooling
 
01:30:58.870 --> 01:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
that's required
 
01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:00.719 align:start position:0%
and it defines in
 
01:31:03.590 --> 01:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
our rules in section 304.01
 
01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:04.550 align:start position:0%
our rules in section 304.01
and

01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
it defines just exactly what is required
 
01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
to be equivalent or better
 
01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
i think it's best that that stays in the
 
01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
rules giving the board some flexibility
 
01:31:17.110 --> 01:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
as representative infantile mentioned if
 
01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
you change that
 
01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
now whatever you were to put in this
 
01:31:23.189 --> 01:31:23.199 align:start position:0%
bill is the only thing they can do
 
01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
if they don't meet it
 
01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
they're not going to get it whereas the
 
01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
board now can give the has the
 
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
flexibility so i think it's important
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
that one
 
01:31:32.709 --> 01:31:32.719 align:start position:0%
if it was written in here it should be
 
01:31:34.629 --> 01:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
written at least the same as our rules
 
01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
to put it in there and that it should be
 
01:31:38.629 --> 01:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
thought about because again it takes
 
01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
away uh any flexibility for anything
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
military people anybody somebody like
 
01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:44.719 align:start position:0%
scott coming in and giving to him any
 
01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
anybody who approaches the state for
 
01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
boarding and if they're rejected they
 
01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
have the ability to appeal and ask
 
01:31:51.510 --> 01:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
especially if they've been licensed
 
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
to to take to try to take a test and
 
01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
test out
 
01:31:57.030 --> 01:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
and and if they can test and get that
 
01:31:59.189 --> 01:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
they can um they can get their license
 
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
right there
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
testing is tough i'll admit i've been in
 
01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:04.400 align:start position:0%
the business for a long time and if i
 
01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
had to try and take the test again from
 
01:32:07.830 --> 01:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
that many years ago i don't know how i
 
01:32:09.189 --> 01:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
would do as well you know you forget
 
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
more than you remember over the years
 
01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:12.400 align:start position:0%
but our experience
 
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
in working in it
 
01:32:15.510 --> 01:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
and is worth the value and the board
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
takes that into account
 
01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:18.870 align:start position:0%
takes that into account
um

01:32:18.870 --> 01:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:32:23.189 --> 01:32:23.199 align:start position:0%
if you've been
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
you come and you're looking for
 
01:32:25.590 --> 01:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
reciprocal it doesn't state are you
 
01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
reciprocating a master or journeyman
 
01:32:28.709 --> 01:32:28.719 align:start position:0%
there are different requirements in
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
different states for that using
 
01:32:31.910 --> 01:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
massachusetts for example in
 
01:32:33.669 --> 01:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
massachusetts as a master i can't pull
 
01:32:35.270 --> 01:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
permits i have to have a journeyman's
 
01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
license but in new hampshire it's
 
01:32:37.750 --> 01:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
reverse you can't pull a permit as a
 
01:32:39.270 --> 01:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
journey as a masses so
 
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
just accepting somebody in based on this
 
01:32:44.310 --> 01:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
guideline is not very good
 
01:32:45.189 --> 01:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
there's people that have been
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
grandfathered over the years and never
 
01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
did any schooling but when licensing
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
came out they they were given the
 
01:32:52.950 --> 01:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
license and approved
 
01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of change in technology has
 
01:32:57.270 --> 01:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
changed over 30 40 years and
 
01:32:58.390 --> 01:32:58.400 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to make sure that the
 
01:32:59.910 --> 01:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
people we put in the state are safe for
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
the the constituents and and protect
 
01:33:04.070 --> 01:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
them as well and not just somebody that
 
01:33:05.510 --> 01:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
got it by chance and wants to just
 
01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:07.590 align:start position:0%
got it by chance and wants to just
reciprocate

01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
reciprocate
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:33:10.149 --> 01:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
as we'll mention
 
01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
we there's 19 states i believe in nero
 
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
which is a national electrical
 
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
reciprocal association that new
 
01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire was instrumental in being a
 
01:33:19.990 --> 01:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
part of in in building to try to create
 
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
additional reciprocals and there's two
 
01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
other states that aren't part of near as
 
01:33:26.070 --> 01:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
was mentioned massachusetts in vermont
 
01:33:28.229 --> 01:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
but in maine vermont and hampshire
 
01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
reciprocate we're the only state that
 
01:33:31.590 --> 01:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
massachusetts reciprocates with right
 
01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
now and i can tell you after spending a
 
01:33:35.910 --> 01:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
year and a half to two years going to
 
01:33:38.070 --> 01:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
meetings on that board as a invited to
 
01:33:39.669 --> 01:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
their their committee to fix their
 
01:33:41.030 --> 01:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
adjust their rules
 
01:33:41.040 --> 01:33:42.070 align:start position:0%
adjust their rules
that

01:33:42.070 --> 01:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:44.790 --> 01:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
if we do not have that wording in there
 
01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
we will lose that reciprocation with
 
01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
massachusetts they've removed it from
 
01:33:49.830 --> 01:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
every other state we're the only one
 
01:33:51.990 --> 01:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
left for somebody who's on the border
 
01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
and i live in pelham new hampshire
 
01:33:55.990 --> 01:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
that's going to have a huge effect on my
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
my livelihood so i would hope the board
 
01:34:00.950 --> 01:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
considers all this um
 
01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
we spoke spoke about the nec's national
 
01:34:05.270 --> 01:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
and i understand that but we've also had
 
01:34:06.629 --> 01:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
between all the other bills out here
 
01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
senate bill 1681 everything else and
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
443 and all the local amendments that
 
01:34:11.830 --> 01:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
get changed and everything it's
 
01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
important for them to know what's going
 
01:34:14.310 --> 01:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
on in the state before we just hand them
 
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
a license
 
01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
in our testing
 
01:34:20.229 --> 01:34:20.239 align:start position:0%
you have to know about rsa319c and the
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
rules 100. there's some questions on it
 
01:34:23.990 --> 01:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
about that if you take the test so just
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
to make sure before you start in our
 
01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
state there are different rules than
 
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
there are in connecticut or rhode island
 
01:34:30.470 --> 01:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
or massachusetts
 
01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
so just to say we just hand them to them
 
01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
because they've been eight thousand
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
hours in an approved program that's not
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
really defined well in this wording i
 
01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
don't think it's the best
 
01:34:40.870 --> 01:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
is the best uh approach
 
01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:42.149 align:start position:0%
is the best uh approach
um

01:34:42.149 --> 01:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
there are some states that refuse to
 
01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
reciprocate with us as well we've tried
 
01:34:47.030 --> 01:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
to reach out to him many times and do
 
01:34:48.310 --> 01:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
that and
 
01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
but if you look and i did some research
 
01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
and connecticut has the exact same law
 
01:34:55.830 --> 01:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
that you have to be equivalent to
 
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
or above
 
01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
what their standard is and there in the
 
01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:00.870 align:start position:0%
what their standard is and there in the
uh

01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
connecticut i would say 20-33a
 
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
it states that
 
01:35:07.990 --> 01:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
the uh has to be substantially similar
 
01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
to or higher than those of this state
 
01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
so he's coming from a state that has the
 
01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
same laws that we have but we want to
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
change our laws
 
01:35:18.149 --> 01:35:18.159 align:start position:0%
so i just think that we should one that
 
01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
should be approached to the board first
 
01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
and they should uh
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
scott would have a better chance
 
01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
probably trying to get that taken care
 
01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:24.229 align:start position:0%
probably trying to get that taken care
of

01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:35:27.030 --> 01:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
through the board um
 
01:35:28.629 --> 01:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:35:30.790 --> 01:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
therefore local
 
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
not every state is on the same code we
 
01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
know that from some of the other bills
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
that have gone through so i do not know
 
01:35:39.189 --> 01:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
what connected it's on um i do know what
 
01:35:41.109 --> 01:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's on working towards
 
01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
getting in the next few months here so
 
01:35:44.790 --> 01:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of variables and i think
 
01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
that those need to be taken into account
 
01:35:48.629 --> 01:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
i'll be glad to answer any questions
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative schmidt has a
 
01:35:50.080 --> 01:35:51.430 align:start position:0%
thank you representative schmidt has a
question

01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:35:52.950 --> 01:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned and we all know uh that
 
01:35:57.510 --> 01:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
you're on the ecba
 
01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
um and do know whether they are taking a
 
01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
position or
 
01:36:03.669 --> 01:36:03.679 align:start position:0%
whether it's
 
01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:06.159 align:start position:0%
a general sentiment of your colleagues
 
01:36:08.470 --> 01:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
that you've spoken with in opposition to
 
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
this amendment i've spoken to the
 
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
executive board and our governmental
 
01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
affairs committee not the whole
 
01:36:14.550 --> 01:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
membership yet but we're not in favor of
 
01:36:17.109 --> 01:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
it as it's written because of the
 
01:36:18.310 --> 01:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
rules that are already in place that we
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:27.510 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
fontenot

01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:30.149 --> 01:36:30.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um and thank you
 
01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:36:34.390 --> 01:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
i'll clarify i too i'm a master
 
01:36:35.590 --> 01:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
electrician in new hampshire and i've
 
01:36:39.030 --> 01:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
had my license for about 30 years but um
 
01:36:40.950 --> 01:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
in regards to this bill
 
01:36:42.950 --> 01:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
i usually like to hope that when a bill
 
01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
comes forward it's to
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
correct a problem
 
01:36:49.030 --> 01:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
and so my question is is there a problem
 
01:36:50.950 --> 01:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
that we need to correct with this bill
 
01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
do you know how many
 
01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
applicants are denied
 
01:36:58.310 --> 01:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
licenses in new hampshire
 
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
yearly or
 
01:37:02.229 --> 01:37:02.239 align:start position:0%
i do not know the number i know that
 
01:37:04.229 --> 01:37:04.239 align:start position:0%
it's very few
 
01:37:06.709 --> 01:37:06.719 align:start position:0%
i know that this isn't really fixing a
 
01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
problem again and you know with all due
 
01:37:10.149 --> 01:37:10.159 align:start position:0%
respect if you haven't gone to the board
 
01:37:12.070 --> 01:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
and been denied then
 
01:37:13.750 --> 01:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
they may have given him his license i
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
don't know that
 
01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:15.990 align:start position:0%
don't know that
um

01:37:15.990 --> 01:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:18.390 --> 01:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
we are one of the most i believe
 
01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
um forefront
 
01:37:23.109 --> 01:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
uh professions with reciprocal compared
 
01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
to all the other people even in oplc and
 
01:37:26.550 --> 01:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
stuff and everything and we've always
 
01:37:28.149 --> 01:37:28.159 align:start position:0%
been open to it we started the nearest
 
01:37:29.350 --> 01:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
so i mean
 
01:37:30.709 --> 01:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
we're not against people coming to
 
01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
licensing but we obviously want to
 
01:37:33.350 --> 01:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
protect the state and constituents and
 
01:37:34.629 --> 01:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
make sure that that person knows they're
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
doing it and it appears that scott does
 
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
have the qualifications but you still
 
01:37:40.390 --> 01:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
have to go through the process right i
 
01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:41.590 align:start position:0%
have to go through the process right i
mean

01:37:41.590 --> 01:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:37:43.109 --> 01:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
you can't just walk in and say i want a
 
01:37:44.550 --> 01:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
license you don't walk in and say i want
 
01:37:46.390 --> 01:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
to take my driver's license and give it
 
01:37:47.669 --> 01:37:47.679 align:start position:0%
to the new hampshire dmv and they give
 
01:37:49.109 --> 01:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
you another one this paperwork to fill
 
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
out and the stuff you have to go through
 
01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:51.109 align:start position:0%
out and the stuff you have to go through
and

01:37:51.109 --> 01:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:52.629 --> 01:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
i think we should try that following
 
01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:58.229 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:37:58.229 --> 01:37:58.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:37:59.109 --> 01:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:38:01.030 --> 01:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
madam chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
question uh following on with
 
01:38:06.149 --> 01:38:06.159 align:start position:0%
representative fontenot's question
 
01:38:09.030 --> 01:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
um is this amendment fixable in in
 
01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
language or would you just soon see the
 
01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
amendment die because you're doing the
 
01:38:17.350 --> 01:38:17.360 align:start position:0%
same thing by rule with more flexibility
 
01:38:19.109 --> 01:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
i would prefer to see it
 
01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
i tl with that because the flexibility
 
01:38:23.669 --> 01:38:23.679 align:start position:0%
is in the rules if we put in the law as
 
01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
you know that's it they have to have
 
01:38:28.950 --> 01:38:28.960 align:start position:0%
whatever hours or or ojt or schooling we
 
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
require it's going to be clearly defined
 
01:38:33.669 --> 01:38:33.679 align:start position:0%
and the board has no flexibility so
 
01:38:36.070 --> 01:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
in a case like myself and possibly like
 
01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
scott when i went and got my license
 
01:38:39.669 --> 01:38:39.679 align:start position:0%
there was only two years of schooling
 
01:38:41.189 --> 01:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
300 hours
 
01:38:43.030 --> 01:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
i technically wouldn't qualify to go to
 
01:38:44.709 --> 01:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
connecticut and get their license
 
01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
because they require 600 hours i've been
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
an electrician for 30-something years
 
01:38:51.990 --> 01:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
i'm in the same position
 
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
it's part of this evolution and change
 
01:38:57.109 --> 01:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
in technology i mean you gotta
 
01:39:00.390 --> 01:39:00.400 align:start position:0%
have a process in some way to protect
 
01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:05.030 align:start position:0%
have a process in some way to protect
so

01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:07.590 --> 01:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
thank you the other questions
 
01:39:09.910 --> 01:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
represent bailly i perhaps missed
 
01:39:16.310 --> 01:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:18.159 align:start position:0%
probably a person who testified who at
 
01:39:19.990 --> 01:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
assets are being brought forward
 
01:39:27.590 --> 01:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:30.229 --> 01:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
do we have any other questions
 
01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you sir
 
01:39:38.629 --> 01:39:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:41.189 --> 01:39:41.199 align:start position:0%
i'd call you dean the greek but uh
 
01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:55.030 --> 01:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair mr chairman and
 
01:39:57.270 --> 01:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
before i begin
 
01:39:57.280 --> 01:39:57.990 align:start position:0%
before i begin
on

01:39:57.990 --> 01:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:39:59.590 --> 01:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
non-german amendment i'd like to thank
 
01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
in regards to house bill 1681 and
 
01:40:08.709 --> 01:40:08.719 align:start position:0%
adoption of the codes because it's very
 
01:40:10.390 --> 01:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
important that the codes move forward
 
01:40:12.070 --> 01:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
and i know this committee has put a lot
 
01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
of work into it and it's nice to see
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
that the codes are moving forward so
 
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
again i really would like to thank the
 
01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:21.430 align:start position:0%
again i really would like to thank the
committee

01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:40:22.870 --> 01:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
a little bit on my background i've been
 
01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
a licensed electrician in new hampshire
 
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
since 1976
 
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
and i was in business for 25 years and
 
01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
in 2001 i went to work for the state of
 
01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
new hampshire as a state electrical
 
01:40:35.830 --> 01:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
inspector and i covered the southern
 
01:40:38.390 --> 01:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
area and then in 2011
 
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
i was the chief electrical inspector
 
01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
until my retirement in um
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
january 1st of 2020
 
01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
and as the chief electrical inspector
 
01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
i worked with the board on many
 
01:40:50.639 --> 01:40:51.910 align:start position:0%
i worked with the board on many
occasions

01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
occasions
 
01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:53.270 align:start position:0%
occasions
and

01:40:53.270 --> 01:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
i got to say our board as was mentioned
 
01:40:58.790 --> 01:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
by earlier people in testimony that the
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
board is very open
 
01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
the board
 
01:41:06.149 --> 01:41:06.159 align:start position:0%
has no intent on making
 
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:41:10.870 --> 01:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
closed for licensed electricians
 
01:41:12.790 --> 01:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
i've seen many cases
 
01:41:15.270 --> 01:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
where the current statute the way it's
 
01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
written gives the board discretion
 
01:41:21.270 --> 01:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
in the rules it does talk about the 600
 
01:41:23.270 --> 01:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
hours of continuing ed
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
continuing education by an approved
 
01:41:26.159 --> 01:41:27.510 align:start position:0%
continuing education by an approved
provider

01:41:27.510 --> 01:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
provider
 
01:41:31.430 --> 01:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
the 8 000 hours is considered ojt
 
01:41:33.430 --> 01:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
01:41:35.590 --> 01:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
as mentioned here it's not an
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship program it's 8 000 hours
 
01:41:40.390 --> 01:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
of working in the field
 
01:41:43.270 --> 01:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
the only people that have a specific
 
01:41:45.030 --> 01:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
apprentice program
 
01:41:46.390 --> 01:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
and it's actually more than eight
 
01:41:48.310 --> 01:41:48.320 align:start position:0%
thousand i believe it's ten thousand is
 
01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
the union
 
01:41:51.830 --> 01:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
they have an apprenticeship program it's
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
a five-year program it's an excellent
 
01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:55.189 align:start position:0%
a five-year program it's an excellent
program

01:41:55.189 --> 01:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:41:55.199 --> 01:41:56.550 align:start position:0%
program
but

01:41:56.550 --> 01:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:41:59.270 --> 01:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
the general eight thousand hours is what
 
01:42:02.709 --> 01:42:02.719 align:start position:0%
we call ojt on the job training
 
01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
so it's not a specific program
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
in my opinion once you tie
 
01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:09.990 align:start position:0%
in my opinion once you tie
this

01:42:09.990 --> 01:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:11.109 align:start position:0%
this
statue

01:42:11.109 --> 01:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
statue
 
01:42:13.990 --> 01:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
to the 8 000 hours and even if you added
 
01:42:16.390 --> 01:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
in the 600 hours of schooling
 
01:42:18.790 --> 01:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
you've now tied the board's hand
 
01:42:20.470 --> 01:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
i've seen cases
 
01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
where the board has approved people
 
01:42:25.270 --> 01:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
either to get a license or to sit and
 
01:42:27.030 --> 01:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
take the exam
 
01:42:29.350 --> 01:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
as the chief electrical inspector for
 
01:42:30.629 --> 01:42:30.639 align:start position:0%
nine years
 
01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
i had been contacted over time by many
 
01:42:35.109 --> 01:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
people seeking to get a license in new
 
01:42:37.590 --> 01:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire wanting to move here or work
 
01:42:40.149 --> 01:42:40.159 align:start position:0%
here for whatever the reason might be
 
01:42:43.109 --> 01:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
and my advice to them was you go to the
 
01:42:43.119 --> 01:42:44.070 align:start position:0%
and my advice to them was you go to the
board

01:42:44.070 --> 01:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:42:46.629 --> 01:42:46.639 align:start position:0%
you give them all the documentation the
 
01:42:48.790 --> 01:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
board is very open
 
01:42:50.390 --> 01:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
if you go to the board and you just say
 
01:42:53.030 --> 01:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
well i did this i did this
 
01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
obviously they're not going to
 
01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639 align:start position:0%
you know accept what you're trying to do
 
01:42:58.709 --> 01:42:58.719 align:start position:0%
but if you go there with documentation
 
01:43:01.189 --> 01:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
okay here's what i had for education
 
01:43:03.189 --> 01:43:03.199 align:start position:0%
here's my working hours
 
01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
they've been very open
 
01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:05.990 align:start position:0%
they've been very open
and

01:43:05.990 --> 01:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:43:07.910 --> 01:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
i can actually say i don't recall them
 
01:43:10.510 --> 01:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
ever refusing anyone that had
 
01:43:13.590 --> 01:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
qualifications either equal to
 
01:43:14.790 --> 01:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
or above
 
01:43:16.709 --> 01:43:16.719 align:start position:0%
what we require
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
it's when somebody goes before the board
 
01:43:21.030 --> 01:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
and they don't provide the backup of the
 
01:43:23.350 --> 01:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
documentation the board will say well
 
01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
you need to do this then once you you
 
01:43:28.629 --> 01:43:28.639 align:start position:0%
know complete this portion come back to
 
01:43:28.639 --> 01:43:29.669 align:start position:0%
know complete this portion come back to
us

01:43:29.669 --> 01:43:29.679 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:43:31.750 --> 01:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
and we'll reconsider
 
01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:34.719 align:start position:0%
and i've served in the um well actually
 
01:43:37.350 --> 01:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
19 years working for the state
 
01:43:39.510 --> 01:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
i've seen the board
 
01:43:41.510 --> 01:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
do this a number of times with many
 
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
people where they they're always willing
 
01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
to help them
 
01:43:47.189 --> 01:43:47.199 align:start position:0%
get their license
 
01:43:47.199 --> 01:43:48.310 align:start position:0%
get their license
so

01:43:48.310 --> 01:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:43:51.270 --> 01:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
that's the one of the important things
 
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
that the board has done and i can also
 
01:43:54.310 --> 01:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
tell you
 
01:43:56.229 --> 01:43:56.239 align:start position:0%
at the request of the board as the chief
 
01:43:56.239 --> 01:43:57.669 align:start position:0%
at the request of the board as the chief
inspector

01:43:57.669 --> 01:43:57.679 align:start position:0%
inspector
 
01:43:59.910 --> 01:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
i submitted a letter to the state of
 
01:44:02.709 --> 01:44:02.719 align:start position:0%
connecticut requesting consideration for
 
01:44:02.719 --> 01:44:04.870 align:start position:0%
connecticut requesting consideration for
reciprocation

01:44:04.870 --> 01:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
reciprocation
 
01:44:06.470 --> 01:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
never got a response
 
01:44:08.229 --> 01:44:08.239 align:start position:0%
i also submitted to the state of rhode
 
01:44:11.669 --> 01:44:11.679 align:start position:0%
island never got a response
 
01:44:11.679 --> 01:44:12.470 align:start position:0%
island never got a response
so

01:44:12.470 --> 01:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:14.870 --> 01:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
obviously there are states that out that
 
01:44:16.229 --> 01:44:16.239 align:start position:0%
are out there that don't want to
 
01:44:18.550 --> 01:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
reciprocate even if they have as was
 
01:44:20.709 --> 01:44:20.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier um
 
01:44:22.390 --> 01:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
by mr rancourt
 
01:44:24.229 --> 01:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
they have similar requirements in their
 
01:44:26.310 --> 01:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
statute as we do but they don't want to
 
01:44:30.390 --> 01:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:32.550 --> 01:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
and if anybody has any questions
 
01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:34.320 align:start position:0%

01:45:01.990 --> 01:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you is there anyone else
 
01:45:06.390 --> 01:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:45:10.950 --> 01:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
not seeing none i'll close the hearing
 
01:45:14.229 --> 01:45:14.239 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 224 and its non-germain
 
01:45:16.950 --> 01:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
amendment and open the hearing on senate
 
01:45:28.470 --> 01:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
represent a merchant you'll have to
 
01:45:32.470 --> 01:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
introduce it because there's no senators
 
01:45:40.149 --> 01:45:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:45.510 --> 01:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
so i bring before the committee
 
01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
senate bill 450.
 
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
senate bill 450 is based upon
 
01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
discussions we've had during the last
 
01:45:54.310 --> 01:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
year with the board and also during some
 
01:45:55.910 --> 01:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
of the working sessions and feedback we
 
01:45:55.920 --> 01:45:57.270 align:start position:0%
of the working sessions and feedback we
received

01:45:57.270 --> 01:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
received
 
01:45:59.910 --> 01:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
and fundamentally it's to help correct
 
01:46:01.669 --> 01:46:01.679 align:start position:0%
some of the language in the bill to make
 
01:46:04.390 --> 01:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
simplified if you will to make it
 
01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:08.229 align:start position:0%
simplified if you will to make it
clarify

01:46:08.229 --> 01:46:08.239 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
different parts of it
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
and if you would madam chair i can walk
 
01:46:14.229 --> 01:46:14.239 align:start position:0%
the committee through the changes the
 
01:46:14.239 --> 01:46:15.750 align:start position:0%
the committee through the changes the
recommendations

01:46:15.750 --> 01:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:46:17.590 --> 01:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
but before i do that one of the things i
 
01:46:20.229 --> 01:46:20.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to be clear on is the role of the
 
01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
this seems to be some confusion the last
 
01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
time i was here
 
01:46:26.470 --> 01:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
i'd like to
 
01:46:29.430 --> 01:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
clarify some of that
 
01:46:31.189 --> 01:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs are an extremely
 
01:46:33.910 --> 01:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
expensive proposition for the taxpayers
 
01:46:36.070 --> 01:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
of this country the state
 
01:46:39.430 --> 01:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
and as governmental entities
 
01:46:42.310 --> 01:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
both at state level municipalities the
 
01:46:42.320 --> 01:46:43.510 align:start position:0%
both at state level municipalities the
county

01:46:43.510 --> 01:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
county
 
01:46:45.510 --> 01:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
01:46:47.430 --> 01:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
we need to be good stewards of taxpayers
 
01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:48.950 align:start position:0%
we need to be good stewards of taxpayers
dollars

01:46:48.950 --> 01:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:46:50.470 --> 01:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
and we have to be sure that we're
 
01:46:52.709 --> 01:46:52.719 align:start position:0%
spending those dollars wisely
 
01:46:54.790 --> 01:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
that's why we want to be sure that that
 
01:46:57.189 --> 01:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
point in time is we don't have taxpayers
 
01:47:00.229 --> 01:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
dollars being spent unwisely
 
01:47:03.510 --> 01:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the whole thing about
 
01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
pricing of prescription drugs it's not
 
01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
very transparent matter of fact it's
 
01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
very opaque
 
01:47:12.550 --> 01:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned before
 
01:47:16.709 --> 01:47:16.719 align:start position:0%
the berkeley group and the 2020 report
 
01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
share that manufacturers which everyone
 
01:47:20.790 --> 01:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
wants to point a finger to
 
01:47:22.470 --> 01:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
as a scapegoat
 
01:47:24.629 --> 01:47:24.639 align:start position:0%
received less than 50 percent
 
01:47:26.629 --> 01:47:26.639 align:start position:0%
of the gross reimbursement
 
01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
of what's paid in the marketplace
 
01:47:34.070 --> 01:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
in 2013 that was 67
 
01:47:36.390 --> 01:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
so if the prescription drugs and the
 
01:47:37.990 --> 01:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
price of certain things the revenue
 
01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:38.950 align:start position:0%
price of certain things the revenue
stream

01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
stream
 
01:47:40.709 --> 01:47:40.719 align:start position:0%
going back to the manufacturers is now
 
01:47:42.629 --> 01:47:42.639 align:start position:0%
less than 50 percent
 
01:47:45.430 --> 01:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
where it was 67 percent
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
the question is where's the money going
 
01:47:50.550 --> 01:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
so the task before the prescription drug
 
01:47:53.350 --> 01:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
affordability board is fundamentally to
 
01:47:55.990 --> 01:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
try to bring greater transparency
 
01:47:58.070 --> 01:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
to the marketplace
 
01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
for governmental entities to help ensure
 
01:48:02.229 --> 01:48:02.239 align:start position:0%
that they're actually
 
01:48:05.430 --> 01:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
paying the prices they should pay
 
01:48:09.030 --> 01:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
but back to the bill itself on 450 and i
 
01:48:11.109 --> 01:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
do have some testimonial
 
01:48:13.590 --> 01:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
in respect to the chair person
 
01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
i should probably back up
 
01:48:18.149 --> 01:48:18.159 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is gary merchant
 
01:48:19.830 --> 01:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
representative merchant for sullivan
 
01:48:21.510 --> 01:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
county district 4
 
01:48:23.189 --> 01:48:23.199 align:start position:0%
which is in
 
01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
ward 2 claremont new hampshire
 
01:48:27.270 --> 01:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
and also for the record i am the
 
01:48:28.950 --> 01:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
chairman of the prescription drug
 
01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:35.430 --> 01:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
and madam chair do you want me to
 
01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
distribute this at the end of my
 
01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:38.870 align:start position:0%
distribute this at the end of my
talk

01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
talk
 
01:48:40.950 --> 01:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
i already have
 
01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:42.870 align:start position:0%
i already have
okay

01:48:42.870 --> 01:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:48:44.709 --> 01:48:44.719 align:start position:0%
so if we walk through what we're trying
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
to do with house senate bill 450
 
01:48:51.750 --> 01:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
on behalf of senator sherman
 
01:48:53.590 --> 01:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
there's a confusion if you look at page
 
01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:54.629 align:start position:0%
there's a confusion if you look at page
one

01:48:54.629 --> 01:48:54.639 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:48:57.750 --> 01:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
lines four five and six
 
01:49:00.390 --> 01:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
what came to our attention was that
 
01:49:02.070 --> 01:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
there are entities that work with a
 
01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturer that don't actually sell
 
01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
the product but they're considered by
 
01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
the fda to be quote a relabeler or
 
01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:08.629 align:start position:0%
the fda to be quote a relabeler or
repackager

01:49:08.629 --> 01:49:08.639 align:start position:0%
repackager
 
01:49:10.470 --> 01:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
for example
 
01:49:13.109 --> 01:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
when a company
 
01:49:14.790 --> 01:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
makes the product they could make
 
01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
something with 55 gallon drum of tablets
 
01:49:18.390 --> 01:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
in it
 
01:49:20.470 --> 01:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
so they subcontract it to somebody to
 
01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
repackage that drug into smaller
 
01:49:25.510 --> 01:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
containers that's a repackager
 
01:49:27.430 --> 01:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
however sometimes every packager may
 
01:49:29.910 --> 01:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
also sell the drug themselves
 
01:49:31.830 --> 01:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
so there's confusion between the
 
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
language and the statute to who's
 
01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
actually the manufacturer and what we
 
01:49:36.229 --> 01:49:36.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to do at that point in time is
 
01:49:38.470 --> 01:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
saying it's the entity that controls
 
01:49:39.910 --> 01:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
assess the price
 
01:49:42.390 --> 01:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
not somebody who acts as a subcontractor
 
01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
to the actual manufacturer that sells
 
01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
if you go back and look at the pricing
 
01:49:51.119 --> 01:49:52.470 align:start position:0%
if you go back and look at the pricing
unit

01:49:52.470 --> 01:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
unit
 
01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
which is on line eight
 
01:49:57.510 --> 01:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
in a pharmacy if you get a bottle
 
01:49:59.350 --> 01:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
of a thousand tablets
 
01:50:01.990 --> 01:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
the smallest dispensable unit
 
01:50:05.990 --> 01:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
so it's very difficult to standardize
 
01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
across pricing
 
01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
to sit there and say is it a tablet out
 
01:50:14.390 --> 01:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
of a bottle of a thousand is a tablet of
 
01:50:16.229 --> 01:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
a bottle of a hundred
 
01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
i could have a jar of one pound of cream
 
01:50:21.030 --> 01:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
and dispense an ounce out of it
 
01:50:23.669 --> 01:50:23.679 align:start position:0%
so to order to make that more simplified
 
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
and be consistent this actually came
 
01:50:27.189 --> 01:50:27.199 align:start position:0%
from the manufacturing community
 
01:50:28.870 --> 01:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
is their recommendation was to go buy
 
01:50:31.910 --> 01:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
the smallest available package unit
 
01:50:34.790 --> 01:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
that you can purchase in a pharmacy
 
01:50:37.109 --> 01:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
would it be a bottle of 30 100 1 000
 
01:50:38.470 --> 01:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
whatever it's going to be whether it
 
01:50:40.229 --> 01:50:40.239 align:start position:0%
comes in a tube with 30 grams it comes
 
01:50:42.390 --> 01:50:42.400 align:start position:0%
in a pound jar but it's the smallest
 
01:50:44.790 --> 01:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
available package in the marketplace
 
01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
that a pharmacist can buy
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
that standardizes that down to a certain
 
01:50:50.830 --> 01:50:50.840 align:start position:0%
point it clarifies
 
01:50:53.669 --> 01:50:53.679 align:start position:0%
it we also had confusion if you go back
 
01:50:57.030 --> 01:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
and look at line 16.
 
01:50:58.629 --> 01:50:58.639 align:start position:0%
there's confusion thinking that you have
 
01:51:00.550 --> 01:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
to be a legislator to be on the
 
01:51:02.470 --> 01:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
committee on the board
 
01:51:04.870 --> 01:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
and that is not the case at all
 
01:51:08.229 --> 01:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
so all this does is really clearly state
 
01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
that you do not have to be a legislator
 
01:51:11.189 --> 01:51:11.199 align:start position:0%
to be on
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
the board in fact
 
01:51:15.030 --> 01:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of people we want on the board who
 
01:51:17.189 --> 01:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
have the expertise and the knowledge
 
01:51:19.350 --> 01:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
and the clinical skills and so forth
 
01:51:21.109 --> 01:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
probably don't reside in the house or
 
01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
the senate so we want to ensure we have
 
01:51:24.390 --> 01:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
as a broader
 
01:51:26.629 --> 01:51:26.639 align:start position:0%
population to choose from to be on the
 
01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:34.870 --> 01:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:36.709 align:start position:0%
 
18

01:51:36.709 --> 01:51:36.719 align:start position:0%
18
 
01:51:38.870 --> 01:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
down through 30 you'll see we've changed
 
01:51:41.669 --> 01:51:41.679 align:start position:0%
the alternates from one to two the
 
01:51:43.589 --> 01:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
rationale to that is
 
01:51:45.270 --> 01:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of legislators on the
 
01:51:45.280 --> 01:51:46.229 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of legislators on the
board

01:51:46.229 --> 01:51:46.239 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
of the eight six of us sit on the board
 
01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
so currently is causing a problem
 
01:51:54.390 --> 01:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
between the calendars on the legislative
 
01:51:56.629 --> 01:51:56.639 align:start position:0%
side and the board side so we've had
 
01:51:58.149 --> 01:51:58.159 align:start position:0%
times where it's been difficult for us
 
01:52:00.229 --> 01:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
to get a physical quorum together so
 
01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:01.679 align:start position:0%
we're trying to increase the number of
 
01:52:06.790 --> 01:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:09.669 --> 01:52:09.679 align:start position:0%
if you look on page two
 
01:52:10.870 --> 01:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
again the same thing is you want to
 
01:52:12.870 --> 01:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
ensure that the board has the authority
 
01:52:15.189 --> 01:52:15.199 align:start position:0%
to hire staff
 
01:52:16.950 --> 01:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
and we talked about the uniqueness of
 
01:52:19.109 --> 01:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
the person we're looking for
 
01:52:21.510 --> 01:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
is what i call a unicorn it's not
 
01:52:23.109 --> 01:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
somebody out there that's easily
 
01:52:24.870 --> 01:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
available in the marketplace
 
01:52:27.109 --> 01:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
so to increase the opportunity for us to
 
01:52:29.589 --> 01:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
find the talent that we need
 
01:52:31.350 --> 01:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
we wanted to move it into a quote
 
01:52:33.189 --> 01:52:33.199 align:start position:0%
unclassified position
 
01:52:36.870 --> 01:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
to allow the people and the personnel
 
01:52:38.070 --> 01:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
to make
 
01:52:39.510 --> 01:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
the job great according to what the
 
01:52:42.310 --> 01:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
marketplace demands
 
01:52:44.229 --> 01:52:44.239 align:start position:0%
the executive director also to be sure
 
01:52:46.709 --> 01:52:46.719 align:start position:0%
it's somebody that the board
 
01:52:48.709 --> 01:52:48.719 align:start position:0%
has the authority to hire to review
 
01:52:50.070 --> 01:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
their credentials
 
01:52:51.350 --> 01:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
because it's really the board that's
 
01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:52.709 align:start position:0%
because it's really the board that's
driving

01:52:52.709 --> 01:52:52.719 align:start position:0%
driving
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
and we want to be sure the board's the
 
01:52:55.990 --> 01:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
one ultimately just making that decision
 
01:52:58.229 --> 01:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
about who are they going to hire if
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
you're the one hiring that person should
 
01:53:01.589 --> 01:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
be the one responsible for the
 
01:53:03.189 --> 01:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
expectations and setting those
 
01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
expectations at the same time
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
if things aren't working out the way you
 
01:53:08.470 --> 01:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
would they should
 
01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
have the ability to alleviate the
 
01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:12.470 align:start position:0%
have the ability to alleviate the
problem

01:53:12.470 --> 01:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
on line 17 on page two we ran into an
 
01:53:17.510 --> 01:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
issue with some of the
 
01:53:20.709 --> 01:53:20.719 align:start position:0%
pbms some pbms
 
01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
do work on behalf of third parties
 
01:53:25.669 --> 01:53:25.679 align:start position:0%
large insurance companies they don't per
 
01:53:28.070 --> 01:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
se pay take the financial responsibility
 
01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
but they pay the claims
 
01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
so to eliminate the issue of confusion
 
01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:33.270 align:start position:0%
so to eliminate the issue of confusion
between

01:53:33.270 --> 01:53:33.280 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:53:35.350 --> 01:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
am i in am i out we basically at that
 
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
point time standardized it and said if
 
01:53:39.189 --> 01:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
you're paying claims as well as taking
 
01:53:41.589 --> 01:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
financial responsibility you're in
 
01:53:44.550 --> 01:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
you're considered a pbm
 
01:53:46.950 --> 01:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
we also heard from the this committee
 
01:53:49.990 --> 01:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
about the runner-in run away train
 
01:53:52.629 --> 01:53:52.639 align:start position:0%
that the board could artificially
 
01:53:55.510 --> 01:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
raise as much money as it wants
 
01:53:56.629 --> 01:53:56.639 align:start position:0%
so to
 
01:53:58.709 --> 01:53:58.719 align:start position:0%
approach that problem if you look at
 
01:54:00.550 --> 01:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
line 23
 
01:54:03.030 --> 01:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
and 24 like other boards we're capped at
 
01:54:04.790 --> 01:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
125 percent
 
01:54:06.390 --> 01:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
of what's there
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
to be sure that the board doesn't have
 
01:54:11.589 --> 01:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
unfettered access to income beyond what
 
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
its needs are
 
01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
if you look at line 27 through 28
 
01:54:19.510 --> 01:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
again the entity and assessment fee they
 
01:54:21.189 --> 01:54:21.199 align:start position:0%
can appeal it that was a question came
 
01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
up before is there a way for them to
 
01:54:25.109 --> 01:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
appeal the assessment fee that was
 
01:54:27.669 --> 01:54:27.679 align:start position:0%
addressed in here as well
 
01:54:30.070 --> 01:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
and line 31 just talks about the appeals
 
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
process we're working on the rules
 
01:54:33.990 --> 01:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
to put that behind it so that's where
 
01:54:35.990 --> 01:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's at
 
01:54:38.550 --> 01:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
and the last one is also
 
01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
the criminal penalty to be sure we talk
 
01:54:42.629 --> 01:54:42.639 align:start position:0%
about protecting confidentiality because
 
01:54:45.109 --> 01:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of this is very confidential
 
01:54:47.109 --> 01:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
is that there's a criminal penalty if
 
01:54:48.830 --> 01:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
you are
 
01:54:51.510 --> 01:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
willingly providing data that's
 
01:54:54.310 --> 01:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
confidential to a third party
 
01:54:55.990 --> 01:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
then you're going to pay the price
 
01:54:57.830 --> 01:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
there's a criminal penalty involved with
 
01:55:00.070 --> 01:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
it which is on line eight
 
01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
and if you look at lines
 
01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:03.430 align:start position:0%
and if you look at lines
14

01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
14
 
01:55:05.669 --> 01:55:05.679 align:start position:0%
is creating a non-lapsing fund so the
 
01:55:07.910 --> 01:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
board at that point in time will have
 
01:55:09.750 --> 01:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
the ability to collect this the
 
01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
assessment fees and disperse them as
 
01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
well to control
 
01:55:15.189 --> 01:55:15.199 align:start position:0%
or to fund the board's operations so
 
01:55:16.709 --> 01:55:16.719 align:start position:0%
that's what senate bill
 
01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
450 is all about
 
01:55:20.310 --> 01:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
it's trying to take what we learned over
 
01:55:21.589 --> 01:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
the last year
 
01:55:23.589 --> 01:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
take the comments you folks made to this
 
01:55:25.669 --> 01:55:25.679 align:start position:0%
committee to to myself and others
 
01:55:28.229 --> 01:55:28.239 align:start position:0%
including senator sherman and try to
 
01:55:29.430 --> 01:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
address some of the issues that you
 
01:55:32.310 --> 01:55:32.320 align:start position:0%
raised during that hearing all day
 
01:55:32.320 --> 01:55:34.950 align:start position:0%
raised during that hearing all day
questions

01:55:34.950 --> 01:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:36.470 --> 01:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any questions from
 
01:55:38.229 --> 01:55:38.239 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
representing judy
 
01:55:43.270 --> 01:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
good morning representative
 
01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you
 
01:55:47.750 --> 01:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
can answer me that question
 
01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:48.790 align:start position:0%
can answer me that question
um

01:55:48.790 --> 01:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:51.910 --> 01:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
why someone have to be legislator
 
01:55:55.750 --> 01:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
to to become in the community
 
01:55:57.589 --> 01:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
you don't have to be we're trying to
 
01:55:59.430 --> 01:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
clarify and be clear that you don't have
 
01:56:00.629 --> 01:56:00.639 align:start position:0%
we don't have to
 
01:56:02.790 --> 01:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
senator jude yes because there's been
 
01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:03.990 align:start position:0%
senator jude yes because there's been
confusion

01:56:03.990 --> 01:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:05.750 align:start position:0%
confusion
that

01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:56:07.430 --> 01:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
you had to be a legislator to be on the
 
01:56:09.589 --> 01:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
committee it wasn't required but we
 
01:56:11.750 --> 01:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to be clear in those statute that
 
01:56:12.830 --> 01:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
that's not a
 
01:56:14.709 --> 01:56:14.719 align:start position:0%
requirement okay
 
01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
01:56:20.229 --> 01:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:56:24.790 --> 01:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
good morning gary uh so honey uh
 
01:56:26.790 --> 01:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
tell me has the board taken a position
 
01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
on the amendment you're offering today
 
01:56:32.550 --> 01:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
no the board has not taken an amendment
 
01:56:33.990 --> 01:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
yeah well
 
01:56:35.510 --> 01:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
we did review it senator sherman did
 
01:56:37.030 --> 01:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
review with the board but no we did not
 
01:56:39.669 --> 01:56:39.679 align:start position:0%
take a a position on the on the bill per
 
01:56:42.149 --> 01:56:42.159 align:start position:0%
se but he did address the board and we
 
01:56:44.149 --> 01:56:44.159 align:start position:0%
supported what he wanted to include in
 
01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
01:56:47.589 --> 01:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
in his bill but to ask a question did we
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
specifically vote on it that i do not
 
01:56:50.950 --> 01:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
believe we did
 
01:56:54.310 --> 01:56:54.320 align:start position:0%
but we're all behind it follow up
 
01:56:56.950 --> 01:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
so not a formal vote but are you telling
 
01:56:58.870 --> 01:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
me that essentially the board is in
 
01:57:01.270 --> 01:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
favor of these changes
 
01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
yes the board is in favor of the changes
 
01:57:05.589 --> 01:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:57:07.109 --> 01:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:57:11.270 --> 01:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
i have one how does a minimum fee
 
01:57:14.870 --> 01:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
correlate with not exceeding 25 125
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
percent of your expenses
 
01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:18.790 align:start position:0%
percent of your expenses
basically

01:57:18.790 --> 01:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:57:20.709 --> 01:57:20.719 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure i follow you um miss
 
01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:27.910 --> 01:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
if you look at it on
 
01:57:30.310 --> 01:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
line 16 page 2 it says annual
 
01:57:34.070 --> 01:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
assessments of not less than 500
 
01:57:37.030 --> 01:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:38.870 --> 01:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
line 23
 
01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
the aggregate level of assessment shall
 
01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
be amount to meet the board's
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
expenditures provided such amount may
 
01:57:48.790 --> 01:57:48.800 align:start position:0%
not exceed 125 of annual costs
 
01:57:50.709 --> 01:57:50.719 align:start position:0%
that appears to be
 
01:57:53.350 --> 01:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
contradictory or possibly an incentive
 
01:57:56.070 --> 01:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
to inflate your costs because you have a
 
01:57:58.470 --> 01:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
set amount coming in what do you do if
 
01:58:01.270 --> 01:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
the more if that 500
 
01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:02.629 align:start position:0%
the more if that 500
produces

01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%
produces
 
01:58:05.830 --> 01:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
150 of your expenses
 
01:58:07.109 --> 01:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
at that point in time my understanding
 
01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
according to the statute we'd have to
 
01:58:10.629 --> 01:58:10.639 align:start position:0%
find a way to reduce our expenses to
 
01:58:11.990 --> 01:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
meet that obligation
 
01:58:13.669 --> 01:58:13.679 align:start position:0%
what if it's it's a hund what if it
 
01:58:17.109 --> 01:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
produces 150 of your expenses
 
01:58:19.830 --> 01:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
what will you do will you refund the the
 
01:58:21.589 --> 01:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
overages or will you increase your
 
01:58:21.599 --> 01:58:24.149 align:start position:0%
overages or will you increase your
expenses

01:58:24.149 --> 01:58:24.159 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
01:58:25.669 --> 01:58:25.679 align:start position:0%
i would say at that point in time our
 
01:58:27.910 --> 01:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
budget is based upon what our needs are
 
01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
and if the needs exceed the money coming
 
01:58:32.550 --> 01:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
and exceeds the needs then at that point
 
01:58:34.229 --> 01:58:34.239 align:start position:0%
in time there would be a refund going
 
01:58:35.910 --> 01:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
back to them the challenge we have in
 
01:58:37.189 --> 01:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
01:58:37.199 --> 01:58:37.990 align:start position:0%
the statute
is

01:58:37.990 --> 01:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:58:39.669 --> 01:58:39.679 align:start position:0%
which has to go back in the rules is the
 
01:58:42.470 --> 01:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
process to do that
 
01:58:44.709 --> 01:58:44.719 align:start position:0%
the rules cannot contradict the statute
 
01:58:46.550 --> 01:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
so i'd be interested in seeing it thank
 
01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:48.950 align:start position:0%
so i'd be interested in seeing it thank
you

01:58:48.950 --> 01:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:50.310 --> 01:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
does anyone else have a question
 
01:58:53.350 --> 01:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
representative pearson
 
01:58:54.550 --> 01:58:54.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
representative merchant for for coming
 
01:58:58.550 --> 01:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
here it kind of ties along
 
01:59:01.589 --> 01:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
the question with the chair
 
01:59:05.030 --> 01:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:07.990 --> 01:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
why not have your your fee structure set
 
01:59:09.750 --> 01:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
up to be
 
01:59:11.350 --> 01:59:11.360 align:start position:0%
similar to what
 
01:59:13.750 --> 01:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
goes on in the oplc in that the fees
 
01:59:17.430 --> 01:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
based on the need and not
 
01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:18.390 align:start position:0%
based on the need and not
have

01:59:18.390 --> 01:59:18.400 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:19.189 align:start position:0%
have
this

01:59:19.189 --> 01:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:59:21.270 --> 01:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
statement of an annual assessment of not
 
01:59:26.070 --> 01:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
less than 500 why not just make it where
 
01:59:28.149 --> 01:59:28.159 align:start position:0%
the the board will set the fee as
 
01:59:28.159 --> 01:59:30.550 align:start position:0%
the the board will set the fee as
necessary

01:59:30.550 --> 01:59:30.560 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:59:31.750 --> 01:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
you know what
 
01:59:33.669 --> 01:59:33.679 align:start position:0%
that's a good point i mean one of the
 
01:59:35.030 --> 01:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
things we could do at that point in time
 
01:59:36.950 --> 01:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
the committee is do an amendment to the
 
01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:37.750 align:start position:0%
the committee is do an amendment to the
bill

01:59:37.750 --> 01:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:59:39.589 --> 01:59:39.599 align:start position:0%
and amend it that way accordingly i mean
 
01:59:42.070 --> 01:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
i i we're not trying to turn the board
 
01:59:43.750 --> 01:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
into a quote revenue producer for the
 
01:59:43.760 --> 01:59:44.550 align:start position:0%
into a quote revenue producer for the
state

01:59:44.550 --> 01:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:59:46.149 --> 01:59:46.159 align:start position:0%
we're trying to be sure we're frugal
 
01:59:48.470 --> 01:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
with the money both with taxpayer monies
 
01:59:50.550 --> 01:59:50.560 align:start position:0%
as well as what comes in from anybody
 
01:59:52.870 --> 01:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
else so if the committee's comfortable
 
01:59:55.350 --> 01:59:55.360 align:start position:0%
with making an amendment to this bill
 
01:59:56.790 --> 01:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
01:59:58.310 --> 01:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
i think if that will make it past that
 
02:00:05.350 --> 02:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:06.629 --> 02:00:06.639 align:start position:0%
no they could
 
02:00:07.910 --> 02:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
the board
 
02:00:09.510 --> 02:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
can have rule making can't have
 
02:00:13.109 --> 02:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
authority to set the fee in rules but
 
02:00:14.790 --> 02:00:14.800 align:start position:0%
generally we like to give them some
 
02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:16.790 align:start position:0%
generally we like to give them some
guidance

02:00:16.790 --> 02:00:16.800 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
and not less than 500 is not the kind of
 
02:00:21.669 --> 02:00:21.679 align:start position:0%
guidance we would normally give
 
02:00:23.589 --> 02:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
i'm open to um the committee i
 
02:00:25.030 --> 02:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
understand the concern
 
02:00:26.950 --> 02:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
it's a valid one obviously so there's a
 
02:00:28.470 --> 02:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
way for the committee to work on an
 
02:00:31.830 --> 02:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
amendment to um tackle that
 
02:00:34.629 --> 02:00:34.639 align:start position:0%
because again be clear the board is a
 
02:00:36.629 --> 02:00:36.639 align:start position:0%
frugal board we're just trying to be
 
02:00:38.870 --> 02:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
sure we have the funds to make the board
 
02:00:41.270 --> 02:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
operational thank you
 
02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
02:00:45.510 --> 02:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
it has been brought to my attention
 
02:00:47.030 --> 02:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
02:00:49.270 --> 02:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
that a an existing
 
02:00:53.270 --> 02:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh section of the statute states
 
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
and that is in
 
02:00:58.870 --> 02:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
126 bb colon 8
 
02:01:00.229 --> 02:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
under funding
 
02:01:02.149 --> 02:01:02.159 align:start position:0%
the last line of
 
02:01:05.189 --> 02:01:05.199 align:start position:0%
section e reads the board may wave
 
02:01:07.350 --> 02:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
assessments otherwise do under
 
02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:08.709 align:start position:0%
assessments otherwise do under
sub-paragraphs

02:01:08.709 --> 02:01:08.719 align:start position:0%
sub-paragraphs
 
02:01:08.719 --> 02:01:09.430 align:start position:0%
sub-paragraphs
c

02:01:09.430 --> 02:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
c
 
02:01:12.629 --> 02:01:12.639 align:start position:0%
as in center and e is an excellent when
 
02:01:14.870 --> 02:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
a waiver is determined to be in the best
 
02:01:17.270 --> 02:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
interest of the board and the parties to
 
02:01:19.030 --> 02:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
be assessed
 
02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
so i think that addresses the questions
 
02:01:25.189 --> 02:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
that we're currently discussing
 
02:01:27.030 --> 02:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative smith for your
 
02:01:30.629 --> 02:01:30.639 align:start position:0%
research are there any other questions
 
02:01:32.709 --> 02:01:32.719 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
02:01:35.350 --> 02:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
and madam chair was a copy of my
 
02:01:36.629 --> 02:01:36.639 align:start position:0%
testimony you got copies of your
 
02:01:38.229 --> 02:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
testimony and passed them around thank
 
02:01:40.709 --> 02:01:40.719 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you madam chair
 
02:01:42.149 --> 02:01:42.159 align:start position:0%
while representative merchant was
 
02:01:44.470 --> 02:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
testifying in response to one of the
 
02:01:47.750 --> 02:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
questions senator sherman was uh
 
02:01:50.229 --> 02:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
indicating so perhaps we could have he's
 
02:01:51.589 --> 02:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
the next one up
 
02:01:53.830 --> 02:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
but perhaps we could have him uh
 
02:01:56.310 --> 02:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
answer that question immediately
 
02:01:59.510 --> 02:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you represent uh
 
02:02:01.350 --> 02:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
senator sherman and i hope you will not
 
02:02:03.430 --> 02:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
need to repeat what representative
 
02:02:06.149 --> 02:02:06.159 align:start position:0%
merchant has so dutifully reported
 
02:02:09.030 --> 02:02:09.040 align:start position:0%
no i won't thank you madam chair and for
 
02:02:11.350 --> 02:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
the record my name is tom sherman once a
 
02:02:13.109 --> 02:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
representative always a representative
 
02:02:13.119 --> 02:02:13.910 align:start position:0%
representative always a representative
but

02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:02:15.510 --> 02:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
currently senator
 
02:02:17.910 --> 02:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh representing 11 towns on the seacoast
 
02:02:19.669 --> 02:02:19.679 align:start position:0%
district 24
 
02:02:25.109 --> 02:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:28.560 align:start position:0%
to answer the question that was raised i
 
02:02:31.669 --> 02:02:31.679 align:start position:0%
would have no problem in line 16
 
02:02:34.550 --> 02:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
i think it works if you just took out
 
02:02:39.270 --> 02:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
the words of not less than 500 assessed
 
02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:40.229 align:start position:0%
the words of not less than 500 assessed
um

02:02:40.229 --> 02:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:41.669 --> 02:02:41.679 align:start position:0%
that leaves
 
02:02:45.030 --> 02:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
the that gets rid of that i i
 
02:02:46.790 --> 02:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
was trying to remember where that number
 
02:02:48.629 --> 02:02:48.639 align:start position:0%
came from but i think it's arbitrary and
 
02:02:51.510 --> 02:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and i appreciate the chairs
 
02:02:53.189 --> 02:02:53.199 align:start position:0%
pointing that out
 
02:02:53.199 --> 02:02:55.030 align:start position:0%
pointing that out
um

02:02:55.030 --> 02:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:58.149 --> 02:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
so the goal here is to follow oplc
 
02:03:00.790 --> 02:03:00.800 align:start position:0%
as representative pearson pointed out
 
02:03:01.990 --> 02:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:03:06.070 --> 02:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
125 percent is the language that's
 
02:03:07.510 --> 02:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
in the board of medicine and the other
 
02:03:12.149 --> 02:03:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:14.229 --> 02:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
and just to be clear this is similar to
 
02:03:15.669 --> 02:03:15.679 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:03:17.189 --> 02:03:17.199 align:start position:0%
parts of this are similar to the bill
 
02:03:20.470 --> 02:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
you heard earlier coming from the house
 
02:03:23.510 --> 02:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
these bills were both fully supported by
 
02:03:24.790 --> 02:03:24.800 align:start position:0%
the board
 
02:03:26.390 --> 02:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
they have been
 
02:03:28.629 --> 02:03:28.639 align:start position:0%
amended slightly in answer to the
 
02:03:30.310 --> 02:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
concerns that were raised by the board
 
02:03:33.189 --> 02:03:33.199 align:start position:0%
and the two most important there
 
02:03:35.350 --> 02:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
by i'm sorry by this committee the two
 
02:03:38.470 --> 02:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
most important there were putting limits
 
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
on fee raising ability that's the 125
 
02:03:43.189 --> 02:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
and the other was
 
02:03:44.470 --> 02:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
putting in
 
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
an appeals process
 
02:03:49.270 --> 02:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
so that and that was a direct response
 
02:03:52.229 --> 02:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
to questions raised so
 
02:03:55.270 --> 02:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
the goal has been to be responsible
 
02:03:57.189 --> 02:03:57.199 align:start position:0%
or responsive to
 
02:03:58.870 --> 02:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
concerns raised by this committee and
 
02:04:01.189 --> 02:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
also by some of the people on fiscal
 
02:04:04.310 --> 02:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:05.669 --> 02:04:05.679 align:start position:0%
process under
 
02:04:07.830 --> 02:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
being undertaken there
 
02:04:10.390 --> 02:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
to make it possible for us to accept
 
02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:12.790 align:start position:0%
to make it possible for us to accept
fees

02:04:12.790 --> 02:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
fees
 
02:04:14.950 --> 02:04:14.960 align:start position:0%
there had been questions about the
 
02:04:17.669 --> 02:04:17.679 align:start position:0%
intent of the board and
 
02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
i don't want to reiterate the intent of
 
02:04:21.750 --> 02:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
the board except to say
 
02:04:25.990 --> 02:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
this is a very very very complex
 
02:04:28.950 --> 02:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
process if you've ever been a patient
 
02:04:28.960 --> 02:04:29.750 align:start position:0%
process if you've ever been a patient
no

02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:04:31.750 --> 02:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
you know i'm a provider and a patient if
 
02:04:33.430 --> 02:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
you've ever been a patient you know how
 
02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:35.830 align:start position:0%
you've ever been a patient you know how
complex

02:04:35.830 --> 02:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
complex
 
02:04:38.550 --> 02:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
pharmacy costs are whether it's a
 
02:04:41.109 --> 02:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
hospital or your own office or you're a
 
02:04:42.390 --> 02:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
patient and you're just going to the
 
02:04:44.470 --> 02:04:44.480 align:start position:0%
person to the drug store
 
02:04:46.390 --> 02:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
you can get five different quotes for
 
02:04:47.990 --> 02:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
the same drug
 
02:04:49.589 --> 02:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
and then there's generic and there's
 
02:04:52.550 --> 02:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
brand name and so it gets very confusing
 
02:04:54.709 --> 02:04:54.719 align:start position:0%
and the goal of this
 
02:04:54.719 --> 02:04:55.910 align:start position:0%
and the goal of this
board

02:04:55.910 --> 02:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:04:58.550 --> 02:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
is to try to clarify
 
02:05:00.310 --> 02:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
for the state
 
02:05:02.709 --> 02:05:02.719 align:start position:0%
what the costs are and how to optimize
 
02:05:05.390 --> 02:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
those costs and there had been some
 
02:05:07.109 --> 02:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
misinterpretation of the goal of the
 
02:05:09.109 --> 02:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
board we're not setting prices there's
 
02:05:09.119 --> 02:05:09.830 align:start position:0%
board we're not setting prices there's
no

02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:05:12.310 --> 02:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
fees i'm sorry there's no
 
02:05:14.950 --> 02:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh fixing of prices there's no penalties
 
02:05:14.960 --> 02:05:16.470 align:start position:0%
uh fixing of prices there's no penalties
there's

02:05:16.470 --> 02:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:05:18.149 --> 02:05:18.159 align:start position:0%
built into this
 
02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
it's really just trying to optimize the
 
02:05:23.189 --> 02:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
state expense and the transparency
 
02:05:23.199 --> 02:05:24.390 align:start position:0%
state expense and the transparency
around

02:05:24.390 --> 02:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
around
 
02:05:27.189 --> 02:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
why things cost what they cost
 
02:05:28.790 --> 02:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
and that
 
02:05:31.990 --> 02:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
is a way of enhancing transparency we've
 
02:05:34.629 --> 02:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
talked about this in other areas like
 
02:05:37.030 --> 02:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
hospital charges and doctors charges and
 
02:05:39.510 --> 02:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
how confusing it is for patients
 
02:05:41.350 --> 02:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
but remember we have eight thousand
 
02:05:43.910 --> 02:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
state employees we have ten thousand so
 
02:05:45.910 --> 02:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
we still have two thousand job openings
 
02:05:47.589 --> 02:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
but that's a lot of people that's a lot
 
02:05:49.109 --> 02:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
of cost
 
02:05:51.270 --> 02:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
um including
 
02:05:54.310 --> 02:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
legislators who are on the health plan
 
02:05:56.950 --> 02:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
so this is to make us smarter to clarify
 
02:05:59.750 --> 02:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
the system make it more transparent and
 
02:06:02.390 --> 02:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
in the end the smarter we get
 
02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
the more we understand where there can
 
02:06:07.750 --> 02:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
be savings without any
 
02:06:10.229 --> 02:06:10.239 align:start position:0%
decrease in quality of the health care
 
02:06:10.239 --> 02:06:12.470 align:start position:0%
decrease in quality of the health care
provided

02:06:12.470 --> 02:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
provided
 
02:06:14.550 --> 02:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
it will save the state money and that's
 
02:06:16.629 --> 02:06:16.639 align:start position:0%
the whole goal so
 
02:06:18.390 --> 02:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
i hope that's clear but i'm happy to
 
02:06:19.910 --> 02:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
02:06:21.350 --> 02:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you senator are there any
 
02:06:21.360 --> 02:06:24.149 align:start position:0%
thank you senator are there any
questions

02:06:24.149 --> 02:06:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:25.830 --> 02:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
02:06:27.669 --> 02:06:27.679 align:start position:0%
representative fellows excuse me yeah i
 
02:06:30.629 --> 02:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
just had a question had have there been
 
02:06:33.030 --> 02:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
bills this year that
 
02:06:38.629 --> 02:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:42.310 --> 02:06:42.320 align:start position:0%
right there was one and this is the we
 
02:06:45.510 --> 02:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
one was in the senate with um and the
 
02:06:47.109 --> 02:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
senators on
 
02:06:49.990 --> 02:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
the committee are senator carson and me
 
02:06:51.750 --> 02:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh so and
 
02:06:54.470 --> 02:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald is an alternate
 
02:06:55.589 --> 02:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:06:57.589 --> 02:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
this was the one that came from the
 
02:07:00.149 --> 02:07:00.159 align:start position:0%
senate senator carson and i
 
02:07:01.990 --> 02:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
worked on this together
 
02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
and then the house bill you have an
 
02:07:08.390 --> 02:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:10.069 --> 02:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
02:07:10.079 --> 02:07:12.310 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
schmidt

02:07:12.310 --> 02:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
schmidt
 
02:07:15.109 --> 02:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so senator sherman
 
02:07:17.189 --> 02:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
uh i think the
 
02:07:19.750 --> 02:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
the nagging question that we all have
 
02:07:21.669 --> 02:07:21.679 align:start position:0%
given the complexity that you've alluded
 
02:07:23.990 --> 02:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
to uh several times in your testimony
 
02:07:26.950 --> 02:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
today but also previously is
 
02:07:29.750 --> 02:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
that this is a very complicated complex
 
02:07:33.910 --> 02:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
situation um and uh
 
02:07:35.430 --> 02:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
i got the impression but i'd like to
 
02:07:37.669 --> 02:07:37.679 align:start position:0%
have you go on the record whether the
 
02:07:40.550 --> 02:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
this this board actually does work and
 
02:07:43.350 --> 02:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
is functioning in the fashion in which
 
02:07:46.310 --> 02:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
it was intended other than the fiscal
 
02:07:48.629 --> 02:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
aspects that that we're trying to
 
02:07:50.790 --> 02:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
wrestle with today
 
02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:51.589 align:start position:0%
wrestle with today
um

02:07:51.589 --> 02:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:55.189 --> 02:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
the short answer is yes we're
 
02:07:58.390 --> 02:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
probably moving forward
 
02:08:01.510 --> 02:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
under representative merchant's guidance
 
02:08:01.520 --> 02:08:04.629 align:start position:0%
under representative merchant's guidance
with

02:08:04.629 --> 02:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:06.709 --> 02:08:06.719 align:start position:0%
we're probably the most advanced now in
 
02:08:10.390 --> 02:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
the country of these types of boards
 
02:08:12.709 --> 02:08:12.719 align:start position:0%
we are very excited about
 
02:08:14.550 --> 02:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
the level of understanding the board
 
02:08:16.870 --> 02:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
actually has now we've had multiple
 
02:08:19.990 --> 02:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
training sessions so that we are
 
02:08:22.069 --> 02:08:22.079 align:start position:0%
getting as clear as we possibly can on
 
02:08:24.790 --> 02:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
this very very difficult to understand
 
02:08:24.800 --> 02:08:26.069 align:start position:0%
this very very difficult to understand
process

02:08:26.069 --> 02:08:26.079 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:08:26.079 --> 02:08:27.990 align:start position:0%
process
um

02:08:27.990 --> 02:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:28.950 align:start position:0%
um
but

02:08:28.950 --> 02:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:08:30.950 --> 02:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
that being said you know we we have to
 
02:08:33.910 --> 02:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
have these things in place to really be
 
02:08:36.629 --> 02:08:36.639 align:start position:0%
able to function the way it was intended
 
02:08:37.990 --> 02:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
and that's why we've come to the
 
02:08:44.149 --> 02:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:46.069 --> 02:08:46.079 align:start position:0%
really sort of housekeeping measures so
 
02:08:48.149 --> 02:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
that we can actually
 
02:08:51.430 --> 02:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
complete our making and
 
02:08:53.589 --> 02:08:53.599 align:start position:0%
start doing the business of the board in
 
02:08:55.750 --> 02:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
a robust way but
 
02:08:58.870 --> 02:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
the the trajectory is very positive the
 
02:09:00.069 --> 02:09:00.079 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:09:00.079 --> 02:09:01.109 align:start position:0%
the uh
the

02:09:01.109 --> 02:09:01.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:09:03.510 --> 02:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
com the board has
 
02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
done a lot of work we've met many many
 
02:09:07.510 --> 02:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
hours and
 
02:09:10.149 --> 02:09:10.159 align:start position:0%
really are on a on a great glide path
 
02:09:12.069 --> 02:09:12.079 align:start position:0%
towards being able to
 
02:09:14.310 --> 02:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
serve the state by making
 
02:09:16.310 --> 02:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
us as
 
02:09:19.589 --> 02:09:19.599 align:start position:0%
smart as possible about how we
 
02:09:21.430 --> 02:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
deal with this very expensive part of
 
02:09:26.390 --> 02:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:28.870 --> 02:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
so i noticed the effective date is july
 
02:09:31.109 --> 02:09:31.119 align:start position:0%
1st 2022
 
02:09:32.950 --> 02:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
is there a specific reason why it should
 
02:09:35.109 --> 02:09:35.119 align:start position:0%
not be upon passage
 
02:09:37.109 --> 02:09:37.119 align:start position:0%
uh because it sounds to me like some of
 
02:09:40.229 --> 02:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
these aspects are pretty time sensitive
 
02:09:40.239 --> 02:09:41.270 align:start position:0%
these aspects are pretty time sensitive
um

02:09:41.270 --> 02:09:41.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:42.550 --> 02:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
02:09:45.589 --> 02:09:45.599 align:start position:0%
great if it were on passage
 
02:09:47.430 --> 02:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
we'll take what we can get in terms of
 
02:09:50.390 --> 02:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
being able to get started you know july
 
02:09:53.030 --> 02:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
2022 is is not very far in the distance
 
02:09:53.040 --> 02:09:54.390 align:start position:0%
2022 is is not very far in the distance
so

02:09:54.390 --> 02:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:56.470 --> 02:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
we're meeting this afternoon we meet
 
02:09:59.270 --> 02:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
regularly and we'll continue to do so
 
02:10:00.550 --> 02:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
until we get
 
02:10:02.310 --> 02:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
really until we get this
 
02:10:04.149 --> 02:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
fully functional
 
02:10:06.470 --> 02:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
it does seem to me that on upon passage
 
02:10:08.550 --> 02:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
would be better
 
02:10:09.990 --> 02:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:10:12.550 --> 02:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i would agree that if you're going
 
02:10:14.390 --> 02:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
to do an amendment to
 
02:10:17.189 --> 02:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
fix line 16 on page two
 
02:10:19.350 --> 02:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
changing the effective date on passage
 
02:10:21.430 --> 02:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
would be welcome
 
02:10:24.870 --> 02:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:27.109 --> 02:10:27.119 align:start position:0%

repetitive would you pick whomever you
 
02:10:49.750 --> 02:10:49.760 align:start position:0%

today that is margie's story margie is a
 
02:11:47.109 --> 02:11:47.119 align:start position:0%
resident of new hampshire and she lives
 
02:11:49.830 --> 02:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
with multiple sclerosis
 
02:11:52.390 --> 02:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
it is a very painful and expensive
 
02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:53.830 align:start position:0%
it is a very painful and expensive
disorder

02:11:53.830 --> 02:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
disorder
 
02:11:56.229 --> 02:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
one of her medications
 
02:11:56.239 --> 02:11:57.189 align:start position:0%
one of her medications
cost

02:11:57.189 --> 02:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
cost
 
02:12:02.069 --> 02:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollars every three months
 
02:12:04.709 --> 02:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
maggie's insurance coverage does help
 
02:12:07.350 --> 02:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
her afford this medication but she is
 
02:12:09.910 --> 02:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
afraid that that won't always be the
 
02:12:09.920 --> 02:12:11.030 align:start position:0%
afraid that that won't always be the
case

02:12:11.030 --> 02:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:12:14.229 --> 02:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
because in the past the board has her
 
02:12:14.239 --> 02:12:15.030 align:start position:0%
because in the past the board has her
her

02:12:15.030 --> 02:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
her
 
02:12:17.510 --> 02:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
insurance has abruptly
 
02:12:21.030 --> 02:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
denied her coverage of
 
02:12:23.430 --> 02:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
a phys physician's recommended
 
02:12:23.440 --> 02:12:25.589 align:start position:0%
a phys physician's recommended
medication

02:12:25.589 --> 02:12:25.599 align:start position:0%
medication
 
02:12:27.669 --> 02:12:27.679 align:start position:0%
changes and gaps
 
02:12:31.189 --> 02:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
in her coverage threatened her health
 
02:12:34.709 --> 02:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
and her hard-won stability
 
02:12:36.709 --> 02:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
without the medication
 
02:12:39.030 --> 02:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
she is likely to relapse
 
02:12:39.040 --> 02:12:40.149 align:start position:0%
she is likely to relapse
and

02:12:40.149 --> 02:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:43.910 --> 02:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
probably lose what stability that she
 
02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
has gained
 
02:12:47.589 --> 02:12:47.599 align:start position:0%
and to think about this is absolutely
 
02:12:50.950 --> 02:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
terrifying to margie
 
02:12:53.669 --> 02:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
she does not want to lose more to than
 
02:12:56.069 --> 02:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
she already has physically and
 
02:12:58.149 --> 02:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
emotionally to
 
02:12:58.159 --> 02:12:59.750 align:start position:0%
emotionally to
ms

02:12:59.750 --> 02:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
ms
 
02:13:03.109 --> 02:13:03.119 align:start position:0%
so while the prescription board afford
 
02:13:05.030 --> 02:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me prescription drug
 
02:13:06.950 --> 02:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
affordability board
 
02:13:09.669 --> 02:13:09.679 align:start position:0%
cannot set drug prices
 
02:13:13.550 --> 02:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
it will help to bring accountability and
 
02:13:17.589 --> 02:13:17.599 align:start position:0%
transparency by asking questions to the
 
02:13:21.030 --> 02:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies as to how there
 
02:13:23.830 --> 02:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
is this widely varying
 
02:13:25.350 --> 02:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
and seemingly
 
02:13:29.109 --> 02:13:29.119 align:start position:0%
random prices that are set
 
02:13:32.470 --> 02:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
i hope that you will support this
 
02:13:35.430 --> 02:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
legislation that is so important to so

of the capital city task force
 
02:14:40.790 --> 02:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to
 
02:14:43.030 --> 02:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
say that this board was created in a
 
02:14:45.830 --> 02:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
bipartisan way in 2020
 
02:14:48.390 --> 02:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
to monitor the changes of the cost of
 
02:14:50.550 --> 02:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs and to have
 
02:14:54.310 --> 02:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
transparency within the drug industry
 
02:14:55.589 --> 02:14:55.599 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
02:14:57.669 --> 02:14:57.679 align:start position:0%
keeps all new hampshire residents
 
02:15:00.390 --> 02:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
informed of any price increases that may
 
02:15:02.629 --> 02:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
affect their ability to afford the
 
02:15:05.350 --> 02:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
medications they use
 
02:15:08.709 --> 02:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
my story involves my mother
 
02:15:11.430 --> 02:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
she like many new hampshire residents
 
02:15:13.350 --> 02:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
felt the increases
 
02:15:15.830 --> 02:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
in prescription drug prices
 
02:15:18.149 --> 02:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
she lived on social security
 
02:15:20.709 --> 02:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
it was not a lot of money
 
02:15:22.870 --> 02:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
but one of her medications
 
02:15:26.310 --> 02:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
was over half the cost of what her
 
02:15:28.950 --> 02:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
social security benefit was
 
02:15:31.510 --> 02:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
she needed this medication in order to
 
02:15:34.629 --> 02:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
maintain the quality of life that she
 
02:15:38.149 --> 02:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
deserved and she was alive and vibrant
 
02:15:38.159 --> 02:15:39.990 align:start position:0%
deserved and she was alive and vibrant
lady

02:15:39.990 --> 02:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
lady
 
02:15:42.310 --> 02:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
i just would like to say that the people
 
02:15:44.629 --> 02:15:44.639 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire do deserve and they
 
02:15:44.639 --> 02:15:45.510 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire do deserve and they
need

02:15:45.510 --> 02:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
need
 
02:15:47.270 --> 02:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
fair drug prices
 
02:15:49.189 --> 02:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't have to choose between
 
02:15:51.350 --> 02:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
their life-saving medications
 
02:15:54.470 --> 02:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
and food or any other necessity of their
 
02:15:54.480 --> 02:15:55.589 align:start position:0%
and food or any other necessity of their
life

of this original legislation since 2020
 
02:17:12.230 --> 02:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
and we were happy when governor sununu
 
02:17:14.230 --> 02:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
signed the drug affordability board act
 
02:17:15.509 --> 02:17:15.519 align:start position:0%
into law
 
02:17:18.070 --> 02:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
i really hope this is a last hurdle it
 
02:17:19.589 --> 02:17:19.599 align:start position:0%
is such an important piece of
 
02:17:19.599 --> 02:17:21.750 align:start position:0%
is such an important piece of
legislation

02:17:21.750 --> 02:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:17:23.830 --> 02:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that the increasing price
 
02:17:25.910 --> 02:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
of prescription drugs is of great
 
02:17:28.870 --> 02:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
concern to folks across new hampshire
 
02:17:31.429 --> 02:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
my fellow concord residents dan and
 
02:17:34.950 --> 02:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
grace are both 62 years of age
 
02:17:36.870 --> 02:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
and live right here just a few miles
 
02:17:39.509 --> 02:17:39.519 align:start position:0%
from where we are meeting
 
02:17:42.629 --> 02:17:42.639 align:start position:0%
dan is newly retired and grace worked a
 
02:17:45.110 --> 02:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
part-time job until she was diagnosed
 
02:17:47.910 --> 02:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
with colorectal cancer
 
02:17:50.309 --> 02:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
while grace was undergoing chemotherapy
 
02:17:52.790 --> 02:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
and receiving radiation treatments their
 
02:17:55.030 --> 02:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
32 year old son michael
 
02:17:57.830 --> 02:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
was diagnosed with leukemia
 
02:18:00.150 --> 02:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
this posed even more challenges for a
 
02:18:04.150 --> 02:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:06.629 --> 02:18:06.639 align:start position:0%
michael a musician had accepted a job
 
02:18:09.270 --> 02:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
teaching music when he was diagnosed and
 
02:18:12.389 --> 02:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
was significantly underinsured
 
02:18:14.709 --> 02:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
in addition to other medications
 
02:18:17.830 --> 02:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
michael's chemotherapy drug
 
02:18:19.349 --> 02:18:19.359 align:start position:0%
then christine
 
02:18:21.270 --> 02:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
cost roughly fifteen thousand dollars
 
02:18:23.190 --> 02:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
per month
 
02:18:25.190 --> 02:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately his insurance pays very
 
02:18:28.150 --> 02:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
little of this exorbitant expense
 
02:18:30.070 --> 02:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
to cover michael's prescription drugs
 
02:18:31.830 --> 02:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
and other related costs
 
02:18:34.070 --> 02:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
dan and grace were forced to take out a
 
02:18:37.669 --> 02:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
second mortgage on their home
 
02:18:39.830 --> 02:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
no one should have to do that to keep a
 
02:18:42.070 --> 02:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
family member alive
 
02:18:43.669 --> 02:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
i'm glad the prescription drug
 
02:18:46.549 --> 02:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
affordability board is up and running
 
02:18:49.509 --> 02:18:49.519 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can move forward finally to
 
02:18:51.270 --> 02:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
allow the board to do its job in
 
02:18:53.509 --> 02:18:53.519 align:start position:0%
gathering information and asking
 
02:18:53.519 --> 02:18:54.950 align:start position:0%
gathering information and asking
questions

02:18:54.950 --> 02:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:18:57.750 --> 02:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
so we can have a better transparency on
 
02:18:59.910 --> 02:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
how drug prices are set and
 
02:19:02.629 --> 02:19:02.639 align:start position:0%

senate bill 450. there were two
 
02:22:54.550 --> 02:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
bills two housekeeping bills one was
 
02:22:56.150 --> 02:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
started in the house one was started in
 
02:22:57.750 --> 02:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
the senate since there were members of
 
02:22:59.429 --> 02:22:59.439 align:start position:0%
both the house and senate on the board
 
02:23:01.670 --> 02:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
which is why they were started in both
 
02:23:03.590 --> 02:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
bodies but they were different bills it
 
02:23:07.110 --> 02:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't that the same bill was started in
 
02:23:09.510 --> 02:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
each body
 
02:23:11.830 --> 02:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
and after this committee
 
02:23:13.670 --> 02:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
expressed some concerns and i know that
 
02:23:15.990 --> 02:23:16.000 align:start position:0%

02:23:19.750 --> 02:23:19.760 align:start position:0%

02:23:56.469 --> 02:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
order to incorporate the concerns that
 
02:23:57.510 --> 02:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
we heard
 
02:24:00.710 --> 02:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
in this committee the concerns that miss
 
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
kroll brought up so that
 
02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:03.750 align:start position:0%
kroll brought up so that
um

02:24:03.750 --> 02:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:05.190 --> 02:24:05.200 align:start position:0%
you know these these concerns were
 
02:24:06.710 --> 02:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
addressed and
 
02:24:09.429 --> 02:24:09.439 align:start position:0%
um really again came together uh
 
02:24:09.439 --> 02:24:10.950 align:start position:0%
um really again came together uh
bipartisanly

02:24:10.950 --> 02:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
bipartisanly
 
02:24:10.960 --> 02:24:11.830 align:start position:0%
bipartisanly
um

02:24:11.830 --> 02:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:14.070 --> 02:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
and really
 
02:24:16.630 --> 02:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
listen to the stakeholders that
 
02:24:20.070 --> 02:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
made themselves available in order to
 
02:24:22.389 --> 02:24:22.399 align:start position:0%
address the concerns
 
02:24:25.349 --> 02:24:25.359 align:start position:0%
so i hope that you will find that senate
 
02:24:27.990 --> 02:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
bill 450 addresses some of the concerns
 
02:24:30.870 --> 02:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
or all of the concerns that you had
 
02:24:33.910 --> 02:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
earlier this session with the house bill
 
02:24:33.920 --> 02:24:34.790 align:start position:0%
earlier this session with the house bill
um

02:24:34.790 --> 02:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:36.710 --> 02:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
and again i just wanted to remind the
 
02:24:38.950 --> 02:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
committee that two years ago this was
 
02:24:40.870 --> 02:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
one of only
 
02:24:43.429 --> 02:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
three bills that senator excuse me
 
02:24:45.830 --> 02:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
governor sununu came and testified on
 
02:24:45.840 --> 02:24:46.710 align:start position:0%
governor sununu came and testified on
and

02:24:46.710 --> 02:24:46.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:24:50.070 --> 02:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:52.469 --> 02:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
that he what he said at the time was
 
02:24:53.590 --> 02:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
this bill will create a drug
 
02:24:55.830 --> 02:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
affordability board in new hampshire to
 
02:24:57.750 --> 02:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
monitor changes in the cost of
 
02:25:00.309 --> 02:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs to keep the industry
 
02:25:00.319 --> 02:25:01.349 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs to keep the industry
honest

02:25:01.349 --> 02:25:01.359 align:start position:0%
honest
 
02:25:03.590 --> 02:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
and to keep an eye on the prices and
 
02:25:06.230 --> 02:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
prevent price spikes often many of the
 
02:25:08.469 --> 02:25:08.479 align:start position:0%
challenges in health care can start to
 
02:25:09.590 --> 02:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
be addressed through greater
 
02:25:12.150 --> 02:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
transparency in pricing and again that's
 
02:25:15.510 --> 02:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
transparency in pricing not fixing the
 
02:25:15.520 --> 02:25:16.950 align:start position:0%
transparency in pricing not fixing the
prices

02:25:16.950 --> 02:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
prices
 
02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:18.550 align:start position:0%
prices
transparency

02:25:18.550 --> 02:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
02:25:21.270 --> 02:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
brings scrutiny and accountability as to
 
02:25:23.270 --> 02:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
why the cost of a particular drug is
 
02:25:26.070 --> 02:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
high or higher than similar drugs and he
 
02:25:27.590 --> 02:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
went on to say that he looked forward to
 
02:25:29.110 --> 02:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
signing the bill
 
02:25:31.349 --> 02:25:31.359 align:start position:0%
but in addition to the transparency you
 
02:25:33.670 --> 02:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
heard today about
 
02:25:35.670 --> 02:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
the the fact that this
 
02:25:39.830 --> 02:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
bill allows the board to really be in in
 
02:25:39.840 --> 02:25:41.030 align:start position:0%
bill allows the board to really be in in
innovative

02:25:41.030 --> 02:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
innovative
 
02:25:43.270 --> 02:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
when it comes to
 
02:25:45.270 --> 02:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
any public payers inc including
 
02:25:45.280 --> 02:25:47.349 align:start position:0%
any public payers inc including
municipal

02:25:47.349 --> 02:25:47.359 align:start position:0%
municipal
 
02:25:49.349 --> 02:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
and trying to get a handle on what the
 
02:25:51.510 --> 02:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities are paying for drugs and
 
02:25:53.910 --> 02:25:53.920 align:start position:0%
what the state is paying for drugs so
 
02:25:56.230 --> 02:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
the one of the main functions of this
 
02:25:59.429 --> 02:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
board is to save money for the state
 
02:26:01.990 --> 02:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
and so i really encourage you to take a
 
02:26:03.750 --> 02:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
look at this bill
 
02:26:06.790 --> 02:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't address all your concerns
 
02:26:08.469 --> 02:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
you know let uh
 
02:26:10.870 --> 02:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
representative emergent merchant senator
 
02:26:13.030 --> 02:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
sherman myself
 
02:26:16.550 --> 02:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
mr barry um or miss delaney know and
 
02:26:18.389 --> 02:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
we'd be more than happy to work with you
 
02:26:20.309 --> 02:26:20.319 align:start position:0%
further on it but i do believe that
 
02:26:21.830 --> 02:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
addressed all the concerns that we heard
 
02:26:23.830 --> 02:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
about a couple months ago with that i
 
02:26:25.990 --> 02:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
will take any questions
 
02:26:29.590 --> 02:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:31.590 --> 02:26:31.600 align:start position:0%

02:26:40.870 --> 02:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:40.880 --> 02:26:41.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:26:41.910 --> 02:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:43.920 align:start position:0%

02:26:43.920 --> 02:26:46.230 align:start position:0%

hearing

02:26:46.230 --> 02:26:46.240 align:start position:0%

02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:47.270 align:start position:0%
hearing

02:26:47.270 --> 02:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:26:48.790 --> 02:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
it's almost noon
 
02:26:51.190 --> 02:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
i'd like to have the republicans here at
 
02:26:53.590 --> 02:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
one o'clock for a caucus the committee
 
02:26:55.110 --> 02:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
will resume
 
02:26:55.120 --> 02:26:56.150 align:start position:0%
will resume
at

02:26:56.150 --> 02:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
at
 
02:58:29.990 --> 02:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:30.000 --> 04:05:22.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:05:22.070 --> 04:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:24.070 --> 04:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
okay welcome back guys
 
04:05:26.550 --> 04:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
i'm going to start with the bills that
 
04:05:29.269 --> 04:05:29.279 align:start position:0%
have messy amendments that we might need
 
04:05:33.030 --> 04:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
to change dir because of our discussions
 
04:05:34.870 --> 04:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
so that we have time to get them rev
 
04:05:34.880 --> 04:05:37.110 align:start position:0%
so that we have time to get them rev
rewritten

04:05:37.110 --> 04:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
rewritten
 
04:05:39.030 --> 04:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
and then we'll go on to the ones with
 
04:05:41.349 --> 04:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
simpler amendments
 
04:05:45.750 --> 04:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:45.760 --> 04:05:46.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:05:46.790 --> 04:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:05:49.349 --> 04:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
397 there's an amendment in work so we
 
04:05:51.830 --> 04:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
won't do that
 
04:05:54.950 --> 04:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
um i think senate bill 330
 
04:05:57.189 --> 04:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
representative shuett
 
04:05:59.110 --> 04:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
is the neck is the
 
04:06:02.229 --> 04:06:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:05.910 --> 04:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair i believe everyone has
 
04:06:07.510 --> 04:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
a copy of the
 
04:06:10.710 --> 04:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
latest iteration
 
04:06:14.870 --> 04:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
amendment 1732 h
 
04:06:18.790 --> 04:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
which is basically the same as
 
04:06:18.800 --> 04:06:21.030 align:start position:0%
which is basically the same as
1520

04:06:21.030 --> 04:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
1520
 
04:06:21.040 --> 04:06:22.229 align:start position:0%
1520
however

04:06:22.229 --> 04:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:06:24.389 --> 04:06:24.399 align:start position:0%
as it was called to my attention that
 
04:06:24.399 --> 04:06:25.590 align:start position:0%
as it was called to my attention that
the

04:06:25.590 --> 04:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:06:28.469 --> 04:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
study in the first part of the bill
 
04:06:30.790 --> 04:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
i had
 
04:06:34.389 --> 04:06:34.399 align:start position:0%
a report date of november 1 of 2023
 
04:06:36.790 --> 04:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
which would have overlapped
 
04:06:39.670 --> 04:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
with the oversight committee
 
04:06:42.389 --> 04:06:42.399 align:start position:0%
and that seemed like
 
04:06:44.309 --> 04:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
a bit of a double effort
 
04:06:46.950 --> 04:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
so i changed
 
04:06:50.710 --> 04:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh if you look on page two
 
04:06:54.630 --> 04:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
of the amendment lines 20-22
 
04:06:57.590 --> 04:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
that now calls for the report
 
04:07:00.550 --> 04:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
of the chaptered study
 
04:07:02.950 --> 04:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
to have its final report done on
 
04:07:06.150 --> 04:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
november 1 of 2022
 
04:07:08.389 --> 04:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
therefore any recommendations that they
 
04:07:08.399 --> 04:07:09.269 align:start position:0%
therefore any recommendations that they
make

04:07:09.269 --> 04:07:09.279 align:start position:0%
make
 
04:07:11.510 --> 04:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
could be taken up by the oversight
 
04:07:14.469 --> 04:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
committee which commences in january of
 
04:07:14.479 --> 04:07:16.790 align:start position:0%
committee which commences in january of
2023

04:07:16.790 --> 04:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
2023
 
04:07:19.830 --> 04:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
that's the only change from
 
04:07:23.910 --> 04:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:23.920 --> 04:07:25.429 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:07:25.429 --> 04:07:25.439 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:07:27.429 --> 04:07:27.439 align:start position:0%
is there a second by the way and some is
 
04:07:28.710 --> 04:07:28.720 align:start position:0%

i'll second okay do you wish to speak to
 
04:07:36.469 --> 04:07:36.479 align:start position:0%

okay
 
04:07:40.800 --> 04:07:45.590 align:start position:0%
okay
and

04:07:45.590 --> 04:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:47.030 --> 04:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
representative schuett does your
 
04:07:48.710 --> 04:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
amendment remove the boxing and
 
04:07:51.110 --> 04:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
wrestling commission issues

yes it deletes the
 
04:07:55.269 --> 04:07:55.279 align:start position:0%
reference to
 
04:07:57.910 --> 04:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
boxing and wrestling just as
 
04:08:00.630 --> 04:08:00.640 align:start position:0%

this committee in a straw poll if
 
04:08:06.950 --> 04:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
everyone remembers uh
 
04:08:09.110 --> 04:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
decided that the boxing and wrestling
 
04:08:12.870 --> 04:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
commission did not belong in oplc
 
04:08:15.030 --> 04:08:15.040 align:start position:0%

yes
 
04:09:56.950 --> 04:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
it's now it's now it's really 19 to zero
 
04:09:58.550 --> 04:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
for what's worth i do the same thing on
 
04:10:00.710 --> 04:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
my committee all the time
 
04:10:02.149 --> 04:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:10:04.070 --> 04:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
it's common
 
04:10:06.469 --> 04:10:06.479 align:start position:0%
all right so that's we have adopted the
 
04:10:07.990 --> 04:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
amendment is there any further
 
04:10:10.389 --> 04:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
discussion on the bill representative
 
04:10:14.550 --> 04:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:19.990 --> 04:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:25.269 --> 04:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:28.389 --> 04:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
basically the motion is the amendment
 
04:10:28.399 --> 04:10:29.429 align:start position:0%
basically the motion is the amendment
um

04:10:29.429 --> 04:10:29.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:32.950 --> 04:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
i think we all agree that uh
 
04:10:35.110 --> 04:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
oversight of some of the issues and
 
04:10:37.030 --> 04:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
problems that we've seen
 
04:10:39.910 --> 04:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
with oplc need to be addressed
 
04:10:42.950 --> 04:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
and that was the major impetus for this
 
04:10:46.070 --> 04:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
amendment was to create the
 
04:10:49.030 --> 04:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
oversight committee
 
04:10:51.830 --> 04:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
yes i'll agree we had a
 
04:10:54.229 --> 04:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
large number of bills this year
 
04:10:57.030 --> 04:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
regarding the relationship of the boards
 
04:10:59.110 --> 04:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
to oplc
 
04:10:59.120 --> 04:11:00.790 align:start position:0%
to oplc
and

04:11:00.790 --> 04:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:11:03.110 --> 04:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
it's pretty obvious that it's not as
 
04:11:04.950 --> 04:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
smooth and efficient
 
04:11:06.469 --> 04:11:06.479 align:start position:0%
as it ought to be
 
04:11:06.479 --> 04:11:07.590 align:start position:0%
as it ought to be
and

04:11:07.590 --> 04:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:11:11.670 --> 04:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
i think that we it's worthy of some
 
04:11:16.550 --> 04:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:16.560 --> 04:11:19.750 align:start position:0%
 
anyone

04:11:19.750 --> 04:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:21.670 --> 04:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
all else seeing none the motion is ought
 
04:11:23.510 --> 04:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
to pass as amended
 
04:11:28.149 --> 04:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:30.790 --> 04:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh madam chair did you wish to bring up
 
04:11:30.800 --> 04:11:31.670 align:start position:0%
uh madam chair did you wish to bring up
the

04:11:31.670 --> 04:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:11:34.469 --> 04:11:34.479 align:start position:0%
matter that we discussed oh yes
 
04:11:37.269 --> 04:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
the other issue is that the ways and
 
04:11:38.790 --> 04:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
means committee
 
04:11:40.870 --> 04:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
is concerned that we're looking at the
 
04:11:43.429 --> 04:11:43.439 align:start position:0%
funding in the study committee
 
04:11:43.439 --> 04:11:44.469 align:start position:0%
funding in the study committee
and

04:11:44.469 --> 04:11:44.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:11:49.110 --> 04:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
they would like to be represented on it
 
04:11:49.120 --> 04:11:49.910 align:start position:0%
they would like to be represented on it
and

04:11:49.910 --> 04:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:11:52.149 --> 04:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
so if that were to be
 
04:11:55.830 --> 04:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:59.110 --> 04:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
specify a third member or
 
04:12:01.189 --> 04:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
make a bigger committee
 
04:12:02.550 --> 04:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
and i'd
 
04:12:04.870 --> 04:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
like to hear the committee which is
 
04:12:07.510 --> 04:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
wants to to make such an amendment
 
04:12:09.510 --> 04:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
representative pearson i just have a
 
04:12:11.590 --> 04:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
question in reference to
 
04:12:14.309 --> 04:12:14.319 align:start position:0%
uh you know ways and means
 
04:12:17.269 --> 04:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
looks at you know how how we fund things
 
04:12:18.870 --> 04:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
typically with these committees they're
 
04:12:20.630 --> 04:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
funded through
 
04:12:22.630 --> 04:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
when the oplc sets the fees they're
 
04:12:24.469 --> 04:12:24.479 align:start position:0%
funded through the fees so
 
04:12:26.309 --> 04:12:26.319 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't really know that ways
 
04:12:28.469 --> 04:12:28.479 align:start position:0%
and means necessarily has to be involved
 
04:12:30.630 --> 04:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
here unless they're unless they think
 
04:12:31.990 --> 04:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
we're they're going to be coming up with
 
04:12:34.149 --> 04:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
alternative funding methods other than
 
04:12:36.149 --> 04:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
the current price the reason they think
 
04:12:39.110 --> 04:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
they should be involved is that we took
 
04:12:41.670 --> 04:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
the study committee on funding
 
04:12:45.189 --> 04:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
out of senate bill 313 and folded it
 
04:12:47.429 --> 04:12:47.439 align:start position:0%
into the study committee here
 
04:12:49.670 --> 04:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
seeing as how the
 
04:12:51.189 --> 04:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
i don't know about you but i had a
 
04:12:53.110 --> 04:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
massive fear i'd be appointed both of
 
04:12:53.120 --> 04:12:54.550 align:start position:0%
massive fear i'd be appointed both of
them

04:12:54.550 --> 04:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:12:56.870 --> 04:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
and and their the functions of the two
 
04:12:58.630 --> 04:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
study committees were close enough that
 
04:13:00.870 --> 04:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
it made sense to combine them
 
04:13:05.670 --> 04:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:05.680 --> 04:13:09.349 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:13:09.349 --> 04:13:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:10.950 --> 04:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
i would be delighted to have a member
 
04:13:12.790 --> 04:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
for ways and means but i'm not sure it's
 
04:13:14.950 --> 04:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
necessary because we're not going to be
 
04:13:17.349 --> 04:13:17.359 align:start position:0%
changing the
 
04:13:19.830 --> 04:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
the concept that the license fees bring
 
04:13:21.510 --> 04:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
in enough
 
04:13:24.070 --> 04:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
to cover their expenses but
 
04:13:25.990 --> 04:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
i'm willing to bow to the rest of the
 
04:13:29.429 --> 04:13:29.439 align:start position:0%
committee to say that we should consider
 
04:13:31.910 --> 04:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative uh platinum and
 
04:13:33.670 --> 04:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
bailey and then shewit
 
04:13:35.990 --> 04:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
okay the way i read the amendment that
 
04:13:37.670 --> 04:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
just passed is three members of the
 
04:13:39.910 --> 04:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
house of representatives two of
 
04:13:42.149 --> 04:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
whom are spoken for health and human
 
04:13:43.990 --> 04:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
services and uh
 
04:13:47.030 --> 04:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
human service and elderly affairs uh
 
04:13:49.429 --> 04:13:49.439 align:start position:0%
excuse me executive edna and health and
 
04:13:50.870 --> 04:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
human services and early affairs which
 
04:13:52.630 --> 04:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
leaves a third member which could be
 
04:13:54.389 --> 04:13:54.399 align:start position:0%
from ways and means
 
04:13:55.990 --> 04:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
i would agree with that as well
 
04:13:58.309 --> 04:13:58.319 align:start position:0%
representative bailey
 
04:14:01.750 --> 04:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
oh okay thank you representative schuett
 
04:14:04.070 --> 04:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
04:14:06.309 --> 04:14:06.319 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i think that probably
 
04:14:10.229 --> 04:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
allows room for that person and
 
04:14:12.550 --> 04:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to
 
04:14:12.560 --> 04:14:13.750 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to
state

04:14:13.750 --> 04:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:14:15.910 --> 04:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
in the blurb that
 
04:14:17.670 --> 04:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
the committee felt that
 
04:14:20.149 --> 04:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
the third slot could go to a ways and
 
04:14:21.429 --> 04:14:21.439 align:start position:0%
means member
 
04:14:24.309 --> 04:14:24.319 align:start position:0%
i will say that the argument was put to
 
04:14:27.189 --> 04:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
me from a member of ways and means also
 
04:14:28.550 --> 04:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
that they had
 
04:14:31.429 --> 04:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
originally instituted the fees
 
04:14:35.110 --> 04:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
that existed in oplc but i
 
04:14:37.429 --> 04:14:37.439 align:start position:0%
counter pointed that that was some time
 
04:14:39.110 --> 04:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
ago that they did that they haven't
 
04:14:41.030 --> 04:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
really been involved
 
04:14:43.349 --> 04:14:43.359 align:start position:0%
in setting the fees for a number of
 
04:14:45.910 --> 04:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
years that i'm aware of it's mostly been
 
04:14:48.550 --> 04:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
through our committee and the senate
 
04:14:48.560 --> 04:14:50.630 align:start position:0%
through our committee and the senate
edna

04:14:50.630 --> 04:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
edna
 
04:14:50.640 --> 04:14:51.590 align:start position:0%
edna
okay

04:14:51.590 --> 04:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:14:53.590 --> 04:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
represent goalie
 
04:14:56.070 --> 04:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i too can go
 
04:14:58.309 --> 04:14:58.319 align:start position:0%
along with the amendment bill as amended
 
04:15:01.590 --> 04:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
um without the additional adding of

recommendations and a 3-1 or a 2-2
 
04:15:50.870 --> 04:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation will still get a minority

i don't see any reason to make any
changes

04:16:00.469 --> 04:16:00.479 align:start position:0%

appreciate your
 
04:17:23.510 --> 04:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
your committee reports as soon as
 
04:17:26.790 --> 04:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
possible like today
 
04:17:35.590 --> 04:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:37.510 --> 04:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
yeah we want to go over the amendment
 
04:17:39.590 --> 04:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
house bill senate bill 357
 
04:17:58.870 --> 04:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:03.030 --> 04:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
i hope so that is amendment 1625 correct
 
04:18:31.990 --> 04:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:32.000 --> 04:18:33.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:18:33.670 --> 04:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:18:36.950 --> 04:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:42.950 --> 04:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:45.269 --> 04:18:45.279 align:start position:0%
take him out of chair
 
04:18:46.309 --> 04:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
and i'll
 
04:18:49.030 --> 04:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
go back to the original just so we can
 
04:18:51.990 --> 04:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
make reference the
 
04:18:54.389 --> 04:18:54.399 align:start position:0%
senate bill 357 is was done at the
 
04:18:56.070 --> 04:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
request of the
 
04:18:58.389 --> 04:18:58.399 align:start position:0%
ptsd commission
 
04:18:58.399 --> 04:18:59.670 align:start position:0%
ptsd commission
and

04:18:59.670 --> 04:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:19:01.990 --> 04:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
what the
 
04:19:03.910 --> 04:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
it's not a total rewrite what this does
 
04:19:05.830 --> 04:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
is the in the it reestablishes the
 
04:19:07.590 --> 04:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
commission the commission
 
04:19:10.070 --> 04:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
was expiring and
 
04:19:14.670 --> 04:19:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:16.950 --> 04:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
re-re-establishes that commission
 
04:19:19.269 --> 04:19:19.279 align:start position:0%
so the new sections part two and beyond
 
04:19:21.269 --> 04:19:21.279 align:start position:0%
fixes a couple of things
 
04:19:22.710 --> 04:19:22.720 align:start position:0%
there was
 
04:19:22.720 --> 04:19:23.910 align:start position:0%
there was
um

04:19:23.910 --> 04:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:26.149 --> 04:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
there was a concern
 
04:19:26.159 --> 04:19:27.590 align:start position:0%
there was a concern
about

04:19:27.590 --> 04:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:19:30.149 --> 04:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
dispatchers that was they were they were
 
04:19:31.990 --> 04:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
added in
 
04:19:34.550 --> 04:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
one of the things that the
 
04:19:37.110 --> 04:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
chairman mcguire wanted to specify is
 
04:19:38.870 --> 04:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
that no current
 
04:19:41.030 --> 04:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
officers would be required to go to
 
04:19:43.590 --> 04:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
their respective academies
 
04:19:46.550 --> 04:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
there is a cost associated with that and
 
04:19:48.790 --> 04:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
so that was added into
 
04:19:50.389 --> 04:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
04:19:52.229 --> 04:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
on several locations where that would be
 
04:19:54.710 --> 04:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate as an example line 10 at the
 
04:19:54.720 --> 04:19:56.149 align:start position:0%
appropriate as an example line 10 at the
beginning

04:19:56.149 --> 04:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
04:19:56.159 --> 04:19:57.189 align:start position:0%
beginning
okay

04:19:57.189 --> 04:19:57.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:19:59.670 --> 04:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is it specifies
 
04:20:02.389 --> 04:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
that the annual refresher
 
04:20:02.399 --> 04:20:03.269 align:start position:0%
that the annual refresher
um

04:20:03.269 --> 04:20:03.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:06.630 --> 04:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
on this will be done online
 
04:20:09.590 --> 04:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
in as we heard from testimony from the
 
04:20:11.110 --> 04:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
various folks that's just something that
 
04:20:13.990 --> 04:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
would be included in their normal
 
04:20:15.590 --> 04:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
training schedules and something they
 
04:20:16.469 --> 04:20:16.479 align:start position:0%
can do
 
04:20:18.550 --> 04:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
where they're at and it doesn't require
 
04:20:19.910 --> 04:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
them to travel
 
04:20:22.309 --> 04:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
what it does also do this bill does is
 
04:20:25.030 --> 04:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
it puts into statute that when
 
04:20:26.389 --> 04:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
new hires are going through their
 
04:20:28.550 --> 04:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
respective academies they do go through
 
04:20:31.269 --> 04:20:31.279 align:start position:0%
the initial training on the
 
04:20:35.189 --> 04:20:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:37.349 --> 04:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
and finally the last thing it does is as
 
04:20:40.149 --> 04:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
has happened way too many times in the
 
04:20:41.990 --> 04:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
past the department of corrections has
 
04:20:44.309 --> 04:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
seemed to be the stepchild of things
 
04:20:44.319 --> 04:20:45.030 align:start position:0%
seemed to be the stepchild of things
so

04:20:45.030 --> 04:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:20:45.040 --> 04:20:45.990 align:start position:0%
so
the

04:20:45.990 --> 04:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:20:48.550 --> 04:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
online 28 it just repeats the law
 
04:20:50.469 --> 04:20:50.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement one but in reference to
 
04:20:52.630 --> 04:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
corrections officers mirroring the
 
04:20:54.710 --> 04:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
language that they need the training
 
04:20:57.349 --> 04:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
initially through their academy and that
 
04:20:59.030 --> 04:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
current officers are not required to go
 
04:21:01.189 --> 04:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
back to their respective academy
 
04:21:01.199 --> 04:21:01.910 align:start position:0%
back to their respective academy
for

04:21:01.910 --> 04:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:21:04.229 --> 04:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
any sort of refresher training
 
04:21:04.239 --> 04:21:05.670 align:start position:0%
any sort of refresher training
okay

04:21:05.670 --> 04:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:21:08.389 --> 04:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
thank you is there a second to this
 
04:21:11.269 --> 04:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
second okay
 
04:21:14.950 --> 04:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
who is that i'll go okay thank you
 
04:21:17.110 --> 04:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:21:19.910 --> 04:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your second
 
04:21:19.920 --> 04:21:21.189 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your second
nope

04:21:21.189 --> 04:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
nope
 
04:21:21.199 --> 04:21:25.269 align:start position:0%
nope
okay

04:21:25.269 --> 04:21:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:27.910 --> 04:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
i'd like to to comment that when i first
 
04:21:29.830 --> 04:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
saw the title of this bill i thought it
 
04:21:31.590 --> 04:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
was about training
 
04:21:33.269 --> 04:21:33.279 align:start position:0%
first responders to deal with
 
04:21:35.030 --> 04:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
individuals who have mental health
 
04:21:37.110 --> 04:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
issues but this is actually
 
04:21:39.429 --> 04:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
to provide mental health training for
 
04:21:41.189 --> 04:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
themselves which is
 
04:21:44.389 --> 04:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
also valid and important
 
04:21:46.309 --> 04:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
any other comments or questions
 
04:21:47.910 --> 04:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
represents like us
 
04:21:50.469 --> 04:21:50.479 align:start position:0%
i i support not requiring uh current
 
04:21:52.469 --> 04:21:52.479 align:start position:0%
officers to have to go to the academy
 
04:21:53.990 --> 04:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
for in person but
 
04:21:56.790 --> 04:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
um under this what kind of uh initial
 
04:21:58.070 --> 04:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
training would they get is there gonna
 
04:21:59.910 --> 04:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
be something online they'll get or or
 
04:21:59.920 --> 04:22:01.429 align:start position:0%
be something online they'll get or or
what

04:22:01.429 --> 04:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:22:02.710 --> 04:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
no when they're in their respective
 
04:22:04.630 --> 04:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
academies it would just be a
 
04:22:06.550 --> 04:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
module that they go through both
 
04:22:09.030 --> 04:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
academies do this already
 
04:22:09.040 --> 04:22:09.990 align:start position:0%
academies do this already
um

04:22:09.990 --> 04:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:11.110 --> 04:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
in a
 
04:22:12.630 --> 04:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
in a kind of a
 
04:22:14.550 --> 04:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
infant stage of the
 
04:22:16.389 --> 04:22:16.399 align:start position:0%
of the training so
 
04:22:18.389 --> 04:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
uh this would just
 
04:22:20.950 --> 04:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
make this one it would statutorily
 
04:22:22.950 --> 04:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
require it because right now it doesn't
 
04:22:24.309 --> 04:22:24.319 align:start position:0%
and two
 
04:22:26.630 --> 04:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
um this would allow both academies which
 
04:22:28.469 --> 04:22:28.479 align:start position:0%
are currently developing
 
04:22:30.630 --> 04:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
the training they're already doing it
 
04:22:30.640 --> 04:22:31.510 align:start position:0%
the training they're already doing it
just

04:22:31.510 --> 04:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:22:33.750 --> 04:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
just to make it codified that it's part
 
04:22:36.229 --> 04:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
of the both academy's processes i wasn't
 
04:22:38.149 --> 04:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
referring to the academy it's just uh
 
04:22:40.389 --> 04:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
what if anything for current offices
 
04:22:42.229 --> 04:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
okay that's all being developed by both
 
04:22:43.830 --> 04:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
academies currently and it's something
 
04:22:45.269 --> 04:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
that's done online they just sit down in
 
04:22:47.030 --> 04:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
front of a computer and watch like a
 
04:22:48.550 --> 04:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
it'd be like a one-hour refresher
 
04:22:50.070 --> 04:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
training annually
 
04:22:51.189 --> 04:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
all right thanks
 
04:22:53.670 --> 04:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
there's also the case that
 
04:22:55.429 --> 04:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
for recent graduates they would have
 
04:22:57.429 --> 04:22:57.439 align:start position:0%
gotten the initial courses
 
04:22:59.590 --> 04:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
which have been presented for a while i
 
04:23:01.349 --> 04:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's five years or what
 
04:23:03.510 --> 04:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
but there are some training already
 
04:23:03.520 --> 04:23:06.630 align:start position:0%
but there are some training already
correct

04:23:06.630 --> 04:23:06.640 align:start position:0%

the
 
04:28:53.189 --> 04:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
board can prosecute and judge
 
04:28:55.269 --> 04:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
unlicensed practice because we were
 
04:28:58.950 --> 04:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:01.990 --> 04:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
we did
 
04:29:04.550 --> 04:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
strengthen the last paragraph that the
 
04:29:07.990 --> 04:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:10.710 --> 04:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
actual alleged or suspected unlicensed
 
04:29:13.030 --> 04:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
activities which
 
04:29:15.269 --> 04:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
should cover any any incidents of
 
04:29:17.429 --> 04:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
unlicensed practice
 
04:29:20.550 --> 04:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
and they can report it to the attorney
 
04:29:23.030 --> 04:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
general for prosecution
 
04:29:25.269 --> 04:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
when they said that the
 
04:29:28.149 --> 04:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
attorney general wasn't paying attention
 
04:29:31.349 --> 04:29:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:33.590 --> 04:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee decided that having an
 
04:29:36.630 --> 04:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
official report from the
 
04:29:39.830 --> 04:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
board of land surveyors rather than from
 
04:29:42.229 --> 04:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
the professional organization would be
 
04:29:44.389 --> 04:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
more effective in stirring them to
 
04:29:44.399 --> 04:29:45.990 align:start position:0%
more effective in stirring them to
prosecute

04:29:45.990 --> 04:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
prosecute
 
04:29:48.309 --> 04:29:48.319 align:start position:0%
and we hope that that will be the case
 
04:29:48.319 --> 04:29:50.469 align:start position:0%
and we hope that that will be the case
where

04:29:50.469 --> 04:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:29:51.910 --> 04:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
and we'll see what happens and see if
 
04:29:53.429 --> 04:29:53.439 align:start position:0%
this helps
 
04:29:57.269 --> 04:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
they also reported that the
 
04:30:00.469 --> 04:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
registry of deeds is already required by
 
04:30:04.710 --> 04:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
law to verify that any map they receive
 
04:30:07.990 --> 04:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
is done by a licensed surveyor
 
04:30:10.790 --> 04:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
so that eliminates some of the issue
 
04:30:13.349 --> 04:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
and i didn't think trying to tell the
 
04:30:16.309 --> 04:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
planning boards not to accept
 
04:30:18.710 --> 04:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
casual maps
 
04:30:18.720 --> 04:30:19.590 align:start position:0%
casual maps
is

04:30:19.590 --> 04:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:30:21.429 --> 04:30:21.439 align:start position:0%
something that we can actually do in a
 
04:30:23.670 --> 04:30:23.680 align:start position:0%
short period of time i think that's a
 
04:30:25.670 --> 04:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
bill for another day that was at least
 
04:30:28.630 --> 04:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
my conclusion
 
04:30:32.389 --> 04:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
the part on a non-resident licensure is
 
04:30:34.870 --> 04:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
cleaned up and put into
 
04:30:34.880 --> 04:30:36.149 align:start position:0%
cleaned up and put into
rsa

04:30:36.149 --> 04:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
04:30:39.429 --> 04:30:39.439 align:start position:0%
310a 69 which already deals with
 
04:30:39.439 --> 04:30:40.830 align:start position:0%
310a 69 which already deals with
non-resident

04:30:40.830 --> 04:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
non-resident
 
04:30:43.349 --> 04:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
licensure and so what it does is that
 
04:30:43.359 --> 04:30:46.630 align:start position:0%
licensure and so what it does is that
the

04:30:46.630 --> 04:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:49.830 --> 04:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
requires the boards to be licensed in
 
04:30:51.510 --> 04:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
another state
 
04:30:53.269 --> 04:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
and has met the requirements for
 
04:30:53.279 --> 04:30:54.550 align:start position:0%
and has met the requirements for
licensure

04:30:54.550 --> 04:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
04:30:56.790 --> 04:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
the biggest and most significant of them
 
04:30:59.349 --> 04:30:59.359 align:start position:0%
is the exam by the board
 
04:31:00.309 --> 04:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
on the
 
04:31:04.389 --> 04:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
truly weird and unique new hampshire
 
04:31:06.229 --> 04:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
title issues
 
04:31:07.510 --> 04:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
they need to know that if they're going
 
04:31:09.189 --> 04:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
to work in the state
 
04:31:12.389 --> 04:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
so they will be tested for that
 
04:31:14.389 --> 04:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
and that as all land surveyors working
 
04:31:15.830 --> 04:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
in the state are
 
04:31:18.469 --> 04:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
and that's uh
 
04:31:19.910 --> 04:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
then it takes place at the beginning of
 
04:31:22.630 --> 04:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:26.950 --> 04:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
let's see representative goalie
 
04:31:29.269 --> 04:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair well i was not
 
04:31:31.030 --> 04:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
part of the subcommittee i did sit in
 
04:31:33.750 --> 04:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
that day um and listen to the folks and
 
04:31:35.750 --> 04:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
i i think we
 
04:31:36.830 --> 04:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
came up
 
04:31:39.750 --> 04:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
with good set of changes um removing the
 
04:31:39.760 --> 04:31:40.870 align:start position:0%
with good set of changes um removing the
penalties

04:31:40.870 --> 04:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
04:31:42.550 --> 04:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
um i think most people had questions as
 
04:31:44.070 --> 04:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
to where up to ten thousand dollars
 
04:31:46.469 --> 04:31:46.479 align:start position:0%
would go with the board as well as the
 
04:31:48.309 --> 04:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
issue of there was really no place to
 
04:31:50.469 --> 04:31:50.479 align:start position:0%
appeal the decision of the board um so
 
04:31:52.630 --> 04:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
removing that section i think was the
 
04:31:53.990 --> 04:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
right thing to do
 
04:31:56.149 --> 04:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
um and also if we you know we're going
 
04:31:58.149 --> 04:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
to remove the monetary penalties
 
04:32:00.149 --> 04:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
increasing it to a class a misdemeanor
 
04:32:02.389 --> 04:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
was also good with that
 
04:32:05.030 --> 04:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
and uh the other changes i'm okay with
 
04:32:07.510 --> 04:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
as well
 
04:32:10.550 --> 04:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
any other comments questions
 
04:32:13.830 --> 04:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:15.910 --> 04:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
thank you man of chair well i'm glad to
 
04:32:18.309 --> 04:32:18.319 align:start position:0%
see us do something i hope it's going to
 
04:32:20.469 --> 04:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
be enough because
 
04:32:22.710 --> 04:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
i i this is an issue that i've had some
 
04:32:25.110 --> 04:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
dealings with in the past with land
 
04:32:27.590 --> 04:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
surveying and i think that
 
04:32:29.990 --> 04:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
the current situation is really
 
04:32:30.000 --> 04:32:31.510 align:start position:0%
the current situation is really
astonishingly

04:32:31.510 --> 04:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
astonishingly
 
04:32:35.590 --> 04:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
lax and irresponsible on the part of
 
04:32:35.600 --> 04:32:36.550 align:start position:0%
lax and irresponsible on the part of
the

04:32:36.550 --> 04:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:32:39.030 --> 04:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
state because a few things involving
 
04:32:41.910 --> 04:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
property i think are more of
 
04:32:45.110 --> 04:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
more significant than establishing
 
04:32:47.269 --> 04:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
exactly where the heck it is
 
04:32:51.750 --> 04:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:51.760 --> 04:32:52.950 align:start position:0%
 
a

04:32:52.950 --> 04:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:32:56.389 --> 04:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
distance above sea level and so far
 
04:32:59.110 --> 04:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
if you get it wrong it can have
 
04:32:59.120 --> 04:33:00.830 align:start position:0%
if you get it wrong it can have
serious

04:33:00.830 --> 04:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
serious
 
04:33:03.750 --> 04:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
repercussions uh so i hope this is gonna
 
04:33:06.070 --> 04:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
work the way we think it is because i
 
04:33:09.029 --> 04:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
think this is a very big deal i i agree
 
04:33:10.949 --> 04:33:10.959 align:start position:0%
and i think it it's a good start to have
 
04:33:13.510 --> 04:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
the board investigate because
 
04:33:14.949 --> 04:33:14.959 align:start position:0%
i mean they know what
 
04:33:16.310 --> 04:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
surveying is and they know who's
 
04:33:16.320 --> 04:33:19.910 align:start position:0%
surveying is and they know who's
licensed

04:33:19.910 --> 04:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:23.189 --> 04:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
any other comments questions
 
04:33:25.590 --> 04:33:25.600 align:start position:0%

house bill that this was the companion

disagreement amongst the acupuncturists
 
04:36:16.150 --> 04:36:16.160 align:start position:0%

subcommittee and agreed upon language
 
04:36:20.310 --> 04:36:20.320 align:start position:0%

statute
 
04:36:43.670 --> 04:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
we also made a number of other minor
 
04:36:46.150 --> 04:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
changes to the bill we changed oriental
 
04:36:48.150 --> 04:36:48.160 align:start position:0%

04:36:49.429 --> 04:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
of places
 
04:36:50.789 --> 04:36:50.799 align:start position:0%
and we
 
04:36:54.869 --> 04:36:54.879 align:start position:0%
updated the names of the a c a h m
 
04:36:56.310 --> 04:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
and the uh
 
04:36:59.269 --> 04:36:59.279 align:start position:0%
ncc aom and added the phrase including
 
04:37:01.830 --> 04:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
its predecessors and successors in order
 
04:37:04.470 --> 04:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
to avoid having to amend the statute if
 
04:37:06.551 --> 04:37:06.561 align:start position:0%
they just changed their name
 
04:37:10.551 --> 04:37:10.561 align:start position:0%

important for new members uh what we did
 
04:37:17.429 --> 04:37:17.439 align:start position:0%
is we made this bill take effect one
 
04:37:20.310 --> 04:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
minute after house bill 1192 so that it
 
04:37:21.750 --> 04:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
will overwrite
 
04:37:23.510 --> 04:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
house bill 1192 which already went
 
04:37:25.029 --> 04:37:25.039 align:start position:0%
through this committee and that way
 
04:37:27.189 --> 04:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
there will be no
 
04:37:28.709 --> 04:37:28.719 align:start position:0%

04:41:41.110 --> 04:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
we would you know make another window
 
04:41:41.120 --> 04:41:42.070 align:start position:0%
we would you know make another window
where

04:41:42.070 --> 04:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:41:42.080 --> 04:41:42.788 align:start position:0%
where
new

04:41:42.788 --> 04:41:42.798 align:start position:0%
new
 
04:41:44.550 --> 04:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
nurses could uh
 
04:41:46.310 --> 04:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
could get licensed without you know
 
04:41:48.868 --> 04:41:48.878 align:start position:0%
emergency license without um
 
04:41:51.270 --> 04:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
taking a exam
 
04:41:51.280 --> 04:41:52.390 align:start position:0%
taking a exam
um

04:41:52.390 --> 04:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:52.400 --> 04:41:53.270 align:start position:0%
um
but

04:41:53.270 --> 04:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:41:55.830 --> 04:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh based on testimony we heard uh
 
04:41:58.230 --> 04:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
because this has a may issue if there
 
04:41:59.670 --> 04:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
was some sort of loophole like that in
 
04:42:05.270 --> 04:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:05.280 --> 04:42:08.628 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:42:08.628 --> 04:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:10.230 --> 04:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
and the economic representative goalie
 
04:42:12.628 --> 04:42:12.638 align:start position:0%
and then marsh
 
04:42:15.190 --> 04:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i will support
 
04:42:19.030 --> 04:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment after voting against it um
 
04:42:20.868 --> 04:42:20.878 align:start position:0%
in subcommittee
 
04:42:20.878 --> 04:42:21.670 align:start position:0%
in subcommittee
i

04:42:21.670 --> 04:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:42:23.750 --> 04:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
still question
 
04:42:25.830 --> 04:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
why ols wrote the amendment the way they
 
04:42:27.510 --> 04:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
did and couldn't use the language that
 
04:42:27.520 --> 04:42:28.310 align:start position:0%
did and couldn't use the language that
was

04:42:28.310 --> 04:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:42:29.990 --> 04:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
in the current bill in front of them in
 
04:42:31.750 --> 04:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
front of them that they wrote beforehand
 
04:42:33.750 --> 04:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
and just changed the date to
 
04:42:36.948 --> 04:42:36.958 align:start position:0%
july 31st 2023 like we had asked that
 
04:42:39.110 --> 04:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
they decided they needed to put in the
 
04:42:39.120 --> 04:42:39.990 align:start position:0%
they decided they needed to put in the
whole

04:42:39.990 --> 04:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
whole
 
04:42:40.000 --> 04:42:41.110 align:start position:0%
whole
um

04:42:41.110 --> 04:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:42.948 --> 04:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
first section of the bill that
 
04:42:44.470 --> 04:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
includes the
 
04:42:46.390 --> 04:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
temporary hill partner
 
04:42:48.868 --> 04:42:48.878 align:start position:0%
includes the um
 
04:42:50.390 --> 04:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
definition for
 
04:42:52.868 --> 04:42:52.878 align:start position:0%
student nursing and all that
 
04:42:54.550 --> 04:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
in there from the
 
04:42:56.550 --> 04:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
what was
 
04:42:58.628 --> 04:42:58.638 align:start position:0%
chaptered law that i had dan pull up for
 
04:43:00.310 --> 04:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
me so i could review it
 
04:43:02.708 --> 04:43:02.718 align:start position:0%
that was the current emergency language
 
04:43:05.190 --> 04:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
um that they chose all of a sudden that
 
04:43:07.350 --> 04:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
they needed to put in this bill versus
 
04:43:09.910 --> 04:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
just changing the date um but in just
 
04:43:11.910 --> 04:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
doing that um and reviewing it i'm
 
04:43:14.628 --> 04:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
comfortable with it now um that i don't
 
04:43:16.830 --> 04:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
believe it'll include any
 
04:43:19.270 --> 04:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
other student nurses going forward it's
 
04:43:21.110 --> 04:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
just those that are currently licensed
 
04:43:23.270 --> 04:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
under this statute thank you
 
04:43:25.750 --> 04:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative marsh yes
 
04:43:27.670 --> 04:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
thank you uh unlike representative
 
04:43:29.590 --> 04:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
goalie i'm afraid i cannot support this
 
04:43:31.590 --> 04:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
amendment and the reason why i've got to
 
04:43:33.910 --> 04:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
go slightly into the weeds as to how
 
04:43:36.070 --> 04:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
continuing medical education works for
 
04:43:38.948 --> 04:43:38.958 align:start position:0%
physicians if you look at lines 12-14
 
04:43:41.910 --> 04:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
and lines 22-24 what this amendment says
 
04:43:43.830 --> 04:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
is not withstanding any law rule to the
 
04:43:45.910 --> 04:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
contrary a medical provider should not
 
04:43:47.590 --> 04:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
be required to complete continuing
 
04:43:49.430 --> 04:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
education as the condition
 
04:43:51.590 --> 04:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
precedent to reactivating your license
 
04:43:51.600 --> 04:43:52.310 align:start position:0%
precedent to reactivating your license
or

04:43:52.310 --> 04:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:43:54.708 --> 04:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
getting an emergency license
 
04:43:57.350 --> 04:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
the way the continuing education
 
04:43:59.030 --> 04:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
cycle works for physicians in the state
 
04:44:00.868 --> 04:44:00.878 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire it's a two-year cycle
 
04:44:03.190 --> 04:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
so when a doctor does give up his
 
04:44:04.550 --> 04:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
license he
 
04:44:06.310 --> 04:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
most often has not done continuing
 
04:44:08.868 --> 04:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
education for two years
 
04:44:10.150 --> 04:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
possibly three because he could have
 
04:44:12.070 --> 04:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
done all of his continuing education in
 
04:44:14.628 --> 04:44:14.638 align:start position:0%
the first year of the prior cycle
 
04:44:16.150 --> 04:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
then we're giving them a three year time
 
04:44:17.990 --> 04:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
period whereby they can reactivate their
 
04:44:20.708 --> 04:44:20.718 align:start position:0%
license and then if they get a license
 
04:44:22.390 --> 04:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
they have another two year cycle before
 
04:44:23.830 --> 04:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
they have to finish completing any
 
04:44:25.670 --> 04:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
medical education
 
04:44:27.270 --> 04:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
if i add those numbers up that makes
 
04:44:29.590 --> 04:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
either seven or eight years during which
 
04:44:31.350 --> 04:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
time a physician would not be required
 
04:44:33.750 --> 04:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
to do any continuing medical education
 
04:44:36.708 --> 04:44:36.718 align:start position:0%
whatsoever i believe that is a threat to
 
04:44:38.708 --> 04:44:38.718 align:start position:0%
the public health and not in the best
 
04:44:40.070 --> 04:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
interests of the citizens of the state
 
04:44:41.430 --> 04:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire so i will be voting
 
04:44:43.430 --> 04:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
against this amendment and if adopted i
 
04:44:45.990 --> 04:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
will vote against the bill
 
04:44:48.310 --> 04:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any other comments
 
04:44:48.320 --> 04:44:59.910 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any other comments
questions

04:44:59.910 --> 04:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:02.070 --> 04:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
okay not seeing any other representative
 
04:45:02.080 --> 04:45:03.190 align:start position:0%
okay not seeing any other representative
schmidt

04:45:03.190 --> 04:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
schmidt
 
04:45:05.110 --> 04:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
i think we ought to uh
 
04:45:07.430 --> 04:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
consider very carefully uh
 
04:45:12.628 --> 04:45:12.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:12.638 --> 04:45:13.670 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:45:13.670 --> 04:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:45:13.680 --> 04:45:15.030 align:start position:0%
yes
it

04:45:15.030 --> 04:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:45:17.510 --> 04:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
that section is not unique to physicians
 
04:45:20.470 --> 04:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
it's any medical provider which includes
 
04:45:21.990 --> 04:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
everybody from
 
04:45:24.868 --> 04:45:24.878 align:start position:0%
occupational therapists on up
 
04:45:26.550 --> 04:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
so i'm
 
04:45:26.560 --> 04:45:28.868 align:start position:0%
so i'm
um

04:45:28.868 --> 04:45:28.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:30.788 --> 04:45:30.798 align:start position:0%
what would you suggest
 
04:45:32.470 --> 04:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh madam chair i'm not as familiar with
 
04:45:34.150 --> 04:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
their continuing education requirements
 
04:45:35.750 --> 04:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
because i have not lived their life but
 
04:45:41.830 --> 04:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:43.270 --> 04:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
i have a question okay
 
04:45:43.280 --> 04:45:44.230 align:start position:0%
i have a question okay
um

04:45:44.230 --> 04:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:44.240 --> 04:45:50.948 align:start position:0%
um
pearson

04:45:50.948 --> 04:45:50.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:52.470 --> 04:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to make sure that we
 
04:45:53.910 --> 04:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
have not
 
04:45:55.830 --> 04:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
also included emergency medical
 
04:45:58.470 --> 04:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
technicians in this
 
04:46:00.150 --> 04:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
because that that would be substantially
 
04:46:02.230 --> 04:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
problematic are they considered medical
 
04:46:04.550 --> 04:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
providers they carry medical property
 
04:46:06.628 --> 04:46:06.638 align:start position:0%
well they carry licenses by the state i
 
04:46:07.750 --> 04:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
just don't know i don't know that it
 
04:46:10.628 --> 04:46:10.638 align:start position:0%
necessarily falls under this statute so
 
04:46:12.470 --> 04:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
they're not under the office of
 
04:46:14.708 --> 04:46:14.718 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
04:46:16.390 --> 04:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
they're under the
 
04:46:17.830 --> 04:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
department of safety correct they are
 
04:46:19.350 --> 04:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
under the department of safety so i
 
04:46:22.390 --> 04:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:25.670 --> 04:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:28.310 --> 04:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
04:46:30.550 --> 04:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
thank you manager uh
 
04:46:33.430 --> 04:46:33.440 align:start position:0%
my guess and i would
 
04:46:35.830 --> 04:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
strongly i believe that
 
04:46:37.510 --> 04:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
they would not fall into this they are
 
04:46:40.070 --> 04:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
not licensed by oak plc these are all
 
04:46:42.070 --> 04:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
licensees that i believe were through
 
04:46:44.390 --> 04:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
oplc and dealing with where as you
 
04:46:44.400 --> 04:46:45.430 align:start position:0%
oplc and dealing with where as you
stated

04:46:45.430 --> 04:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
stated
 
04:46:47.830 --> 04:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
emts are through department of safety
 
04:46:51.110 --> 04:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
yeah 3310 is oplcs okay
 
04:46:52.150 --> 04:46:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:46:58.230 --> 04:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:05.030 --> 04:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:07.830 --> 04:47:07.840 align:start position:0%
the license the continuing education for
 
04:47:07.840 --> 04:47:15.350 align:start position:0%
the license the continuing education for
physicians

04:47:15.350 --> 04:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:17.270 --> 04:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
we don't require continuing education
 
04:47:19.270 --> 04:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
for someone who gets an initial license
 
04:47:21.270 --> 04:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
do we
 
04:47:22.948 --> 04:47:22.958 align:start position:0%
well you're required to pass an exam and
 
04:47:25.910 --> 04:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
complete medical school
 
04:47:27.990 --> 04:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
well these things there's nothing to it
 
04:47:28.000 --> 04:47:29.270 align:start position:0%
well these things there's nothing to it
yeah

04:47:29.270 --> 04:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:47:31.990 --> 04:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
no but if you are say a practicing
 
04:47:34.150 --> 04:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
physician in another state
 
04:47:36.708 --> 04:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
we don't require any special
 
04:47:39.750 --> 04:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
continuing education before
 
04:47:41.350 --> 04:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
giving them a new hampshire license do
 
04:47:41.360 --> 04:47:42.550 align:start position:0%
giving them a new hampshire license do
we

04:47:42.550 --> 04:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:47:44.070 --> 04:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to that question
 
04:47:46.310 --> 04:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
i can tell you what it was uh 35 years
 
04:47:47.830 --> 04:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
ago when i got my license i don't think
 
04:47:49.590 --> 04:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
that's wrong i would suspect that is no
 
04:47:53.510 --> 04:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:55.750 --> 04:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
represented maybe we ought to pull this
 
04:47:57.350 --> 04:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
off the
 
04:47:59.670 --> 04:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
agenda for the moment and
 
04:48:01.990 --> 04:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
move to things where where we don't have
 
04:48:04.390 --> 04:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
questions outstanding well
 
04:48:06.708 --> 04:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
i what i need to do is make sure that we
 
04:48:09.190 --> 04:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
proceed with it because
 
04:48:11.350 --> 04:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not willing to accept the bill as
 
04:48:11.360 --> 04:48:12.550 align:start position:0%
i'm not willing to accept the bill as
written

04:48:12.550 --> 04:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
written
 
04:48:12.560 --> 04:48:14.070 align:start position:0%
written
and

04:48:14.070 --> 04:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:48:15.750 --> 04:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
if the rest of the committee is not
 
04:48:17.590 --> 04:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
willing to accept this amendment we've
 
04:48:17.600 --> 04:48:18.788 align:start position:0%
willing to accept this amendment we've
got

04:48:18.788 --> 04:48:18.798 align:start position:0%
got
 
04:48:22.390 --> 04:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:24.868 --> 04:48:24.878 align:start position:0%
mr tory could you find out what the
 
04:48:26.868 --> 04:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
continuing education requirements are
 
04:48:28.708 --> 04:48:28.718 align:start position:0%
for physicians coming here from another
 
04:48:28.718 --> 04:48:32.788 align:start position:0%
for physicians coming here from another
state

04:48:32.788 --> 04:48:32.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:39.510 --> 04:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:41.670 --> 04:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:48:44.788 --> 04:48:44.798 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i also just
 
04:48:46.708 --> 04:48:46.718 align:start position:0%
so the committee knows that this also
 
04:48:48.070 --> 04:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
states that
 
04:48:48.080 --> 04:48:50.230 align:start position:0%
states that
um

04:48:50.230 --> 04:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:52.948 --> 04:48:52.958 align:start position:0%
oplc may
 
04:48:54.628 --> 04:48:54.638 align:start position:0%
produce a license for these individuals
 
04:48:56.550 --> 04:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say they shall so there still
 
04:48:58.070 --> 04:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
is discretion there as to where they're
 
04:48:58.080 --> 04:48:59.270 align:start position:0%
is discretion there as to where they're
qualified

04:48:59.270 --> 04:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
qualified
 
04:48:59.280 --> 04:49:01.670 align:start position:0%
qualified
well

04:49:01.670 --> 04:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:04.948 --> 04:49:04.958 align:start position:0%
i that's nice to know but i'm if the if
 
04:49:06.628 --> 04:49:06.638 align:start position:0%
the committee is seriously concerned
 
04:49:09.510 --> 04:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
that we want to require
 
04:49:11.830 --> 04:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
continuing education or some education
 
04:49:14.628 --> 04:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
or even a note that they
 
04:49:16.708 --> 04:49:16.718 align:start position:0%
they must complete continuing education
 
04:49:18.470 --> 04:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
within six months of getting that
 
04:49:22.150 --> 04:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
license which might be one way to do it
 
04:49:22.160 --> 04:49:25.590 align:start position:0%
license which might be one way to do it
um

04:49:25.590 --> 04:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:26.708 --> 04:49:26.718 align:start position:0%
like us
 
04:49:29.030 --> 04:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
i i was just going to ask if
 
04:49:30.868 --> 04:49:30.878 align:start position:0%
if representative marsh had some
 
04:49:32.550 --> 04:49:32.560 align:start position:0%
suggestion on how to change this that
 
04:49:32.560 --> 04:49:33.670 align:start position:0%
suggestion on how to change this that
would

04:49:33.670 --> 04:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:49:35.510 --> 04:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
satisfy him
 
04:49:37.910 --> 04:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
i would be satisfied if they were
 
04:49:39.670 --> 04:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
current on their continuing education at
 
04:49:42.788 --> 04:49:42.798 align:start position:0%
the time of being reissued a license
 
04:49:44.230 --> 04:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
and some language to that effect could
 
04:49:46.310 --> 04:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
certainly be drafted
 
04:49:51.030 --> 04:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you okay thank you
 
04:49:55.670 --> 04:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:57.750 --> 04:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
all right we'll we will in fact take a
 
04:49:59.270 --> 04:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
recess on this
 
04:50:02.628 --> 04:50:02.638 align:start position:0%
after rep after mr tory reports to us
 
04:50:04.868 --> 04:50:04.878 align:start position:0%
representing marsh i'll be looking for a
 
04:50:07.750 --> 04:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
change to this amendment that we can
 
04:50:09.670 --> 04:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
discuss and then go for a final
 
04:50:09.680 --> 04:50:12.390 align:start position:0%
discuss and then go for a final
amendment

04:50:12.390 --> 04:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:12.400 --> 04:50:13.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:50:13.590 --> 04:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:50:15.670 --> 04:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
moving right along
 
04:50:21.750 --> 04:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:24.150 --> 04:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
let's see where's my amendment on i have
 
04:50:35.510 --> 04:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:37.510 --> 04:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
you haven't
 
04:50:40.788 --> 04:50:40.798 align:start position:0%
give us a number it i believe it's 16 45
 
04:50:44.830 --> 04:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
correct 1645 okay i move amendment
 
04:50:46.628 --> 04:50:46.638 align:start position:0%
1645 to
 
04:50:50.310 --> 04:50:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:52.708 --> 04:50:52.718 align:start position:0%
this amendment is almost identical to
 
04:50:56.230 --> 04:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
the non-germane amendment we heard
 
04:50:56.240 --> 04:50:57.110 align:start position:0%
the non-germane amendment we heard
to

04:50:57.110 --> 04:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:50:59.430 --> 04:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
expand jail car
 
04:51:03.270 --> 04:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
except that it corrects the number of
 
04:51:05.830 --> 04:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
members of each party that are going to
 
04:51:07.190 --> 04:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
be appointed
 
04:51:09.910 --> 04:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
per representative goalie's request
 
04:51:11.030 --> 04:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
because i
 
04:51:14.948 --> 04:51:14.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:17.110 --> 04:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
and i will say
 
04:51:19.030 --> 04:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
well first is there a second
 
04:51:21.510 --> 04:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
i'll second it okay thank you i was
 
04:51:24.868 --> 04:51:24.878 align:start position:0%
waiting for that all right and i i will
 
04:51:26.550 --> 04:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
comment that
 
04:51:30.310 --> 04:51:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:32.868 --> 04:51:32.878 align:start position:0%
improvements based on this amendment
 
04:51:34.470 --> 04:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
the first
 
04:51:37.430 --> 04:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
and most obvious and important
 
04:51:39.510 --> 04:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
is that each member of jail card will
 
04:51:43.670 --> 04:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
have one third of the total work
 
04:51:43.680 --> 04:51:44.390 align:start position:0%
have one third of the total work
that

04:51:44.390 --> 04:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:51:48.310 --> 04:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
members have now and i think that's
 
04:51:51.030 --> 04:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
going to be really important in terms of
 
04:51:53.350 --> 04:51:53.360 align:start position:0%
recruitment and retention
 
04:51:55.750 --> 04:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
the current workload means that if
 
04:51:55.760 --> 04:51:57.030 align:start position:0%
the current workload means that if
you're

04:51:57.030 --> 04:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
you're
 
04:51:59.590 --> 04:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
really diligent you can skim through
 
04:52:03.190 --> 04:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
most of the the rules before the meeting
 
04:52:06.070 --> 04:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
i read fast but i can't get through the
 
04:52:08.788 --> 04:52:08.798 align:start position:0%
entire packet every every time
 
04:52:11.270 --> 04:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
and so i would expect that having a
 
04:52:13.910 --> 04:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
lesser workload would make it easier for
 
04:52:16.788 --> 04:52:16.798 align:start position:0%
the p to people to
 
04:52:19.270 --> 04:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
review the review the rules in front of
 
04:52:20.550 --> 04:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
them and
 
04:52:23.110 --> 04:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
do a better job with them
 
04:52:25.590 --> 04:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
uh the second advantage is that we'll
 
04:52:27.990 --> 04:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
get more members of the house
 
04:52:30.948 --> 04:52:30.958 align:start position:0%
involved in the rulemaking process
 
04:52:33.270 --> 04:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
and i think that will help them to take
 
04:52:36.550 --> 04:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
it more seriously we get we keep trying
 
04:52:38.868 --> 04:52:38.878 align:start position:0%
to get other people on committees other
 
04:52:42.628 --> 04:52:42.638 align:start position:0%
than the edna to take rules seriously
 
04:52:45.030 --> 04:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
but it is
 
04:52:47.270 --> 04:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
it's an uphill battle i think if we have
 
04:52:49.910 --> 04:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
more people who are not on the edna
 
04:52:52.868 --> 04:52:52.878 align:start position:0%
involved on jail car and reading the
 
04:52:54.948 --> 04:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
rules they will understand how important
 
04:52:56.070 --> 04:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:52:58.948 --> 04:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
and therefore be more involved
 
04:53:01.110 --> 04:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
and the third reason is that it's
 
04:53:01.120 --> 04:53:02.788 align:start position:0%
and the third reason is that it's
possible

04:53:02.788 --> 04:53:02.798 align:start position:0%
possible
 
04:53:05.510 --> 04:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
in rare cases that a member would have
 
04:53:07.590 --> 04:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
some knowledge of
 
04:53:10.070 --> 04:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
legislative intent or the
 
04:53:11.990 --> 04:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
business that
 
04:53:12.000 --> 04:53:13.830 align:start position:0%
business that
the

04:53:13.830 --> 04:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:53:16.150 --> 04:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
the staff doesn't have
 
04:53:17.830 --> 04:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
and you know really this isn't going to
 
04:53:20.150 --> 04:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
happen very often but once in a while
 
04:53:21.670 --> 04:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
it'll be useful
 
04:53:23.990 --> 04:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
it'll be particularly handy in cases
 
04:53:26.470 --> 04:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
where we have conflicting statutes which
 
04:53:27.750 --> 04:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
comes up more
 
04:53:29.670 --> 04:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
more often than you would think
 
04:53:31.510 --> 04:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
they try to write the rule and they say
 
04:53:33.830 --> 04:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
well you know this the statute says this
 
04:53:35.430 --> 04:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
but this other statute says something
 
04:53:35.440 --> 04:53:36.310 align:start position:0%
but this other statute says something
else

04:53:36.310 --> 04:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
else
 
04:53:39.590 --> 04:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
it hap and getting that kind of
 
04:53:41.590 --> 04:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
problem resolved is
 
04:53:43.430 --> 04:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
always a
 
04:53:46.070 --> 04:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
hard to do elegantly so i would support
 
04:53:48.868 --> 04:53:48.878 align:start position:0%
that representative pearson
 
04:53:50.788 --> 04:53:50.798 align:start position:0%
thank you man chair and uh the other
 
04:53:52.310 --> 04:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
thing too is
 
04:53:53.910 --> 04:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
as far as looking at the structure of
 
04:53:55.910 --> 04:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
this i mean this is an in this is fairly
 
04:53:57.910 --> 04:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
similar to how we broke up finance
 
04:54:00.070 --> 04:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
with the uh
 
04:54:01.750 --> 04:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
because of due to their workload with
 
04:54:01.760 --> 04:54:02.948 align:start position:0%
because of due to their workload with
the

04:54:02.948 --> 04:54:02.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:54:04.628 --> 04:54:04.638 align:start position:0%
you know just just as a reminder on the
 
04:54:07.590 --> 04:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
top of page two it does just talk about
 
04:54:11.190 --> 04:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
the authorities and how when the full
 
04:54:11.200 --> 04:54:12.230 align:start position:0%
the authorities and how when the full
committee

04:54:12.230 --> 04:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:54:14.788 --> 04:54:14.798 align:start position:0%
is involved and whatnot so
 
04:54:14.798 --> 04:54:15.750 align:start position:0%
is involved and whatnot so
um

04:54:15.750 --> 04:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:54:17.510 --> 04:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
i think with the also too with the
 
04:54:18.948 --> 04:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
situation now where rules have
 
04:54:21.510 --> 04:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
expiration dates and they have to be re
 
04:54:21.520 --> 04:54:23.270 align:start position:0%
expiration dates and they have to be re
reviewed

04:54:23.270 --> 04:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
reviewed
 
04:54:24.868 --> 04:54:24.878 align:start position:0%
we're we're getting ourselves into a
 
04:54:26.628 --> 04:54:26.638 align:start position:0%
situation where jail car is going to
 
04:54:26.638 --> 04:54:27.510 align:start position:0%
situation where jail car is going to
become

04:54:27.510 --> 04:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
become
 
04:54:30.470 --> 04:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
literally a full-time job so without
 
04:54:32.310 --> 04:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
this i can tell you without this there's
 
04:54:33.830 --> 04:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
zero chance i'd ever want to be on jail
 
04:54:35.030 --> 04:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
car so
 
04:54:37.030 --> 04:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
i i think this is this is definitely
 
04:54:40.628 --> 04:54:40.638 align:start position:0%
necessary and i fully support it okay
 
04:54:43.670 --> 04:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
other comments or questions
 
04:54:46.310 --> 04:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
representative schuett
 
04:54:48.628 --> 04:54:48.638 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um
 
04:54:52.150 --> 04:54:52.160 align:start position:0%
as an alternate member of job carr
 
04:54:54.230 --> 04:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
we heard during the hearing on this
 
04:54:56.628 --> 04:54:56.638 align:start position:0%
non-german amendment that this is
 
04:54:58.628 --> 04:54:58.638 align:start position:0%
something that leadership was looking at
 
04:55:00.550 --> 04:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
for some time
 
04:55:00.560 --> 04:55:02.310 align:start position:0%
for some time
however

04:55:02.310 --> 04:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
however
 
04:55:03.990 --> 04:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
it was brought to us practically the
 
04:55:06.390 --> 04:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
last minute as a non-germane amendment
 
04:55:08.628 --> 04:55:08.638 align:start position:0%
on a bill that has nothing to do with
 
04:55:10.230 --> 04:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
the subject matter
 
04:55:12.310 --> 04:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
if it's been looked at for so long why
 
04:55:14.708 --> 04:55:14.718 align:start position:0%
were we not seeing it as
 
04:55:17.190 --> 04:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
a standalone bill that could be examined
 
04:55:19.110 --> 04:55:19.120 align:start position:0%
more thoroughly
 
04:55:21.590 --> 04:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
i think there could be
 
04:55:25.110 --> 04:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
some good issues in this i agree with
 
04:55:25.120 --> 04:55:26.788 align:start position:0%
some good issues in this i agree with
expanding

04:55:26.788 --> 04:55:26.798 align:start position:0%
expanding
 
04:55:29.750 --> 04:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
to more membership however i think
 
04:55:31.750 --> 04:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
i think we need to look at it a little
 
04:55:33.910 --> 04:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
more deeply
 
04:55:36.550 --> 04:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
i would prefer to not adopt this
 
04:55:39.750 --> 04:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
amendment or if we adopt the amendment
 
04:55:42.070 --> 04:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
end up putting the bill in interim study
 
04:55:46.470 --> 04:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
so that it can be looked at more deeply
 
04:55:49.270 --> 04:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
this was actually intended to be a
 
04:55:51.830 --> 04:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
perfectly germane amendment on the bill
 
04:55:55.190 --> 04:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
we had on the rule making process
 
04:55:57.510 --> 04:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
but the deadline slipped before we i
 
04:56:00.230 --> 04:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
could schedule before i could deal with
 
04:56:03.270 --> 04:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
it so this was intended to be an
 
04:56:05.270 --> 04:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
amendment to a house bill on the jail
 
04:56:07.350 --> 04:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
car process which we had
 
04:56:09.590 --> 04:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
and this was the first
 
04:56:13.830 --> 04:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity we had to deal with it
 
04:56:16.470 --> 04:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
i i do appreciate that however like i
 
04:56:18.788 --> 04:56:18.798 align:start position:0%
said i i would have even
 
04:56:19.990 --> 04:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
thought that it could have been brought
 
04:56:23.590 --> 04:56:23.600 align:start position:0%
forward as a bill a standalone bill
 
04:56:25.750 --> 04:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh unfortunately the speaker didn't talk
 
04:56:28.310 --> 04:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
to me until after until well after the
 
04:56:33.030 --> 04:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:36.230 --> 04:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
well but i will say that this year is
 
04:56:36.240 --> 04:56:37.510 align:start position:0%
well but i will say that this year is
unusual

04:56:37.510 --> 04:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
unusual
 
04:56:39.350 --> 04:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
in that it's
 
04:56:42.150 --> 04:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
the first time on edna
 
04:56:44.230 --> 04:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
that i've seen that we haven't had any
 
04:56:46.390 --> 04:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
bills trying to tweak the rulemaking
 
04:56:48.628 --> 04:56:48.638 align:start position:0%
process other than that one
 
04:56:48.638 --> 04:56:49.590 align:start position:0%
process other than that one
um

04:56:49.590 --> 04:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:51.270 --> 04:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
that we
 
04:56:52.948 --> 04:56:52.958 align:start position:0%
didn't want to use
 
04:56:52.958 --> 04:56:54.550 align:start position:0%
didn't want to use
and

04:56:54.550 --> 04:56:54.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:56:56.948 --> 04:56:56.958 align:start position:0%
you know it it's not that like this is a
 
04:56:59.350 --> 04:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
surprise people have been complaining
 
04:57:01.350 --> 04:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
that the rules don't quite meet
 
04:57:03.190 --> 04:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
legislative intent
 
04:57:04.948 --> 04:57:04.958 align:start position:0%
or their
 
04:57:07.750 --> 04:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
the agencies are doing things
 
04:57:09.110 --> 04:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
out of line
 
04:57:10.550 --> 04:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
so i
 
04:57:12.868 --> 04:57:12.878 align:start position:0%
i would say that you sh it shouldn't
 
04:57:14.470 --> 04:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
have been a surprise
 
04:57:17.670 --> 04:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
and that this is a fairly modest change
 
04:57:20.788 --> 04:57:20.798 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change the procedure except
 
04:57:22.708 --> 04:57:22.718 align:start position:0%
by splitting up the workload and that's
 
04:57:24.310 --> 04:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
why i thought that was the most
 
04:57:24.320 --> 04:57:25.430 align:start position:0%
why i thought that was the most
important

04:57:25.430 --> 04:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
important
 
04:57:28.390 --> 04:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
issue to bring forward that the work
 
04:57:31.510 --> 04:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
particularly this coming session when
 
04:57:33.990 --> 04:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
all the the rules the first 10 year
 
04:57:35.830 --> 04:57:35.840 align:start position:0%
rules are expiring
 
04:57:37.350 --> 04:57:37.360 align:start position:0%
so there's going to be a lot of rules
 
04:57:39.750 --> 04:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
coming through and i think having
 
04:57:42.390 --> 04:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
a third of the workload is a very
 
04:57:46.070 --> 04:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:48.550 --> 04:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
anyone else representing fellows
 
04:57:50.948 --> 04:57:50.958 align:start position:0%
um yeah i had two thoughts about this
 
04:57:52.868 --> 04:57:52.878 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
04:57:56.070 --> 04:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
one is i'm i'm not
 
04:57:58.230 --> 04:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
04:58:01.350 --> 04:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
adding another layer to the process is
 
04:58:04.150 --> 04:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
going to help eliminate the the workload
 
04:58:05.590 --> 04:58:05.600 align:start position:0%
that much because if you've got
 
04:58:09.670 --> 04:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
divisions then it raises questions about
 
04:58:11.830 --> 04:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
when does the public testify do they
 
04:58:14.948 --> 04:58:14.958 align:start position:0%
testify to the division and then testify
 
04:58:17.270 --> 04:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
again when you have the whole group
 
04:58:19.990 --> 04:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
or um
 
04:58:22.550 --> 04:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
the only time that the entire board has
 
04:58:24.150 --> 04:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
to get together if there is a final
 
04:58:28.070 --> 04:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
objection and a petition to the house
 
04:58:30.868 --> 04:58:30.878 align:start position:0%
well when does the public testify
 
04:58:30.878 --> 04:58:31.910 align:start position:0%
well when does the public testify
at

04:58:31.910 --> 04:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:58:34.628 --> 04:58:34.638 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on the rule
 
04:58:36.550 --> 04:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
in front of the agency is the most
 
04:58:39.350 --> 04:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
appropriate time or they could testify
 
04:58:45.510 --> 04:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:47.750 --> 04:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
so they that would be just a subgroup of
 
04:58:49.990 --> 04:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
the people who are going to act on it so
 
04:58:52.788 --> 04:58:52.798 align:start position:0%
i have no no the that would be the only
 
04:58:52.798 --> 04:58:53.910 align:start position:0%
i have no no the that would be the only
action

04:58:53.910 --> 04:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
action
 
04:58:56.470 --> 04:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
unless there's a final objection
 
04:58:58.788 --> 04:58:58.798 align:start position:0%
gelcar is a filter more than anything
 
04:58:58.798 --> 04:58:59.750 align:start position:0%
gelcar is a filter more than anything
else

04:58:59.750 --> 04:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
else
 
04:58:59.760 --> 04:59:00.788 align:start position:0%
else
it's

04:59:00.788 --> 04:59:00.798 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:59:01.910 --> 04:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
they say
 
04:59:04.070 --> 04:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
the assumption in jalakar is that the
 
04:59:06.310 --> 04:59:06.320 align:start position:0%
agency has done its job it has written
 
04:59:08.230 --> 04:59:08.240 align:start position:0%
the rules correctly
 
04:59:11.110 --> 04:59:11.120 align:start position:0%
and if it's and so we we just bless it
 
04:59:13.990 --> 04:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
and it goes into effect the only way we
 
04:59:15.270 --> 04:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
can stop
 
04:59:18.550 --> 04:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
stop a rule is by a
 
04:59:20.948 --> 04:59:20.958 align:start position:0%
final objection to the whole house and
 
04:59:25.350 --> 04:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:28.070 --> 04:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
triggered by testimony that is heard
 
04:59:30.070 --> 04:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
that's correct and if that were to
 
04:59:32.628 --> 04:59:32.638 align:start position:0%
happen then the entire jail car would
 
04:59:35.030 --> 04:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
meet to to consider that
 
04:59:36.868 --> 04:59:36.878 align:start position:0%
and so i would say that somebody would
 
04:59:39.190 --> 04:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
get three bites at the apple
 
04:59:40.390 --> 04:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
before the
 
04:59:43.350 --> 04:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
agency before the uh division and before
 
04:59:44.948 --> 04:59:44.958 align:start position:0%
the final uh
 
04:59:44.958 --> 04:59:46.788 align:start position:0%
the final uh
objection

04:59:46.788 --> 04:59:46.798 align:start position:0%
objection
 
04:59:49.510 --> 04:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
so well that that was just you know
 
04:59:52.788 --> 04:59:52.798 align:start position:0%
no i agree it's a concern
 
04:59:54.708 --> 04:59:54.718 align:start position:0%
and the other thing is
 
04:59:57.510 --> 04:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that it would be useful
 
05:00:00.470 --> 05:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
to have a study committee look at this
 
05:00:02.390 --> 05:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
and then we could get input from the
 
05:00:04.948 --> 05:00:04.958 align:start position:0%
agencies who have to write the rules
 
05:00:07.190 --> 05:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
and the people on gelcar
 
05:00:08.628 --> 05:00:08.638 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:00:12.390 --> 05:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
the public or or organizations that that
 
05:00:16.390 --> 05:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes testify before jail car just
 
05:00:18.708 --> 05:00:18.718 align:start position:0%
i'm just concerned about something that
 
05:00:21.510 --> 05:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
that is pretty has a pretty delicate
 
05:00:23.590 --> 05:00:23.600 align:start position:0%
balance in terms of being able to get
 
05:00:25.670 --> 05:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
through the process right now
 
05:00:25.680 --> 05:00:26.470 align:start position:0%
through the process right now
that

05:00:26.470 --> 05:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:00:28.230 --> 05:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
if we're going to make changes we want
 
05:00:30.550 --> 05:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we do all the right
 
05:00:32.788 --> 05:00:32.798 align:start position:0%
changes that are needed
 
05:00:34.550 --> 05:00:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you any other comments or
 
05:00:34.560 --> 05:00:35.910 align:start position:0%
thank you any other comments or
questions

05:00:35.910 --> 05:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:00:41.830 --> 05:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:44.628 --> 05:00:44.638 align:start position:0%
so i think that uh
 
05:00:46.390 --> 05:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
there are a number of incorrect
 
05:00:48.948 --> 05:00:48.958 align:start position:0%
assumptions that work here
 
05:00:52.150 --> 05:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
or misunderstandings
 
05:00:54.470 --> 05:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
and having served on the jail car now
 
05:00:54.480 --> 05:00:55.270 align:start position:0%
and having served on the jail car now
for

05:00:55.270 --> 05:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:00:56.868 --> 05:00:56.878 align:start position:0%
16 years
 
05:00:59.590 --> 05:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
i think i have some level of
 
05:01:02.788 --> 05:01:02.798 align:start position:0%
understanding of the entire process
 
05:01:02.798 --> 05:01:04.310 align:start position:0%
understanding of the entire process
and

05:01:04.310 --> 05:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:01:05.430 --> 05:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
i think
 
05:01:07.510 --> 05:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns are simply
 
05:01:10.310 --> 05:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
wrong-headed to the degree that
 
05:01:12.948 --> 05:01:12.958 align:start position:0%
there may be
 
05:01:12.958 --> 05:01:15.150 align:start position:0%
there may be
mis

05:01:15.150 --> 05:01:15.160 align:start position:0%
mis
 
05:01:18.708 --> 05:01:18.718 align:start position:0%
misapplication of the rules or
 
05:01:21.670 --> 05:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
a heavy-handedness on the part of
 
05:01:23.830 --> 05:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
agencies or departments
 
05:01:28.708 --> 05:01:28.718 align:start position:0%
uh this uh rewrite uh will not prevent
 
05:01:28.718 --> 05:01:30.628 align:start position:0%
uh this uh rewrite uh will not prevent
that

05:01:30.628 --> 05:01:30.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:01:32.390 --> 05:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
05:01:34.470 --> 05:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
the idea of
 
05:01:36.628 --> 05:01:36.638 align:start position:0%
getting into something as significant as
 
05:01:36.638 --> 05:01:37.510 align:start position:0%
getting into something as significant as
this

05:01:37.510 --> 05:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:01:40.470 --> 05:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
without having heard a word of testimony
 
05:01:40.480 --> 05:01:41.270 align:start position:0%
without having heard a word of testimony
from

05:01:41.270 --> 05:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:01:45.110 --> 05:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
scott eaton who basically created
 
05:01:48.070 --> 05:01:48.080 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules unit
 
05:01:51.670 --> 05:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
some 35 years ago
 
05:01:54.390 --> 05:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
and who served until about two months
 
05:01:54.400 --> 05:01:55.270 align:start position:0%
and who served until about two months
ago

05:01:55.270 --> 05:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
ago
 
05:01:57.750 --> 05:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
as is the executive director of the
 
05:02:00.230 --> 05:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
administrative rules unit
 
05:02:02.470 --> 05:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
and we also have the current acting
 
05:02:05.430 --> 05:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
director who's also been
 
05:02:05.440 --> 05:02:06.390 align:start position:0%
director who's also been
the

05:02:06.390 --> 05:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:02:06.400 --> 05:02:07.910 align:start position:0%
the
um

05:02:07.910 --> 05:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:10.628 --> 05:02:10.638 align:start position:0%
a member of the administrative rules or
 
05:02:10.638 --> 05:02:12.070 align:start position:0%
a member of the administrative rules or
unit

05:02:12.070 --> 05:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
unit
 
05:02:15.350 --> 05:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
he didn't get to testify
 
05:02:18.708 --> 05:02:18.718 align:start position:0%
and i think a study committee to look at
 
05:02:20.390 --> 05:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
the real issues
 
05:02:22.868 --> 05:02:22.878 align:start position:0%
and there are some
 
05:02:22.878 --> 05:02:23.990 align:start position:0%
and there are some
that

05:02:23.990 --> 05:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:02:24.000 --> 05:02:25.030 align:start position:0%
that
could

05:02:25.030 --> 05:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
could
 
05:02:25.040 --> 05:02:26.868 align:start position:0%
could
definitely

05:02:26.868 --> 05:02:26.878 align:start position:0%
definitely
 
05:02:26.878 --> 05:02:27.990 align:start position:0%
definitely
stand

05:02:27.990 --> 05:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
stand
 
05:02:28.000 --> 05:02:28.708 align:start position:0%
stand
have

05:02:28.708 --> 05:02:28.718 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:02:32.628 --> 05:02:32.638 align:start position:0%
an examination by a study committee i i
 
05:02:34.868 --> 05:02:34.878 align:start position:0%
wouldn't object to that at all
 
05:02:36.948 --> 05:02:36.958 align:start position:0%
because it can never hurt to look at
 
05:02:38.868 --> 05:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
things even if they've been in effect
 
05:02:41.510 --> 05:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
for a long time but here we are
 
05:02:42.948 --> 05:02:42.958 align:start position:0%
launching into
 
05:02:45.910 --> 05:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh you know a significant rewrite
 
05:02:47.270 --> 05:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh with
 
05:02:49.830 --> 05:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
some assumptions that the
 
05:02:53.030 --> 05:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
model of the the finance committee where
 
05:02:55.990 --> 05:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
divisions are absolutely necessary
 
05:02:57.430 --> 05:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
but where the
 
05:03:00.708 --> 05:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
full committee does vote on
 
05:03:05.030 --> 05:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:06.830 --> 05:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
is a bad
 
05:03:09.510 --> 05:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
analogy that's really not the way gel
 
05:03:11.990 --> 05:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
car works and the idea that you're going
 
05:03:13.910 --> 05:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
to have
 
05:03:16.708 --> 05:03:16.718 align:start position:0%
the the divisions
 
05:03:19.110 --> 05:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
make decisions just means that
 
05:03:21.830 --> 05:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the gel car won't have
 
05:03:21.840 --> 05:03:22.628 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the gel car won't have
seen

05:03:22.628 --> 05:03:22.638 align:start position:0%
seen
 
05:03:26.948 --> 05:03:26.958 align:start position:0%
uh you know a particular rule set
 
05:03:28.150 --> 05:03:28.160 align:start position:0%
at all
 
05:03:30.628 --> 05:03:30.638 align:start position:0%
uh unless there's a final objection
 
05:03:32.550 --> 05:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
which there rarely is
 
05:03:32.560 --> 05:03:34.070 align:start position:0%
which there rarely is
there

05:03:34.070 --> 05:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:03:37.190 --> 05:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
it's nothing is more common with gel car
 
05:03:38.948 --> 05:03:38.958 align:start position:0%
other than stuff that goes through on
 
05:03:40.628 --> 05:03:40.638 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar
 
05:03:40.638 --> 05:03:41.670 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar
um

05:03:41.670 --> 05:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:41.680 --> 05:03:42.948 align:start position:0%
um
uh

05:03:42.948 --> 05:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:03:45.270 --> 05:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
then for the committee to file a
 
05:03:45.280 --> 05:03:46.628 align:start position:0%
then for the committee to file a
preliminary

05:03:46.628 --> 05:03:46.638 align:start position:0%
preliminary
 
05:03:48.708 --> 05:03:48.718 align:start position:0%
objection the first time the rule comes
 
05:03:50.470 --> 05:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
before the jail card
 
05:03:50.480 --> 05:03:51.430 align:start position:0%
before the jail card
it's

05:03:51.430 --> 05:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:03:53.030 --> 05:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
a virtual
 
05:03:54.708 --> 05:03:54.718 align:start position:0%
certainty that
 
05:03:54.718 --> 05:03:56.390 align:start position:0%
certainty that
that

05:03:56.390 --> 05:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:03:59.590 --> 05:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
there will be preliminary objections
 
05:04:00.788 --> 05:04:00.798 align:start position:0%
which then
 
05:04:04.550 --> 05:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
gives the agency the slash department 45
 
05:04:04.560 --> 05:04:05.990 align:start position:0%
gives the agency the slash department 45
days

05:04:05.990 --> 05:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
days
 
05:04:10.150 --> 05:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
to come up with a a solution that is not
 
05:04:10.160 --> 05:04:11.830 align:start position:0%
to come up with a a solution that is not
objectionable

05:04:11.830 --> 05:04:11.840 align:start position:0%
objectionable
 
05:04:14.230 --> 05:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
and ordinarily that's what happens
 
05:04:17.270 --> 05:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
the agency slash department comes back
 
05:04:18.550 --> 05:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
in the
 
05:04:21.590 --> 05:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
within that 45-day period with wording
 
05:04:21.600 --> 05:04:22.390 align:start position:0%
within that 45-day period with wording
that

05:04:22.390 --> 05:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:04:24.390 --> 05:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
will find approval
 
05:04:26.628 --> 05:04:26.638 align:start position:0%
from the gel car
 
05:04:30.070 --> 05:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
and so i think this is rushed
 
05:04:33.750 --> 05:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
i think it's flawed i think it's
 
05:04:35.350 --> 05:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
wrong-headed in terms of its
 
05:04:37.190 --> 05:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
understanding of the process
 
05:04:39.350 --> 05:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh where in point of fact the
 
05:04:41.750 --> 05:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
the chair has already correctly
 
05:04:44.708 --> 05:04:44.718 align:start position:0%
enunciated that the rules the assumption
 
05:04:46.948 --> 05:04:46.958 align:start position:0%
is that the rules will be well written
 
05:04:50.788 --> 05:04:50.798 align:start position:0%
by the agency slash department
 
05:04:53.110 --> 05:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
and generally they are and they are the
 
05:04:55.590 --> 05:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
rules are written uh you know in
 
05:04:58.470 --> 05:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the stakeholders slash
 
05:04:58.480 --> 05:05:00.948 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the stakeholders slash
practitioners

05:05:00.948 --> 05:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
practitioners
 
05:05:03.510 --> 05:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
there's a public hearing to
 
05:05:05.750 --> 05:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
to hear that
 
05:05:08.230 --> 05:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
preliminary rule
 
05:05:08.240 --> 05:05:09.270 align:start position:0%
preliminary rule
and

05:05:09.270 --> 05:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:05:11.670 --> 05:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
work is done in that in that
 
05:05:15.510 --> 05:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
in that context as well and
 
05:05:18.070 --> 05:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
when it comes to us the second time
 
05:05:20.390 --> 05:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
to the jail car
 
05:05:23.030 --> 05:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
you know we have another public hearing
 
05:05:23.040 --> 05:05:24.310 align:start position:0%
you know we have another public hearing
and

05:05:24.310 --> 05:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:05:26.230 --> 05:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
i think the process works
 
05:05:28.628 --> 05:05:28.638 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily well
 
05:05:28.638 --> 05:05:30.070 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily well
and

05:05:30.070 --> 05:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:05:32.310 --> 05:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that i would object to
 
05:05:35.350 --> 05:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
looking at it in in line with some
 
05:05:37.910 --> 05:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
criticisms that have been raised but i
 
05:05:40.150 --> 05:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
think many of the criticisms and i've
 
05:05:42.788 --> 05:05:42.798 align:start position:0%
heard them over and over again in my 20
 
05:05:45.350 --> 05:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
years in the house
 
05:05:49.670 --> 05:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
that the agencies or departments are
 
05:05:51.350 --> 05:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
running amok
 
05:05:54.150 --> 05:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
they're running wild they're there they
 
05:05:56.948 --> 05:05:56.958 align:start position:0%
have plenary authority to do whatever
 
05:05:58.230 --> 05:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
they want
 
05:06:00.788 --> 05:06:00.798 align:start position:0%
that's complete balderdash
 
05:06:03.990 --> 05:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
hogwash and and ridiculous
 
05:06:06.390 --> 05:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
the agencies and departments
 
05:06:08.788 --> 05:06:08.798 align:start position:0%
are bound by their rules and to the
 
05:06:11.670 --> 05:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
degree that they are heavy-handed
 
05:06:13.990 --> 05:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
on some occasions we had one here in
 
05:06:18.070 --> 05:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
this committee with the remember the
 
05:06:18.080 --> 05:06:19.350 align:start position:0%
this committee with the remember the
clamshack

05:06:19.350 --> 05:06:19.360 align:start position:0%
clamshack
 
05:06:19.360 --> 05:06:21.110 align:start position:0%
clamshack
people

05:06:21.110 --> 05:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:06:23.430 --> 05:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
that had to put in this massive
 
05:06:25.830 --> 05:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh grease trap uh
 
05:06:27.910 --> 05:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
as a result of an order from the from
 
05:06:30.070 --> 05:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
the des
 
05:06:32.628 --> 05:06:32.638 align:start position:0%
i i i had to miss the first half of the
 
05:06:34.390 --> 05:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
hearing you know what it's like when you
 
05:06:36.310 --> 05:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
come in and halfway through a movie and
 
05:06:37.670 --> 05:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
you're trying to figure out what's going
 
05:06:37.680 --> 05:06:38.550 align:start position:0%
you're trying to figure out what's going
on

05:06:38.550 --> 05:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:06:41.510 --> 05:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh but but nevertheless i i i didn't
 
05:06:43.670 --> 05:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
think that there was a real argument
 
05:06:45.910 --> 05:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
that the agency had overstepped its
 
05:06:47.990 --> 05:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
authority but that's not going to be
 
05:06:50.708 --> 05:06:50.718 align:start position:0%
solved by this rewrite at all
 
05:06:53.750 --> 05:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
the agency is always uh
 
05:06:57.830 --> 05:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
you know potentially going to be
 
05:07:00.150 --> 05:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
going too far
 
05:07:03.670 --> 05:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
but but we haven't had if we had regular
 
05:07:05.190 --> 05:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
examples of that
 
05:07:07.590 --> 05:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
then i would say we we would need to fix
 
05:07:07.600 --> 05:07:09.350 align:start position:0%
then i would say we we would need to fix
that

05:07:09.350 --> 05:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:07:11.350 --> 05:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
not the rules themselves
 
05:07:13.990 --> 05:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
um so again i don't want to talk this to
 
05:07:16.310 --> 05:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
death and that's not my intention i just
 
05:07:18.310 --> 05:07:18.320 align:start position:0%
think that that this has
 
05:07:24.150 --> 05:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:26.948 --> 05:07:26.958 align:start position:0%
amend that statement a very low
 
05:07:29.830 --> 05:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
percentage chance of passing the senate
 
05:07:31.590 --> 05:07:31.600 align:start position:0%
just think about it
 
05:07:35.190 --> 05:07:35.200 align:start position:0%
this rewrite would put 12 members of the
 
05:07:35.200 --> 05:07:36.788 align:start position:0%
this rewrite would put 12 members of the
senate

05:07:36.788 --> 05:07:36.798 align:start position:0%
senate
 
05:07:39.350 --> 05:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
on jail card either as regular members
 
05:07:41.670 --> 05:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
or alternates
 
05:07:44.628 --> 05:07:44.638 align:start position:0%
that's half the senate
 
05:07:46.948 --> 05:07:46.958 align:start position:0%
if it were 12 members of the house which
 
05:07:48.390 --> 05:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
it will be
 
05:07:51.030 --> 05:07:51.040 align:start position:0%
or maybe it's a few more i'm i may be
 
05:07:52.948 --> 05:07:52.958 align:start position:0%
misremembering that
 
05:07:56.070 --> 05:07:56.080 align:start position:0%
that's what in a 400 member house
 
05:07:57.510 --> 05:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
that's a fraction
 
05:07:59.990 --> 05:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
whereas the reality is not only would it
 
05:08:00.000 --> 05:08:01.110 align:start position:0%
whereas the reality is not only would it
involve

05:08:01.110 --> 05:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
involve
 
05:08:02.470 --> 05:08:02.480 align:start position:0%
half the senate
 
05:08:05.270 --> 05:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
but virtually all the senators at one
 
05:08:07.190 --> 05:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
point or another have been on the have
 
05:08:09.750 --> 05:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
been on the jail car
 
05:08:12.390 --> 05:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
so they all have experience
 
05:08:14.470 --> 05:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
and i and i don't think that they will
 
05:08:17.990 --> 05:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
think that this is uh workable at all
 
05:08:20.230 --> 05:08:20.240 align:start position:0%
and we haven't heard from
 
05:08:22.788 --> 05:08:22.798 align:start position:0%
the public we haven't heard from
 
05:08:25.430 --> 05:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
the members of the administrative rules
 
05:08:27.350 --> 05:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
unit as i said
 
05:08:29.590 --> 05:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
so there's just no way in hell that i'm
 
05:08:30.788 --> 05:08:30.798 align:start position:0%
going to vote
 
05:08:32.628 --> 05:08:32.638 align:start position:0%
for this and i'm going to fight it if it
 
05:08:34.948 --> 05:08:34.958 align:start position:0%
if it passes this committee
 
05:08:37.270 --> 05:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
and if it passes the house i'll continue
 
05:08:39.350 --> 05:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
to fight it because i think it's a
 
05:08:41.590 --> 05:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
solution in search of a problem thank
 
05:08:44.788 --> 05:08:44.798 align:start position:0%
you representative schmidt i appreciate
 
05:08:47.430 --> 05:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
your honesty i will say that having only
 
05:08:49.750 --> 05:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
served 12 years on jail car
 
05:08:53.590 --> 05:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
i i'm more concerned about the fact that
 
05:08:56.550 --> 05:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
it is my experience that very few
 
05:08:59.430 --> 05:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
members actually read the rules they
 
05:09:01.590 --> 05:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
don't know what questions to ask because
 
05:09:04.470 --> 05:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
there's a stack like this
 
05:09:07.350 --> 05:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
my goal is to bring down the stack so
 
05:09:07.360 --> 05:09:09.110 align:start position:0%
my goal is to bring down the stack so
that

05:09:09.110 --> 05:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:09:09.120 --> 05:09:09.910 align:start position:0%
that
the

05:09:09.910 --> 05:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:09:13.430 --> 05:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
the rules will be looked at that's all i
 
05:09:16.470 --> 05:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
am not saying anything that will stop
 
05:09:19.030 --> 05:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
the agencies from
 
05:09:21.430 --> 05:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
going too far i mean i was probably on
 
05:09:23.190 --> 05:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
jail car when we passed that thousand
 
05:09:24.708 --> 05:09:24.718 align:start position:0%
gallon tank
 
05:09:27.350 --> 05:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
and you were too
 
05:09:30.070 --> 05:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
but we didn't it wasn't flagged by by
 
05:09:33.030 --> 05:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
the staff and neither of us knew enough
 
05:09:35.350 --> 05:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
about it to say a thousand gallon grease
 
05:09:35.360 --> 05:09:36.948 align:start position:0%
about it to say a thousand gallon grease
tank

05:09:36.948 --> 05:09:36.958 align:start position:0%
tank
 
05:09:38.310 --> 05:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:09:41.110 --> 05:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
i i mad i'm sure i doubt that came to
 
05:09:44.230 --> 05:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
the job card all that was an action of
 
05:09:47.030 --> 05:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
the de this is in their rules it's not
 
05:09:48.948 --> 05:09:48.958 align:start position:0%
in the law the thousand gallon tank is
 
05:09:51.990 --> 05:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
an action it's a rule of the of des it's
 
05:09:52.830 --> 05:09:52.840 align:start position:0%
in their
 
05:09:55.830 --> 05:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
rules specifically and it doesn't say
 
05:09:58.390 --> 05:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
any and if we had thought about it if we
 
05:10:00.550 --> 05:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
had realized god that's an enormous
 
05:10:01.990 --> 05:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
grease trap
 
05:10:04.948 --> 05:10:04.958 align:start position:0%
we could have said you know unless
 
05:10:07.590 --> 05:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
and when the des was here they say well
 
05:10:09.830 --> 05:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
we we can make allowances
 
05:10:11.750 --> 05:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
except their rule has no place for
 
05:10:11.760 --> 05:10:13.030 align:start position:0%
except their rule has no place for
allowances

05:10:13.030 --> 05:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
allowances
 
05:10:15.830 --> 05:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
all right so i think that the
 
05:10:17.670 --> 05:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
that just a little more knowledge might
 
05:10:20.470 --> 05:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
be very helpful and having a shorter
 
05:10:23.030 --> 05:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
stack of rules to read
 
05:10:25.830 --> 05:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
is going would be extremely helpful and
 
05:10:28.230 --> 05:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
that's why i'm pushing that as the major
 
05:10:31.510 --> 05:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
advantage yes the senate will be
 
05:10:33.510 --> 05:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
will be an issue and we'll have to deal
 
05:10:35.190 --> 05:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
with that but
 
05:10:37.990 --> 05:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
well a little more knowledge i think is
 
05:10:39.270 --> 05:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
a very
 
05:10:41.590 --> 05:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
wise statement and i think this
 
05:10:43.910 --> 05:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
committee with regard to this
 
05:10:46.470 --> 05:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
non-tremaine amendment which has you
 
05:10:48.948 --> 05:10:48.958 align:start position:0%
know had precious little
 
05:10:52.150 --> 05:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
hearing and precious little involvement
 
05:10:54.948 --> 05:10:54.958 align:start position:0%
it was properly noticed and announced
 
05:10:56.628 --> 05:10:56.638 align:start position:0%
and available in advance and
 
05:10:58.550 --> 05:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
specifically mentioned
 
05:11:00.550 --> 05:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
it was about jail car
 
05:11:02.788 --> 05:11:02.798 align:start position:0%
and the administrative rules agency
 
05:11:04.948 --> 05:11:04.958 align:start position:0%
decided not to send anybody even for
 
05:11:07.190 --> 05:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
information purposes
 
05:11:09.430 --> 05:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
so i my
 
05:11:11.030 --> 05:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm used to dealing with the
 
05:11:13.030 --> 05:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
agencies and my assumption is if they
 
05:11:14.470 --> 05:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
don't show up
 
05:11:17.430 --> 05:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
they're okay with it maybe not but maybe
 
05:11:19.270 --> 05:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
not significantly in support but they
 
05:11:21.510 --> 05:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
don't have any serious objections or
 
05:11:24.150 --> 05:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
they would have been at the hearing
 
05:11:28.310 --> 05:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:30.390 --> 05:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
but i'm pretty sure it was not the case
 
05:11:32.868 --> 05:11:32.878 align:start position:0%
and not i'm not challenge your belief
 
05:11:34.310 --> 05:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
our opinions are
 
05:11:36.708 --> 05:11:36.718 align:start position:0%
are set and we don't need to discuss it
 
05:11:39.590 --> 05:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
represent goalie you have a comment
 
05:11:41.270 --> 05:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i will be
 
05:11:42.810 --> 05:11:42.820 align:start position:0%
supporting this um
 
05:11:42.820 --> 05:11:45.270 align:start position:0%
supporting this um
[Music]

05:11:45.270 --> 05:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:11:48.230 --> 05:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
i come from the philosophy that
 
05:11:50.708 --> 05:11:50.718 align:start position:0%
more eyes overseeing something is always
 
05:11:50.718 --> 05:11:51.910 align:start position:0%
more eyes overseeing something is always
better

05:11:51.910 --> 05:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
better
 
05:11:53.990 --> 05:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:11:56.868 --> 05:11:56.878 align:start position:0%
lessening a workload of those few is
 
05:11:58.788 --> 05:11:58.798 align:start position:0%
always better
 
05:11:58.798 --> 05:11:59.670 align:start position:0%
always better
um

05:11:59.670 --> 05:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:02.628 --> 05:12:02.638 align:start position:0%
it creates a better product
 
05:12:05.990 --> 05:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
creates greater oversight
 
05:12:09.030 --> 05:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
and i think that's important
 
05:12:10.948 --> 05:12:10.958 align:start position:0%
as many of us know
 
05:12:13.510 --> 05:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
legislation that's passed here
 
05:12:15.830 --> 05:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
and number of it goes through the
 
05:12:18.628 --> 05:12:18.638 align:start position:0%
rule-making process
 
05:12:18.638 --> 05:12:20.390 align:start position:0%
rule-making process
and

05:12:20.390 --> 05:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:12:22.390 --> 05:12:22.400 align:start position:0%
most people don't follow that through
 
05:12:24.150 --> 05:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
and there are times when
 
05:12:26.830 --> 05:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
those rules that are written for
 
05:12:29.430 --> 05:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
legislation can have more of an effect
 
05:12:31.590 --> 05:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
than the legislation itself
 
05:12:34.230 --> 05:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
when it's written
 
05:12:34.240 --> 05:12:36.550 align:start position:0%
when it's written
so

05:12:36.550 --> 05:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:39.110 --> 05:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
i believe having more eyes
 
05:12:40.708 --> 05:12:40.718 align:start position:0%
and having less of a workload on those
 
05:12:43.030 --> 05:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
individuals on gelcar
 
05:12:45.350 --> 05:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
will make sure that those rules put in
 
05:12:45.360 --> 05:12:47.110 align:start position:0%
will make sure that those rules put in
place

05:12:47.110 --> 05:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
place
 
05:12:49.990 --> 05:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
follow the law that was written
 
05:12:51.830 --> 05:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
so for that reason i'll be supporting
 
05:12:54.310 --> 05:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
this thank you
 
05:12:55.670 --> 05:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you any other comments or
 
05:12:57.590 --> 05:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative marsh
 
05:12:59.190 --> 05:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
yes i have to admit that i'm a little
 
05:13:01.510 --> 05:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
bit of a quandary here i've never been
 
05:13:03.750 --> 05:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
on gelcar however the comment that the
 
05:13:05.270 --> 05:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
senate's not likely to get along with
 
05:13:06.868 --> 05:13:06.878 align:start position:0%
this certainly sounds like the senate to
 
05:13:09.510 --> 05:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
me the senate is usually very good at
 
05:13:11.270 --> 05:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
reducing the number of senators on bills
 
05:13:13.190 --> 05:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
that we send to them and i think if we
 
05:13:14.788 --> 05:13:14.798 align:start position:0%
pass this we should expect this to go to
 
05:13:16.390 --> 05:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
committee of conference and that will
 
05:13:18.230 --> 05:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
probably get worked out
 
05:13:21.030 --> 05:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh yes i will mention that on jail car
 
05:13:25.910 --> 05:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:27.670 --> 05:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
for the house alternates to fill the
 
05:13:29.590 --> 05:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
senate seats other than the chair or
 
05:13:32.550 --> 05:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
vice chairs the case may be
 
05:13:32.560 --> 05:13:34.310 align:start position:0%
vice chairs the case may be
certainly

05:13:34.310 --> 05:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
05:13:34.320 --> 05:13:35.270 align:start position:0%
certainly
the

05:13:35.270 --> 05:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:13:37.350 --> 05:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
it is rare we have a full complement of
 
05:13:37.360 --> 05:13:40.868 align:start position:0%
it is rare we have a full complement of
senators

05:13:40.868 --> 05:13:40.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:40.878 --> 05:13:43.510 align:start position:0%

05:16:02.310 --> 05:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:16:04.070 --> 05:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
05:16:06.550 --> 05:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
no representative fellows now
 
05:16:08.948 --> 05:16:08.958 align:start position:0%
representative fautner no

05:16:15.110 --> 05:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
and the chair
 
05:16:17.190 --> 05:16:17.200 align:start position:0%
yes guess what
 
05:16:19.430 --> 05:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's 14 to 5.
 
05:16:24.628 --> 05:16:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:41.190 --> 05:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:43.030 --> 05:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
and your motion will be what to
 
05:16:43.040 --> 05:16:46.708 align:start position:0%
and your motion will be what to
represent

05:16:46.708 --> 05:16:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:51.270 --> 05:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:34.470 --> 05:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:36.948 --> 05:17:36.958 align:start position:0%
yes yes yes yes
 
05:17:40.948 --> 05:17:40.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:40.958 --> 05:17:43.750 align:start position:0%
 
test

05:17:43.750 --> 05:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:45.990 --> 05:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
so how about there we go we had we
 
05:17:48.948 --> 05:17:48.958 align:start position:0%
probably had too many on
 
05:17:51.590 --> 05:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
anyway so representative grota suggests
 
05:17:53.868 --> 05:17:53.878 align:start position:0%
we consider senate bill
 
05:17:57.350 --> 05:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
226 which is the recruit
 
05:18:03.270 --> 05:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:07.510 --> 05:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:11.350 --> 05:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:13.990 --> 05:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
i moved back to pass
 
05:18:15.670 --> 05:18:15.680 align:start position:0%
representative fellow moves ought to
 
05:18:17.670 --> 05:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
pass is there a second
 
05:18:25.750 --> 05:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:27.830 --> 05:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
it's not i think it's not working again
 
05:18:33.030 --> 05:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:35.990 --> 05:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
um anyway um i think
 
05:18:36.000 --> 05:18:37.350 align:start position:0%
um anyway um i think
that

05:18:37.350 --> 05:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:18:39.510 --> 05:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
we have heard in nobody disputes that
 
05:18:41.830 --> 05:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
there's a difficulty
 
05:18:45.190 --> 05:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
filling positions for state workers
 
05:18:49.110 --> 05:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
and in some cases it's very difficult
 
05:18:52.150 --> 05:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
to fill some key positions and and one
 
05:18:54.708 --> 05:18:54.718 align:start position:0%
that we've heard about more than once is
 
05:18:54.718 --> 05:18:55.750 align:start position:0%
that we've heard about more than once is
filling

05:18:55.750 --> 05:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
filling
 
05:18:59.510 --> 05:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh vacancies at the state prison
 
05:19:01.910 --> 05:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
so while i don't think
 
05:19:03.750 --> 05:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
this bill will
 
05:19:05.190 --> 05:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
make any
 
05:19:07.430 --> 05:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
long-term improvements
 
05:19:09.990 --> 05:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
i think that it will prevent the
 
05:19:13.350 --> 05:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
situation from becoming worse at some of
 
05:19:15.750 --> 05:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
those key places like like in the in
 
05:19:18.788 --> 05:19:18.798 align:start position:0%
corrections and if we don't pass it
 
05:19:18.798 --> 05:19:19.750 align:start position:0%
corrections and if we don't pass it
um

05:19:19.750 --> 05:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:22.390 --> 05:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
the the shortage
 
05:19:22.400 --> 05:19:24.150 align:start position:0%
the the shortage
of

05:19:24.150 --> 05:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:19:27.670 --> 05:19:27.680 align:start position:0%
um corrections officers will just become
 
05:19:30.470 --> 05:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
worse and even more people will just
 
05:19:32.868 --> 05:19:32.878 align:start position:0%
want to quit so i think that just as a
 
05:19:34.788 --> 05:19:34.798 align:start position:0%
stop gap
 
05:19:39.350 --> 05:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:40.868 --> 05:19:40.878 align:start position:0%
uh representative brodar do you wish to
 
05:19:40.878 --> 05:19:42.390 align:start position:0%
uh representative brodar do you wish to
speak

05:19:42.390 --> 05:19:42.400 align:start position:0%

we did hear from
 
05:19:59.670 --> 05:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:01.910 --> 05:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
one of the agencies that that this has
 
05:20:04.150 --> 05:20:04.160 align:start position:0%
been somewhat
 
05:20:05.990 --> 05:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh this somewhat been going on for a
 
05:20:07.750 --> 05:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
05:20:11.190 --> 05:20:11.200 align:start position:0%
because the the the crisis the problem
 
05:20:13.190 --> 05:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
that we have which which uh various
 
05:20:15.350 --> 05:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
agencies have is it varies obviously
 
05:20:17.750 --> 05:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
from agency to agency i know that we're
 
05:20:20.150 --> 05:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
you know we're 68 state troopers short
 
05:20:22.230 --> 05:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
right now we're hundreds of corrections
 
05:20:25.350 --> 05:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
officers short
 
05:20:25.360 --> 05:20:26.470 align:start position:0%
officers short
and

05:20:26.470 --> 05:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:20:28.230 --> 05:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
the alarming
 
05:20:30.868 --> 05:20:30.878 align:start position:0%
realization that especially in the doc
 
05:20:33.110 --> 05:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
they're spending 16 million dollars of
 
05:20:33.120 --> 05:20:34.310 align:start position:0%
they're spending 16 million dollars of
overtime

05:20:34.310 --> 05:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
overtime
 
05:20:38.868 --> 05:20:38.878 align:start position:0%
and we have one one state person so um
 
05:20:40.708 --> 05:20:40.718 align:start position:0%
we have the men and the women yeah
 
05:20:43.830 --> 05:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
one one for each um but the
 
05:20:45.990 --> 05:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
you know looking at this i i think that
 
05:20:48.548 --> 05:20:48.558 align:start position:0%
it's um
 
05:20:51.190 --> 05:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
i think it just kind of kind of codifies
 
05:20:53.510 --> 05:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
what what they're doing
 
05:20:56.310 --> 05:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
haphazardly in some cases right now and
 
05:20:56.320 --> 05:20:57.430 align:start position:0%
haphazardly in some cases right now and
uh

05:20:57.430 --> 05:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:21:00.470 --> 05:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
and i hope that this actually does
 
05:21:03.430 --> 05:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
bear some realistic fruit from the from
 
05:21:04.948 --> 05:21:04.958 align:start position:0%
the deep dive so
 
05:21:08.230 --> 05:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
i can i'm certainly supportive of this
 
05:21:11.830 --> 05:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
anyone anyone anyone else
 
05:21:14.150 --> 05:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
personally yeah i'm just going to
 
05:21:15.670 --> 05:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
express a concern i know it's not going
 
05:21:18.788 --> 05:21:18.798 align:start position:0%
to impact the way that this is voted but
 
05:21:21.430 --> 05:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
i just have this sneaking suspicion that
 
05:21:21.440 --> 05:21:22.470 align:start position:0%
i just have this sneaking suspicion that
um

05:21:22.470 --> 05:21:22.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:24.310 --> 05:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
well as representative peterson said
 
05:21:25.590 --> 05:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
they've been doing this kind of
 
05:21:28.390 --> 05:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
haphazardly for a while
 
05:21:30.548 --> 05:21:30.558 align:start position:0%
i think we're throwing money at a
 
05:21:33.110 --> 05:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
project that
 
05:21:35.670 --> 05:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
ain't gonna make a difference i mean i
 
05:21:38.708 --> 05:21:38.718 align:start position:0%
think there are probably deeper problems
 
05:21:38.718 --> 05:21:39.670 align:start position:0%
think there are probably deeper problems
than

05:21:39.670 --> 05:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
than
 
05:21:41.510 --> 05:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh what have been stated in the
 
05:21:43.190 --> 05:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
testimony that we're heard
 
05:21:44.788 --> 05:21:44.798 align:start position:0%
and they're not gonna be taken care of
 
05:21:46.390 --> 05:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
in the short term
 
05:21:48.070 --> 05:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
just by throwing a little bit more money
 
05:21:50.390 --> 05:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
at it but like i said i'm not going to
 
05:21:52.230 --> 05:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
go on because
 
05:21:53.670 --> 05:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
i'm probably going to wind up supporting
 
05:21:56.708 --> 05:21:56.718 align:start position:0%
this but um i do so hesitantly
 
05:21:58.948 --> 05:21:58.958 align:start position:0%
okay representative schuett
 
05:22:01.590 --> 05:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i will say that
 
05:22:03.270 --> 05:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
there was an article
 
05:22:05.910 --> 05:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
in the news over the weekend that the
 
05:22:08.410 --> 05:22:08.420 align:start position:0%
doc has
 
05:22:08.420 --> 05:22:09.830 align:start position:0%
doc has
[Music]

05:22:09.830 --> 05:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:22:11.990 --> 05:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure what the word is
 
05:22:12.000 --> 05:22:13.590 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite sure what the word is
recruited

05:22:13.590 --> 05:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
recruited
 
05:22:16.628 --> 05:22:16.638 align:start position:0%
parole and probation officers to come in
 
05:22:18.310 --> 05:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
and assist
 
05:22:20.948 --> 05:22:20.958 align:start position:0%
doing doc officer
 
05:22:20.958 --> 05:22:22.548 align:start position:0%
doing doc officer
positions

05:22:22.548 --> 05:22:22.558 align:start position:0%
positions
 
05:22:24.948 --> 05:22:24.958 align:start position:0%
which is a pretty extreme
 
05:22:28.390 --> 05:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
reaction but obviously needed
 
05:22:30.628 --> 05:22:30.638 align:start position:0%
i agree with representative allegro i'm
 
05:22:32.868 --> 05:22:32.878 align:start position:0%
not sure if this is
 
05:22:34.868 --> 05:22:34.878 align:start position:0%
going to make that large a difference
 
05:22:37.830 --> 05:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
but at least they are attempting to do
 
05:22:37.840 --> 05:22:38.948 align:start position:0%
but at least they are attempting to do
something

05:22:38.948 --> 05:22:38.958 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:22:41.910 --> 05:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
and i think we can support that and
 
05:22:44.470 --> 05:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
i would hope that going forward
 
05:22:46.788 --> 05:22:46.798 align:start position:0%
that this legislature would look at
 
05:22:48.948 --> 05:22:48.958 align:start position:0%
perhaps increasing
 
05:22:51.350 --> 05:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
the pay scale for
 
05:22:53.190 --> 05:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the pay scale for
 
05:22:55.270 --> 05:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
corrections officers is determined
 
05:22:58.628 --> 05:22:58.638 align:start position:0%
primarily by their their contract and we
 
05:23:01.990 --> 05:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
have almost no control over that
 
05:23:06.070 --> 05:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:08.868 --> 05:23:08.878 align:start position:0%
that's only for the executive the
 
05:23:11.110 --> 05:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
non-classified employees the classified
 
05:23:12.948 --> 05:23:12.958 align:start position:0%
employees are
 
05:23:15.670 --> 05:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
in covered by the contract
 
05:23:17.910 --> 05:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
and i will point out that
 
05:23:19.990 --> 05:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
our state employees went for quite some
 
05:23:22.070 --> 05:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
time without a contract trying to
 
05:23:22.080 --> 05:23:23.830 align:start position:0%
time without a contract trying to
negotiate

05:23:23.830 --> 05:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
negotiate
 
05:23:26.628 --> 05:23:26.638 align:start position:0%
better benefits and better pay so that's
 
05:23:29.750 --> 05:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
i'll leave it at that yeah
 
05:23:31.830 --> 05:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
anyone else represent bailly
 
05:23:33.190 --> 05:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
again i don't necessarily think it would
 
05:23:35.110 --> 05:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
make me oppose it but i don't know that
 
05:23:36.708 --> 05:23:36.718 align:start position:0%
we ever heard anything
 
05:23:36.718 --> 05:23:38.788 align:start position:0%
we ever heard anything
that

05:23:38.788 --> 05:23:38.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:23:40.948 --> 05:23:40.958 align:start position:0%
identified or showed that
 
05:23:42.470 --> 05:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
the problems the state the hiring
 
05:23:43.910 --> 05:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
problems the state is having are any
 
05:23:45.430 --> 05:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
different than those in the market at
 
05:23:45.440 --> 05:23:46.948 align:start position:0%
different than those in the market at
large

05:23:46.948 --> 05:23:46.958 align:start position:0%
large
 
05:23:50.470 --> 05:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
if if you want some i can give you some
 
05:23:51.670 --> 05:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
i'll give you i'll give you a glowing
 
05:23:54.470 --> 05:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
example that the city of worcester under
 
05:23:56.628 --> 05:23:56.638 align:start position:0%
massachusetts civil service law has to
 
05:23:58.788 --> 05:23:58.798 align:start position:0%
post their hiring list there's 276
 
05:24:01.590 --> 05:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
people on worcester fire's hiring list
 
05:24:03.830 --> 05:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
there are 35 firefighters in the state
 
05:24:06.548 --> 05:24:06.558 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire period on a hiring list
 
05:24:09.190 --> 05:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
not not manchester not nashua the entire
 
05:24:11.030 --> 05:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
state so this is very much a new
 
05:24:12.708 --> 05:24:12.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire problem
 
05:24:13.830 --> 05:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
where this
 
05:24:15.670 --> 05:24:15.680 align:start position:0%
where in massachusetts they they are not
 
05:24:17.190 --> 05:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
seeing this
 
05:24:19.190 --> 05:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
well you're talking about other state
 
05:24:21.910 --> 05:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
governments i mean the market at large
 
05:24:25.430 --> 05:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
has a overall problem of staffing and is
 
05:24:27.110 --> 05:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
this really any different sure but
 
05:24:28.230 --> 05:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
there's a you know there's a direct
 
05:24:29.510 --> 05:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
correlation some of these jobs that
 
05:24:31.590 --> 05:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
we're looking at are are by definition
 
05:24:33.830 --> 05:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
government jobs so you know we don't
 
05:24:36.150 --> 05:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
really have you know private prisons and
 
05:24:37.510 --> 05:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
we don't really have private police
 
05:24:39.430 --> 05:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
departments and things like that so so i
 
05:24:40.868 --> 05:24:40.878 align:start position:0%
think there is a direct correlation as
 
05:24:42.390 --> 05:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
the new england
 
05:24:44.628 --> 05:24:44.638 align:start position:0%
region as we are is
 
05:24:46.868 --> 05:24:46.878 align:start position:0%
from a from a human resources standpoint
 
05:24:49.670 --> 05:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
is very much regional and we do compete
 
05:24:51.590 --> 05:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
and i would like to mention that it
 
05:24:53.670 --> 05:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
appears that this is the
 
05:24:55.430 --> 05:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
first time they can throw money at the
 
05:24:57.030 --> 05:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
problem even if it's
 
05:24:57.040 --> 05:24:57.990 align:start position:0%
problem even if it's
with

05:24:57.990 --> 05:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:24:59.830 --> 05:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
by going through fiscal and getting some
 
05:24:59.840 --> 05:25:00.788 align:start position:0%
by going through fiscal and getting some
money

05:25:00.788 --> 05:25:00.798 align:start position:0%
money
 
05:25:03.430 --> 05:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
and some of their ideas involve money
 
05:25:04.548 --> 05:25:04.558 align:start position:0%
some don't
 
05:25:05.910 --> 05:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
but i think
 
05:25:07.990 --> 05:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's always
 
05:25:09.430 --> 05:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
something to consider because i know
 
05:25:11.350 --> 05:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
that the private sector is creating
 
05:25:15.590 --> 05:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:18.628 --> 05:25:18.638 align:start position:0%
yeah mcdonald's and dairy has got a 500
 
05:25:21.030 --> 05:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
sign-on bonus i i've never seen that in
 
05:25:23.030 --> 05:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
my life
 
05:25:25.590 --> 05:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
but they didn't feel the need to
 
05:25:28.310 --> 05:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
have a special program they just
 
05:25:33.670 --> 05:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:36.708 --> 05:25:36.718 align:start position:0%
yeah any other comments
 
05:25:38.548 --> 05:25:38.558 align:start position:0%
representative platt it's not going to
 
05:25:40.868 --> 05:25:40.878 align:start position:0%
involve my vote at all i think i'm for
 
05:25:42.470 --> 05:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
this but uh
 
05:25:44.628 --> 05:25:44.638 align:start position:0%
it's not only pay its working conditions
 
05:25:45.430 --> 05:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
05:25:47.590 --> 05:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
in the state prison can't be great i'll
 
05:25:49.430 --> 05:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
just leave it there and i used to go
 
05:25:50.948 --> 05:25:50.958 align:start position:0%
into the state prison all the time
 
05:25:52.868 --> 05:25:52.878 align:start position:0%
because there was a jc chapter in there

i will say that having a previous
 
05:26:23.430 --> 05:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
conviction is not a bar to being elected
 
05:26:26.390 --> 05:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
as a state representative
 
05:26:28.788 --> 05:26:28.798 align:start position:0%

05:29:38.230 --> 05:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
now
 
05:29:40.590 --> 05:29:40.600 align:start position:0%

05:29:43.350 --> 05:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
1759 which is representative pearson's
 
05:29:43.360 --> 05:29:44.948 align:start position:0%
1759 which is representative pearson's
amendment

05:29:44.948 --> 05:29:44.958 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:29:46.470 --> 05:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
and then we will consider other
 
05:29:46.480 --> 05:29:47.910 align:start position:0%
and then we will consider other
amendments

05:29:47.910 --> 05:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
05:29:50.230 --> 05:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
madam chair do we know if if the three
 
05:29:50.240 --> 05:29:51.910 align:start position:0%
madam chair do we know if if the three
amendments

05:29:51.910 --> 05:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
05:29:54.070 --> 05:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
counteract the others or
 
05:29:56.230 --> 05:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
will they work in conjunction
 
05:29:58.628 --> 05:29:58.638 align:start position:0%
we don't we will deal with that when we
 
05:30:00.390 --> 05:30:00.400 align:start position:0%
see them i haven't seen representative
 
05:30:02.390 --> 05:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
marsha's amendment
 
05:30:04.230 --> 05:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
did you say
 
05:30:05.990 --> 05:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
you have madam chair senator carson's
 
05:30:08.070 --> 05:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
amendment made as a house amendment
 
05:30:09.030 --> 05:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
05:30:12.948 --> 05:30:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:16.390 --> 05:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:18.548 --> 05:30:18.558 align:start position:0%
so no they do no they do not work
 
05:30:21.030 --> 05:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
together because representative
 
05:30:24.070 --> 05:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
pearson's amendment makes changes beyond
 
05:30:26.150 --> 05:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative marsha's amendment so i
 
05:30:28.310 --> 05:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
think we should consider his first
 
05:30:30.150 --> 05:30:30.160 align:start position:0%
can we please heaven what are the three
 
05:30:31.350 --> 05:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
amendments i just want to make i'm
 
05:30:33.430 --> 05:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
missing one there's one from marsh one
 
05:30:35.750 --> 05:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
from pearson and one from allegro
 
05:30:37.750 --> 05:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
mark have you passed them out or will
 
05:30:37.760 --> 05:30:41.510 align:start position:0%
mark have you passed them out or will
you

05:30:41.510 --> 05:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:43.670 --> 05:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
oh they're right here
 
05:30:43.680 --> 05:30:47.110 align:start position:0%
oh they're right here
sorry

05:30:47.110 --> 05:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:48.470 --> 05:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
oh my god
 
05:30:50.390 --> 05:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
representative allegro's amendment would
 
05:30:52.708 --> 05:30:52.718 align:start position:0%
work with either of the other two but
 
05:30:54.788 --> 05:30:54.798 align:start position:0%
those two do not work with each other do
 
05:30:57.270 --> 05:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
you have a legend no i don't thank you
 
05:30:57.280 --> 05:31:03.110 align:start position:0%
you have a legend no i don't thank you
yes

05:31:03.110 --> 05:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:05.190 --> 05:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
i can explain
 
05:31:06.868 --> 05:31:06.878 align:start position:0%
right representative pearson you go
 
05:31:06.878 --> 05:31:08.390 align:start position:0%
right representative pearson you go
first

05:31:08.390 --> 05:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
first
 
05:31:11.110 --> 05:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um wait is there a
 
05:31:13.110 --> 05:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
second to your amendment
 
05:31:15.190 --> 05:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
oh second all right just for the sake of
 
05:31:19.030 --> 05:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
discussion yes okay thank you so
 
05:31:21.830 --> 05:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment um that that i'm bringing
 
05:31:24.150 --> 05:31:24.160 align:start position:0%
forward does this
 
05:31:27.510 --> 05:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
okay the bill itself 397
 
05:31:31.190 --> 05:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:34.708 --> 05:31:34.718 align:start position:0%
part one involves a compact
 
05:31:36.868 --> 05:31:36.878 align:start position:0%
for mental health
 
05:31:36.878 --> 05:31:41.430 align:start position:0%
for mental health
counseling

05:31:41.430 --> 05:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:43.750 --> 05:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
the second part of the bill which is i
 
05:31:45.910 --> 05:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
believe starts on page
 
05:31:49.830 --> 05:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
19 involves an
 
05:31:49.840 --> 05:31:51.670 align:start position:0%
19 involves an
compact

05:31:51.670 --> 05:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
compact
 
05:31:59.750 --> 05:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:01.830 --> 05:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
and that's what that's what the the the
 
05:32:04.548 --> 05:32:04.558 align:start position:0%
actual bill is it does two things what
 
05:32:08.310 --> 05:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
my amendment does is my amendment
 
05:32:10.868 --> 05:32:10.878 align:start position:0%
retains the mental health compact
 
05:32:13.590 --> 05:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
portion and removes the interstate
 
05:32:16.390 --> 05:32:16.400 align:start position:0%
compact for the placement of children
 
05:32:19.670 --> 05:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
what it also does is it includes
 
05:32:22.070 --> 05:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
the critical items that
 
05:32:24.230 --> 05:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
children in family law was concerned
 
05:32:28.628 --> 05:32:28.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:39.430 --> 05:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:41.350 --> 05:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
right so the
 
05:32:42.868 --> 05:32:42.878 align:start position:0%
reason being
 
05:32:43.910 --> 05:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
for this
 
05:32:45.430 --> 05:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
is that the
 
05:32:47.190 --> 05:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
the second part of this the interstate
 
05:32:49.270 --> 05:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
compact for the placement of children
 
05:32:52.470 --> 05:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
has existed for 13 years
 
05:32:56.310 --> 05:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
in it and it is not getting traction
 
05:32:58.708 --> 05:32:58.718 align:start position:0%
it requires 35 states in order to be
 
05:33:01.190 --> 05:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
enacted and they haven't even cleared a
 
05:33:02.708 --> 05:33:02.718 align:start position:0%
third of that yet
 
05:33:05.670 --> 05:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
in 13 years so clearly there's not an
 
05:33:05.680 --> 05:33:07.030 align:start position:0%
in 13 years so clearly there's not an
appetite

05:33:07.030 --> 05:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
appetite
 
05:33:09.910 --> 05:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
by the by the various states
 
05:33:12.548 --> 05:33:12.558 align:start position:0%
to get into that particular type of
 
05:33:14.788 --> 05:33:14.798 align:start position:0%
compact the current compact we have was
 
05:33:17.190 --> 05:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
created in somewhere between 1960 and
 
05:33:17.200 --> 05:33:18.868 align:start position:0%
created in somewhere between 1960 and
1965

05:33:18.868 --> 05:33:18.878 align:start position:0%
1965
 
05:33:18.878 --> 05:33:19.590 align:start position:0%
1965
it

05:33:19.590 --> 05:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:33:22.230 --> 05:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
certainly has some things in it that
 
05:33:23.750 --> 05:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
aren't working
 
05:33:23.760 --> 05:33:25.350 align:start position:0%
aren't working
the

05:33:25.350 --> 05:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:33:29.590 --> 05:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
carson slash marsh amendment um has
 
05:33:31.670 --> 05:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
sections in it that fix a couple of
 
05:33:33.590 --> 05:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
immediate needs
 
05:33:35.190 --> 05:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
that the children and family law
 
05:33:36.788 --> 05:33:36.798 align:start position:0%
committee saw
 
05:33:39.430 --> 05:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
so my amendment retains those critical
 
05:33:41.830 --> 05:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
items and just dumps the the rest of a
 
05:33:44.070 --> 05:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
compact that frankly i don't think will
 
05:33:47.350 --> 05:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:49.910 --> 05:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay and i will add that
 
05:33:49.920 --> 05:33:50.868 align:start position:0%
okay and i will add that
this

05:33:50.868 --> 05:33:50.878 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:33:53.750 --> 05:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
part is what the chip the committee on
 
05:33:56.150 --> 05:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
children and family law which we invited
 
05:33:58.150 --> 05:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
to participate in our
 
05:33:58.160 --> 05:33:59.670 align:start position:0%
to participate in our
subcommittee

05:33:59.670 --> 05:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
05:34:01.190 --> 05:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
actually i invited them to for the
 
05:34:03.910 --> 05:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
hearing but they didn't
 
05:34:06.708 --> 05:34:06.718 align:start position:0%
and the governor considered to be
 
05:34:10.070 --> 05:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
crucial to enact this year so
 
05:34:12.548 --> 05:34:12.558 align:start position:0%
i would hope you will support that
 
05:34:14.390 --> 05:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
05:34:15.990 --> 05:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh yes i will point out that when we
 
05:34:17.750 --> 05:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
heard testimony on the interstate
 
05:34:19.590 --> 05:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
compact for the placement of children
 
05:34:20.788 --> 05:34:20.798 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
05:34:22.628 --> 05:34:22.638 align:start position:0%
services told us that currently it's
 
05:34:25.670 --> 05:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
been enacted by between 17 and 20 states
 
05:34:27.270 --> 05:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
that's considerably more than had
 
05:34:29.190 --> 05:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
enacted it last year when it came before
 
05:34:31.510 --> 05:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
05:34:33.110 --> 05:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
nevertheless uh the representative
 
05:34:34.390 --> 05:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
pearson is quite correct that the
 
05:34:36.708 --> 05:34:36.718 align:start position:0%
threshold of 35 is quite high and it may
 
05:34:38.788 --> 05:34:38.798 align:start position:0%
be a number of years before we reach
 
05:34:40.310 --> 05:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
that threshold that i would take issue
 
05:34:42.868 --> 05:34:42.878 align:start position:0%
with the statement that uh there are not
 
05:34:44.470 --> 05:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
more states adopting it because there
 
05:34:47.270 --> 05:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:50.708 --> 05:34:50.718 align:start position:0%
yeah and i will we'll add that if we
 
05:34:52.948 --> 05:34:52.958 align:start position:0%
unless we are entirely happy with the
 
05:34:55.270 --> 05:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
revision there is no need to pass it
 
05:34:57.510 --> 05:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
this year because it is extremely
 
05:34:59.990 --> 05:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
unlikely that the additional 15 states
 
05:35:02.070 --> 05:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
will proceed to adopt it
 
05:35:05.110 --> 05:35:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:07.430 --> 05:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
any other comments or questions
 
05:35:09.270 --> 05:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
representative platt question of
 
05:35:11.190 --> 05:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative pearson if we were to
 
05:35:13.110 --> 05:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
retain the second part of the bill with
 
05:35:14.788 --> 05:35:14.798 align:start position:0%
the interstate compact that means we
 
05:35:17.590 --> 05:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
have to swallow a whole language
 
05:35:19.270 --> 05:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
for the compact
 
05:35:21.590 --> 05:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
so the way compacts work in the in
 
05:35:25.270 --> 05:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that this is a 37 page
 
05:35:25.280 --> 05:35:26.310 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that this is a 37 page
document

05:35:26.310 --> 05:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
document
 
05:35:29.830 --> 05:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
is con interstate compacts are go no go
 
05:35:31.430 --> 05:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
we can't
 
05:35:33.510 --> 05:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
amend the terms of them it's either we
 
05:35:35.270 --> 05:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
agree to get into them
 
05:35:39.510 --> 05:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:41.590 --> 05:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
some of these compacts especially if
 
05:35:43.670 --> 05:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
you're in the door early
 
05:35:46.628 --> 05:35:46.638 align:start position:0%
to entice states to join you you now sit
 
05:35:49.430 --> 05:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
on a rules committee where the where the
 
05:35:51.430 --> 05:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
some of those things occur
 
05:35:51.440 --> 05:35:52.310 align:start position:0%
some of those things occur
um

05:35:52.310 --> 05:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:52.320 --> 05:35:53.670 align:start position:0%
um
the

05:35:53.670 --> 05:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:35:55.670 --> 05:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
placement of children if
 
05:35:57.030 --> 05:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
representative marsha's numbers are
 
05:35:58.948 --> 05:35:58.958 align:start position:0%
correct which they probably are we're
 
05:36:00.548 --> 05:36:00.558 align:start position:0%
going to be past the we'll pass the
 
05:36:03.590 --> 05:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
initial dangling of the gold coin so we
 
05:36:06.548 --> 05:36:06.558 align:start position:0%
would just be a member in that case the
 
05:36:08.548 --> 05:36:08.558 align:start position:0%
mental health compact
 
05:36:08.558 --> 05:36:09.910 align:start position:0%
mental health compact
um

05:36:09.910 --> 05:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:11.750 --> 05:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
is now
 
05:36:13.670 --> 05:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
initially had five states that had
 
05:36:16.310 --> 05:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
entered it is now at nine it takes ten
 
05:36:17.750 --> 05:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
to ratify
 
05:36:19.270 --> 05:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
this is a compact that actually will
 
05:36:20.948 --> 05:36:20.958 align:start position:0%
happen and it actually will happen if
 
05:36:28.788 --> 05:36:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:30.470 --> 05:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i just understood that
 
05:36:32.868 --> 05:36:32.878 align:start position:0%
right that if you're in on this early
 
05:36:35.750 --> 05:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
um you potentially get more say
 
05:36:38.788 --> 05:36:38.798 align:start position:0%
and so what we're doing here is seeding
 
05:36:41.750 --> 05:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
some of our own ability to set rules for
 
05:36:45.430 --> 05:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
our own business and behavior but
 
05:36:47.590 --> 05:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
i i have to what bothers me about this
 
05:36:49.110 --> 05:36:49.120 align:start position:0%
process right here that we're talking
 
05:36:50.628 --> 05:36:50.638 align:start position:0%
about is
 
05:36:52.070 --> 05:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make excuses we're
 
05:36:55.190 --> 05:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
saying it yes 35 is a high bar it's
 
05:36:57.030 --> 05:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
probably not going to happen and so on
 
05:36:58.548 --> 05:36:58.558 align:start position:0%
and so forth
 
05:37:01.350 --> 05:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
ruling by i'm sorry legislating by
 
05:37:01.360 --> 05:37:02.470 align:start position:0%
ruling by i'm sorry legislating by
roulette

05:37:02.470 --> 05:37:02.480 align:start position:0%
roulette
 
05:37:04.150 --> 05:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
i don't think is
 
05:37:05.510 --> 05:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
the way to go here i think that there
 
05:37:07.990 --> 05:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
are objections enough objections to both
 
05:37:09.510 --> 05:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
parts of this bill
 
05:37:11.030 --> 05:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
that i'm going to have great difficulty
 
05:37:12.390 --> 05:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
supporting either
 
05:37:15.590 --> 05:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
i think okay well this amendment deletes
 
05:37:17.830 --> 05:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
section two so you should be happy with
 
05:37:17.840 --> 05:37:19.430 align:start position:0%
section two so you should be happy with
that

05:37:19.430 --> 05:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:37:21.430 --> 05:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
representative blackist and then folsom
 
05:37:24.310 --> 05:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
yeah i agree with representative eliagro
 
05:37:27.270 --> 05:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm a general skeptical of compacts
 
05:37:29.190 --> 05:37:29.200 align:start position:0%
otherwise my support in general what
 
05:37:30.788 --> 05:37:30.798 align:start position:0%
they're trying to do
 
05:37:32.788 --> 05:37:32.798 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to support this um part of
 
05:37:34.708 --> 05:37:34.718 align:start position:0%
my concern is that
 
05:37:36.390 --> 05:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
this came as an amendment late in the
 
05:37:39.430 --> 05:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
day to a senate bill
 
05:37:41.270 --> 05:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
05:37:43.430 --> 05:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
i would like to have uh certainly more
 
05:37:46.150 --> 05:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
of a look at this and uh hear from more
 
05:37:48.070 --> 05:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
people on the details of this compact
 
05:37:51.510 --> 05:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:53.030 --> 05:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
05:37:55.350 --> 05:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
05:37:57.670 --> 05:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
last year we saw this come before health
 
05:38:00.548 --> 05:38:00.558 align:start position:0%
and human services as part of a 72-part
 
05:38:02.150 --> 05:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
omnibus bill
 
05:38:04.868 --> 05:38:04.878 align:start position:0%
and at that point i argued against its
 
05:38:07.030 --> 05:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
passage in saying that it needed to go
 
05:38:10.390 --> 05:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
before child and family law
 
05:38:12.948 --> 05:38:12.958 align:start position:0%
i see that they've now attached it to
 
05:38:15.990 --> 05:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
another part um it worries me that they
 
05:38:18.150 --> 05:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
can't they don't think that it can stand
 
05:38:20.070 --> 05:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
alone as a bill and i think that that's
 
05:38:23.190 --> 05:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
what it has to have i believe once we
 
05:38:25.990 --> 05:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
enter into this compact
 
05:38:26.000 --> 05:38:26.868 align:start position:0%
enter into this compact
we

05:38:26.868 --> 05:38:26.878 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:38:29.590 --> 05:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
cede a lot of our authority of our
 
05:38:32.708 --> 05:38:32.718 align:start position:0%
children over to the federal government
 
05:38:32.718 --> 05:38:33.590 align:start position:0%
children over to the federal government
and

05:38:33.590 --> 05:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:38:37.190 --> 05:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
because the rules are then set by
 
05:38:39.990 --> 05:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
a person that has been appointed by the
 
05:38:41.270 --> 05:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner of health and human
 
05:38:43.750 --> 05:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
services from our state to go
 
05:38:47.030 --> 05:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
vote we don't know those 35 states that
 
05:38:48.948 --> 05:38:48.958 align:start position:0%
are going to be voting we don't know if
 
05:38:51.430 --> 05:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
they're like our state
 
05:38:51.440 --> 05:38:52.310 align:start position:0%
they're like our state
and

05:38:52.310 --> 05:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:38:55.430 --> 05:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
the financing is also not described in
 
05:38:55.440 --> 05:38:56.470 align:start position:0%
the financing is also not described in
here

05:38:56.470 --> 05:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:38:59.190 --> 05:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
in that each member state shall
 
05:39:01.830 --> 05:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
establish a central state compact office
 
05:39:03.350 --> 05:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
and it goes on
 
05:39:05.270 --> 05:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
and at first i
 
05:39:05.280 --> 05:39:06.948 align:start position:0%
and at first i
was

05:39:06.948 --> 05:39:06.958 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:39:09.590 --> 05:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
thought that it was a general state
 
05:39:11.750 --> 05:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
compact office for the state but when
 
05:39:13.830 --> 05:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
you start looking at how they define
 
05:39:16.788 --> 05:39:16.798 align:start position:0%
things they want a state office just for
 
05:39:18.390 --> 05:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
this compact
 
05:39:21.110 --> 05:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
um and there's no fiscal note regarding
 
05:39:22.868 --> 05:39:22.878 align:start position:0%
that and then also
 
05:39:24.788 --> 05:39:24.798 align:start position:0%
the rules committee once it is
 
05:39:27.830 --> 05:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
established will decide on how the all
 
05:39:29.830 --> 05:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
the work will be financed
 
05:39:31.590 --> 05:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
and that the states will be required to
 
05:39:33.270 --> 05:39:33.280 align:start position:0%
help finance that
 
05:39:35.910 --> 05:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
it also talks about data collection and
 
05:39:38.150 --> 05:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
sharing among various agencies and
 
05:39:38.160 --> 05:39:39.270 align:start position:0%
sharing among various agencies and
states

05:39:39.270 --> 05:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
states
 
05:39:42.390 --> 05:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
and uh we have we have some
 
05:39:44.548 --> 05:39:44.558 align:start position:0%
pretty strong opinions in our state
 
05:39:47.670 --> 05:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
about privacy and
 
05:39:51.350 --> 05:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
i don't know that we want to hand over
 
05:39:51.360 --> 05:39:52.470 align:start position:0%
i don't know that we want to hand over
to

05:39:52.470 --> 05:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:39:55.910 --> 05:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
at least 34 other states a decision on
 
05:39:59.270 --> 05:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
what we feel our citizens have said is
 
05:39:59.280 --> 05:40:00.470 align:start position:0%
what we feel our citizens have said is
privacy

05:40:00.470 --> 05:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
05:40:02.230 --> 05:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
05:40:02.240 --> 05:40:03.670 align:start position:0%
um and so
uh

05:40:03.670 --> 05:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:40:05.510 --> 05:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
you know that's just that's just an
 
05:40:07.350 --> 05:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
overview of some of the things that i've
 
05:40:09.750 --> 05:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
i i'm concerned about this concept so
 
05:40:11.670 --> 05:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
you're in favor of this amendment i am
 
05:40:14.070 --> 05:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
very in favor of this amendment okay
 
05:40:17.030 --> 05:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
other comments
 
05:40:18.868 --> 05:40:18.878 align:start position:0%
i'd like to say that i agree with
 
05:40:21.510 --> 05:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative folsom and that the
 
05:40:23.990 --> 05:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
compact doesn't
 
05:40:26.230 --> 05:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't accept the compact without a
 
05:40:29.590 --> 05:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
great deal of concern because if nothing
 
05:40:31.510 --> 05:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
else it gives
 
05:40:33.990 --> 05:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
rule-making authority to an unelected
 
05:40:34.000 --> 05:40:35.270 align:start position:0%
rule-making authority to an unelected
body

05:40:35.270 --> 05:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
body
 
05:40:39.110 --> 05:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
which is against our state constitution
 
05:40:41.590 --> 05:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
we can delegate that but it we cannot
 
05:40:44.948 --> 05:40:44.958 align:start position:0%
have a rule imposed by this compact
 
05:40:46.708 --> 05:40:46.718 align:start position:0%
board that is
 
05:40:48.948 --> 05:40:48.958 align:start position:0%
has the effect of law in the compact
 
05:40:48.958 --> 05:40:50.548 align:start position:0%
has the effect of law in the compact
states

05:40:50.548 --> 05:40:50.558 align:start position:0%
states
 
05:40:55.190 --> 05:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
anyway other questions comments concerns
 
05:40:58.150 --> 05:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
okay represent bail
 
05:40:59.830 --> 05:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
we've got three amendments here and you
 
05:41:02.310 --> 05:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
said one one aspect of this was some
 
05:41:04.310 --> 05:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
kind of huge priority
 
05:41:06.948 --> 05:41:06.958 align:start position:0%
uh which one gives us that and not the
 
05:41:09.350 --> 05:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
both representative marsha's amendment
 
05:41:11.270 --> 05:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
and representative pearson's amendment
 
05:41:13.510 --> 05:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
include the language that the governor
 
05:41:15.590 --> 05:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
and the children and family law found
 
05:41:15.600 --> 05:41:17.030 align:start position:0%
and the children and family law found
vital

05:41:17.030 --> 05:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
vital
 
05:41:18.548 --> 05:41:18.558 align:start position:0%
okay the difference is that
 
05:41:20.230 --> 05:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
representative pearson's amendment
 
05:41:20.240 --> 05:41:21.510 align:start position:0%
representative pearson's amendment
removes

05:41:21.510 --> 05:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
removes
 
05:41:22.830 --> 05:41:22.840 align:start position:0%
the interstate
 
05:41:26.230 --> 05:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
compact from the bill
 
05:41:31.190 --> 05:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:34.310 --> 05:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
is that correct versus marsh uh yes okay
 
05:41:34.320 --> 05:41:36.548 align:start position:0%
is that correct versus marsh uh yes okay
so

05:41:36.548 --> 05:41:36.558 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:41:38.390 --> 05:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
so we will consider the pearson
 
05:41:38.400 --> 05:41:39.670 align:start position:0%
so we will consider the pearson
amendment

05:41:39.670 --> 05:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:41:42.310 --> 05:41:42.320 align:start position:0%
after if it passes we will go on to the
 
05:41:44.868 --> 05:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
allegro amendment if it does not pass we
 
05:41:46.470 --> 05:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
will consider the march amendment
 
05:41:46.480 --> 05:41:47.590 align:start position:0%
will consider the march amendment
because

05:41:47.590 --> 05:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:41:47.600 --> 05:41:49.030 align:start position:0%
because
um

05:41:49.030 --> 05:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:41:51.510 --> 05:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's one or the other that's reasonable
 
05:41:51.520 --> 05:41:52.470 align:start position:0%
it's one or the other that's reasonable
okay

05:41:52.470 --> 05:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:41:55.110 --> 05:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
so the the question is to adopt the
 
05:41:56.830 --> 05:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
pearson amendment
 
05:42:00.628 --> 05:42:00.638 align:start position:0%
1759 to senate bill 397
 
05:42:02.310 --> 05:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
which deletes
 
05:42:04.868 --> 05:42:04.878 align:start position:0%
the interstate comment compact on the
 
05:42:07.990 --> 05:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
placement of children the 2009 version
 
05:42:10.150 --> 05:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
and adds in the protection of placement
 
05:42:12.548 --> 05:42:12.558 align:start position:0%
of a child with the parent
 
05:42:17.110 --> 05:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:19.270 --> 05:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
mr pearson can you in just one sentence
 
05:42:21.190 --> 05:42:21.200 align:start position:0%
could you just
 
05:42:23.030 --> 05:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry but this is all coming on at
 
05:42:26.070 --> 05:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
the last moment in just one sentence can
 
05:42:26.080 --> 05:42:27.110 align:start position:0%
the last moment in just one sentence can
you

05:42:27.110 --> 05:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:42:31.510 --> 05:42:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:33.110 --> 05:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
if you uh talk to my mother you'll
 
05:42:34.470 --> 05:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
understand that i can't do anything in
 
05:42:35.750 --> 05:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
one sentence
 
05:42:37.430 --> 05:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
so here he said it's already one so
 
05:42:38.548 --> 05:42:38.558 align:start position:0%
here's what i'll tell you what the
 
05:42:40.788 --> 05:42:40.798 align:start position:0%
amendment does this is a two-part piece
 
05:42:43.270 --> 05:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
of legislation 397. it removes the
 
05:42:45.110 --> 05:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
entire second part
 
05:42:45.120 --> 05:42:46.390 align:start position:0%
entire second part
gone

05:42:46.390 --> 05:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
gone
 
05:42:49.110 --> 05:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
totally dispatches of it and then what
 
05:42:51.510 --> 05:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
it does is it tacks on the part that
 
05:42:53.590 --> 05:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
we've been discussing um that is
 
05:42:55.110 --> 05:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
critical to both child and family law
 
05:42:56.948 --> 05:42:56.958 align:start position:0%
and the governor's office in reference
 
05:42:59.430 --> 05:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
to current situations
 
05:43:02.070 --> 05:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
that is um that will fix something in
 
05:43:04.548 --> 05:43:04.558 align:start position:0%
the 1960 compact that we're already in
 
05:43:06.948 --> 05:43:06.958 align:start position:0%
that is extraordinarily problematic
 
05:43:09.590 --> 05:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
so this bill goes from being
 
05:43:12.310 --> 05:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
two compacts
 
05:43:15.270 --> 05:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
to being one compact and some new
 
05:43:16.788 --> 05:43:16.798 align:start position:0%
provisions correct thank you that is
 
05:43:16.798 --> 05:43:19.190 align:start position:0%
provisions correct thank you that is
correct

05:43:19.190 --> 05:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:23.430 --> 05:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
any other any other questions discussion
 
05:43:25.270 --> 05:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none
 
05:43:28.230 --> 05:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
the motion is to adopt the
 
05:43:30.510 --> 05:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
pearson amendment 15
 
05:43:34.548 --> 05:43:34.558 align:start position:0%
1759 h to senate bill 397 and the clerk

okay one two three
 
05:44:30.390 --> 05:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:32.230 --> 05:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
it's ten to nine
 
05:44:32.240 --> 05:44:34.230 align:start position:0%
it's ten to nine
okay

05:44:34.230 --> 05:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:44:36.070 --> 05:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
find the
 
05:44:38.948 --> 05:44:38.958 align:start position:0%
the pearson amendment passes
 
05:44:41.110 --> 05:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
and the so we will not consider the
 
05:44:43.430 --> 05:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
marsh amendment we will go on to the
 
05:44:46.628 --> 05:44:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:48.788 --> 05:44:48.798 align:start position:0%
mark you will make a motion
 
05:44:52.830 --> 05:44:52.840 align:start position:0%
um yes i uh well obviously i propose his
 
05:44:55.750 --> 05:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
amendment um
 
05:44:55.760 --> 05:44:57.270 align:start position:0%
amendment um
and

05:44:57.270 --> 05:44:57.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:44:58.230 --> 05:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
it does
 
05:45:01.510 --> 05:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
two things from my point of view
 
05:45:05.510 --> 05:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
one is it it addresses what we just did
 
05:45:08.708 --> 05:45:08.718 align:start position:0%
for part one for part two for part one
 
05:45:11.190 --> 05:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
it simply removes the interstate compact
 
05:45:13.350 --> 05:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
on mental health
 
05:45:16.470 --> 05:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
that satisfies me because again
 
05:45:16.480 --> 05:45:19.030 align:start position:0%
that satisfies me because again
um

05:45:19.030 --> 05:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:20.470 --> 05:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
several people have made the point that
 
05:45:22.628 --> 05:45:22.638 align:start position:0%
we're seeding
 
05:45:24.230 --> 05:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
our authority
 
05:45:27.510 --> 05:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
to other states
 
05:45:29.910 --> 05:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
but as i said i would be remiss if i
 
05:45:31.110 --> 05:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
didn't say
 
05:45:33.350 --> 05:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
what i said on friday
 
05:45:35.350 --> 05:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
i see language in here that is very
 
05:45:37.510 --> 05:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
bothersome to me
 
05:45:40.470 --> 05:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
i understand that this is embedded
 
05:45:41.670 --> 05:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
in most
 
05:45:41.680 --> 05:45:43.510 align:start position:0%
in most
professional

05:45:43.510 --> 05:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
professional
 
05:45:45.830 --> 05:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
societies and boards and
 
05:45:48.390 --> 05:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
employment places
 
05:45:50.628 --> 05:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
and that's language on
 
05:45:50.638 --> 05:45:52.470 align:start position:0%
and that's language on
insisting

05:45:52.470 --> 05:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
insisting
 
05:45:52.480 --> 05:45:53.590 align:start position:0%
insisting
on

05:45:53.590 --> 05:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:45:55.910 --> 05:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh training in i don't remember the
 
05:45:58.070 --> 05:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
precise words now
 
05:46:01.270 --> 05:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
cultural diversity
 
05:46:02.830 --> 05:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
whatever it
 
05:46:06.548 --> 05:46:06.558 align:start position:0%
was we have a law in this state
 
05:46:10.390 --> 05:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
that addresses divisive concepts
 
05:46:11.990 --> 05:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
anyone and everyone could sit here in
 
05:46:13.350 --> 05:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
this room and tell me oh it's a
 
05:46:15.030 --> 05:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
different thing this is cultural
 
05:46:15.040 --> 05:46:17.110 align:start position:0%
different thing this is cultural
diversity

05:46:17.110 --> 05:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
diversity
 
05:46:19.830 --> 05:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
i have seen too many times
 
05:46:21.750 --> 05:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
and i am guessing that most of the
 
05:46:23.750 --> 05:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
people in this room have seen too many
 
05:46:23.760 --> 05:46:24.788 align:start position:0%
people in this room have seen too many
times

05:46:24.788 --> 05:46:24.798 align:start position:0%
times
 
05:46:27.110 --> 05:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
that this is a moving target
 
05:46:28.070 --> 05:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
and that
 
05:46:29.510 --> 05:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
the terms
 
05:46:31.750 --> 05:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
cultural diversity or whatever it was in
 
05:46:33.510 --> 05:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
this one
 
05:46:35.830 --> 05:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
is just a euphemism
 
05:46:35.840 --> 05:46:38.150 align:start position:0%
is just a euphemism
or

05:46:38.150 --> 05:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:39.910 --> 05:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
dare i say the words critical race
 
05:46:39.920 --> 05:46:42.070 align:start position:0%
dare i say the words critical race
theory

05:46:42.070 --> 05:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
theory
 
05:46:45.350 --> 05:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
i cannot and i will not
 
05:46:47.830 --> 05:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
in the future ever again
 
05:46:50.150 --> 05:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
support anything that violates the
 
05:46:52.470 --> 05:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
language of hb 544 that we passed in
 
05:46:57.350 --> 05:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:58.628 --> 05:46:58.638 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
05:47:01.830 --> 05:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
no second okay
 
05:47:03.350 --> 05:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure we're talking
 
05:47:06.788 --> 05:47:06.798 align:start position:0%
about amendment 17 35 h correct
 
05:47:06.798 --> 05:47:08.470 align:start position:0%
about amendment 17 35 h correct
yes

05:47:08.470 --> 05:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:47:09.510 --> 05:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:47:11.910 --> 05:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:47:14.708 --> 05:47:14.718 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your second yes
 
05:47:18.548 --> 05:47:18.558 align:start position:0%
i uh i certainly support um
 
05:47:20.628 --> 05:47:20.638 align:start position:0%
what representative elieger i think is
 
05:47:22.150 --> 05:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
trying to do but i actually do have a
 
05:47:22.160 --> 05:47:23.190 align:start position:0%
trying to do but i actually do have a
question

05:47:23.190 --> 05:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:47:24.628 --> 05:47:24.638 align:start position:0%
which is sort of a
 
05:47:27.350 --> 05:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
mechanical question into how
 
05:47:30.470 --> 05:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
this will fit together with um
 
05:47:30.480 --> 05:47:31.430 align:start position:0%
this will fit together with um
uh

05:47:31.430 --> 05:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:47:35.110 --> 05:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:37.910 --> 05:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
i see that it'll get rid of one and two
 
05:47:39.830 --> 05:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
and it will replace three and four which
 
05:47:42.548 --> 05:47:42.558 align:start position:0%
basically gets rid of them with this
 
05:47:44.708 --> 05:47:44.718 align:start position:0%
contingency but the question is will it
 
05:47:46.150 --> 05:47:46.160 align:start position:0%
leave in
 
05:47:46.160 --> 05:47:47.030 align:start position:0%
leave in
uh

05:47:47.030 --> 05:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:47:49.270 --> 05:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
the additional language that was added
 
05:47:52.230 --> 05:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
by the other prior amendment we adopted
 
05:47:56.230 --> 05:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
no it will not it will override the
 
05:48:03.830 --> 05:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:03.840 --> 05:48:05.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:48:05.030 --> 05:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:07.190 --> 05:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
so yes we would
 
05:48:10.070 --> 05:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
if we pass this amendment i we will need
 
05:48:12.948 --> 05:48:12.958 align:start position:0%
to discuss whether we need a
 
05:48:16.548 --> 05:48:16.558 align:start position:0%
corrected amendment that includes
 
05:48:18.628 --> 05:48:18.638 align:start position:0%
that new language from the pearson
 
05:48:26.548 --> 05:48:26.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:32.948 --> 05:48:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:35.990 --> 05:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
amazing okay i will uh
 
05:48:38.070 --> 05:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
so this amendment essentially deletes
 
05:48:43.510 --> 05:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:43.520 --> 05:48:45.590 align:start position:0%
 
counselors

05:48:45.590 --> 05:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
counselors
 
05:48:54.150 --> 05:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:56.390 --> 05:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
can i just clarify something
 
05:48:58.788 --> 05:48:58.798 align:start position:0%
so f if both of these amendments pass
 
05:49:01.270 --> 05:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
we've deleted both compacts but we
 
05:49:03.590 --> 05:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
haven't really resolved the issue
 
05:49:06.150 --> 05:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
that we need to resolve is that correct
 
05:49:09.270 --> 05:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
that's why i think we need to
 
05:49:09.280 --> 05:49:10.390 align:start position:0%
that's why i think we need to
consider

05:49:10.390 --> 05:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
consider
 
05:49:12.868 --> 05:49:12.878 align:start position:0%
reinserting the language of the pearson
 
05:49:12.878 --> 05:49:14.470 align:start position:0%
reinserting the language of the pearson
amendment

05:49:14.470 --> 05:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:49:14.480 --> 05:49:17.110 align:start position:0%
amendment
because

05:49:17.110 --> 05:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:19.510 --> 05:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
and leave that as the only content of
 
05:49:23.270 --> 05:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
the bill if we pass this amendment also
 
05:49:25.510 --> 05:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
i will recommend that we do so because
 
05:49:27.750 --> 05:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's important
 
05:49:30.270 --> 05:49:30.280 align:start position:0%
okay so it's we're adopting amendment
 
05:49:34.150 --> 05:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
1735 to senate bill 397 representative

it's a six six to thirteen
 
05:50:30.948 --> 05:50:30.958 align:start position:0%
amendment fails

the amendment fails 6 to 13.
 
05:50:37.510 --> 05:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
so representative pearson you have a
 
05:50:41.190 --> 05:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
a motion i do i i do have a motion on
 
05:50:46.830 --> 05:50:46.840 align:start position:0%
senate bill 397 otp with amendment
 
05:50:50.070 --> 05:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
1759 h
 
05:50:51.990 --> 05:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
the pearson amendment
 
05:50:52.000 --> 05:51:03.910 align:start position:0%
the pearson amendment
okay

05:51:03.910 --> 05:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:05.830 --> 05:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
with the pearson amendment which
 
05:51:08.150 --> 05:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
replaces the interstate compact for
 
05:51:10.230 --> 05:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
children with the specific language that
 
05:51:14.150 --> 05:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
we want to adopt so it's otpa
 
05:51:17.750 --> 05:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
with amendment 1759
 
05:51:21.750 --> 05:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:28.150 --> 05:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:28.160 --> 05:51:35.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:51:35.190 --> 05:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:35.200 --> 05:51:36.948 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:51:36.948 --> 05:51:36.958 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:51:39.350 --> 05:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
you wish to speak to your motion
 
05:51:42.310 --> 05:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh we've we've certainly covered um
 
05:51:44.470 --> 05:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
what what my amendment does to the bill
 
05:51:46.230 --> 05:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
and uh so i don't think there's anything
 
05:51:48.150 --> 05:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
else to say
 
05:51:51.990 --> 05:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
all right any other comments
 
05:51:53.510 --> 05:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
for the record i won't support this
 
05:51:56.548 --> 05:51:56.558 align:start position:0%
because i do think that the 1960s
 
05:51:59.750 --> 05:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
version needs to be replaced badly and
 
05:52:02.390 --> 05:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
and i intend to have a minority report
 
05:52:04.628 --> 05:52:04.638 align:start position:0%
reflect that fact
 
05:52:06.628 --> 05:52:06.638 align:start position:0%
so you are you are not supporting it you
 
05:52:08.788 --> 05:52:08.798 align:start position:0%
are opposing it i will i will oppose
 
05:52:10.948 --> 05:52:10.958 align:start position:0%
otpa because i think that we need a
 
05:52:16.708 --> 05:52:16.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:22.070 --> 05:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:23.110 --> 05:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:52:25.990 --> 05:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
the motion is ought to pass with the
 
05:52:29.030 --> 05:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
pearson amendment on senate bill 397 and
 
05:52:32.868 --> 05:52:32.878 align:start position:0%

05:55:17.350 --> 05:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:55:19.510 --> 05:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
okay do you wish to speak to your motion
 
05:55:21.910 --> 05:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um i have a couple or a
 
05:55:24.230 --> 05:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
few reasons why i
 
05:55:26.548 --> 05:55:26.558 align:start position:0%
am not in support of this bill
 
05:55:28.230 --> 05:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
the one that i think
 
05:55:30.548 --> 05:55:30.558 align:start position:0%
resonates most with this committee
 
05:55:32.150 --> 05:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
is the idea that we shouldn't be in the
 
05:55:34.948 --> 05:55:34.958 align:start position:0%
business of creating memorial days
 
05:55:37.670 --> 05:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
and i think we've rejected virtually
 
05:55:40.470 --> 05:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
virtually every one of them this year
 
05:55:40.480 --> 05:55:41.910 align:start position:0%
virtually every one of them this year
um

05:55:41.910 --> 05:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:55:43.270 --> 05:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
05:55:45.270 --> 05:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
my number one concern the the other was
 
05:55:47.510 --> 05:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
i was very surprised this morning to see
 
05:55:47.520 --> 05:55:48.948 align:start position:0%
i was very surprised this morning to see
nobody

05:55:48.948 --> 05:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
nobody
 
05:55:50.628 --> 05:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
in testimony supporting unless i'm
 
05:55:50.638 --> 05:55:52.868 align:start position:0%
in testimony supporting unless i'm
forgetting

05:55:52.868 --> 05:55:52.878 align:start position:0%
forgetting
 
05:55:54.788 --> 05:55:54.798 align:start position:0%
nobody showed up
 
05:55:56.470 --> 05:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
so i don't think there's
 
05:55:56.480 --> 05:55:57.430 align:start position:0%
so i don't think there's
a

05:55:57.430 --> 05:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:55:58.948 --> 05:55:58.958 align:start position:0%
great amount of interest in this to
 
05:56:00.310 --> 05:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
begin with and i
 
05:56:02.150 --> 05:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
i don't like adding legislation to the
 
05:56:10.150 --> 05:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:12.628 --> 05:56:12.638 align:start position:0%
uh basically what he said is good
 
05:56:12.638 --> 05:56:14.230 align:start position:0%
uh basically what he said is good
hey

05:56:14.230 --> 05:56:14.240 align:start position:0%

05:56:16.230 --> 05:56:16.240 align:start position:0%

with enough of these memorial days
 
05:56:20.948 --> 05:56:20.958 align:start position:0%
they won't be memorable
 
05:56:23.910 --> 05:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
that's been our position thank you
 
05:56:26.948 --> 05:56:26.958 align:start position:0%

05:56:28.470 --> 05:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:56:31.030 --> 05:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
um i agree with what was previously said
 
05:56:32.548 --> 05:56:32.558 align:start position:0%
and although we're not voting on the
 
05:56:34.628 --> 05:56:34.638 align:start position:0%
amendment i i wouldn't move to adopt the
 
05:56:36.150 --> 05:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
amendment because it had problems as
 
05:56:40.230 --> 05:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:44.310 --> 05:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
thank you and i i agree i also
 
05:56:46.310 --> 05:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
let initially liked the idea of the
 
05:56:49.750 --> 05:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
amendment but it it is was not as well
 
05:56:51.830 --> 05:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
thought through as it should have been
 
05:56:54.948 --> 05:56:54.958 align:start position:0%
and i would recommend the constituent
 
05:56:57.190 --> 05:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
simply apply to the board for license
 
05:57:00.150 --> 05:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
which he should have done earlier

06:00:41.840 --> 06:00:43.470 align:start position:0%
that says delete section two

06:00:43.470 --> 06:00:43.480 align:start position:0%

06:00:44.830 --> 06:00:44.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:00:50.070 --> 06:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:50.080 --> 06:00:51.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:00:51.190 --> 06:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:00:55.350 --> 06:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:57.750 --> 06:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
this build delete section two which is
 
06:01:01.750 --> 06:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
what which was added by the senate
 
06:01:04.150 --> 06:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
and that's the section that all the
 
06:01:07.190 --> 06:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
other case managers are upset about
 
06:01:10.230 --> 06:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
the situation is there are about six
 
06:01:12.868 --> 06:01:12.878 align:start position:0%
different types of case managers
 
06:01:15.350 --> 06:01:15.360 align:start position:0%
the people who have been pushing for
 
06:01:15.360 --> 06:01:16.310 align:start position:0%
the people who have been pushing for
this

06:01:16.310 --> 06:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:01:16.320 --> 06:01:17.670 align:start position:0%
this
bill

06:01:17.670 --> 06:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:01:22.948 --> 06:01:22.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:22.958 --> 06:01:24.470 align:start position:0%
 
is

06:01:24.470 --> 06:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:01:26.470 --> 06:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
one type they deal with
 
06:01:28.470 --> 06:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
medicaid with
 
06:01:29.750 --> 06:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
home care
 
06:01:32.788 --> 06:01:32.798 align:start position:0%
for nursing home eligible people it's
 
06:01:34.628 --> 06:01:34.638 align:start position:0%
probably the largest group of case
 
06:01:37.270 --> 06:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
managers but it's not the only one
 
06:01:39.190 --> 06:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
the other
 
06:01:41.190 --> 06:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
groups deal with developmentally
 
06:01:44.628 --> 06:01:44.638 align:start position:0%
disabled or private services
 
06:01:44.638 --> 06:01:51.910 align:start position:0%
disabled or private services
and

06:01:51.910 --> 06:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:53.430 --> 06:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
and they do not
 
06:01:53.440 --> 06:01:55.990 align:start position:0%
and they do not
appreciate

06:01:55.990 --> 06:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
06:01:59.670 --> 06:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
having their having the description of
 
06:01:59.680 --> 06:02:00.470 align:start position:0%
having their having the description of
one

06:02:00.470 --> 06:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
one
 
06:02:02.948 --> 06:02:02.958 align:start position:0%
branch of case managers
 
06:02:04.070 --> 06:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
be the
 
06:02:06.868 --> 06:02:06.878 align:start position:0%
definition in statute
 
06:02:08.310 --> 06:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
and so
 
06:02:08.320 --> 06:02:09.190 align:start position:0%
and so
what

06:02:09.190 --> 06:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
what
 
06:02:11.910 --> 06:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
what this does is essentially delete the
 
06:02:14.230 --> 06:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
senate amendment and brings it back to
 
06:02:14.240 --> 06:02:15.190 align:start position:0%
senate amendment and brings it back to
the

06:02:15.190 --> 06:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:02:17.430 --> 06:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
as introduced status
 
06:02:19.990 --> 06:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
which all of the other groups looked at
 
06:02:22.390 --> 06:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
and decided to ignore
 
06:02:24.628 --> 06:02:24.638 align:start position:0%
it so it was only when the senate
 
06:02:26.868 --> 06:02:26.878 align:start position:0%
amendment was passed that they came out
 
06:02:28.708 --> 06:02:28.718 align:start position:0%
and said wait a minute you're
 
06:02:30.868 --> 06:02:30.878 align:start position:0%
you're doing it to us and we don't don't
 
06:02:32.948 --> 06:02:32.958 align:start position:0%
really want it
 
06:02:32.958 --> 06:02:34.948 align:start position:0%
really want it
um

06:02:34.948 --> 06:02:34.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:36.230 --> 06:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
06:02:38.548 --> 06:02:38.558 align:start position:0%
one solution to the issue
 
06:02:38.558 --> 06:02:39.430 align:start position:0%
one solution to the issue
and

06:02:39.430 --> 06:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:02:41.190 --> 06:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
i will
 
06:02:43.430 --> 06:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
welcome comments rep representative
 
06:02:44.788 --> 06:02:44.798 align:start position:0%
blackist you wish to speak to your
 
06:02:48.470 --> 06:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
second um just briefly as uh and i think
 
06:02:50.070 --> 06:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
is where we're going but
 
06:02:50.080 --> 06:02:51.110 align:start position:0%
is where we're going but
uh

06:02:51.110 --> 06:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:02:52.628 --> 06:02:52.638 align:start position:0%
looking at the marsh amendment it
 
06:02:55.270 --> 06:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
appears that it also uh deletes section
 
06:02:56.868 --> 06:02:56.878 align:start position:0%
two but does some other things so i'd
 
06:02:57.750 --> 06:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
like to
 
06:03:00.470 --> 06:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
so if we adopted it uh it would do that
 
06:03:02.708 --> 06:03:02.718 align:start position:0%
part and other things and so as i'm sure
 
06:03:04.070 --> 06:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
represent marshall's ready i'd like to
 
06:03:05.430 --> 06:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
hear what the difference yeah well i
 
06:03:08.070 --> 06:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
will i will just mention that the senate
 
06:03:10.628 --> 06:03:10.638 align:start position:0%
has agreed to
 
06:03:12.628 --> 06:03:12.638 align:start position:0%
at least from i have been assured that
 
06:03:15.270 --> 06:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
they agree to my amendment the marsh
 
06:03:17.670 --> 06:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
amendment incorporates some language
 
06:03:20.390 --> 06:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
that was offered in the senate and not
 
06:03:20.400 --> 06:03:21.430 align:start position:0%
that was offered in the senate and not
chosen

06:03:21.430 --> 06:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
chosen
 
06:03:23.430 --> 06:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
and they would not approve of it
 
06:03:25.190 --> 06:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
at least that's my understanding thank
 
06:03:25.200 --> 06:03:26.310 align:start position:0%
at least that's my understanding thank
you

06:03:26.310 --> 06:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:03:27.910 --> 06:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative marsh you wish to
 
06:03:30.230 --> 06:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
speak uh thank you i i have to admit
 
06:03:31.510 --> 06:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
that when we had the hearing for this
 
06:03:33.430 --> 06:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
bill it was distinctly unclear what was
 
06:03:34.470 --> 06:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
going on
 
06:03:36.788 --> 06:03:36.798 align:start position:0%
we heard further uh information at
 
06:03:38.948 --> 06:03:38.958 align:start position:0%
health and human services oversight last
 
06:03:41.110 --> 06:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
friday when we heard testimony from the
 
06:03:42.708 --> 06:03:42.718 align:start position:0%
division of long-term supports and
 
06:03:44.628 --> 06:03:44.638 align:start position:0%
services bureau of developmental
 
06:03:47.350 --> 06:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
services the issue is that there are
 
06:03:49.030 --> 06:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
more parties involved than the house and
 
06:03:50.470 --> 06:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
the senate there's also the federal
 
06:03:52.470 --> 06:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
government turns out that the federal
 
06:03:52.480 --> 06:03:53.430 align:start position:0%
government turns out that the federal
government

06:03:53.430 --> 06:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
government
 
06:03:56.150 --> 06:03:56.160 align:start position:0%
passed the deficit reduction act of 2005
 
06:03:58.390 --> 06:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
which required a number of things one
 
06:04:01.030 --> 06:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
thing which we did hear about was that
 
06:04:03.110 --> 06:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
conflict case management be provided we
 
06:04:04.868 --> 06:04:04.878 align:start position:0%
heard about that in the testimony but
 
06:04:07.590 --> 06:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
they also adopted a rule uh that
 
06:04:10.310 --> 06:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
required that there be only one case
 
06:04:14.628 --> 06:04:14.638 align:start position:0%
manager at a time for medicaid providers
 
06:04:16.708 --> 06:04:16.718 align:start position:0%
and the reason why was because they were
 
06:04:18.628 --> 06:04:18.638 align:start position:0%
receiving multiple
 
06:04:20.310 --> 06:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
bills for services some of which may or
 
06:04:22.230 --> 06:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
may not have been provided
 
06:04:24.310 --> 06:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire is currently
 
06:04:24.320 --> 06:04:25.270 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire is currently
under

06:04:25.270 --> 06:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
under
 
06:04:25.280 --> 06:04:28.548 align:start position:0%
under
a

06:04:28.548 --> 06:04:28.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:30.230 --> 06:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan which must be
 
06:04:32.548 --> 06:04:32.558 align:start position:0%
implemented by next june to provide two
 
06:04:34.310 --> 06:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
things one of which is conflict-free
 
06:04:35.830 --> 06:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
case management we heard about that but
 
06:04:37.510 --> 06:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
the second was to fully implement the
 
06:04:39.910 --> 06:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
single case manager provision of the
 
06:04:42.470 --> 06:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
1915 c waiver program and if we fail to
 
06:04:44.628 --> 06:04:44.638 align:start position:0%
comply with that our federal medicaid
 
06:04:47.270 --> 06:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
money is substantially at risk and they
 
06:04:49.590 --> 06:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
don't need to remind people that that is
 
06:04:52.470 --> 06:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of money
 
06:04:52.480 --> 06:04:53.270 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of money
the

06:04:53.270 --> 06:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:04:55.750 --> 06:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
issue that adopting either the maguire
 
06:04:58.788 --> 06:04:58.798 align:start position:0%
amendment or what we heard in as
 
06:05:00.948 --> 06:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
was brought to us from the senate is
 
06:05:04.548 --> 06:05:04.558 align:start position:0%
that it can it confuses the definitions
 
06:05:07.750 --> 06:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
of home health providers with uh case
 
06:05:11.270 --> 06:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
managers which are in the eyes of cms
 
06:05:13.430 --> 06:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
two separate entities
 
06:05:15.750 --> 06:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
and the federal government wants those
 
06:05:17.990 --> 06:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
to be clearly distinct so that the case
 
06:05:20.708 --> 06:05:20.718 align:start position:0%
managers are supervising and ensuring
 
06:05:22.708 --> 06:05:22.718 align:start position:0%
that the services that are contracted
 
06:05:25.110 --> 06:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
for are actually provided
 
06:05:26.868 --> 06:05:26.878 align:start position:0%
i i will unfortunately have to vote
 
06:05:29.670 --> 06:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
against your amendment uh and put forth
 
06:05:31.590 --> 06:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
my amendment as an alternative because i
 
06:05:32.948 --> 06:05:32.958 align:start position:0%
think that's the only way we can be
 
06:05:36.868 --> 06:05:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:38.628 --> 06:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
that's interesting
 
06:05:41.750 --> 06:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh yes my copies of my men are on the
 
06:05:44.150 --> 06:05:44.160 align:start position:0%
table buried up under more
 
06:05:45.430 --> 06:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
more recent
 
06:05:45.440 --> 06:05:46.868 align:start position:0%
more recent
paperwork

06:05:46.868 --> 06:05:46.878 align:start position:0%
paperwork
 
06:05:46.878 --> 06:05:48.788 align:start position:0%
paperwork
um

06:05:48.788 --> 06:05:48.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:05:55.190 --> 06:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:57.670 --> 06:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
yeah represent pearson thank you i
 
06:05:59.350 --> 06:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
um health and human services oversight
 
06:06:01.270 --> 06:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
committee is
 
06:06:03.190 --> 06:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
something that is charged with looking
 
06:06:03.200 --> 06:06:04.470 align:start position:0%
something that is charged with looking
at

06:06:04.470 --> 06:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
at
 
06:06:07.110 --> 06:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
this giant blend of the federal
 
06:06:07.120 --> 06:06:08.948 align:start position:0%
this giant blend of the federal
government's

06:06:08.948 --> 06:06:08.958 align:start position:0%
government's
 
06:06:12.310 --> 06:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
gigantic hand on what we do
 
06:06:18.628 --> 06:06:18.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:21.110 --> 06:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
and i i know for a fact that they take
 
06:06:23.350 --> 06:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
that job extraordinarily seriously so
 
06:06:26.390 --> 06:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm concerned that what was revealed
 
06:06:27.750 --> 06:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
in the health and human services
 
06:06:29.750 --> 06:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
oversight meeting
 
06:06:29.760 --> 06:06:30.948 align:start position:0%
oversight meeting
um

06:06:30.948 --> 06:06:30.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:06:32.470 --> 06:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
really does need to be taken into
 
06:06:35.190 --> 06:06:35.200 align:start position:0%
account and i'm not entirely sure how
 
06:06:37.830 --> 06:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
that how we do that so i'm i'll be
 
06:06:39.910 --> 06:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
looking for additional
 
06:06:42.310 --> 06:06:42.320 align:start position:0%
discussion in reference to to that i
 
06:06:44.310 --> 06:06:44.320 align:start position:0%
know representative marsh was there i i
 
06:06:48.390 --> 06:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:48.400 --> 06:06:49.350 align:start position:0%
 
yes

yes
larkis

06:06:50.390 --> 06:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
larkis
 
06:06:54.230 --> 06:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you um do we have any idea of why
 
06:06:57.830 --> 06:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
the uh senate is opposed to uh what
 
06:07:00.310 --> 06:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
representative marsh is proposing is it
 
06:07:02.070 --> 06:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
gonna do something they don't like that
 
06:07:04.230 --> 06:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
we know or
 
06:07:08.070 --> 06:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
i believe i represent mars do you know
 
06:07:08.080 --> 06:07:09.990 align:start position:0%
i believe i represent mars do you know
the

06:07:09.990 --> 06:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:07:11.750 --> 06:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
my my
 
06:07:13.750 --> 06:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
contacts with the senate from which i
 
06:07:17.510 --> 06:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
would answer that question are currently
 
06:07:19.750 --> 06:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
not inclined to speak to me on subject
 
06:07:21.670 --> 06:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
for other reasons
 
06:07:23.910 --> 06:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
okay well i would suggest that it may
 
06:07:25.750 --> 06:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
have been due to the opposition of the
 
06:07:28.070 --> 06:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
other groups of case managers
 
06:07:30.548 --> 06:07:30.558 align:start position:0%
who didn't want
 
06:07:33.270 --> 06:07:33.280 align:start position:0%
the medicaid definition
 
06:07:36.390 --> 06:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
imposed as the only type of case manager
 
06:07:39.270 --> 06:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
because there are other types including
 
06:07:42.150 --> 06:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
private pay that do not have to follow
 
06:07:44.310 --> 06:07:44.320 align:start position:0%
these federal rules
 
06:07:47.190 --> 06:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
and so
 
06:07:48.230 --> 06:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
i would
 
06:07:50.310 --> 06:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
i would consider your amendment as if
 
06:07:52.548 --> 06:07:52.558 align:start position:0%
you were to say that case management
 
06:07:55.670 --> 06:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
agencies for the purposes of a home and
 
06:07:57.910 --> 06:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
community based care
 
06:08:00.470 --> 06:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
must meet these requirements
 
06:08:01.990 --> 06:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
i would be willing to do that but not
 
06:08:03.030 --> 06:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
for to save for a home and
 
06:08:04.788 --> 06:08:04.798 align:start position:0%
community-based care but for
 
06:08:06.230 --> 06:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
the purposes of enrollment in the
 
06:08:08.470 --> 06:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
medicaid program uh but but if that's
 
06:08:10.628 --> 06:08:10.638 align:start position:0%
acceptable for you i'll be glad to get
 
06:08:12.548 --> 06:08:12.558 align:start position:0%
an other amendment and we can recess
 
06:08:15.030 --> 06:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
this to later i think that would solve
 
06:08:16.390 --> 06:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
the issue
 
06:08:19.910 --> 06:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you i will do that okay we will
 
06:08:20.868 --> 06:08:20.878 align:start position:0%
we will
 
06:08:24.150 --> 06:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
we will recess senate bill 333
 
06:08:26.070 --> 06:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
and get a better
 
06:08:29.670 --> 06:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
amendment that addresses the real issues
 
06:08:32.628 --> 06:08:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:35.750 --> 06:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
what else have we got
 
06:08:35.760 --> 06:08:42.310 align:start position:0%
what else have we got
um

06:08:42.310 --> 06:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:44.070 --> 06:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
that we had this morning
 
06:08:46.548 --> 06:08:46.558 align:start position:0%
oh wait that's been killed
 
06:08:49.030 --> 06:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
we did we deleted the bill
 
06:08:51.430 --> 06:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
all right uh senate bill 450 the
 
06:08:53.910 --> 06:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board
 
06:08:55.270 --> 06:08:55.280 align:start position:0%
representative lucas you have an
 
06:08:57.990 --> 06:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
amendment do you have a motion i do um
 
06:09:00.868 --> 06:09:00.878 align:start position:0%
i'd like to move interim study on this
 
06:09:00.878 --> 06:09:02.548 align:start position:0%
i'd like to move interim study on this
bill

06:09:02.548 --> 06:09:02.558 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:09:07.510 --> 06:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:09.430 --> 06:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
all right breakfast seconded by
 
06:09:11.830 --> 06:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
representative allegro
 
06:09:11.840 --> 06:09:13.750 align:start position:0%
representative allegro
and

06:09:13.750 --> 06:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:09:15.910 --> 06:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
do you should speak to your motion i do
 
06:09:15.920 --> 06:09:17.030 align:start position:0%
do you should speak to your motion i do
um

06:09:17.030 --> 06:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:19.750 --> 06:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
first this is related to um not
 
06:09:22.830 --> 06:09:22.840 align:start position:0%
identical but related to house bill
 
06:09:25.830 --> 06:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
1566 on the prescription drug drug
 
06:09:27.910 --> 06:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
affordability board which we
 
06:09:31.510 --> 06:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:33.350 --> 06:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
i think this amendment
 
06:09:35.990 --> 06:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
may fix some of the concerns
 
06:09:36.000 --> 06:09:36.830 align:start position:0%
may fix some of the concerns
certainly

06:09:36.830 --> 06:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
06:09:39.670 --> 06:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
around well actually it doesn't it with
 
06:09:42.150 --> 06:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
it it could be
 
06:09:44.310 --> 06:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
the bill actually has some
 
06:09:46.150 --> 06:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
issues around the fees and it's
 
06:09:48.470 --> 06:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
internally inconsistent but i think just
 
06:09:51.190 --> 06:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
trying to amend that right now
 
06:09:54.470 --> 06:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't uh take care of everything um
 
06:09:56.708 --> 06:09:56.718 align:start position:0%
i mean i have concerns that
 
06:09:59.430 --> 06:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
it has very broad exemptions from 91a i
 
06:10:00.948 --> 06:10:00.958 align:start position:0%
understand that it does deal with
 
06:10:03.270 --> 06:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
information private proprietary
 
06:10:03.280 --> 06:10:04.470 align:start position:0%
information private proprietary
information

06:10:04.470 --> 06:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
information
 
06:10:06.788 --> 06:10:06.798 align:start position:0%
that does need to be kept
 
06:10:09.030 --> 06:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
um you know not made public
 
06:10:10.628 --> 06:10:10.638 align:start position:0%
um but
 
06:10:12.230 --> 06:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
i think we need to look at it and figure
 
06:10:14.070 --> 06:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
out whether all of its deliberations
 
06:10:14.080 --> 06:10:15.510 align:start position:0%
out whether all of its deliberations
really

06:10:15.510 --> 06:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
really
 
06:10:17.110 --> 06:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
should be hidden from the public other
 
06:10:18.708 --> 06:10:18.718 align:start position:0%
than the final decisions i have a real
 
06:10:20.628 --> 06:10:20.638 align:start position:0%
problem with that
 
06:10:23.350 --> 06:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
and then the other thing is um
 
06:10:25.190 --> 06:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if there's
 
06:10:27.590 --> 06:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
is a sense of being entirely good or bad
 
06:10:27.600 --> 06:10:28.470 align:start position:0%
is a sense of being entirely good or bad
but

06:10:28.470 --> 06:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:10:31.430 --> 06:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
well it's true it's not a
 
06:10:33.270 --> 06:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
price fixing bill
 
06:10:35.510 --> 06:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
or law it's a law now
 
06:10:37.670 --> 06:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
but um
 
06:10:40.150 --> 06:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
it kind of sort of is in that
 
06:10:42.070 --> 06:10:42.080 align:start position:0%
if they're not able to negotiate a price
 
06:10:45.510 --> 06:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
with suppliers that meets the board's um
 
06:10:47.350 --> 06:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
desires then
 
06:10:48.788 --> 06:10:48.798 align:start position:0%
they can say the state won't be able to
 
06:10:50.708 --> 06:10:50.718 align:start position:0%
buy certain things
 
06:10:53.110 --> 06:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
and you know even if the doctor of the
 
06:10:54.948 --> 06:10:54.958 align:start position:0%
patient's doctor thinks that's the best
 
06:10:56.708 --> 06:10:56.718 align:start position:0%
thing for them
 
06:10:58.628 --> 06:10:58.638 align:start position:0%
and um you know i have some concerns
 
06:10:59.990 --> 06:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
about that as well and some other things
 
06:11:01.190 --> 06:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
06:11:04.070 --> 06:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
you know really uh studying this is
 
06:11:05.590 --> 06:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
something we should do for both of those
 
06:11:07.190 --> 06:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
bills thanks
 
06:11:08.628 --> 06:11:08.638 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
06:11:09.990 --> 06:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your second
 
06:11:12.150 --> 06:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
briefly i remember what a quagmire the
 
06:11:14.470 --> 06:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
debate on the house bill turned into and
 
06:11:16.230 --> 06:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
that their if i recall was broad
 
06:11:18.470 --> 06:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
consensus that it would benefit from
 
06:11:20.948 --> 06:11:20.958 align:start position:0%
some additional study
 
06:11:22.948 --> 06:11:22.958 align:start position:0%
thank you representative marsh
 
06:11:25.270 --> 06:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you i cannot support this
 
06:11:27.510 --> 06:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
motion i believe this bill ought to pass
 
06:11:30.310 --> 06:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
first of all as far as 91a is concerned
 
06:11:31.910 --> 06:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
i serve on the prescription drug
 
06:11:33.510 --> 06:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
affordability board its meetings are
 
06:11:36.390 --> 06:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
public uh they had one this afternoon
 
06:11:38.390 --> 06:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
and i believe that they are viewable
 
06:11:40.390 --> 06:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
online except when you're in the middle
 
06:11:42.548 --> 06:11:42.558 align:start position:0%
of an executive session of the edna
 
06:11:44.948 --> 06:11:44.958 align:start position:0%
committee so i'll have to have them let
 
06:11:47.190 --> 06:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
them catch me up on what happened this
 
06:11:47.200 --> 06:11:48.390 align:start position:0%
them catch me up on what happened this
afternoon

06:11:48.390 --> 06:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
06:11:50.548 --> 06:11:50.558 align:start position:0%
regarding the fees i think it is quite
 
06:11:51.830 --> 06:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
evident that when you look at the whole
 
06:11:54.548 --> 06:11:54.558 align:start position:0%
statute that the board is capable of
 
06:11:56.708 --> 06:11:56.718 align:start position:0%
waiving fees such that they do not go
 
06:11:59.590 --> 06:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
over 125 percent in compliance with this
 
06:12:03.430 --> 06:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
amendment and i gave that language uh to
 
06:12:05.110 --> 06:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
my colleague to my right to read to the
 
06:12:07.110 --> 06:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
committee during the testimony as i was
 
06:12:09.190 --> 06:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
a sponsor the bill and not able to do so
 
06:12:09.200 --> 06:12:10.868 align:start position:0%
a sponsor the bill and not able to do so
myself

06:12:10.868 --> 06:12:10.878 align:start position:0%
myself
 
06:12:13.510 --> 06:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
third as far as price fixing
 
06:12:15.590 --> 06:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
or denying people access to drugs is
 
06:12:17.750 --> 06:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
concerned that's not what this is about
 
06:12:19.590 --> 06:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
this this committee is about providing
 
06:12:22.628 --> 06:12:22.638 align:start position:0%
transparency uh to make reports as to
 
06:12:25.990 --> 06:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
what are the most rapidly increasing
 
06:12:28.310 --> 06:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
drug costs both in individual and
 
06:12:28.320 --> 06:12:29.830 align:start position:0%
drug costs both in individual and
aggregate

06:12:29.830 --> 06:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
aggregate
 
06:12:32.390 --> 06:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
to people in public health plans
 
06:12:34.548 --> 06:12:34.558 align:start position:0%
including our legislative insurance plan
 
06:12:36.310 --> 06:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire
 
06:12:38.548 --> 06:12:38.558 align:start position:0%
that actually will benefit all citizens
 
06:12:40.310 --> 06:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
and not just those involved in the plans
 
06:12:40.320 --> 06:12:41.270 align:start position:0%
and not just those involved in the plans
because

06:12:41.270 --> 06:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:12:43.830 --> 06:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
the prices tend to increase in parallel
 
06:12:46.070 --> 06:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh no matter what your your insurance
 
06:12:48.548 --> 06:12:48.558 align:start position:0%
might be so i think this is something
 
06:12:50.548 --> 06:12:50.558 align:start position:0%
that our public very much wants us to be
 
06:12:52.948 --> 06:12:52.958 align:start position:0%
involved in they very much want to see
 
06:12:55.110 --> 06:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
less expensive prescription drugs and
 
06:12:57.350 --> 06:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
they very much want to see transparency
 
06:12:58.948 --> 06:12:58.958 align:start position:0%
and therefore i think the spill ought to
 
06:12:58.958 --> 06:13:01.110 align:start position:0%
and therefore i think the spill ought to
pass

06:13:01.110 --> 06:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
pass
 
06:13:03.990 --> 06:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
representative grotto and then like
 
06:13:05.430 --> 06:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
06:13:07.670 --> 06:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that this bill has the
 
06:13:09.750 --> 06:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
market control that people
 
06:13:12.070 --> 06:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
are claiming to say that it does and i
 
06:13:14.150 --> 06:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
do believe that the purpose of it is to
 
06:13:14.160 --> 06:13:15.590 align:start position:0%
do believe that the purpose of it is to
identify

06:13:15.590 --> 06:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
identify
 
06:13:19.110 --> 06:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
what is causing the increase in drugs
 
06:13:22.070 --> 06:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
and prescription drugs in new hampshire
 
06:13:24.070 --> 06:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really say
 
06:13:25.270 --> 06:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
that the board doesn't have the
 
06:13:27.110 --> 06:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
authority to do any kind of price
 
06:13:30.310 --> 06:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
negotiations but i do i am concerned
 
06:13:33.910 --> 06:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
about some of the language in the bill
 
06:13:35.590 --> 06:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
and i hate to do this but i'm just
 
06:13:37.590 --> 06:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
wondering if we can
 
06:13:39.750 --> 06:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
if we're if someone's willing to work on
 
06:13:42.030 --> 06:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment that had that involved the
 
06:13:44.070 --> 06:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
125 percent
 
06:13:45.590 --> 06:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
there were a couple of issues that we
 
06:13:48.070 --> 06:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
had as as a committee
 
06:13:50.470 --> 06:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
that were brought up that i felt would
 
06:13:53.030 --> 06:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
be readily fixed
 
06:13:54.948 --> 06:13:54.958 align:start position:0%
if we send an amendment in and i don't
 
06:13:57.510 --> 06:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
know how i don't know what what yes i
 
06:13:58.948 --> 06:13:58.958 align:start position:0%
as i recall
 
06:14:01.510 --> 06:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
the discussion senator sherman said just
 
06:14:02.708 --> 06:14:02.718 align:start position:0%
delete the
 
06:14:04.948 --> 06:14:04.958 align:start position:0%
yes they were quickly
 
06:14:07.350 --> 06:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
the minimum 500 fee
 
06:14:10.788 --> 06:14:10.798 align:start position:0%
and leave the 125 there which would
 
06:14:13.830 --> 06:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
solve at least that issue
 
06:14:15.190 --> 06:14:15.200 align:start position:0%
there were two there were two things let
 
06:14:17.670 --> 06:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
me see if i can quickly put my finger on
 
06:14:19.910 --> 06:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
them sorry
 
06:14:21.990 --> 06:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
and there was an rsa yesterday there was
 
06:14:24.150 --> 06:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
an rsa that was in it that was
 
06:14:27.830 --> 06:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:31.750 --> 06:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:34.788 --> 06:14:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:36.310 --> 06:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if that would change
 
06:14:40.470 --> 06:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:42.628 --> 06:14:42.638 align:start position:0%
and i do believe that this
 
06:14:44.470 --> 06:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
these amendments addressed many of the
 
06:14:46.628 --> 06:14:46.638 align:start position:0%
concerns that we had when we originally
 
06:14:48.150 --> 06:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
discussed this bill
 
06:14:50.548 --> 06:14:50.558 align:start position:0%
in committee
 
06:14:52.868 --> 06:14:52.878 align:start position:0%
on that lovely afternoon
 
06:14:55.830 --> 06:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
okay well the the other bill was not
 
06:14:57.830 --> 06:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
this is not identical to the bill that
 
06:14:59.910 --> 06:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
we discussed it merely deals with the
 
06:15:01.990 --> 06:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
same statutes
 
06:15:05.830 --> 06:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
any other comments or questions
 
06:15:05.840 --> 06:15:07.270 align:start position:0%
any other comments or questions
representative

06:15:07.270 --> 06:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:15:09.190 --> 06:15:09.200 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
06:15:11.750 --> 06:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
well it may not be you know the intent
 
06:15:13.670 --> 06:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
of the current board
 
06:15:13.680 --> 06:15:14.628 align:start position:0%
of the current board
to

06:15:14.628 --> 06:15:14.638 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:15:16.310 --> 06:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
prevent people from getting medicines
 
06:15:17.910 --> 06:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
that their doctor may think they should
 
06:15:17.920 --> 06:15:18.788 align:start position:0%
that their doctor may think they should
get

06:15:18.788 --> 06:15:18.798 align:start position:0%
get
 
06:15:22.310 --> 06:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
as i read 126 bb it explicitly gives the
 
06:15:24.150 --> 06:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
board that authority
 
06:15:25.750 --> 06:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
and we don't know who's going to be in
 
06:15:28.628 --> 06:15:28.638 align:start position:0%
it in the future
 
06:15:29.910 --> 06:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
i have a question for representative
 
06:15:32.948 --> 06:15:32.958 align:start position:0%
lekkis yes is that current statute
 
06:15:34.230 --> 06:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
what you just said is that i mean does
 
06:15:36.150 --> 06:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
that exist right now this this bill
 
06:15:37.510 --> 06:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that they can already do that
 
06:15:39.030 --> 06:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
right now this is the current statute
 
06:15:41.030 --> 06:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
yes but i have various concerns about
 
06:15:43.430 --> 06:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
the bill and i think studying
 
06:15:46.868 --> 06:15:46.878 align:start position:0%
this and what was in the the 1566
 
06:15:48.788 --> 06:15:48.798 align:start position:0%
um you know would be good to good to
 
06:15:54.310 --> 06:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:55.830 --> 06:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
any other comments representative
 
06:15:58.150 --> 06:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
pearson thank you madam chair i'm i'm
 
06:15:59.510 --> 06:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
just looking through what's i don't
 
06:16:01.190 --> 06:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
really care what what theoretically is
 
06:16:02.390 --> 06:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
going to happen i got to look at what
 
06:16:04.470 --> 06:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
the with the four pages of stuff that's
 
06:16:06.230 --> 06:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
in front of me right now is
 
06:16:06.240 --> 06:16:07.190 align:start position:0%
in front of me right now is
um

06:16:07.190 --> 06:16:07.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:09.270 --> 06:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
what what i see here is i see a re you
 
06:16:10.948 --> 06:16:10.958 align:start position:0%
know alternates to a board which is
 
06:16:12.310 --> 06:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
something we've done to all kinds of
 
06:16:15.190 --> 06:16:15.200 align:start position:0%
boards on oplc that's fine
 
06:16:15.200 --> 06:16:16.230 align:start position:0%
boards on oplc that's fine
um

06:16:16.230 --> 06:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:17.670 --> 06:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
a minor
 
06:16:21.190 --> 06:16:21.200 align:start position:0%
clarification on two definitions
 
06:16:22.788 --> 06:16:22.798 align:start position:0%
i certainly have a problem with the of
 
06:16:26.230 --> 06:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
not less than 500 assessed line i
 
06:16:27.990 --> 06:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
that's i can't believe they put that in
 
06:16:29.830 --> 06:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
there that that could definitely come
 
06:16:29.840 --> 06:16:30.628 align:start position:0%
there that that could definitely come
out

06:16:30.628 --> 06:16:30.638 align:start position:0%
out
 
06:16:32.708 --> 06:16:32.718 align:start position:0%
but this doesn't this board exists it
 
06:16:34.150 --> 06:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't eliminate the board it doesn't
 
06:16:35.430 --> 06:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
stop the board from continuing to
 
06:16:36.868 --> 06:16:36.878 align:start position:0%
function right now it really doesn't
 
06:16:38.470 --> 06:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
change some of the concerns that were
 
06:16:39.910 --> 06:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned because those exist right now
 
06:16:42.470 --> 06:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
the board is functioning they met today
 
06:16:42.480 --> 06:16:43.590 align:start position:0%
the board is functioning they met today
so

06:16:43.590 --> 06:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:16:46.310 --> 06:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to see what this senate bill
 
06:16:46.320 --> 06:16:47.590 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to see what this senate bill
540

06:16:47.590 --> 06:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
540
 
06:16:50.470 --> 06:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
really does and all i'm looking at is is
 
06:16:52.230 --> 06:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
two minor definition changes adding
 
06:16:54.230 --> 06:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
alternates to a board
 
06:16:54.240 --> 06:16:55.590 align:start position:0%
alternates to a board
and

06:16:55.590 --> 06:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:16:57.910 --> 06:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
it adds two typos it adds an
 
06:17:02.150 --> 06:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
unclassified employee employee at
 
06:17:03.990 --> 06:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
appointed by and serve at the pleasure
 
06:17:06.390 --> 06:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
of the board
 
06:17:06.400 --> 06:17:08.230 align:start position:0%
of the board
and

06:17:08.230 --> 06:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:17:08.240 --> 06:17:09.830 align:start position:0%
and
okay

06:17:09.830 --> 06:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:17:14.470 --> 06:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:14.480 --> 06:17:15.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:17:15.750 --> 06:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:17:24.548 --> 06:17:24.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:26.548 --> 06:17:26.558 align:start position:0%
this doesn't repeal the board
 
06:17:27.990 --> 06:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't stop what they're currently
 
06:17:31.910 --> 06:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
doing it doesn't change the 91a parts so
 
06:17:33.270 --> 06:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the discussion and
 
06:17:35.190 --> 06:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
reference to those and those are things
 
06:17:36.310 --> 06:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
that could certainly be addressed at
 
06:17:37.910 --> 06:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
some point but they're not in here
 
06:17:40.788 --> 06:17:40.798 align:start position:0%
that's not what we're reading so
 
06:17:42.390 --> 06:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
um i mean
 
06:17:44.868 --> 06:17:44.878 align:start position:0%
as it as this exists now with no
 
06:17:47.190 --> 06:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
amendment no this i i won't support this
 
06:17:49.190 --> 06:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
but i think that this can be
 
06:17:50.628 --> 06:17:50.638 align:start position:0%
if we can fix a couple of things that
 
06:17:53.430 --> 06:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
have been discussed i
 
06:18:00.948 --> 06:18:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:03.030 --> 06:18:03.040 align:start position:0%

but
 
06:19:58.628 --> 06:19:58.638 align:start position:0%
it'll just be a tough motion it has a

it'll just be a tough motion it has a
typo

06:20:01.990 --> 06:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:05.190 --> 06:20:05.200 align:start position:0%

06:20:21.510 --> 06:20:21.520 align:start position:0%

06:20:34.230 --> 06:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
pardon me i wrote it down wrong
 
06:20:35.670 --> 06:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
representative times and decisions
 
06:20:38.390 --> 06:20:38.400 align:start position:0%

06:20:43.990 --> 06:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
all right do we should speak to your
 
06:20:44.000 --> 06:20:45.430 align:start position:0%
all right do we should speak to your
motion

06:20:45.430 --> 06:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
motion
 
06:20:48.390 --> 06:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
yeah uh the bill uh prohibits telehealth
 
06:20:49.910 --> 06:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
services to residents of new hampshire
 
06:20:51.110 --> 06:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
from providers out of state that are
 
06:20:53.270 --> 06:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
unlicensed by new hampshire
 
06:20:54.390 --> 06:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
since this
 
06:20:56.868 --> 06:20:56.878 align:start position:0%
practice is already occurring
 
06:20:58.868 --> 06:20:58.878 align:start position:0%
if we were going to put this prohibition
 
06:20:59.830 --> 06:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
in then
 
06:21:00.708 --> 06:21:00.718 align:start position:0%
they would
 
06:21:01.590 --> 06:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:21:03.190 --> 06:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
take care away from patients that are
 
06:21:04.708 --> 06:21:04.718 align:start position:0%
currently receiving it
 
06:21:07.350 --> 06:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
and telehealth is going to be a growing
 
06:21:09.190 --> 06:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
industry so i think we should try to
 
06:21:11.510 --> 06:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
work to
 
06:21:13.190 --> 06:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
support it instead of make it more
 
06:21:13.200 --> 06:21:15.750 align:start position:0%
support it instead of make it more
difficult

06:21:15.750 --> 06:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:17.430 --> 06:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
06:21:19.590 --> 06:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and uh
 
06:21:22.070 --> 06:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
so executive director of oplc argued
 
06:21:24.230 --> 06:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
that uh in current law
 
06:21:26.390 --> 06:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
even though it's not explicit it's
 
06:21:26.400 --> 06:21:28.150 align:start position:0%
even though it's not explicit it's
probably

06:21:28.150 --> 06:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
probably
 
06:21:30.708 --> 06:21:30.718 align:start position:0%
not legal for a doctor out of state to
 
06:21:32.628 --> 06:21:32.638 align:start position:0%
practice doing telehealth to new
 
06:21:32.638 --> 06:21:33.750 align:start position:0%
practice doing telehealth to new
hampshire

06:21:33.750 --> 06:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:21:35.350 --> 06:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
without a license i mean that may or may
 
06:21:37.510 --> 06:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
not be true i asked for some case law on
 
06:21:40.070 --> 06:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
that and i didn't get anything
 
06:21:42.310 --> 06:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
um i think that you know we're gonna be
 
06:21:44.070 --> 06:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
moving more and more to telehealth and i
 
06:21:45.590 --> 06:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
think requiring
 
06:21:48.150 --> 06:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
every doctor who might provide that
 
06:21:49.990 --> 06:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
service to
 
06:21:53.430 --> 06:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
a patient another state to in effect
 
06:21:55.750 --> 06:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
have to get licensed in every other
 
06:21:57.430 --> 06:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
state potentially all other states where
 
06:21:59.270 --> 06:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
they might potentially have a
 
06:22:01.030 --> 06:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
patient i think is
 
06:22:02.868 --> 06:22:02.878 align:start position:0%
is nonsense i mean it doesn't make any
 
06:22:02.878 --> 06:22:03.830 align:start position:0%
is nonsense i mean it doesn't make any
sense

06:22:03.830 --> 06:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
sense
 
06:22:06.230 --> 06:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
they're licensed in their home state
 
06:22:08.628 --> 06:22:08.638 align:start position:0%
and this idea that we don't trust other
 
06:22:11.110 --> 06:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
states for this sort of thing is uh
 
06:22:12.868 --> 06:22:12.878 align:start position:0%
especially for things that are are
 
06:22:15.430 --> 06:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
regulated and controlled you know to the
 
06:22:17.350 --> 06:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
extent of being a physician i think is
 
06:22:18.868 --> 06:22:18.878 align:start position:0%
uh is
 
06:22:20.548 --> 06:22:20.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense
 
06:22:22.070 --> 06:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
i mean if anything i'd want to offer an
 
06:22:25.030 --> 06:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
amendment that would explicitly say that
 
06:22:27.510 --> 06:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
a doctor licensed in any state could
 
06:22:29.750 --> 06:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
practice through telehealth to anyone in
 
06:22:31.030 --> 06:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
the united states but i wasn't going to
 
06:22:32.390 --> 06:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
introduce something like this at this
 
06:22:34.230 --> 06:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
late point so
 
06:22:36.150 --> 06:22:36.160 align:start position:0%
that's why i support an ital on this and
 
06:22:37.830 --> 06:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
see what we can do in the future
 
06:22:40.230 --> 06:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
representative marsh uh thank you i
 
06:22:42.150 --> 06:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
cannot support this motion and instead
 
06:22:45.110 --> 06:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
feel that senate bill 382 ought to pass
 
06:22:46.628 --> 06:22:46.638 align:start position:0%
there are two situations here to
 
06:22:47.910 --> 06:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
consider first of all there are the
 
06:22:50.230 --> 06:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
states that have adopted the interstate
 
06:22:52.390 --> 06:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
compact on the licensure of physicians
 
06:22:54.230 --> 06:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
and there are those that have not the
 
06:22:56.070 --> 06:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
state of massachusetts says not and that
 
06:22:58.230 --> 06:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
is somewhat problematic but in those
 
06:22:59.910 --> 06:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
states that participate in the compact
 
06:23:02.390 --> 06:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
it is clearly defined that the site of
 
06:23:04.948 --> 06:23:04.958 align:start position:0%
service is the location of the patient
 
06:23:07.350 --> 06:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
and that will govern not only whether
 
06:23:08.628 --> 06:23:08.638 align:start position:0%
the the
 
06:23:11.110 --> 06:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
care is licensed to occur but it also
 
06:23:13.670 --> 06:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
governs things like malpractice law what
 
06:23:16.310 --> 06:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
courts things get settled in if
 
06:23:19.110 --> 06:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
something untoward should happen
 
06:23:21.750 --> 06:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
and what jurisdiction disciplinary
 
06:23:23.910 --> 06:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
actions might occur in
 
06:23:25.910 --> 06:23:25.920 align:start position:0%
in states that are not participants in
 
06:23:27.190 --> 06:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
the interstate compact which would
 
06:23:28.788 --> 06:23:28.798 align:start position:0%
include the state of massachusetts that
 
06:23:32.070 --> 06:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
would be undefined if we allow
 
06:23:32.080 --> 06:23:33.350 align:start position:0%
would be undefined if we allow
practice

06:23:33.350 --> 06:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
practice
 
06:23:35.350 --> 06:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
to not be defined as the patient
 
06:23:36.788 --> 06:23:36.798 align:start position:0%
physically being in new hampshire being
 
06:23:39.430 --> 06:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
practiced in new hampshire which is what
 
06:23:41.830 --> 06:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
as oplc testified is what's normally
 
06:23:43.350 --> 06:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
been considered to be the case for some
 
06:23:46.390 --> 06:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
time but it's not currently in statute
 
06:23:48.390 --> 06:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
due to the rapid expansion of telehealth
 
06:23:50.628 --> 06:23:50.638 align:start position:0%
we really need to define this or we are
 
06:23:53.030 --> 06:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
going to end up sooner or later to have
 
06:23:54.468 --> 06:23:54.478 align:start position:0%
cases where
 
06:23:56.868 --> 06:23:56.878 align:start position:0%
patients have no idea uh
 
06:23:58.708 --> 06:23:58.718 align:start position:0%
what courts have jurisdiction over
 
06:24:00.948 --> 06:24:00.958 align:start position:0%
malpractice which may occur uh double
 
06:24:03.270 --> 06:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
jeopardy may very well happen uh you may
 
06:24:05.590 --> 06:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
get conflicting judgments and it will be
 
06:24:07.670 --> 06:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
an absolute nightmare to sort out so i
 
06:24:09.350 --> 06:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
believe that this bill truly ought to
 
06:24:11.270 --> 06:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
pass thank you
 
06:24:13.990 --> 06:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you other other comments
 
06:24:15.590 --> 06:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative lackas
 
06:24:17.990 --> 06:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
yeah the only other thing is i'll say is
 
06:24:18.000 --> 06:24:18.868 align:start position:0%
yeah the only other thing is i'll say is
that

06:24:18.868 --> 06:24:18.878 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:24:20.390 --> 06:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
i've heard some concern
 
06:24:22.070 --> 06:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
06:24:24.788 --> 06:24:24.798 align:start position:0%
you know if there are complaints um
 
06:24:26.548 --> 06:24:26.558 align:start position:0%
you know what would new hampshire do and
 
06:24:26.558 --> 06:24:27.430 align:start position:0%
you know what would new hampshire do and
they

06:24:27.430 --> 06:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
they
 
06:24:28.868 --> 06:24:28.878 align:start position:0%
you know the the doctor is going to be
 
06:24:31.750 --> 06:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
licensed in the state of residence and
 
06:24:33.270 --> 06:24:33.280 align:start position:0%
you know as i'm sure happens in a lot of
 
06:24:35.510 --> 06:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
cases the complaint can be passed on to
 
06:24:37.350 --> 06:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
them and then they can deal with the
 
06:24:39.270 --> 06:24:39.280 align:start position:0%

06:24:43.990 --> 06:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:45.510 --> 06:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative grota and then
 
06:24:45.520 --> 06:24:46.708 align:start position:0%
okay representative grota and then
allegra

06:24:46.708 --> 06:24:46.718 align:start position:0%
allegra
 
06:24:51.590 --> 06:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:54.230 --> 06:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
as i enter as i have am looking at my
 
06:24:55.990 --> 06:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
notes what i have is that this bill
 
06:24:58.868 --> 06:24:58.878 align:start position:0%
clarifies what's existing in statute so
 
06:25:00.868 --> 06:25:00.878 align:start position:0%
basically what constitutes practice in
 
06:25:03.910 --> 06:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire at what laws pertaining
 
06:25:06.708 --> 06:25:06.718 align:start position:0%
pertain to licensing
 
06:25:09.990 --> 06:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
so i don't really understand
 
06:25:10.000 --> 06:25:10.868 align:start position:0%
so i don't really understand
what

06:25:10.868 --> 06:25:10.878 align:start position:0%
what
 
06:25:14.548 --> 06:25:14.558 align:start position:0%
the resistance is to this bill
 
06:25:16.708 --> 06:25:16.718 align:start position:0%
i haven't been there's anything that
 
06:25:18.150 --> 06:25:18.160 align:start position:0%
i've heard
 
06:25:19.750 --> 06:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
from anyone
 
06:25:22.310 --> 06:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
who says that this is going to
 
06:25:22.320 --> 06:25:23.270 align:start position:0%
who says that this is going to
limit

06:25:23.270 --> 06:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
limit
 
06:25:23.280 --> 06:25:24.548 align:start position:0%
limit
access

06:25:24.548 --> 06:25:24.558 align:start position:0%
access
 
06:25:24.558 --> 06:25:26.230 align:start position:0%
access
or

06:25:26.230 --> 06:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:25:26.240 --> 06:25:27.350 align:start position:0%
or
um

06:25:27.350 --> 06:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:25:27.360 --> 06:25:29.350 align:start position:0%
um
cause

06:25:29.350 --> 06:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
cause
 
06:25:31.110 --> 06:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
you know people that are
 
06:25:31.120 --> 06:25:32.070 align:start position:0%
you know people that are
not

06:25:32.070 --> 06:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:25:34.948 --> 06:25:34.958 align:start position:0%
who are traveling from getting care i
 
06:25:36.948 --> 06:25:36.958 align:start position:0%
don't understand what maybe perhaps you
 
06:25:38.708 --> 06:25:38.718 align:start position:0%
can explain that to me representative
 
06:25:38.718 --> 06:25:40.070 align:start position:0%
can explain that to me representative
lucas

06:25:40.070 --> 06:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
lucas
 
06:25:45.270 --> 06:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
sure um i know of people who have gotten
 
06:25:47.030 --> 06:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
treatment through telehealth directly
 
06:25:49.590 --> 06:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
from doctors in other states and
 
06:25:52.310 --> 06:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
as the executive director said that may
 
06:25:54.948 --> 06:25:54.958 align:start position:0%
or may not actually be illegal
 
06:25:56.948 --> 06:25:56.958 align:start position:0%
um you know in general i'd rather have
 
06:25:58.548 --> 06:25:58.558 align:start position:0%
law be settled
 
06:25:58.558 --> 06:25:59.590 align:start position:0%
law be settled
but

06:25:59.590 --> 06:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:26:02.390 --> 06:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
i know people have it has served some
 
06:26:04.548 --> 06:26:04.558 align:start position:0%
people quite well and i'm just not
 
06:26:07.270 --> 06:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
willing to make it explicitly illegal
 
06:26:07.280 --> 06:26:08.070 align:start position:0%
willing to make it explicitly illegal
and

06:26:08.070 --> 06:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:26:11.270 --> 06:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
yes i agree we need to clarify this but
 
06:26:12.548 --> 06:26:12.558 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to move in the direction
 
06:26:15.350 --> 06:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
of prohibiting it
 
06:26:17.110 --> 06:26:17.120 align:start position:0%
representative pearson
 
06:26:18.868 --> 06:26:18.878 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair the you know
 
06:26:22.948 --> 06:26:22.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:25.030 --> 06:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
politics loves hypocrisy so i'm gonna
 
06:26:26.628 --> 06:26:26.638 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna have to think
 
06:26:29.270 --> 06:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
i have a general question here if we are
 
06:26:32.070 --> 06:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
not we meaning
 
06:26:35.430 --> 06:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
several of us are not in favor
 
06:26:37.430 --> 06:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
of compacts
 
06:26:40.230 --> 06:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
as a general rule then our only other
 
06:26:42.948 --> 06:26:42.958 align:start position:0%
alternative is reciprocity
 
06:26:45.670 --> 06:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
okay otherwise we're an island
 
06:26:47.910 --> 06:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
so starting on line 11 i'm reading about
 
06:26:49.590 --> 06:26:49.600 align:start position:0%
reciprocity agreements all over the
 
06:26:52.788 --> 06:26:52.798 align:start position:0%
place the oplc shall issue a license
 
06:26:54.390 --> 06:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
for those that are in good standing of
 
06:26:55.990 --> 06:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
their other state
 
06:26:58.150 --> 06:26:58.160 align:start position:0%
that this is the alternative
 
06:26:58.160 --> 06:26:59.510 align:start position:0%
that this is the alternative
to

06:26:59.510 --> 06:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:27:03.990 --> 06:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
a compact which is reciprocity so
 
06:27:06.548 --> 06:27:06.558 align:start position:0%
i can't i can't be against both i've got
 
06:27:09.750 --> 06:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
to be in favor of one or the other and
 
06:27:12.070 --> 06:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
so it's either it's either
 
06:27:14.390 --> 06:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
or you can be in favor of both but but
 
06:27:16.230 --> 06:27:16.240 align:start position:0%
you can't be in favor of none because
 
06:27:18.390 --> 06:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise we become an island
 
06:27:20.150 --> 06:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire is entirely too small
 
06:27:22.468 --> 06:27:22.478 align:start position:0%
to be an island
 
06:27:25.350 --> 06:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:26.948 --> 06:27:26.958 align:start position:0%
this is not a compact this is a
 
06:27:26.958 --> 06:27:28.310 align:start position:0%
this is not a compact this is a
reciprocity

06:27:28.310 --> 06:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
reciprocity
 
06:27:28.320 --> 06:27:29.350 align:start position:0%
reciprocity
deal

06:27:29.350 --> 06:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
deal
 
06:27:29.360 --> 06:27:30.070 align:start position:0%
deal
as

06:27:30.070 --> 06:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
as
 
06:27:30.080 --> 06:27:31.910 align:start position:0%
as
representatives

06:27:31.910 --> 06:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
06:27:36.628 --> 06:27:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:39.510 --> 06:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
telehealth isn't a is a is moving
 
06:27:41.750 --> 06:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
the field of that the technology of that
 
06:27:43.430 --> 06:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
is moving far more rapid than this
 
06:27:45.990 --> 06:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
legislature moves so
 
06:27:47.590 --> 06:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
i think that we're already behind the
 
06:27:49.350 --> 06:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
eight ball in some ways
 
06:27:51.830 --> 06:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
and if if we're okay with the concept of
 
06:27:51.840 --> 06:27:52.868 align:start position:0%
and if if we're okay with the concept of
this

06:27:52.868 --> 06:27:52.878 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:27:54.390 --> 06:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
and we don't like compacts our only
 
06:27:56.390 --> 06:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
other option is reciprocity
 
06:27:57.830 --> 06:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
so help me out if i'm missing something
 
06:27:57.840 --> 06:27:58.708 align:start position:0%
so help me out if i'm missing something
here

06:27:58.708 --> 06:27:58.718 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:28:01.430 --> 06:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
sure no i understand that um
 
06:28:05.190 --> 06:28:05.200 align:start position:0%
oh thank thank you um sorry for jumping
 
06:28:07.270 --> 06:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
the gun um
 
06:28:09.750 --> 06:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
i don't i i don't completely have an
 
06:28:12.788 --> 06:28:12.798 align:start position:0%
opposition to part two part one i do
 
06:28:16.708 --> 06:28:16.718 align:start position:0%
and what i'm suggesting is that um
 
06:28:18.708 --> 06:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
for occupational licensing and certainly
 
06:28:20.708 --> 06:28:20.718 align:start position:0%
cert especially in certain areas that
 
06:28:23.110 --> 06:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
where there's uh
 
06:28:25.270 --> 06:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
there tends to be you know significant
 
06:28:27.270 --> 06:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
regulation all states
 
06:28:28.548 --> 06:28:28.558 align:start position:0%
that it should be treated like a
 
06:28:30.390 --> 06:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
driver's license and not require
 
06:28:32.468 --> 06:28:32.478 align:start position:0%
reciprocity that's my position
 
06:28:34.310 --> 06:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
and i know that's not in this bill and
 
06:28:35.510 --> 06:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
it was just
 
06:28:37.270 --> 06:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
that's something that i might consider
 
06:28:39.270 --> 06:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
uh introducing the future and i think it
 
06:28:41.270 --> 06:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
wasn't it wasn't
 
06:28:42.788 --> 06:28:42.798 align:start position:0%
appropriate to try and introduce an
 
06:28:44.230 --> 06:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
amendment to this thing to do that at
 
06:28:47.030 --> 06:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
this point because that would need a
 
06:28:48.948 --> 06:28:48.958 align:start position:0%
full public hearing and everything
 
06:28:50.628 --> 06:28:50.638 align:start position:0%
president pearson for follow-up thank
 
06:28:52.788 --> 06:28:52.798 align:start position:0%
you you know just looking at line 15
 
06:28:55.590 --> 06:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
shall issue licenses i mean it's
 
06:28:55.600 --> 06:28:57.110 align:start position:0%
shall issue licenses i mean it's
almost

06:28:57.110 --> 06:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
almost
 
06:28:59.910 --> 06:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
it's not quite direct recognition but
 
06:29:02.230 --> 06:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
man is it close i mean this isn't even a
 
06:29:02.240 --> 06:29:03.190 align:start position:0%
man is it close i mean this isn't even a
should

06:29:03.190 --> 06:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
should
 
06:29:05.030 --> 06:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's a shell
 
06:29:06.548 --> 06:29:06.558 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
06:29:09.030 --> 06:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh yes we recently got a handout from
 
06:29:10.548 --> 06:29:10.558 align:start position:0%
our researcher about licensing
 
06:29:12.948 --> 06:29:12.958 align:start position:0%
requirements from various states and i
 
06:29:14.468 --> 06:29:14.478 align:start position:0%
will point out to the committee that if
 
06:29:16.628 --> 06:29:16.638 align:start position:0%
you examine that uh document you will
 
06:29:19.190 --> 06:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
see that the qualifications for lights
 
06:29:20.948 --> 06:29:20.958 align:start position:0%
insure amongst the various states very
 
06:29:23.590 --> 06:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
significantly with new hampshire being
 
06:29:25.030 --> 06:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
amongst the highest in requiring
 
06:29:27.750 --> 06:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
educational opportunity education prior
 
06:29:31.350 --> 06:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
to issuing a license so in fact what you
 
06:29:33.590 --> 06:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
are doing is creating a back door around
 
06:29:36.708 --> 06:29:36.718 align:start position:0%
what the legislature has long adopted
 
06:29:38.868 --> 06:29:38.878 align:start position:0%
for requirements for medical licensure
 
06:29:40.948 --> 06:29:40.958 align:start position:0%
by allowing physicians in other states
 
06:29:42.310 --> 06:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
who would not meet licensure
 
06:29:43.910 --> 06:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
requirements in the state of new
 
06:29:46.948 --> 06:29:46.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire to practice on our citizens
 
06:29:51.590 --> 06:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:52.948 --> 06:29:52.958 align:start position:0%
i'm confused
 
06:29:57.030 --> 06:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
no i i'm against i wanted to add clarity
 
06:29:58.788 --> 06:29:58.798 align:start position:0%
to the statement that representative
 
06:30:00.868 --> 06:30:00.878 align:start position:0%
legis made about
 
06:30:02.468 --> 06:30:02.478 align:start position:0%
trying to create something like driver's
 
06:30:04.150 --> 06:30:04.160 align:start position:0%
licenses where it can go from one state
 
06:30:06.310 --> 06:30:06.320 align:start position:0%
to the other i am in favor of the spill
 
06:30:08.868 --> 06:30:08.878 align:start position:0%
which essentially defines the site of
 
06:30:11.670 --> 06:30:11.680 align:start position:0%
service as the location where it is
 
06:30:13.750 --> 06:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
rendered i'm not
 
06:30:15.750 --> 06:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
opposed the reciprocity part of the
 
06:30:17.750 --> 06:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
section i think that the language of the
 
06:30:20.468 --> 06:30:20.478 align:start position:0%
compact is far superior but i cannot
 
06:30:21.990 --> 06:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
force the state of massachusetts to
 
06:30:24.070 --> 06:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
adopt the compact
 
06:30:25.910 --> 06:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any other comments
 
06:30:29.670 --> 06:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:31.430 --> 06:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i just on the
 
06:30:34.070 --> 06:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
first part of the bill i'm just thinking
 
06:30:35.350 --> 06:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
you know if we're talking about
 
06:30:35.360 --> 06:30:37.030 align:start position:0%
you know if we're talking about
telemedicine

06:30:37.030 --> 06:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
telemedicine
 
06:30:39.670 --> 06:30:39.680 align:start position:0%
and the provider isn't licensed in new
 
06:30:39.680 --> 06:30:41.030 align:start position:0%
and the provider isn't licensed in new
hampshire

06:30:41.030 --> 06:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:30:43.510 --> 06:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
the the person who's receiving those
 
06:30:45.910 --> 06:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
services may not even know what state
 
06:30:48.948 --> 06:30:48.958 align:start position:0%
that person is in so how how do you even
 
06:30:52.150 --> 06:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
find him if there's a malpractice or any
 
06:30:55.750 --> 06:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:57.270 --> 06:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
versus bailey
 
06:30:59.190 --> 06:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
hi i don't know where it fits into this
 
06:31:02.230 --> 06:31:02.240 align:start position:0%
wild and wacky world of reciprocity and
 
06:31:04.468 --> 06:31:04.478 align:start position:0%
compacts and everything but isn't there
 
06:31:04.478 --> 06:31:05.110 align:start position:0%
compacts and everything but isn't there
a

06:31:05.110 --> 06:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:31:08.390 --> 06:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
currently or recently a thing where
 
06:31:10.948 --> 06:31:10.958 align:start position:0%
we're objecting to massachusetts taxing
 
06:31:13.030 --> 06:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
people that were telecommuting from new
 
06:31:13.040 --> 06:31:14.708 align:start position:0%
people that were telecommuting from new
hampshire

06:31:14.708 --> 06:31:14.718 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
06:31:16.070 --> 06:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
as being
 
06:31:18.548 --> 06:31:18.558 align:start position:0%
no they live there live and work here
 
06:31:21.030 --> 06:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
even though the employer is there
 
06:31:22.628 --> 06:31:22.638 align:start position:0%
and therefore we don't have to pay
 
06:31:26.548 --> 06:31:26.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:27.750 --> 06:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
and i don't know we even know which side
 
06:31:30.070 --> 06:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
that falls on but it seems
 
06:31:32.310 --> 06:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
it seems uh
 
06:31:34.628 --> 06:31:34.638 align:start position:0%
well this is this already been decided
 
06:31:36.468 --> 06:31:36.478 align:start position:0%
by the state that we're going to support
 
06:31:39.190 --> 06:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
that position actually this implies it
 
06:31:41.190 --> 06:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
because it says if you're telecommuting
 
06:31:43.750 --> 06:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
i mean if you're providing telehealth
 
06:31:46.708 --> 06:31:46.718 align:start position:0%
services to a patient in new hampshire
 
06:31:48.310 --> 06:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
that means you're working in new
 
06:31:50.948 --> 06:31:50.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire and therefore you are not you
 
06:31:52.788 --> 06:31:52.798 align:start position:0%
do not owe
 
06:31:55.030 --> 06:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
massachusetts taxes except that you're a
 
06:31:56.468 --> 06:31:56.478 align:start position:0%
resident of
 
06:31:58.708 --> 06:31:58.718 align:start position:0%
massachusetts but the employer evidently
 
06:32:11.430 --> 06:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:13.030 --> 06:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
as we go back and forth on this like
 
06:32:13.040 --> 06:32:13.830 align:start position:0%
as we go back and forth on this like
that

06:32:13.830 --> 06:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:32:15.990 --> 06:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
i think the difference there is that
 
06:32:17.430 --> 06:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of
 
06:32:19.270 --> 06:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents versus
 
06:32:21.430 --> 06:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
massachusetts residents because if you
 
06:32:24.390 --> 06:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
are a massachusetts resident you all owe
 
06:32:26.548 --> 06:32:26.558 align:start position:0%
massachusetts taxes on all work
 
06:32:29.510 --> 06:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
performed anywhere
 
06:32:31.670 --> 06:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
having been a massachusetts resident i
 
06:32:35.350 --> 06:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:37.350 --> 06:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
i also am a refugee
 
06:32:37.360 --> 06:32:38.310 align:start position:0%
i also am a refugee
yes

06:32:38.310 --> 06:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:32:38.320 --> 06:32:39.030 align:start position:0%
yes
so

06:32:39.030 --> 06:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:32:40.948 --> 06:32:40.958 align:start position:0%
yeah it's
 
06:32:43.670 --> 06:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
it may help a
 
06:32:46.788 --> 06:32:46.798 align:start position:0%
a new hampshire resident who works for a
 
06:32:48.868 --> 06:32:48.878 align:start position:0%
massachusetts employer and then does
 
06:32:51.590 --> 06:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
telehealth but i think that's a a very
 
06:32:54.230 --> 06:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
minor case in this situation
 
06:32:54.240 --> 06:32:55.350 align:start position:0%
minor case in this situation
so

06:32:55.350 --> 06:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:32:58.150 --> 06:32:58.160 align:start position:0%
if consistently consistency was to be my
 
06:33:00.628 --> 06:33:00.638 align:start position:0%
hobgoblin should i be voting yes or no
 
06:33:07.750 --> 06:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:09.830 --> 06:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
06:33:11.670 --> 06:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
i i wouldn't claim that you have a
 
06:33:13.430 --> 06:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
little mind
 
06:33:19.110 --> 06:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:21.190 --> 06:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
i would like to say that this is one of
 
06:33:23.750 --> 06:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
the the many things we deal with
 
06:33:26.788 --> 06:33:26.798 align:start position:0%
where it doesn't really matter
 
06:33:29.350 --> 06:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
as long as everything goes well
 
06:33:32.468 --> 06:33:32.478 align:start position:0%
it's only when something bad happens
 
06:33:35.110 --> 06:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
that you're going to care whether
 
06:33:38.390 --> 06:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
which states laws apply
 
06:33:38.400 --> 06:33:41.190 align:start position:0%
which states laws apply
because

06:33:41.190 --> 06:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:33:46.468 --> 06:33:46.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:50.468 --> 06:33:50.478 align:start position:0%
just you know who to complain to is
 
06:33:52.468 --> 06:33:52.478 align:start position:0%
if if everything goes well this doesn't
 
06:33:55.110 --> 06:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
matter if you see some if you call up
 
06:33:57.110 --> 06:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
somebody like your
 
06:33:58.948 --> 06:33:58.958 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the name of the the
 
06:34:01.750 --> 06:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
the website is that gives you viagra
 
06:34:03.350 --> 06:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
medications and you don't have any
 
06:34:03.360 --> 06:34:05.430 align:start position:0%
medications and you don't have any
complaints

06:34:05.430 --> 06:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
06:34:07.270 --> 06:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
they may be doing something criminal by
 
06:34:09.350 --> 06:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
this bill but who but you aren't going
 
06:34:10.628 --> 06:34:10.638 align:start position:0%
to complain
 
06:34:12.548 --> 06:34:12.558 align:start position:0%
it's only when something bad happens
 
06:34:14.548 --> 06:34:14.558 align:start position:0%
that there's going to be a real issue as
 
06:34:17.750 --> 06:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:21.350 --> 06:34:21.360 align:start position:0%

understanding of the spill when it

matters is when something bad happens
 
06:36:01.350 --> 06:36:01.360 align:start position:0%

okay
277

06:38:59.430 --> 06:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:00.788 --> 06:39:00.798 align:start position:0%
right one two
 
06:39:02.548 --> 06:39:02.558 align:start position:0%
three four
 
06:39:03.990 --> 06:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
one two
 
06:39:04.000 --> 06:39:07.030 align:start position:0%
one two
three

06:39:07.030 --> 06:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:07.040 --> 06:39:09.030 align:start position:0%
 
let's

06:39:09.030 --> 06:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
let's
 
06:39:12.070 --> 06:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
we have one two three four five six
 
06:39:13.910 --> 06:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
seven eight nine
 
06:39:20.628 --> 06:39:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:22.548 --> 06:39:22.558 align:start position:0%
so three through three we are working
 
06:39:24.788 --> 06:39:24.798 align:start position:0%
waiting for an amendment
 
06:39:28.548 --> 06:39:28.558 align:start position:0%
277 we have the amendment we think
 
06:39:28.558 --> 06:39:33.990 align:start position:0%
277 we have the amendment we think
yes

06:39:33.990 --> 06:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:37.030 --> 06:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
i believe so it was just
 
06:39:37.040 --> 06:39:37.990 align:start position:0%
i believe so it was just
okay

06:39:37.990 --> 06:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:39:42.548 --> 06:39:42.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:45.110 --> 06:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
274 which is the one we have not yet to
 
06:39:46.468 --> 06:39:46.478 align:start position:0%
end um
 
06:39:49.350 --> 06:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
in 397 where we were kind of
 
06:39:50.708 --> 06:39:50.718 align:start position:0%
back and forth
 
06:39:53.670 --> 06:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
so 274
 
06:39:55.830 --> 06:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
senate bill 274
 
06:40:00.548 --> 06:40:00.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:02.310 --> 06:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
madam chair move
 
06:40:05.030 --> 06:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate on 274 and i'll
 
06:40:10.070 --> 06:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:10.080 --> 06:40:11.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:40:11.110 --> 06:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:40:14.948 --> 06:40:14.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:14.958 --> 06:40:16.948 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:40:16.948 --> 06:40:16.958 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:40:19.910 --> 06:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
um 2784 dealt with
 
06:40:22.070 --> 06:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
project labor agreements
 
06:40:22.080 --> 06:40:23.990 align:start position:0%
project labor agreements
and

06:40:23.990 --> 06:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:40:25.430 --> 06:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
the committee heard
 
06:40:28.390 --> 06:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
testimony that
 
06:40:29.750 --> 06:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
currently in new hampshire there has
 
06:40:33.990 --> 06:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
never been a project labor agreement on
 
06:40:37.590 --> 06:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
any contract put forward by the state
 
06:40:38.830 --> 06:40:38.840 align:start position:0%
we also heard
 
06:40:42.548 --> 06:40:42.558 align:start position:0%
from individual contractors
 
06:40:44.468 --> 06:40:44.478 align:start position:0%
who said that if there was a project
 
06:40:46.788 --> 06:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
labor agreement that they would not bid
 
06:40:49.190 --> 06:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
on the contract
 
06:40:51.670 --> 06:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
i look at it as that's a business's
 
06:40:54.150 --> 06:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
choice whether or not they decide to bid
 
06:40:55.990 --> 06:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
and under the conditions of the contract
 
06:40:59.350 --> 06:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:01.350 --> 06:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
specifically asked if that was their
 
06:41:02.948 --> 06:41:02.958 align:start position:0%
choice and they said yes because they
 
06:41:04.468 --> 06:41:04.478 align:start position:0%
contained a pla
 
06:41:06.948 --> 06:41:06.958 align:start position:0%
that's a business decision
 
06:41:08.628 --> 06:41:08.638 align:start position:0%
that's up to them to decide which
 
06:41:10.230 --> 06:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
contracts they want to bid on no
 
06:41:11.910 --> 06:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
different than whether they're in
 
06:41:13.590 --> 06:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
manchester and want to bid on a contract
 
06:41:14.948 --> 06:41:14.958 align:start position:0%
up in pittsburgh new hampshire whether
 
06:41:16.708 --> 06:41:16.718 align:start position:0%
it's feasible for them
 
06:41:18.468 --> 06:41:18.478 align:start position:0%
um so
 
06:41:19.830 --> 06:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
for those
 
06:41:24.310 --> 06:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
reasons um i i will not this is just a
 
06:41:26.548 --> 06:41:26.558 align:start position:0%
solution you know problem insertion
 
06:41:28.468 --> 06:41:28.478 align:start position:0%
solution in search of a problem that's
 
06:41:30.628 --> 06:41:30.638 align:start position:0%
not there and i will not
 
06:41:32.150 --> 06:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
support that and
 
06:41:33.670 --> 06:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
move itl
 
06:41:35.670 --> 06:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
okay representative marshall do you wish
 
06:41:37.270 --> 06:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
to speak to your second yes thank you
 
06:41:38.948 --> 06:41:38.958 align:start position:0%
madam chair i think it became evident
 
06:41:41.270 --> 06:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
during the testimony that the definition
 
06:41:43.830 --> 06:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
of government assisted project in this
 
06:41:46.868 --> 06:41:46.878 align:start position:0%
bill would apply to uh projects that are
 
06:41:50.468 --> 06:41:50.478 align:start position:0%
subject to rsa 79e and receiving tax
 
06:41:52.230 --> 06:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
exemptions which would include the
 
06:41:53.910 --> 06:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
advanced regenerative manufacturing
 
06:41:56.230 --> 06:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
institute in manchester which uh the
 
06:41:58.150 --> 06:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
city of manchester is currently applying
 
06:42:01.750 --> 06:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
for a 100 million dollar grant
 
06:42:04.230 --> 06:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
we heard from the mayor and that that
 
06:42:06.390 --> 06:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
would be most disadvantageous to the
 
06:42:08.070 --> 06:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
city of manchester both because they
 
06:42:10.390 --> 06:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't receive the funds and because
 
06:42:12.628 --> 06:42:12.638 align:start position:0%
this would create a great many
 
06:42:14.150 --> 06:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
really good jobs for the city of
 
06:42:14.160 --> 06:42:15.910 align:start position:0%
really good jobs for the city of
manchester

06:42:15.910 --> 06:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
manchester
 
06:42:15.920 --> 06:42:17.350 align:start position:0%
manchester
we

06:42:17.350 --> 06:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
we
 
06:42:19.350 --> 06:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
also learned that were we to exclude
 
06:42:21.030 --> 06:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
that definition from the bill it would
 
06:42:23.110 --> 06:42:23.120 align:start position:0%
still be problematic because a number of
 
06:42:25.830 --> 06:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
other grants dealing with department of
 
06:42:28.070 --> 06:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
transportation projects also require
 
06:42:30.468 --> 06:42:30.478 align:start position:0%
project labor agreements uh including
 
06:42:32.230 --> 06:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
the rebuilding american infrastructure
 
06:42:33.990 --> 06:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
with sustainability and equity grant
 
06:42:34.000 --> 06:42:35.030 align:start position:0%
with sustainability and equity grant
program

06:42:35.030 --> 06:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
program
 
06:42:36.868 --> 06:42:36.878 align:start position:0%
which is a rather large grant program
 
06:42:38.708 --> 06:42:38.718 align:start position:0%
and a number of others which i would be
 
06:42:39.990 --> 06:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
happy to read to the committee if they
 
06:42:42.948 --> 06:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
are interested i i think that
 
06:42:44.868 --> 06:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
disadvantaging the state of new
 
06:42:46.628 --> 06:42:46.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire and competing for federal
 
06:42:48.230 --> 06:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
funds is distinctly not in the interest
 
06:42:49.750 --> 06:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
of our citizens and therefore this bill
 
06:42:52.230 --> 06:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
is exp inexpedient to legislate thank
 
06:42:52.240 --> 06:42:52.948 align:start position:0%
is exp inexpedient to legislate thank
you

06:42:52.948 --> 06:42:52.958 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:42:53.990 --> 06:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:42:56.150 --> 06:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
i'd like to mention that i have an
 
06:42:58.788 --> 06:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
amendment from senator bradley
 
06:43:00.628 --> 06:43:00.638 align:start position:0%
that deals with some of those later
 
06:43:02.948 --> 06:43:02.958 align:start position:0%
issues regarding the definition of who
 
06:43:05.350 --> 06:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
who would be covered by this bill
 
06:43:07.670 --> 06:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
that would amend the the first one that
 
06:43:09.270 --> 06:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
i mentioned but not the other grants
 
06:43:11.270 --> 06:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
which the department of
 
06:43:14.310 --> 06:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh transportation clearly is a division
 
06:43:15.830 --> 06:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
of the government and would still be
 
06:43:17.750 --> 06:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
subject to the limitations under this
 
06:43:17.760 --> 06:43:20.230 align:start position:0%
subject to the limitations under this
bill

06:43:20.230 --> 06:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:22.310 --> 06:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you but in any event we can't
 
06:43:24.788 --> 06:43:24.798 align:start position:0%
consider the amendment until
 
06:43:26.548 --> 06:43:26.558 align:start position:0%
under this motion
 
06:43:31.350 --> 06:43:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:33.670 --> 06:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
representative pearson
 
06:43:35.270 --> 06:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
since uh since i'm going to do a deep
 
06:43:37.430 --> 06:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
dive on the on the sword here
 
06:43:40.548 --> 06:43:40.558 align:start position:0%
um a couple things in my mind
 
06:43:40.558 --> 06:43:41.430 align:start position:0%
um a couple things in my mind
um

06:43:41.430 --> 06:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:43:42.868 --> 06:43:42.878 align:start position:0%
and in this
 
06:43:44.310 --> 06:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
i know this is on video so the new
 
06:43:46.310 --> 06:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire municipal association can can
 
06:43:47.750 --> 06:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
eat this up this is going to be a rare
 
06:43:49.990 --> 06:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity that i agree with them
 
06:43:50.000 --> 06:43:51.830 align:start position:0%
opportunity that i agree with them
um

06:43:51.830 --> 06:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:43:53.910 --> 06:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
in reference to local control i am a
 
06:43:55.750 --> 06:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
general local control guy
 
06:43:59.030 --> 06:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
i always have been and
 
06:44:00.390 --> 06:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
they have some serious concerns in
 
06:44:02.230 --> 06:44:02.240 align:start position:0%
reference to local control i have
 
06:44:05.830 --> 06:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
serious serious concerns that this will
 
06:44:08.070 --> 06:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
shut off federal money to the state of
 
06:44:09.990 --> 06:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire regardless of whether or
 
06:44:11.910 --> 06:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
not we like what the fred's tack on to
 
06:44:14.150 --> 06:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
things that is the current reality and i
 
06:44:15.350 --> 06:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
don't think it's in the interest of the
 
06:44:17.510 --> 06:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to cut off hundreds of million
 
06:44:20.150 --> 06:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
dollars of potential federal money for a
 
06:44:23.350 --> 06:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
plethora of items that occur
 
06:44:23.360 --> 06:44:24.708 align:start position:0%
plethora of items that occur
we

06:44:24.708 --> 06:44:24.718 align:start position:0%
we
 
06:44:26.868 --> 06:44:26.878 align:start position:0%
i will remind the committee that it is
 
06:44:29.030 --> 06:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
federal law that anyone can bid on a job
 
06:44:31.910 --> 06:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
any contractor can bid on a job and as i
 
06:44:33.670 --> 06:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
have a substantial safety background a
 
06:44:35.350 --> 06:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
lot of these project labor agreements
 
06:44:36.788 --> 06:44:36.798 align:start position:0%
focus around safety and safety
 
06:44:38.708 --> 06:44:38.718 align:start position:0%
conditions on jobs
 
06:44:38.718 --> 06:44:39.990 align:start position:0%
conditions on jobs
so

06:44:39.990 --> 06:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:44:41.670 --> 06:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
we've we've never really
 
06:44:43.430 --> 06:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
we haven't used these in new hampshire i
 
06:44:45.350 --> 06:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
don't think we have a problem to to
 
06:44:47.270 --> 06:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
address with this i think that the
 
06:44:49.590 --> 06:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
ramifications are substantial
 
06:44:51.430 --> 06:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh and i don't even think they're fully
 
06:44:54.230 --> 06:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:55.830 --> 06:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
fully out there i think i think we're
 
06:44:57.110 --> 06:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
gonna there's more problems with this
 
06:44:59.510 --> 06:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
than we even realize so
 
06:45:01.350 --> 06:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
for the for the sake of just doing this
 
06:45:02.708 --> 06:45:02.718 align:start position:0%
i don't agree with this i think it's
 
06:45:04.070 --> 06:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
just gonna cause too many problems and
 
06:45:05.110 --> 06:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly not gonna have the
 
06:45:06.788 --> 06:45:06.798 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of dairy
 
06:45:08.230 --> 06:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
have to foot the bill for things that
 
06:45:10.070 --> 06:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
could have been uh had federal money
 
06:45:12.070 --> 06:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
matching with them so i'm i'm a solid
 
06:45:12.080 --> 06:45:16.070 align:start position:0%
matching with them so i'm i'm a solid
now

06:45:16.070 --> 06:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:19.030 --> 06:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
um i'm little don't quite understand why
 
06:45:20.548 --> 06:45:20.558 align:start position:0%
if we've never used them then
 
06:45:22.468 --> 06:45:22.478 align:start position:0%
prohibiting them is going to cause this
 
06:45:24.628 --> 06:45:24.638 align:start position:0%
disaster to fall in our heads
 
06:45:26.868 --> 06:45:26.878 align:start position:0%
and and i agree i mean it is a business
 
06:45:28.868 --> 06:45:28.878 align:start position:0%
decision but uh
 
06:45:30.390 --> 06:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's appropriate for the
 
06:45:34.070 --> 06:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
state to uh to mandate them and and it
 
06:45:35.750 --> 06:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
would still be a business decision
 
06:45:38.390 --> 06:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
whether a contractor
 
06:45:41.670 --> 06:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to make use of apla
 
06:45:43.350 --> 06:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
even if it were not required by the
 
06:45:46.230 --> 06:45:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:47.590 --> 06:45:47.600 align:start position:0%

amendment and representative cuba which

06:48:47.110 --> 06:48:47.120 align:start position:0%
excuse me technical correction the
 
06:48:50.868 --> 06:48:50.878 align:start position:0%
previous motion on this bill was by
 
06:48:55.670 --> 06:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
represent bailey adopting amendment 1695
 
06:48:58.310 --> 06:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
and rather than voting on it we have a
 
06:49:00.548 --> 06:49:00.558 align:start position:0%
revision to that amendment
 
06:49:02.548 --> 06:49:02.558 align:start position:0%
by representative marsh we should
 
06:49:04.390 --> 06:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
probably have voted on the other
 
06:49:08.548 --> 06:49:08.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:11.510 --> 06:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
you need a motion or do you
 
06:49:14.390 --> 06:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
we dropped the conversation after the
 
06:49:16.708 --> 06:49:16.718 align:start position:0%
motion was made before it passed can he
 
06:49:19.430 --> 06:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
withdraw his motion yes he could
 
06:49:21.990 --> 06:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh i do have some comments before you
 
06:49:23.830 --> 06:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
withdraw as if that's okay in regards to
 
06:49:23.840 --> 06:49:24.628 align:start position:0%
withdraw as if that's okay in regards to
it

06:49:24.628 --> 06:49:24.638 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:49:26.310 --> 06:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
i have some comments in regard to the
 
06:49:27.990 --> 06:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
previous amendment
 
06:49:29.990 --> 06:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh just michael ivolkovic
 
06:49:32.070 --> 06:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
he contacted me in the interim he's
 
06:49:34.310 --> 06:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
watching it on uh the internet and he
 
06:49:36.868 --> 06:49:36.878 align:start position:0%
was just pointing out that um
 
06:49:36.878 --> 06:49:37.590 align:start position:0%
was just pointing out that um
the

06:49:37.590 --> 06:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:49:39.510 --> 06:49:39.520 align:start position:0%
the concern is you know potentially you
 
06:49:39.520 --> 06:49:40.230 align:start position:0%
the concern is you know potentially you
know

06:49:40.230 --> 06:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:49:41.750 --> 06:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
three to six years in the future with
 
06:49:43.430 --> 06:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
the continuing education requirements
 
06:49:45.430 --> 06:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
and since this bill is just to
 
06:49:47.910 --> 06:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
kind of temporarily you know extend the
 
06:49:50.310 --> 06:49:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh emergency licensure
 
06:49:52.310 --> 06:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
we could just uh take care of the
 
06:49:54.548 --> 06:49:54.558 align:start position:0%
problem uh and you know
 
06:49:56.548 --> 06:49:56.558 align:start position:0%
during another legislative session as
 
06:49:58.548 --> 06:49:58.558 align:start position:0%
far as making sure the contingent
 
06:50:00.390 --> 06:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
occasion would be covered okay well
 
06:50:02.150 --> 06:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
that's more
 
06:50:03.830 --> 06:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
that's more of a question on
 
06:50:07.430 --> 06:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative marsha's amendment
 
06:50:10.948 --> 06:50:10.958 align:start position:0%

yes representative bailey do you wish to
 
06:50:31.510 --> 06:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
withdraw your motion or do we should
 
06:50:35.830 --> 06:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:39.270 --> 06:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
it's not a good question it's not yes
 
06:50:42.788 --> 06:50:42.798 align:start position:0%
it's not a trick question
 
06:50:45.110 --> 06:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
you want to vote on a vote
 
06:50:45.120 --> 06:50:48.788 align:start position:0%
you want to vote on a vote
okay

06:50:48.788 --> 06:50:48.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:50.868 --> 06:50:50.878 align:start position:0%
all right so which amendment
 
06:50:52.948 --> 06:50:52.958 align:start position:0%
so this the amendment that we had the
 
06:50:56.150 --> 06:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
motion on is amendment 1695
 
06:50:58.628 --> 06:50:58.638 align:start position:0%
written by representatives
 
06:51:03.350 --> 06:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:03.360 --> 06:51:08.830 align:start position:0%
 
and

06:51:08.830 --> 06:51:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:11.990 --> 06:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
representatives yes i i know we're we're
 
06:51:14.070 --> 06:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
voting on this amendment but it would
 
06:51:16.868 --> 06:51:16.878 align:start position:0%
help me make the decision if i knew just
 
06:51:18.948 --> 06:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
what what lines in
 
06:51:21.830 --> 06:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative marsha's amendment differ
 
06:51:25.190 --> 06:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
it's lines 21 and 22.
 
06:51:27.510 --> 06:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
but no that's not correct manager or in
 
06:51:27.520 --> 06:51:30.070 align:start position:0%
but no that's not correct manager or in
the

06:51:30.070 --> 06:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:33.270 --> 06:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
the in yokobovich's amendment uh lines
 
06:51:36.548 --> 06:51:36.558 align:start position:0%
12 through 14 and lines 22 to 24 are the
 
06:51:39.110 --> 06:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
lines that i object to and i'll be glad
 
06:51:41.030 --> 06:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
to explain what i would propose that we
 
06:51:42.390 --> 06:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
replace them if you would think that is
 
06:51:44.390 --> 06:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
an order
 
06:51:46.628 --> 06:51:46.638 align:start position:0%
uh i have one concern
 
06:51:48.788 --> 06:51:48.798 align:start position:0%
your amendment specifically addresses
 
06:51:51.990 --> 06:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
rsa 329 16g
 
06:51:54.070 --> 06:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
which i believe is the licensing
 
06:51:55.910 --> 06:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
official physicians
 
06:51:57.670 --> 06:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh you're correct and that's because
 
06:51:59.030 --> 06:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's what we had in the information
 
06:52:00.948 --> 06:52:00.958 align:start position:0%
that was distributed it would take me
 
06:52:02.468 --> 06:52:02.478 align:start position:0%
longer to prepare an amendment that
 
06:52:05.350 --> 06:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
looked at other medical providers
 
06:52:05.360 --> 06:52:06.548 align:start position:0%
looked at other medical providers
well

06:52:06.548 --> 06:52:06.558 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:52:08.788 --> 06:52:08.798 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i would require every
 
06:52:10.628 --> 06:52:10.638 align:start position:0%
medical provider
 
06:52:13.110 --> 06:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
to provide evidence they've met the
 
06:52:15.030 --> 06:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
physician's continuing education
 
06:52:17.350 --> 06:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
requirement which is what your bill your
 
06:52:20.390 --> 06:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
amendment does
 
06:52:23.350 --> 06:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
but anyway uh the current amendment is
 
06:52:23.360 --> 06:52:25.030 align:start position:0%
but anyway uh the current amendment is
1695

06:52:25.030 --> 06:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
1695
 
06:52:28.310 --> 06:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
and as i said rep as he said represented
 
06:52:32.948 --> 06:52:32.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:37.910 --> 06:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:37.920 --> 06:52:40.150 align:start position:0%
 
yes

06:52:40.150 --> 06:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:52:42.708 --> 06:52:42.718 align:start position:0%
you'd like to just recess it again
 
06:52:48.468 --> 06:52:48.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:48.478 --> 06:53:04.230 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:53:04.230 --> 06:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:06.468 --> 06:53:06.478 align:start position:0%
yes i'm
 
06:53:06.478 --> 06:53:08.628 align:start position:0%
yes i'm
um

06:53:08.628 --> 06:53:08.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:53:10.468 --> 06:53:10.478 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly not going to accept your
 
06:53:13.110 --> 06:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
your your amendment because it simply
 
06:53:15.110 --> 06:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
says medical providers and not
 
06:53:17.270 --> 06:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
physicians i'm have no problem with
 
06:53:19.590 --> 06:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
saying physicians shall meet
 
06:53:21.830 --> 06:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
that requirement but it's
 
06:53:23.510 --> 06:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
a typical doctor mistake thinking that
 
06:53:26.868 --> 06:53:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:29.030 --> 06:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
you're so right how could i disagree
 
06:53:31.350 --> 06:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
with that statement
 
06:53:33.750 --> 06:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
and always illegibly
 
06:53:35.190 --> 06:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
of course
 
06:53:37.750 --> 06:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
so madam chair then so if i understand
 
06:53:39.510 --> 06:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
this right if if representative marsh
 
06:53:41.030 --> 06:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
was to amend
 
06:53:42.548 --> 06:53:42.558 align:start position:0%
just part c
 
06:53:45.590 --> 06:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
on lines 21 and 22 to read a physician
 
06:53:47.990 --> 06:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
shall be required would that satisfy the
 
06:53:50.230 --> 06:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
the circumstances we're trying to
 
06:53:53.590 --> 06:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
find two places 12 does say that not
 
06:53:55.590 --> 06:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
withstanding any law oh it's up there
 
06:53:57.670 --> 06:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
it's up there on 12 as well my thought
 
06:53:59.670 --> 06:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
is that i'll just ask coalesce to strike
 
06:54:03.110 --> 06:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
pursuant to rsa 329-16g
 
06:54:04.788 --> 06:54:04.798 align:start position:0%
because they can certainly define which
 
06:54:06.788 --> 06:54:06.798 align:start position:0%
is the statute and the rules and look
 
06:54:08.070 --> 06:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
them up for the various medical
 
06:54:11.030 --> 06:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
providers and the intent here is to
 
06:54:12.708 --> 06:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
require the applicant to present
 
06:54:15.510 --> 06:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
evidence uh that does not require that
 
06:54:18.150 --> 06:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
they actually have met the requirements
 
06:54:20.070 --> 06:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
that gives the board significant
 
06:54:21.750 --> 06:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
latitude which i believe is appropriate
 
06:54:23.830 --> 06:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
in emergency situations
 
06:54:23.840 --> 06:54:24.788 align:start position:0%
in emergency situations
okay

06:54:24.788 --> 06:54:24.798 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:54:26.948 --> 06:54:26.958 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
06:54:29.430 --> 06:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
we have the motion on the akubovich
 
06:54:31.190 --> 06:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
amendment which
 
06:54:33.350 --> 06:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
now that we understand the the marsh
 
06:54:34.868 --> 06:54:34.878 align:start position:0%
amendment which
 
06:54:36.788 --> 06:54:36.798 align:start position:0%
which a different version of which will
 
06:54:39.110 --> 06:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
be brought forward after we take this
 
06:54:42.390 --> 06:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
vote if we prefer it are there any other
 
06:54:44.788 --> 06:54:44.798 align:start position:0%
issues with the yakupovic amendment that
 
06:54:46.948 --> 06:54:46.958 align:start position:0%
we should discuss while we're
 
06:54:49.510 --> 06:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
looking at it representation
 
06:55:00.468 --> 06:55:00.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:02.310 --> 06:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
madam chair yes
 
06:55:04.910 --> 06:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
representing flat if we were to pass
 
06:55:08.548 --> 06:55:08.558 align:start position:0%
1695 the yokuba which amendment and then
 
06:55:10.548 --> 06:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
we were to take up uh representative
 
06:55:13.590 --> 06:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
marsha's revised amendment would we not
 
06:55:14.788 --> 06:55:14.798 align:start position:0%
have to
 
06:55:19.430 --> 06:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
take a vote to reverse the 1695 adoption
 
06:55:21.190 --> 06:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
second amendment
 
06:55:24.070 --> 06:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
would supersede the first one
 
06:55:25.750 --> 06:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
in my committee we had to do just that
 
06:55:28.788 --> 06:55:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:28.798 --> 06:55:31.110 align:start position:0%
 
right

06:55:31.110 --> 06:55:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:32.548 --> 06:55:32.558 align:start position:0%
okay representing goalie you have a
 
06:55:32.558 --> 06:55:35.830 align:start position:0%
okay representing goalie you have a
comment

06:55:35.830 --> 06:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:35.840 --> 06:55:37.430 align:start position:0%
 
i'm

06:55:37.430 --> 06:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
06:55:37.440 --> 06:55:39.510 align:start position:0%
i'm
still

06:55:39.510 --> 06:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
still
 
06:55:41.830 --> 06:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
a little confused with this continuing
 
06:55:43.830 --> 06:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
education um
 
06:55:46.628 --> 06:55:46.638 align:start position:0%
if you look at the conditions for
 
06:55:48.548 --> 06:55:48.558 align:start position:0%
licensure on the emergency medic
 
06:55:50.628 --> 06:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
licensing process
 
06:55:52.868 --> 06:55:52.878 align:start position:0%
any medical provider previously licensed
 
06:55:54.628 --> 06:55:54.638 align:start position:0%
in the last three years
 
06:55:58.230 --> 06:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:59.830 --> 06:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
how are they going to provide continuing
 
06:56:02.230 --> 06:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
education if representative lakers could
 
06:56:02.240 --> 06:56:09.990 align:start position:0%
education if representative lakers could
turn

06:56:09.990 --> 06:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:12.230 --> 06:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
then i i look at
 
06:56:14.868 --> 06:56:14.878 align:start position:0%
this is a condition to reactivate their
 
06:56:14.878 --> 06:56:18.390 align:start position:0%
this is a condition to reactivate their
license

06:56:18.390 --> 06:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:20.468 --> 06:56:20.478 align:start position:0%
so i i guess my question is why are we
 
06:56:22.150 --> 06:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
requiring continuing education for
 
06:56:23.350 --> 06:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
someone who's been out of the service
 
06:56:25.670 --> 06:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
for three years
 
06:56:27.990 --> 06:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
how are they going to do that
 
06:56:30.868 --> 06:56:30.878 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question and i would
 
06:56:33.110 --> 06:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
like my preferred approach would be to
 
06:56:35.030 --> 06:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
say that they shall complete
 
06:56:36.948 --> 06:56:36.958 align:start position:0%
their continuing education within a
 
06:56:38.628 --> 06:56:38.638 align:start position:0%
shorter period of time than the two
 
06:56:40.708 --> 06:56:40.718 align:start position:0%
years of the license that representative
 
06:56:41.990 --> 06:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
marsh has probably has a different
 
06:56:44.230 --> 06:56:44.240 align:start position:0%
answer yes as a retired physician i can
 
06:56:46.230 --> 06:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
attest to the fact that many retired
 
06:56:47.990 --> 06:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
physicians retain an interest in
 
06:56:50.788 --> 06:56:50.798 align:start position:0%
medicine and continue to
 
06:56:52.948 --> 06:56:52.958 align:start position:0%
attend lectures or classes and may very
 
06:56:55.670 --> 06:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
well be able to document that they have
 
06:56:55.680 --> 06:56:56.708 align:start position:0%
well be able to document that they have
met

06:56:56.708 --> 06:56:56.718 align:start position:0%
met
 
06:56:58.390 --> 06:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
the continuing education requirements
 
06:56:59.670 --> 06:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
although they may not have submitted the
 
06:57:02.230 --> 06:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
paperwork so that's why i phrased it in
 
06:57:05.510 --> 06:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:08.230 --> 06:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
thank you any other comments
 
06:57:08.240 --> 06:57:09.990 align:start position:0%
thank you any other comments
questions

06:57:09.990 --> 06:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:57:13.110 --> 06:57:13.120 align:start position:0%
massive confusion all around okay
 
06:57:16.310 --> 06:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
the vote on amendment 16
 
06:57:22.310 --> 06:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:24.310 --> 06:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
the motion is ought to pass amendment
 
06:57:24.320 --> 06:57:28.070 align:start position:0%
the motion is ought to pass amendment
1695-h

06:57:28.070 --> 06:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:30.708 --> 06:57:30.718 align:start position:0%
may represent blackous uh just briefly
 
06:57:32.868 --> 06:57:32.878 align:start position:0%
so as i understand what you uh told
 
06:57:34.788 --> 06:57:34.798 align:start position:0%
representative plett
 
06:57:37.830 --> 06:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
if we adopt this amendment and then uh
 
06:57:39.270 --> 06:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
we do get an amendment we find
 
06:57:39.280 --> 06:57:40.788 align:start position:0%
we do get an amendment we find
acceptable

06:57:40.788 --> 06:57:40.798 align:start position:0%
acceptable
 
06:57:42.468 --> 06:57:42.478 align:start position:0%
from representative marsh and we adopt
 
06:57:44.468 --> 06:57:44.478 align:start position:0%
that it supersedes it so it'd be fine i
 
06:57:46.390 --> 06:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
mean so i'm thinking about
 
06:57:48.628 --> 06:57:48.638 align:start position:0%
voting yes on this one and if the other
 
06:57:50.070 --> 06:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
one looks good i vote yes on that as
 
06:57:52.468 --> 06:57:52.478 align:start position:0%
well it would be okay is that correct
 
06:57:55.110 --> 06:57:55.120 align:start position:0%
yes that's my plan also thank you i
 
06:57:56.948 --> 06:57:56.958 align:start position:0%
think that this amendment deals with a
 
06:57:59.430 --> 06:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
lot of the issues we had with the the
 
06:57:59.440 --> 06:58:00.548 align:start position:0%
lot of the issues we had with the the
bill

06:58:00.548 --> 06:58:00.558 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:58:02.708 --> 06:58:02.718 align:start position:0%
and so i would recommend that we support
 
06:58:04.390 --> 06:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment and then
 
06:58:06.548 --> 06:58:06.558 align:start position:0%
specifically consider a second amendment
 
06:58:08.390 --> 06:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
that would address the continuing
 
06:58:12.230 --> 06:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
education issue representative goalie
 
06:58:14.468 --> 06:58:14.478 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i too will
 
06:58:16.468 --> 06:58:16.478 align:start position:0%
support the amendment um
 
06:58:18.390 --> 06:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
we've been working
 
06:58:20.948 --> 06:58:20.958 align:start position:0%
under this language for the last year
 
06:58:22.788 --> 06:58:22.798 align:start position:0%
and there has been no problems and
 
06:58:24.390 --> 06:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
that's all this is doing is extending
 
06:58:26.628 --> 06:58:26.638 align:start position:0%
this basically
 
06:58:27.910 --> 06:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
another year
 
06:58:29.990 --> 06:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
and i feel comfortable with that we're
 
06:58:31.110 --> 06:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
not doing
 
06:58:32.310 --> 06:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
going beyond
 
06:58:37.590 --> 06:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:40.390 --> 06:58:40.400 align:start position:0%

07:00:13.110 --> 07:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
i think we need to take a break while
 
07:00:15.110 --> 07:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
we're getting these amendments
 
07:00:16.868 --> 07:00:16.878 align:start position:0%

one

07:00:17.990 --> 07:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
one
 
07:00:21.190 --> 07:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
and we never give the vote on this
 
07:00:22.788 --> 07:00:22.798 align:start position:0%

dealing with that
 
07:24:21.110 --> 07:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
because it it's a serious issue
 
07:24:22.948 --> 07:24:22.958 align:start position:0%
so they get five minutes left they close
 
07:24:24.708 --> 07:24:24.718 align:start position:0%

no i they will stay as long as we're
 
07:24:36.070 --> 07:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
here and i think we're close enough to

the finish line that i'd rather not come
 
07:24:43.910 --> 07:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:47.990 --> 07:24:48.000 align:start position:0%

otpa with house senate bill i mean
 
07:29:34.548 --> 07:29:34.558 align:start position:0%
amendment 1759 madam chair i'd like to
 
07:29:43.430 --> 07:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:43.440 --> 07:29:46.708 align:start position:0%
 
um

07:29:46.708 --> 07:29:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:47.990 --> 07:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
if you've got
 
07:29:51.590 --> 07:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
you got one but i would like to
 
07:29:54.388 --> 07:29:54.398 align:start position:0%
elaborate well i suspect we will differ
 
07:29:57.510 --> 07:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
for different reasons uh you are i i
 
07:30:00.070 --> 07:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
suspect that to be the case also
 
07:30:01.670 --> 07:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
so i think would probably be better if
 
07:30:02.948 --> 07:30:02.958 align:start position:0%
you wrote it
 
07:30:05.670 --> 07:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you i've already written it
 
07:30:08.708 --> 07:30:08.718 align:start position:0%
and your emotion will be
 
07:30:10.230 --> 07:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
my emotion will be ought to pass for the
 
07:30:14.150 --> 07:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:15.510 --> 07:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
and what certainly wouldn't be my
 
07:30:16.868 --> 07:30:16.878 align:start position:0%
recommendation what would and what would
 
07:30:20.830 --> 07:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
that be what would that amendment number
 
07:30:25.990 --> 07:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:29.510 --> 07:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:31.750 --> 07:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
okie dokie all right
 
07:30:33.350 --> 07:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
one down
 
07:30:34.948 --> 07:30:34.958 align:start position:0%
and we don't have quite have the
 
07:30:42.548 --> 07:30:42.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:43.990 --> 07:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
07:30:44.000 --> 07:30:47.750 align:start position:0%
all right so
um

07:30:47.750 --> 07:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:53.830 --> 07:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
07:30:57.910 --> 07:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
have we voted on either amendment
 
07:30:57.920 --> 07:30:58.948 align:start position:0%
have we voted on either amendment
no

07:30:58.948 --> 07:30:58.958 align:start position:0%
no
 
07:31:01.510 --> 07:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
okay no we didn't make the same problem
 
07:31:01.520 --> 07:31:02.388 align:start position:0%
okay no we didn't make the same problem
as

07:31:02.388 --> 07:31:02.398 align:start position:0%
as
 
07:31:06.468 --> 07:31:06.478 align:start position:0%
we have emotion by you a second by lucas
 
07:31:06.478 --> 07:31:07.670 align:start position:0%

okay

07:31:07.670 --> 07:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
okay

okay
um

07:31:10.708 --> 07:31:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:13.990 --> 07:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
in that case i think we need to
 
07:31:16.628 --> 07:31:16.638 align:start position:0%
continue the debate and decide what to
 
07:31:16.638 --> 07:31:22.468 align:start position:0%
continue the debate and decide what to
do

07:31:22.468 --> 07:31:22.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:22.478 --> 07:31:23.430 align:start position:0%
 
yes

07:31:23.430 --> 07:31:23.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
07:31:26.468 --> 07:31:26.478 align:start position:0%
my the amendment that i that we that we
 
07:31:29.190 --> 07:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
are under consideration at the moment
 
07:31:31.670 --> 07:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
which is amendment number
 
07:31:31.680 --> 07:31:36.868 align:start position:0%
which is amendment number
1694

07:31:36.868 --> 07:31:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:39.430 --> 07:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
simply adds the explicit requirement
 
07:31:42.310 --> 07:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
that the case management providers be
 
07:31:42.320 --> 07:31:43.750 align:start position:0%
that the case management providers be
licensed

07:31:43.750 --> 07:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
07:31:46.388 --> 07:31:46.398 align:start position:0%
it deletes any definition of case
 
07:31:46.398 --> 07:31:48.948 align:start position:0%
it deletes any definition of case
management

07:31:48.948 --> 07:31:48.958 align:start position:0%
management
 
07:31:48.958 --> 07:31:50.388 align:start position:0%
management
and

07:31:50.388 --> 07:31:50.398 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:31:56.070 --> 07:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:58.230 --> 07:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
as introduced position which nobody
 
07:32:00.230 --> 07:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
cared about or nobody cared enough about
 
07:32:01.910 --> 07:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
to object
 
07:32:01.920 --> 07:32:03.190 align:start position:0%
to object
so

07:32:03.190 --> 07:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:32:06.388 --> 07:32:06.398 align:start position:0%
so i think that's a
 
07:32:20.468 --> 07:32:20.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:25.430 --> 07:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:27.830 --> 07:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative pearson thank you um but
 
07:32:29.190 --> 07:32:29.200 align:start position:0%
you know going to the wayback machine
 
07:32:31.430 --> 07:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
here a little bit just to
 
07:32:33.510 --> 07:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
as to what we talked about
 
07:32:33.520 --> 07:32:34.788 align:start position:0%
as to what we talked about
earlier

07:32:34.788 --> 07:32:34.798 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
07:32:34.798 --> 07:32:36.150 align:start position:0%
earlier
um

07:32:36.150 --> 07:32:36.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:32:39.750 --> 07:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
if i understand this correctly
 
07:32:41.830 --> 07:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
the marsh amendment contains language
 
07:32:44.070 --> 07:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
that the senate has already rejected
 
07:32:46.548 --> 07:32:46.558 align:start position:0%
that is correct so your amendment
 
07:32:48.468 --> 07:32:48.478 align:start position:0%
restores this bill
 
07:32:50.310 --> 07:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
to its as
 
07:32:50.320 --> 07:32:51.830 align:start position:0%
to its as
filed

07:32:51.830 --> 07:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
filed
 
07:32:51.840 --> 07:32:53.590 align:start position:0%
filed
state

07:32:53.590 --> 07:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
state
 
07:32:55.910 --> 07:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
which eliminates the objections from all
 
07:32:59.190 --> 07:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
the other case managers which which we
 
07:33:02.070 --> 07:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
we heard in in testimony so
 
07:33:04.548 --> 07:33:04.558 align:start position:0%
just so that uh we can all refresh
 
07:33:06.468 --> 07:33:06.478 align:start position:0%
ourselves as to exactly what's before us
 
07:33:08.230 --> 07:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
that's thank you for that
 
07:33:08.240 --> 07:33:11.750 align:start position:0%
that's thank you for that
okay

07:33:11.750 --> 07:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:33:13.830 --> 07:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
any other comments questions just
 
07:33:13.840 --> 07:33:16.310 align:start position:0%
any other comments questions just
concerns

07:33:16.310 --> 07:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
07:33:16.320 --> 07:33:17.190 align:start position:0%
concerns
okay

07:33:17.190 --> 07:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:33:17.200 --> 07:33:18.310 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

07:33:18.310 --> 07:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:33:21.110 --> 07:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
what yes representative grota so during
 
07:33:24.548 --> 07:33:24.558 align:start position:0%
this testimony there seemed to be
 
07:33:26.388 --> 07:33:26.398 align:start position:0%
a disagreement between the case
 
07:33:26.398 --> 07:33:27.430 align:start position:0%
a disagreement between the case
management

07:33:27.430 --> 07:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
management
 
07:33:29.670 --> 07:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
service providers
 
07:33:32.548 --> 07:33:32.558 align:start position:0%
and the home care providers
 
07:33:35.270 --> 07:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
and health and human services
 
07:33:38.310 --> 07:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
and i don't know how this amendment
 
07:33:40.628 --> 07:33:40.638 align:start position:0%
resolves that
 
07:33:43.510 --> 07:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
it eliminates
 
07:33:46.230 --> 07:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
the home care providers
 
07:33:48.468 --> 07:33:48.478 align:start position:0%
it does not add a definition of case
 
07:33:48.478 --> 07:33:49.830 align:start position:0%
it does not add a definition of case
managers

07:33:49.830 --> 07:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
managers
 
07:33:52.150 --> 07:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
it simply says that that they are to be
 
07:33:52.160 --> 07:33:53.350 align:start position:0%
it simply says that that they are to be
licensed

07:33:53.350 --> 07:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
07:33:55.430 --> 07:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
as they have been for the last 20 odd
 
07:33:55.440 --> 07:33:57.030 align:start position:0%
as they have been for the last 20 odd
years

07:33:57.030 --> 07:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
years
 
07:33:58.150 --> 07:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
it is
 
07:34:00.788 --> 07:34:00.798 align:start position:0%
probably not the best result
 
07:34:02.548 --> 07:34:02.558 align:start position:0%
because there are other issues that need
 
07:34:04.310 --> 07:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
to be considered
 
07:34:07.270 --> 07:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
but we don't have enough information and
 
07:34:09.750 --> 07:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough time to do it
 
07:34:09.760 --> 07:34:11.750 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough time to do it
um

07:34:11.750 --> 07:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:34:11.760 --> 07:34:13.510 align:start position:0%
um
so

07:34:13.510 --> 07:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:34:15.750 --> 07:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
i think just establishing that yes they
 
07:34:17.910 --> 07:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
need to be
 
07:34:22.628 --> 07:34:22.638 align:start position:0%
licensed because i don't know why
 
07:34:25.910 --> 07:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
hhs decided after 20 odd years of
 
07:34:28.070 --> 07:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
licensing them
 
07:34:30.548 --> 07:34:30.558 align:start position:0%
including that they don't have any
 
07:34:32.948 --> 07:34:32.958 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to license them so
 
07:34:35.590 --> 07:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about
 
07:34:38.150 --> 07:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
what hhs is thinking
 
07:34:40.230 --> 07:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
and also and what their intentions are
 
07:34:43.350 --> 07:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
and i do not want to speculate on them
 
07:34:43.360 --> 07:34:45.270 align:start position:0%
and i do not want to speculate on them
because

07:34:45.270 --> 07:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
07:34:47.590 --> 07:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
that's not what we do and so i think
 
07:34:50.150 --> 07:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
just saying yes we think these people
 
07:34:52.628 --> 07:34:52.638 align:start position:0%
these organizations need to be licensed
 
07:34:55.350 --> 07:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
do it the way you have been doing it
 
07:34:58.388 --> 07:34:58.398 align:start position:0%
seems like the right step to take now
 
07:35:00.468 --> 07:35:00.478 align:start position:0%
any additional steps that need to be
 
07:35:06.708 --> 07:35:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:08.548 --> 07:35:08.558 align:start position:0%
i said that
 
07:35:10.230 --> 07:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
next year
 
07:35:13.030 --> 07:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
because we only have
 
07:35:15.350 --> 07:35:15.360 align:start position:0%
i mean i was extremely disappointed at
 
07:35:17.590 --> 07:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
the hearing that no that hhs wasn't
 
07:35:20.548 --> 07:35:20.558 align:start position:0%
explaining their point of view
 
07:35:24.310 --> 07:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:26.468 --> 07:35:26.478 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
07:35:27.750 --> 07:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
i was
 
07:35:29.270 --> 07:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
unable to
 
07:35:32.070 --> 07:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
be here for that hearing and i guess i
 
07:35:35.510 --> 07:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
just have a question as to
 
07:35:37.110 --> 07:35:37.120 align:start position:0%
what happens if we don't make this
 
07:35:38.388 --> 07:35:38.398 align:start position:0%
change now
 
07:35:39.830 --> 07:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
are we able to interim study this
 
07:35:41.270 --> 07:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
because this appears to me this is where
 
07:35:43.190 --> 07:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
this should go this isn't a problem
 
07:35:45.990 --> 07:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's going to be solved today it's
 
07:35:47.990 --> 07:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
an ongoing issue that's been going on
 
07:35:48.000 --> 07:35:49.110 align:start position:0%
an ongoing issue that's been going on
and

07:35:49.110 --> 07:35:49.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:35:51.110 --> 07:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
it needs to be dove into a lot deeper
 
07:35:53.430 --> 07:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
than what we've had time to do um so i'm
 
07:35:53.440 --> 07:35:54.230 align:start position:0%
than what we've had time to do um so i'm
just

07:35:54.230 --> 07:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
just
 
07:35:56.070 --> 07:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
wondering for myself
 
07:35:57.510 --> 07:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
07:35:59.030 --> 07:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
this has to go through
 
07:36:01.190 --> 07:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
this year or can we intro really interim
 
07:36:02.788 --> 07:36:02.798 align:start position:0%
study this and do the work that should
 
07:36:06.948 --> 07:36:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:09.110 --> 07:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know i agree with you that the
 
07:36:13.670 --> 07:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
whole topic needs to be looked at but
 
07:36:15.430 --> 07:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure we're the right people to
 
07:36:18.628 --> 07:36:18.638 align:start position:0%
do it because it's mostly tangled up
 
07:36:18.638 --> 07:36:20.070 align:start position:0%
do it because it's mostly tangled up
with

07:36:20.070 --> 07:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
with
 
07:36:22.548 --> 07:36:22.558 align:start position:0%
not so much with licensing as with
 
07:36:22.558 --> 07:36:23.990 align:start position:0%
not so much with licensing as with
medicaid

07:36:23.990 --> 07:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
07:36:24.000 --> 07:36:25.270 align:start position:0%
medicaid
and

07:36:25.270 --> 07:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:36:27.350 --> 07:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
07:36:30.070 --> 07:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
we'd rather not get involved
 
07:36:33.830 --> 07:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
but if the original impetus for the bill
 
07:36:36.868 --> 07:36:36.878 align:start position:0%
was a statement by hhs that they don't
 
07:36:39.110 --> 07:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
have the authority to license these
 
07:36:39.120 --> 07:36:42.708 align:start position:0%
have the authority to license these
organizations

07:36:42.708 --> 07:36:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:44.788 --> 07:36:44.798 align:start position:0%
and they don't come to defend that here
 
07:36:46.708 --> 07:36:46.718 align:start position:0%
i think i'm
 
07:36:48.310 --> 07:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
i'd like to just say yes we want to
 
07:36:50.070 --> 07:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
license them
 
07:36:51.030 --> 07:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
and let
 
07:36:54.868 --> 07:36:54.878 align:start position:0%
the other issues be dealt with by hhs
 
07:36:56.310 --> 07:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
for one
 
07:36:59.750 --> 07:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
and uh financed by the other
 
07:36:59.760 --> 07:37:00.788 align:start position:0%
and uh financed by the other
it

07:37:00.788 --> 07:37:00.798 align:start position:0%
it
 
07:37:03.270 --> 07:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
that's my preference but if you i'm sure
 
07:37:05.510 --> 07:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
you could see it differently
 
07:37:07.670 --> 07:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
representative marsh yes i'll point out
 
07:37:09.830 --> 07:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
to everyone that the state of new
 
07:37:11.990 --> 07:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire is under a deadline from the
 
07:37:13.110 --> 07:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
federal government to come into
 
07:37:16.070 --> 07:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
compliance by this june and putting this
 
07:37:18.150 --> 07:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
off until next year is not going to
 
07:37:20.628 --> 07:37:20.638 align:start position:0%
solve the problem and the last thing we
 
07:37:21.990 --> 07:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
want is for the state of new hampshire
 
07:37:24.310 --> 07:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
to have to fund the dd program out of
 
07:37:26.230 --> 07:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
state funds and no longer be eligible
 
07:37:28.948 --> 07:37:28.958 align:start position:0%
for medicaid dollars to do so
 
07:37:31.510 --> 07:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
yes i don't disagree that we don't want
 
07:37:33.350 --> 07:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
to fund that program
 
07:37:33.360 --> 07:37:37.670 align:start position:0%
to fund that program
but

07:37:37.670 --> 07:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:41.190 --> 07:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
if it isn't defined statute now isn't it
 
07:37:43.990 --> 07:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
within their rules to in their authority
 
07:37:45.830 --> 07:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
to make rules on it
 
07:37:45.840 --> 07:37:46.708 align:start position:0%
to make rules on it
i

07:37:46.708 --> 07:37:46.718 align:start position:0%
i
 
07:37:49.190 --> 07:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
i mean we had the whole medicaid program
 
07:37:51.750 --> 07:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
under the commissioner of hhs's ruling
 
07:37:54.070 --> 07:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
broad rulemaking authority
 
07:37:56.070 --> 07:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
so i i
 
07:37:58.548 --> 07:37:58.558 align:start position:0%
understand that they have tremendously
 
07:38:01.350 --> 07:38:01.360 align:start position:0%
wide rule making authority on that they
 
07:38:03.030 --> 07:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
do have tremendously wide rule making
 
07:38:04.548 --> 07:38:04.558 align:start position:0%
authority but i do not think that they
 
07:38:06.468 --> 07:38:06.478 align:start position:0%
have the authority to suddenly license
 
07:38:08.388 --> 07:38:08.398 align:start position:0%
people without some statutory authority
 
07:38:10.388 --> 07:38:10.398 align:start position:0%
to do so and the federal government is
 
07:38:11.670 --> 07:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
requiring them to license these
 
07:38:14.310 --> 07:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
providers well representative marshall
 
07:38:15.830 --> 07:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
trouble with this is this doesn't
 
07:38:19.510 --> 07:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
address the dd providers
 
07:38:22.150 --> 07:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
they are not included in this bill
 
07:38:24.948 --> 07:38:24.958 align:start position:0%
and they've they were here testifying to
 
07:38:26.948 --> 07:38:26.958 align:start position:0%
say that well we're licensed under a
 
07:38:29.030 --> 07:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
different statute
 
07:38:29.040 --> 07:38:30.070 align:start position:0%
different statute
and

07:38:30.070 --> 07:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:38:31.910 --> 07:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know i i don't disagree with you
 
07:38:33.910 --> 07:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
that they ought to be but i don't
 
07:38:35.590 --> 07:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
07:38:35.600 --> 07:38:37.910 align:start position:0%
believe that
um

07:38:37.910 --> 07:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:39.910 --> 07:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
that this bill is what's going to solve
 
07:38:41.510 --> 07:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
that issue
 
07:38:42.868 --> 07:38:42.878 align:start position:0%
i think this version of the bill will
 
07:38:44.628 --> 07:38:44.638 align:start position:0%
not solve the issue which is why i have
 
07:38:47.190 --> 07:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
my amendment which i gave to you
 
07:38:49.110 --> 07:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that
 
07:38:51.030 --> 07:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
your amendment either
 
07:38:53.030 --> 07:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
solves the issue of the dd
 
07:38:53.040 --> 07:38:54.388 align:start position:0%
solves the issue of the dd
providers

07:38:54.388 --> 07:38:54.398 align:start position:0%
providers
 
07:38:57.110 --> 07:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
they're licensed under 171
 
07:39:00.628 --> 07:39:00.638 align:start position:0%
or not licensed under 171. as the case
 
07:39:02.548 --> 07:39:02.558 align:start position:0%
the case managers are not actually
 
07:39:03.990 --> 07:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
providers they are people that
 
07:39:06.230 --> 07:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
coordinate care and the federal
 
07:39:08.388 --> 07:39:08.398 align:start position:0%
government began making a distinction
 
07:39:10.948 --> 07:39:10.958 align:start position:0%
between the two uh with the deficit
 
07:39:13.670 --> 07:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
reduction act of 2005 which is i believe
 
07:39:15.910 --> 07:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
the original event that started the
 
07:39:19.430 --> 07:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:19.440 --> 07:39:20.310 align:start position:0%
 
well

07:39:20.310 --> 07:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
well
 
07:39:23.590 --> 07:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
so why on earth don't we have didn't we
 
07:39:26.628 --> 07:39:26.638 align:start position:0%
have a bill originally to address that i
 
07:39:28.548 --> 07:39:28.558 align:start position:0%
mean this is
 
07:39:31.190 --> 07:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
this is really i would rather amend the
 
07:39:33.110 --> 07:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
bill so there's very little to it and
 
07:39:35.510 --> 07:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
then be the up the senate and committee
 
07:39:37.510 --> 07:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
of conference
 
07:39:40.708 --> 07:39:40.718 align:start position:0%
i don't want to keep adding
 
07:39:43.830 --> 07:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
stuff on rumors and hearsay
 
07:39:46.388 --> 07:39:46.398 align:start position:0%
i i don't think that the testimony of
 
07:39:48.230 --> 07:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
the at hhs oversight was rumors and
 
07:39:50.548 --> 07:39:50.558 align:start position:0%
hearsay and i agree with you that health
 
07:39:52.070 --> 07:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
and human services could bring their
 
07:39:52.080 --> 07:39:52.948 align:start position:0%
and human services could bring their
bills

07:39:52.948 --> 07:39:52.958 align:start position:0%
bills
 
07:39:54.788 --> 07:39:54.798 align:start position:0%
in a more
 
07:39:57.270 --> 07:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
timely manner and in a more divided
 
07:39:58.548 --> 07:39:58.558 align:start position:0%
manner so they could be properly
 
07:40:01.030 --> 07:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
considered by the legislature
 
07:40:03.510 --> 07:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
well yeah that's beyond my control
 
07:40:06.070 --> 07:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
indeed and the fact that the senate has
 
07:40:08.310 --> 07:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
already considered this and rejected it
 
07:40:08.320 --> 07:40:09.110 align:start position:0%
already considered this and rejected it
says

07:40:09.110 --> 07:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
says
 
07:40:12.388 --> 07:40:12.398 align:start position:0%
it's a waste of time for us to to add it
 
07:40:12.398 --> 07:40:13.430 align:start position:0%
it's a waste of time for us to to add it
because

07:40:13.430 --> 07:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
07:40:14.948 --> 07:40:14.958 align:start position:0%
they've already said no we don't want to
 
07:40:16.708 --> 07:40:16.718 align:start position:0%
do that
 
07:40:19.190 --> 07:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
regardless of what hhs said
 
07:40:22.548 --> 07:40:22.558 align:start position:0%
if if we add that amendment my concern
 
07:40:24.708 --> 07:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
is that the senate will say you know we
 
07:40:28.310 --> 07:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
don't care let it let it die
 
07:40:30.150 --> 07:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
if it feels
 
07:40:32.708 --> 07:40:32.718 align:start position:0%
which i understand is going to happen
 
07:40:35.750 --> 07:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
without even a committee a conference
 
07:40:38.868 --> 07:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
07:40:41.110 --> 07:40:41.120 align:start position:0%
thank you manager and
 
07:40:45.350 --> 07:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:47.590 --> 07:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
if we amend this
 
07:40:49.110 --> 07:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
and the senate decides to go to
 
07:40:51.830 --> 07:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
committee conference
 
07:40:53.190 --> 07:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
deadline for the committee conference is
 
07:40:55.510 --> 07:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
the end of may
 
07:40:57.270 --> 07:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
and goes forward and whether it gets
 
07:40:59.430 --> 07:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
signed or not this doesn't take effect
 
07:41:01.350 --> 07:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
until 60 days after that we're looking
 
07:41:06.070 --> 07:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:08.310 --> 07:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
um so i i think that's another issue
 
07:41:09.670 --> 07:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
there that we we're talking about when
 
07:41:11.190 --> 07:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
you talk about deadlines and this needs
 
07:41:12.948 --> 07:41:12.958 align:start position:0%
to be implemented right away it's not
 
07:41:14.948 --> 07:41:14.958 align:start position:0%
going to be implemented right away it's
 
07:41:17.190 --> 07:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
a ways off
 
07:41:22.070 --> 07:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:41:25.190 --> 07:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
is in section that it's section two that
 
07:41:26.708 --> 07:41:26.718 align:start position:0%
has the deadline
 
07:41:28.468 --> 07:41:28.478 align:start position:0%
section one just says keep doing what
 
07:41:30.788 --> 07:41:30.798 align:start position:0%
you've been doing
 
07:41:34.708 --> 07:41:34.718 align:start position:0%
let me note with no particular deadline
 
07:41:37.110 --> 07:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
anyone else want to get in on this
 
07:41:38.708 --> 07:41:38.718 align:start position:0%
representative schuett
 
07:41:42.150 --> 07:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
thank you i have a genuine question um
 
07:41:43.430 --> 07:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
we know that
 
07:41:44.788 --> 07:41:44.798 align:start position:0%
you've said several times that the
 
07:41:47.030 --> 07:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
senate rejected
 
07:41:49.270 --> 07:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment i believe it was senator
 
07:41:51.110 --> 07:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
carson's originally
 
07:41:54.388 --> 07:41:54.398 align:start position:0%
and representative marsh has put a house
 
07:41:56.150 --> 07:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
note on it
 
07:41:56.160 --> 07:41:56.948 align:start position:0%
note on it
did

07:41:56.948 --> 07:41:56.958 align:start position:0%
did
 
07:42:00.388 --> 07:42:00.398 align:start position:0%
did the senate have the information
 
07:42:03.430 --> 07:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
about the differentiation from cms at
 
07:42:06.548 --> 07:42:06.558 align:start position:0%
the time that they rejected that
 
07:42:09.350 --> 07:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
i don't know for sure they did have the
 
07:42:11.590 --> 07:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
information from hhs
 
07:42:13.830 --> 07:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
which was the letter that said there's
 
07:42:16.868 --> 07:42:16.878 align:start position:0%
these different types of case managers
 
07:42:19.990 --> 07:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
including for example the dd is under
 
07:42:20.868 --> 07:42:20.878 align:start position:0%
you know
 
07:42:22.548 --> 07:42:22.558 align:start position:0%
they're covered under this section or
 
07:42:23.990 --> 07:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
that section
 
07:42:26.230 --> 07:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
or the programs are under such sections
 
07:42:29.030 --> 07:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
and they had that information
 
07:42:31.270 --> 07:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know if they had any other
 
07:42:35.110 --> 07:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:37.910 --> 07:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
it's a it's questionable in my mind as
 
07:42:37.920 --> 07:42:38.868 align:start position:0%
it's a it's questionable in my mind as
to

07:42:38.868 --> 07:42:38.878 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:42:41.230 --> 07:42:41.240 align:start position:0%
what criteria they made their decision
 
07:42:41.240 --> 07:42:42.788 align:start position:0%
what criteria they made their decision
[Laughter]

07:42:42.788 --> 07:42:42.798 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
07:42:45.110 --> 07:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
and we may not be able to change that
 
07:42:47.030 --> 07:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not sure i'm going to answer what
 
07:42:48.868 --> 07:42:48.878 align:start position:0%
they had in mind representative pearson
 
07:42:50.230 --> 07:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:42:53.030 --> 07:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair rep so the mcguire amendment
 
07:42:56.310 --> 07:42:56.320 align:start position:0%
here the 1694-h which really just
 
07:42:58.548 --> 07:42:58.558 align:start position:0%
brings it back to part one what does
 
07:43:00.388 --> 07:43:00.398 align:start position:0%
part one solve
 
07:43:03.990 --> 07:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
it solves the declaration of
 
07:43:06.708 --> 07:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
hhs that they do not have statutory
 
07:43:09.270 --> 07:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
authority to license case managers in
 
07:43:10.948 --> 07:43:10.958 align:start position:0%
the medicaid
 
07:43:13.750 --> 07:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
home care market
 
07:43:16.230 --> 07:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
and that this will then give them that
 
07:43:18.468 --> 07:43:18.478 align:start position:0%
authority correct
 
07:43:19.670 --> 07:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
that's it
 
07:43:21.750 --> 07:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't address the deeper issues
 
07:43:23.910 --> 07:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
which i'm sure will come back to haunt
 
07:43:30.788 --> 07:43:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:43:30.798 --> 07:43:31.590 align:start position:0%
 
no

07:43:31.590 --> 07:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
no
 
07:43:31.600 --> 07:43:33.430 align:start position:0%
no
no

07:43:33.430 --> 07:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
no
 
07:43:36.150 --> 07:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative grota
 
07:43:38.628 --> 07:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
so if this amendment
 
07:43:40.628 --> 07:43:40.638 align:start position:0%
addresses the immediate problem that we
 
07:43:43.110 --> 07:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
have with licensing
 
07:43:43.120 --> 07:43:45.190 align:start position:0%
have with licensing
and

07:43:45.190 --> 07:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:43:47.190 --> 07:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
given the time constraints i'm thinking
 
07:43:48.788 --> 07:43:48.798 align:start position:0%
that that's the best this committee
 
07:43:49.990 --> 07:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
could do
 
07:43:52.310 --> 07:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
this might be the best compromise even
 
07:43:52.320 --> 07:43:53.670 align:start position:0%
this might be the best compromise even
though

07:43:53.670 --> 07:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
though
 
07:43:56.388 --> 07:43:56.398 align:start position:0%
it's not the right compromise
 
07:43:56.398 --> 07:43:57.750 align:start position:0%
it's not the right compromise
correct

07:43:57.750 --> 07:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
correct
 
07:44:00.788 --> 07:44:00.798 align:start position:0%
i would agree with that assessment
 
07:44:03.750 --> 07:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a quick fix
 
07:44:05.910 --> 07:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
to a problem that is
 
07:44:09.350 --> 07:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
deeper than we have time to solve and i
 
07:44:10.628 --> 07:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
and with all due respect to
 
07:44:12.310 --> 07:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
representative goalie i'm not sure we're
 
07:44:17.910 --> 07:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:17.920 --> 07:44:18.948 align:start position:0%
 
so

07:44:18.948 --> 07:44:18.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:44:21.030 --> 07:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
so that's my take on it anyone else
 
07:44:22.948 --> 07:44:22.958 align:start position:0%
representative blackis yeah and as to
 
07:44:26.150 --> 07:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
the concerns of the 60 days i don't know
 
07:44:28.628 --> 07:44:28.638 align:start position:0%
but i would hope that if the bills
 
07:44:28.638 --> 07:44:29.670 align:start position:0%
but i would hope that if the bills
actually

07:44:29.670 --> 07:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
actually
 
07:44:32.388 --> 07:44:32.398 align:start position:0%
been passed and signed that
 
07:44:34.788 --> 07:44:34.798 align:start position:0%
the 60 days would not get you know
 
07:44:36.468 --> 07:44:36.478 align:start position:0%
medicare to decide they're going to cut
 
07:44:38.868 --> 07:44:38.878 align:start position:0%
us off because of that but what do i
 
07:44:44.468 --> 07:44:44.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:47.030 --> 07:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else
 
07:44:49.270 --> 07:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
all right see yes representative fellows
 
07:44:52.868 --> 07:44:52.878 align:start position:0%
so i i'm just trying to understand this
 
07:44:54.868 --> 07:44:54.878 align:start position:0%
so if we adopt
 
07:44:56.788 --> 07:44:56.798 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
07:44:59.670 --> 07:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
that defines case management service
 
07:45:02.708 --> 07:45:02.718 align:start position:0%
providers and it says that they're they
 
07:45:05.350 --> 07:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
don't deliver direct services they're
 
07:45:08.070 --> 07:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
just making the arrangements
 
07:45:10.468 --> 07:45:10.478 align:start position:0%
correct no that's the marsh amendment
 
07:45:13.110 --> 07:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
that does that my amendment deletes the
 
07:45:13.120 --> 07:45:16.788 align:start position:0%
that does that my amendment deletes the
definition

07:45:16.788 --> 07:45:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:20.388 --> 07:45:20.398 align:start position:0%
okay because it is
 
07:45:23.750 --> 07:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
probably correct for the
 
07:45:26.150 --> 07:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
home and community based care case
 
07:45:28.230 --> 07:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
management providers that deal with the
 
07:45:30.868 --> 07:45:30.878 align:start position:0%
medicaid program but it is not correct
 
07:45:32.868 --> 07:45:32.878 align:start position:0%
for people who in other for case
 
07:45:36.388 --> 07:45:36.398 align:start position:0%
managers in other situations so
 
07:45:39.110 --> 07:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
when because you're only deleting
 
07:45:39.120 --> 07:45:40.468 align:start position:0%
when because you're only deleting
two

07:45:40.468 --> 07:45:40.478 align:start position:0%
two
 
07:45:42.388 --> 07:45:42.398 align:start position:0%
you're not changing
 
07:45:44.230 --> 07:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
section one
 
07:45:46.388 --> 07:45:46.398 align:start position:0%
where there's a reference to case
 
07:45:49.590 --> 07:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
management service providers so there's
 
07:45:52.788 --> 07:45:52.798 align:start position:0%
not really a depth is there definition
 
07:45:52.798 --> 07:45:54.788 align:start position:0%
not really a depth is there definition
no

07:45:54.788 --> 07:45:54.798 align:start position:0%
no
 
07:45:57.910 --> 07:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
so they they can just deal with it or
 
07:45:59.190 --> 07:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
sure hope so
 
07:46:01.350 --> 07:46:01.360 align:start position:0%
okay but we're not here if they've been
 
07:46:03.510 --> 07:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
they have this lot this particular
 
07:46:05.750 --> 07:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
section has not been changed and the
 
07:46:08.868 --> 07:46:08.878 align:start position:0%
case management agencies have been
 
07:46:10.948 --> 07:46:10.958 align:start position:0%
providing these services and
 
07:46:12.948 --> 07:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
arrangements and so forth they're
 
07:46:15.830 --> 07:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
generally conflict-free as it turns out
 
07:46:17.750 --> 07:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
and so
 
07:46:20.948 --> 07:46:20.958 align:start position:0%
why hhs decided they can't quite license
 
07:46:22.628 --> 07:46:22.638 align:start position:0%
them anymore
 
07:46:26.150 --> 07:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:27.670 --> 07:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
they've been doing it for almost three
 
07:46:31.190 --> 07:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:32.548 --> 07:46:32.558 align:start position:0%

pass it with a different amendment
 
07:50:45.750 --> 07:50:45.760 align:start position:0%

07:50:45.760 --> 07:50:46.788 align:start position:0%
okay so he doesn't have to ideal and
then

07:50:46.788 --> 07:50:46.798 align:start position:0%

juggling a lot of things we're juggling

a lot of papers
 
07:52:02.548 --> 07:52:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:02.558 --> 07:52:12.708 align:start position:0%
 
yes

07:52:12.708 --> 07:52:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:14.468 --> 07:52:14.478 align:start position:0%
representative marsh can i ask him a
 
07:52:14.478 --> 07:52:15.990 align:start position:0%
representative marsh can i ask him a
question

07:52:15.990 --> 07:52:16.000 align:start position:0%

told me okay you know why that's okay
 
07:52:31.110 --> 07:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:32.548 --> 07:52:32.558 align:start position:0%
are you sure he said the amendment's
 
07:52:34.310 --> 07:52:34.320 align:start position:0%

one i don't know
 
07:52:40.150 --> 07:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
it could be a different one okay thank
 
07:52:42.310 --> 07:52:42.320 align:start position:0%
you representative marsh explain the
 
07:52:42.320 --> 07:52:47.430 align:start position:0%
you representative marsh explain the
concerns

07:52:47.430 --> 07:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:48.628 --> 07:52:48.638 align:start position:0%
adam chair
 
07:52:52.310 --> 07:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
yes did we do 225 was it
 
07:52:53.750 --> 07:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
we did that this morning that was the
 
07:52:55.910 --> 07:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
auctioneer one yes that was the one that
 
07:52:57.190 --> 07:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
you motioned
 
07:53:00.548 --> 07:53:00.558 align:start position:0%
okay i i will speak uh using amendment
 
07:53:03.590 --> 07:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
number 1763h which i asked ols to base
 
07:53:04.868 --> 07:53:04.878 align:start position:0%
this off of
 
07:53:04.878 --> 07:53:06.468 align:start position:0%
this off of
um

07:53:06.468 --> 07:53:06.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:53:08.468 --> 07:53:08.478 align:start position:0%
and the only difference between this
 
07:53:10.070 --> 07:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
amendment and the forthcoming one is on
 
07:53:12.468 --> 07:53:12.478 align:start position:0%
line 13 and line 22
 
07:53:15.030 --> 07:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
i asked them to strike pursuant to
 
07:53:18.948 --> 07:53:18.958 align:start position:0%
rsa 3 29 16 g as the chair requested and
 
07:53:20.628 --> 07:53:20.638 align:start position:0%
change that to saying pursuant to the
 
07:53:22.230 --> 07:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
applicable statute
 
07:53:22.240 --> 07:53:23.190 align:start position:0%
applicable statute
um

07:53:23.190 --> 07:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:53:24.708 --> 07:53:24.718 align:start position:0%
if they put in the numbers that would be
 
07:53:26.468 --> 07:53:26.478 align:start position:0%
even better but i doubt they'll do that
 
07:53:28.230 --> 07:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
in short order
 
07:53:30.468 --> 07:53:30.478 align:start position:0%
the the issue is a very straightforward
 
07:53:33.110 --> 07:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
one uh and that regards whether the
 
07:53:35.110 --> 07:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
people we are actually licensing are
 
07:53:37.430 --> 07:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
actually qualified and whether we are
 
07:53:40.628 --> 07:53:40.638 align:start position:0%
putting our citizens at risk and as a as
 
07:53:42.388 --> 07:53:42.398 align:start position:0%
i said if you look at the cycles of
 
07:53:44.150 --> 07:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
licensure for physicians which is the
 
07:53:45.990 --> 07:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
example i know best
 
07:53:47.270 --> 07:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
you could do all of your continuing
 
07:53:49.910 --> 07:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
medical education in the last cycle that
 
07:53:52.230 --> 07:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
you actually did education in the first
 
07:53:54.310 --> 07:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
year leaving the second year with no
 
07:53:56.948 --> 07:53:56.958 align:start position:0%
cmas you could then do the following
 
07:53:59.430 --> 07:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
cycle doing no cmes which is two more
 
07:54:01.510 --> 07:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
years your license lapses you then have
 
07:54:03.190 --> 07:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
three years to apply for one of these
 
07:54:06.070 --> 07:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
licenses that makes six years so far and
 
07:54:07.830 --> 07:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
it's two more years before you are
 
07:54:11.270 --> 07:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
required to present evidence of cme
 
07:54:13.270 --> 07:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
for your licensure so conceivably a
 
07:54:14.548 --> 07:54:14.558 align:start position:0%
physician would be continuing to
 
07:54:16.388 --> 07:54:16.398 align:start position:0%
practice without having done any
 
07:54:18.070 --> 07:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
education for eight years i believe
 
07:54:22.310 --> 07:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:24.548 --> 07:54:24.558 align:start position:0%
the the amendment simply requires the
 
07:54:26.388 --> 07:54:26.398 align:start position:0%
provider to present evidence that
 
07:54:28.388 --> 07:54:28.398 align:start position:0%
they're concurrent with continuing
 
07:54:30.548 --> 07:54:30.558 align:start position:0%
education it doesn't require the board
 
07:54:32.948 --> 07:54:32.958 align:start position:0%
to actually require them to be current
 
07:54:34.310 --> 07:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
it just requires them to present
 
07:54:36.230 --> 07:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
evidence so then the board can make an
 
07:54:37.750 --> 07:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
informed and reasonable decision on a
 
07:54:41.350 --> 07:54:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:43.510 --> 07:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
thank you i think that
 
07:54:46.948 --> 07:54:46.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:54:48.310 --> 07:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
is there any other discussion
 
07:54:51.110 --> 07:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
representative platt yes the use
 
07:54:53.350 --> 07:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
referred uh representative marsh to a
 
07:54:56.628 --> 07:54:56.638 align:start position:0%
specific rsa dealing with physicians in
 
07:54:58.628 --> 07:54:58.638 align:start position:0%
two places you struck them in both did
 
07:54:58.638 --> 07:54:59.430 align:start position:0%
two places you struck them in both did
you

07:54:59.430 --> 07:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:54:59.440 --> 07:55:00.310 align:start position:0%
you
yes

07:55:00.310 --> 07:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
07:55:02.070 --> 07:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
yes i asked them to replace that with
 
07:55:04.150 --> 07:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
the to the applicable statutes because i
 
07:55:05.670 --> 07:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
know it's a different statute for nurse
 
07:55:08.150 --> 07:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
practitioners for physician assistants
 
07:55:10.070 --> 07:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
for whatever and
 
07:55:11.750 --> 07:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not capable of looking up all the
 
07:55:13.830 --> 07:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
statutes while also debating bills here
 
07:55:15.750 --> 07:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
in the committee
 
07:55:17.430 --> 07:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
yes why not
 
07:55:18.948 --> 07:55:18.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:55:20.310 --> 07:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
any other comments representative
 
07:55:20.320 --> 07:55:21.910 align:start position:0%
any other comments representative
pearson

07:55:21.910 --> 07:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
pearson
 
07:55:24.150 --> 07:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
no um you know just just thinking back
 
07:55:26.548 --> 07:55:26.558 align:start position:0%
to some you know i'm my medical license
 
07:55:29.510 --> 07:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
is in a different area so it's uh for
 
07:55:31.030 --> 07:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
the department of safety
 
07:55:33.670 --> 07:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
um but i agree with representative marsh
 
07:55:34.868 --> 07:55:34.878 align:start position:0%
in the way that
 
07:55:37.510 --> 07:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
the continuing education hours work
 
07:55:39.750 --> 07:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
in that in that world is the same and
 
07:55:42.150 --> 07:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
you can
 
07:55:44.548 --> 07:55:44.558 align:start position:0%
what what he's describing as a timeline
 
07:55:46.548 --> 07:55:46.558 align:start position:0%
is is extraordinarily plausible it's
 
07:55:48.948 --> 07:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
it's it's actually quite easy so
 
07:55:51.430 --> 07:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
i agree that having um
 
07:55:54.310 --> 07:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
a physician out of any
 
07:55:56.388 --> 07:55:56.398 align:start position:0%
or any medical provider really that's
 
07:55:58.070 --> 07:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
out of continuing education for that
 
07:55:59.750 --> 07:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
length of time i mean that's
 
07:56:01.830 --> 07:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
i spent seven years in college you know
 
07:56:03.910 --> 07:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
then we're i got two degrees we're
 
07:56:05.990 --> 07:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
talking about eight years of of ces
 
07:56:07.830 --> 07:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
which is just really you know the
 
07:56:09.750 --> 07:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
threshold is is relatively minor when it
 
07:56:11.430 --> 07:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
comes to continuing education but that
 
07:56:13.670 --> 07:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
puts you out of the field for for so
 
07:56:15.270 --> 07:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
long that it
 
07:56:16.628 --> 07:56:16.638 align:start position:0%
i i agree with him that it's an
 
07:56:19.110 --> 07:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
unacceptable duration of time
 
07:56:21.750 --> 07:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair the amendment number is 1773
 
07:56:21.760 --> 07:56:23.670 align:start position:0%
madam chair the amendment number is 1773
h

07:56:23.670 --> 07:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
h
 
07:56:23.680 --> 07:56:25.830 align:start position:0%
h
okay

07:56:25.830 --> 07:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:56:25.840 --> 07:56:28.230 align:start position:0%
okay
73

07:56:28.230 --> 07:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
73
 
07:56:29.830 --> 07:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
i'm waiting to see who's going to come
 
07:56:34.948 --> 07:56:34.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:56:36.388 --> 07:56:36.398 align:start position:0%
i know one or two reps that would love
 
07:56:38.628 --> 07:56:38.638 align:start position:0%
to have that number i'll bet
 
07:56:38.638 --> 07:56:41.590 align:start position:0%
to have that number i'll bet
okay

07:56:41.590 --> 07:56:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:56:41.600 --> 07:56:42.708 align:start position:0%
 
so

07:56:42.708 --> 07:56:42.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:56:44.548 --> 07:56:44.558 align:start position:0%
at this point we've already adopted the
 
07:56:46.230 --> 07:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
cuba vich amendment year moving
 
07:56:49.750 --> 07:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
amendment 1773
 
07:56:52.070 --> 07:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
which is being yes i am thank you
 
07:56:56.150 --> 07:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:16.468 --> 07:57:16.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:46.788 --> 07:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:57:49.750 --> 07:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
so further discussion
 
07:58:04.468 --> 07:58:04.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:06.310 --> 07:58:06.320 align:start position:0%
that's right and we're proud supporters
 
07:58:10.388 --> 07:58:10.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:11.830 --> 07:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
i think i'd
 
07:58:14.628 --> 07:58:14.638 align:start position:0%
rather make paper than uh
 
07:58:17.110 --> 07:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
expensive power yes and represent like
 
07:58:17.120 --> 07:58:17.830 align:start position:0%
expensive power yes and represent like
us

07:58:17.830 --> 07:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
us
 
07:58:21.430 --> 07:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh yes i mean this was for um
 
07:58:23.830 --> 07:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
is granted under you know emergency and
 
07:58:26.310 --> 07:58:26.320 align:start position:0%
it's uh going to end
 
07:58:27.990 --> 07:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
i think um
 
07:58:29.750 --> 07:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
what was the the ending date on this i
 
07:58:32.868 --> 07:58:32.878 align:start position:0%
apologize but it's it's not that long
 
07:58:34.230 --> 07:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
and so i don't
 
07:58:35.910 --> 07:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
i don't see a need to do this i mean if
 
07:58:37.430 --> 07:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
it was the original
 
07:58:39.670 --> 07:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
going out to 2024
 
07:58:42.150 --> 07:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
i might see a stronger argument but uh
 
07:58:45.350 --> 07:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:58:48.628 --> 07:58:48.638 align:start position:0%
well this also would a lie allow
 
07:58:51.590 --> 07:58:51.600 align:start position:0%
in a future emergency
 
07:58:54.468 --> 07:58:54.478 align:start position:0%
emergency license to be issued
 
07:58:56.868 --> 07:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
bless you and um
 
07:58:58.388 --> 07:58:58.398 align:start position:0%
that is you know
 
07:59:00.468 --> 07:59:00.478 align:start position:0%
under the circumstances we might want to
 
07:59:01.430 --> 07:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
dig up

blackis
 
07:59:25.110 --> 07:59:25.120 align:start position:0%
actually i would see that argument on
 
07:59:27.110 --> 07:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
the other side because if we really have
 
07:59:29.670 --> 07:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
an emergency and we need medical
 
07:59:31.910 --> 07:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
people and things are disrupted i don't
 
07:59:33.990 --> 07:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
think we'd want to have to
 
07:59:35.990 --> 07:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
prevent them from helping out just
 
07:59:38.230 --> 07:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
because they're waiting on some
 
07:59:39.590 --> 07:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
training which may or may not be
 
07:59:42.788 --> 07:59:42.798 align:start position:0%

07:59:42.798 --> 07:59:46.070 align:start position:0%
