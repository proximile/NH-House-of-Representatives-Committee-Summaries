and welcome
 
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh we're
 
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
a couple of minutes behind but this is a
 
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
fairly informal
 
00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
uh gathering it would seem
 
00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
we're here to discuss uh hb 1061
 
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh relative to
 
00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:57.759 align:start position:0%
midwifery council
 
00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:00.070 align:start position:0%
midwifery council
and

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 align:start position:0%
i'm going to take a moment well before i
 
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
even start i want to please remind you
 
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
that even though it's an informal thing
 
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
it is streaming and so when you step up
 
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
to speak please do make sure that your
 
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
let me go over a little bit of the
 
00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
history of this because we've seen a lot
 
00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
of bills
 
00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 align:start position:0%
and uh some of us could use the reminder
 
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
although some who this is most close to
 
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
may not
 
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.070 align:start position:0%
may not
um

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
let's see this uh this bill first had a
 
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.390 align:start position:0%
public hearing
on

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
january 20th of this year
 
00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
it went into a subcommittee meeting on
 
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
march 1st
 
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
followed by an executive session on
 
00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
march 7th during which an amendment was
 
00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
proposed and passed 18 to 1
 
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
and amongst the other things that that
 
00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
amendment did it
 
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.390 align:start position:0%
amendment did it
it

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
reinstated midwives as a majority on the
 
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 align:start position:0%
it went uh for a vote ought to pass as
 
00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:14.950 align:start position:0%
it went uh for a vote ought to pass as
amended

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
amended
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
and that vote failed by a vote of 8 to
 
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.790 align:start position:0%
and that vote failed by a vote of 8 to
11

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
11
 
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
and then the motion was made to send it
 
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
to interim study
 
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
that motion passed 19 to zero
 
00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
and that's what brings us here
 
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
today it was placed on the consent
 
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
calendar passed in the house
 
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to um
 
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
just uh
 
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.270 align:start position:0%
just uh
and

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
this may be a little bit uh different
 
00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
than some of the interim study
 
00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
subcommittees you've attended because
 
00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:44.319 align:start position:0%
this is the first one that i've chaired
 
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
but i'm going to try to cover all the
 
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
territory as briefly as possible
 
00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
first i want to just give a brief
 
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
summary of the testimony that was
 
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.469 align:start position:0%
summary of the testimony that was
provided

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
provided
 
00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
in the public hearing
 
00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
and then i'd like to give an opportunity
 
00:06:59.909 --> 00:06:59.919 align:start position:0%
for anybody
 
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
who has an interest in this bill whether
 
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
on the committee or in the public to
 
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.710 align:start position:0%
on the committee or in the public to
speak

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
to summarize briefly the um
 
00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
the public
 
00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:15.670 align:start position:0%
the public
testimony

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
for the bill was
 
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
all in opposition
 
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
that's just a fact we had heidi
 
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
reinhardt who was an obgyn from keene
 
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
sherry stevens
 
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.110 align:start position:0%
sherry stevens
chair

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:37.029 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
proponents of the bill were the
 
00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:39.919 align:start position:0%
committee members the co-sponsors and
 
00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
they spoke and
 
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
made their support for the bill clear
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
they'll probably hear some more of that
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
today especially since we're speaking
 
00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:48.879 align:start position:0%
about the amended
 
00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
um version
 
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.360 align:start position:0%
my recollection is that there were two
 
00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
major concerns about the bill
 
00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
converted the board from a
 
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
decision-making body
 
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
to an advisory body
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
and the second was that
 
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
from a majority of midwives on the board
 
00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
it went to a minority of midwives
 
00:08:18.469 --> 00:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
one ob gyn one pediatrician
 
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
i don't recall if it was one or two
 
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
midwives and perhaps a public member
 
00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
anybody's uh please feel free to correct
 
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
me on that
 
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
so would you
 
00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:35.919 align:start position:0%
repeat the um
 
00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
it increased the number of ob gyns which
 
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
was very uh threatening to the midwives
 
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
and uh not at all the intent of the
 
00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
original sponsors but that was the way
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
the wording came out so that that was
 
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
something you're going to have more ob
 
00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
gyns and midwives on the board that was
 
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
completely unacceptable to the
 
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
profession and frankly to myself as one
 
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
of the co-sponsors as well thank you mr
 
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you all right
 
00:09:09.269 --> 00:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
put together by representative pearson
 
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
remedy that situation
 
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
and let me see if i can
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
quickly find
 
00:09:20.949 --> 00:09:20.959 align:start position:0%
the new makeup of the board proposed in
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
one obstetrician one pediatrician
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
and if i recall there was some
 
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
discussion of a public member
 
00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.230 align:start position:0%
discussion of a public member
but

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:41.519 align:start position:0%
perhaps there's someone in here who
 
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
knows best and can
 
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.150 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
that amendment is
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
not ex was not actually adopted the
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
final vote was not to pass it with the
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
amendment but to go to interim study so
 
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
we do not need to consider the amendment
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
okay you want to yeah no thank you i i
 
00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:10.389 align:start position:0%
okay you want to yeah no thank you i i
um

00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
i was unclear on that from the notes to
 
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
tell you the truth in the sequence i got
 
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
the sequence one out of step
 
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
but officially the vote to
 
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
interim study kind of wipes out the
 
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
amendment yes that's correct thank you
 
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
because um on the docket it does not
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
make mention of the amendment so we
 
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
discussed the amendment
 
00:10:33.269 --> 00:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
but we did not pass it
 
00:10:35.509 --> 00:10:35.519 align:start position:0%
and then we voted
 
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
18 to 1 or 19 to 0 to
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
to move it to interim study
 
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
i guess i would like to ask anyone who's
 
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
interested in speaking on behalf or an
 
00:10:47.839 --> 00:10:49.269 align:start position:0%
interested in speaking on behalf or an
opposition

00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
opposition
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
to the bill
 
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
and to make a recommendation about what
 
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
might be done i would be pleased to hear
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
it now so if anybody would like to step
 
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:13.120 align:start position:0%

to hb 1061 because it fails to address
 
00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:06.310 align:start position:0%
to hb 1061 because it fails to address
fundamental

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
better was on
 
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to make the midwifery
 
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
council simply an advisory committee to
 
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
the executive director of the office of
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
as advisory committee we would
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
have no independent ability to make
 
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
changes instead all actions would be
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
initiated and decided by the oplc
 
00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
executive director
 
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
the midwifery council has worked to
 
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
cultivate a fundamental working
 
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
relationship with oplc staff and
 
00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.470 align:start position:0%
relationship with oplc staff and
administration

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
administration
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
however we can cannot be guaranteed the
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
agency will continue to be cordial and
 
00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
collap collaborative in the future under
 
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
different leadership
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
if this bill becomes law the midwifery
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
council would lose its ability to remain
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
the clinical experts who conduct
 
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
administrative rulemaking draft and
 
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
proctor examinations that is actually
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
changing now
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
and initiate investigations in imposed
 
00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.949 align:start position:0%

discipline
 
00:12:58.959 --> 00:12:59.670 align:start position:0%
discipline
the

00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:01.839 align:start position:0%
midwifery council consists of a licensed
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
obstetrician a licensed pediatrician
 
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
three midwives and a member of the
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
public that's what it currently is
 
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
it is improper for the legislature to
 
00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
give the oplc executive director
 
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
regulatory authority over the practice
 
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
of midwifery in new hampshire with
 
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
discretionary power to discard disregard
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
the expertise of experienced midwives
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
and physicians knowledge about midwifery
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
practice or profession
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
in order to preserve professional
 
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
midwifery autonomy the midwifery council
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
and to achieve the goals of functioning
 
00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
within legal barriers we would endorse
 
00:13:39.509 --> 00:13:39.519 align:start position:0%
amending the language of this proposed
 
00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
legislation to reflect that the
 
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
midwifery council continued to act
 
00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
autonomously with consultation of the
 
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
executive director of oplc
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
we respectfully request that you reject
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
hb 1061 or in the very least amend the
 
00:13:55.269 --> 00:13:55.279 align:start position:0%
bill to charge experienced midwifery
 
00:13:57.829 --> 00:13:57.839 align:start position:0%
professionals with input from
 
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
physicians who are knowledgeable in in
 
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
midwifery to make critical decisions
 
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
regarding the practice of midwifery in
 
00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
new hampshire the midwifery council
 
00:14:07.829 --> 00:14:07.839 align:start position:0%
welcomes the guidance and oversight of
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
oplc executive director to remain within
 
00:14:12.710 --> 00:14:12.720 align:start position:0%
legal bounds in prudent administrative
 
00:14:14.829 --> 00:14:14.839 align:start position:0%
practices thank you for your
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
consideration currently the
 
00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
board makeup has three midwives an
 
00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
obstetrician and pediatrician that have
 
00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
experience working with midwifery
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
practices and a
 
00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:33.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm thinking my words the
 
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
amendment had taken out the member of
 
00:14:40.949 --> 00:14:40.959 align:start position:0%
the public but we think they're valuable
 
00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
right so it kept it at five members
 
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
instead of booming it to six right um
 
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
which was a um
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
a matter of um
 
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
balance and i'm you know we were okay
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
with that we're that if that were to
 
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
come about
 
00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
but we're very concerned with you know
 
00:14:59.350 --> 00:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
losing the autonomy of
 
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
the mid referee profession as it is and
 
00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.430 align:start position:0%
the mid referee profession as it is and
we

00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
understand oplc's
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
reasoning that they had given
 
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
about wanting oversight and so we would
 
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
be happy to work with them and see if we
 
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
can't come to some kind of
 
00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:17.519 align:start position:0%
way of making oversight um other than
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
completely losing our autonomy of our
 
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.030 align:start position:0%
completely losing our autonomy of our
profession

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
profession
 
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
committee members for uh
 
00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:28.399 --> 00:15:29.509 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh i was concerned
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
that there aren't a lot of midwives in
 
00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
and that in order to maintain autonomous
 
00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
you'd have to charge
 
00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
have you has the
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
technical and professional support they
 
00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
need to arrange to pay for
 
00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
it has not come to our um
 
00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
attention in terms of
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
fees or our licensure we had had in the
 
00:16:06.389 --> 00:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
past 200
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
was our fee for licensing um every two
 
00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
years that we had
 
00:16:11.199 --> 00:16:12.310 align:start position:0%
years that we had
um

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
we had the ability to to make our fees
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
at that time and i believe that oplc has
 
00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
changed that and our laws i mean our the
 
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
fee got changed to 110
 
00:16:24.629 --> 00:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
quite honestly without our knowledge at
 
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
the time and
 
00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.189 align:start position:0%
the time and
um

00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
that they have the ability to to change
 
00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:31.759 align:start position:0%
those fees on us at this point
 
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
but we have not had that discussion and
 
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
that has not been brought to my
 
00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.150 align:start position:0%
that has not been brought to my
attention

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
yes and i i noticed that you're
 
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
in rule making on the scope of practice
 
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
how's that going it's going great we are
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
that's um
 
00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:53.839 align:start position:0%
because they sunset they go out of date
 
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
that we look at them and make changes
 
00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
and the scope of practice
 
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
we need to update certain things that
 
00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:03.839 align:start position:0%
you know as time goes on they need to be
 
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
addressed but it's pretty it's not very
 
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.069 align:start position:0%
addressed but it's pretty it's not very
substantial

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
so our substantive
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
the the protocols that we're looking to
 
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
change at this time
 
00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:16.559 align:start position:0%
it's more about getting them before they
 
00:17:16.559 --> 00:17:20.230 align:start position:0%
it's more about getting them before they
expire

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
if not um then
 
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i i was waiting to
 
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
see whether any of the other
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
representatives wanted to weigh in on
 
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
this because uh
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
as ms stevens knows from a long
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
conversation she and i had early days on
 
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
this when this bill was in the process
 
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.750 align:start position:0%
this when this bill was in the process
of

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
being brought forward
 
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
that our purpose
 
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
in fighting was not
 
00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:54.799 align:start position:0%
to handcuff the midwives with regard to
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
their autonomy
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
and i did apologize i believe during the
 
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
course of the hearing with regard to
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
that that the language of the
 
00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
of the bill as it landed on the on the
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
committee's doorstep
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
included several aspects which were not
 
00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh were not uh certainly not my
 
00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.230 align:start position:0%
uh were not uh certainly not my
intention

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
intention
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
and i was not supportive of them
 
00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.909 align:start position:0%
and i was not supportive of them
certainly

00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:18:19.919 --> 00:18:20.630 align:start position:0%
certainly
but

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
one of the issues
 
00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
is that we have been trying to
 
00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:25.909 align:start position:0%
is that we have been trying to
um

00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
to change the oplc
 
00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
structure if you will
 
00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.029 align:start position:0%
structure if you will
to

00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:18:33.039 --> 00:18:34.150 align:start position:0%
to
um

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
to be more
 
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.549 align:start position:0%
to be more
successful

00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
successful
 
00:18:38.559 --> 00:18:39.750 align:start position:0%
successful
and

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
and to be
 
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
more effective
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
and we started with a couple of the
 
00:18:45.679 --> 00:18:47.029 align:start position:0%
and we started with a couple of the
smaller

00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
smaller
 
00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
professions so that we wouldn't tackle
 
00:18:51.190 --> 00:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
some big profession it's kind of like
 
00:18:52.549 --> 00:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
when your
 
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
child starts with a small bicycle before
 
00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
a tricycle before they try a big bicycle
 
00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%
and they are big enough for that so
 
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
one of the problems has been that that
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
with some of the smaller boards
 
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
getting a quorum
 
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
when you have a small contingent of
 
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.310 align:start position:0%
when you have a small contingent of
practitioners

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
practitioners
 
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.350 align:start position:0%
practitioners
um

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.310 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
um and and the advisory aspect uh as
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
as it's
 
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
been put forward
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.310 align:start position:0%
 
administrative

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
function in the hands of
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
an oversight in the hands of the oplc
 
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
which is their forte they have attorneys
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
rules writers and so forth and so on
 
00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799 align:start position:0%
the practitioners should be in charge of
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
the scope of practice and all aspects
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
involving that
 
00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:50.799 align:start position:0%
and the word advisory
 
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
is causing lots of complications because
 
00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
it certainly implied to you and to many
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
of your practitioners the idea that you
 
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
were going to be
 
00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.310 align:start position:0%
were going to be
only

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
only
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
offering advice and the
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
executive director would have plenary
 
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
authority to do everything
 
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
and somehow
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
can you see a
 
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
a way or a word
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
that would
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
express the partnership of the two
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
entities oplc on the one hand
 
00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.190 align:start position:0%
entities oplc on the one hand
administratively

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
administratively
 
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
legally and so forth
 
00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
the the in your case the midwives uh and
 
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
their medical
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
cohorts the ob gyns and pediatricians
 
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
would be on the side of
 
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
the science of midwifery
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
and that and neither side would have
 
00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:46.640 align:start position:0%
dominance over the other each would
 
00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.430 align:start position:0%
dominance over the other each would
which

00:20:47.430 --> 00:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
provide its area of expertise so that
 
00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
the whole operation would be more
 
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.750 align:start position:0%
the whole operation would be more
effective

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
effective
 
00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:54.870 align:start position:0%
effective
in

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
advancing the cause in this case
 
00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919 align:start position:0%
of midwifery so
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
if if we can come to some kind of terms
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
that will that will
 
00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
make that clear in the statute
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
and a future executive director could
 
00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.510 align:start position:0%
and a future executive director could
not

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
take away your autonomy uh would you
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
more be inclined to
 
00:21:16.799 --> 00:21:18.470 align:start position:0%
more be inclined to
this

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.909 align:start position:0%
this
cooperative

00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
cooperative
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
arrangement than you you were initially
 
00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
i think you and i understood each other
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
after our conversation certainly the
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
midwives and supporters of midwifery who
 
00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
came to the bill
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
were not of they did not understand that
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
and they were not supportive of anything
 
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
other than the midwives being in charge
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
even if it was not maybe working as well
 
00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
as it should on behalf of midwifery and
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
the right of citizens of new hampshire
 
00:21:54.789 --> 00:21:54.799 align:start position:0%
to to go to midwives as opposed to being
 
00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
seen in hospitals by ob gyn
 
00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
representative i would like to hear the
 
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
answer to that thank you i appreciate
 
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
your indulgence mr chairman okay
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
um well first of all the
 
00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
this bill as it is right now i think
 
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
what was said earlier was that the
 
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
amendment to change the balance of three
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
obs and midwives is still on the table
 
00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:16.710 align:start position:0%
obs and midwives is still on the table
because

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
okay so that's this bill is
 
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
this bill is not in its in any form on
 
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799 align:start position:0%
the table okay we're here to consider
 
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
using the this is a framework whether we
 
00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:30.630 align:start position:0%
using the this is a framework whether we
need

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
legislation for next year and if so what
 
00:22:35.909 --> 00:22:35.919 align:start position:0%
would it consist of okay
 
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
so the i guess the question would be if
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
if a new bill
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
um reflected the amendment
 
00:22:45.909 --> 00:22:45.919 align:start position:0%
uh what would your your thoughts and
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
position be on that right
 
00:22:50.549 --> 00:22:50.559 align:start position:0%
so officially what i can say that i have
 
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
we have a vote on from the council is
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
that we had wanted
 
00:22:55.919 --> 00:22:57.029 align:start position:0%
that we had wanted
to

00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
this bill to um
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
be rejected and that if they oplc wanted
 
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
to have more
 
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
oversight over us that we would the
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
midwifery council continues to act
 
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
autonomously with consultation of the
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
executive director of oplc so if we were
 
00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
to make decisions with our rulemaking or
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
make decisions with
 
00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:19.919 align:start position:0%
our investigations things like that that
 
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
we would have to go to the executive
 
00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
director and and it would put us in the
 
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
position of they could say yay or nay to
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
us and so we would still be
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
accountable to somebody other than our
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
group in terms of having quorum and
 
00:23:35.669 --> 00:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
things like that there are enough
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
midwives in the state that meet the
 
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
requirements for
 
00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
serving on the board and at this point
 
00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:43.039 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit of
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
of a process to get somebody on a board
 
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
but we've had we've been able to fill
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
those positions we have the
 
00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.950 align:start position:0%
those positions we have the
um

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:53.919 align:start position:0%
public member is um
 
00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
at large right now because we weren't
 
00:23:56.159 --> 00:23:57.669 align:start position:0%
at large right now because we weren't
really

00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
trying to fill that position because
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
this all was going on i think there are
 
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.630 align:start position:0%
this all was going on i think there are
people

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
um looking to just to fill that position
 
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
at this point but we've not had a quorum
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
issue and there's enough new midwives
 
00:24:11.110 --> 00:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
coming in to the state and old midwives
 
00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
like me that are going to be um done
 
00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
with our service soon and there's enough
 
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
coming in so keeping a quorum of the
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
three midwives and the and the two
 
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
doctors and the public is is fine with
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
us and in terms of working with oplc
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
we are happy to i mean in right it costs
 
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
some money and we understand that but
 
00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:33.039 align:start position:0%
have you know we were told that oplc is
 
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
coming in and we're going to help you
 
00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
administratively we've had um members of
 
00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
the oplc in our meetings that have kept
 
00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:42.799 align:start position:0%
our meeting minutes going correctly and
 
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480 align:start position:0%

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
agendas and we welcome that we've been
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
very happy with that having legal
 
00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
counsel in on the rulemaking and um when
 
00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:53.919 align:start position:0%
we have investigations they have a
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
you know a process there that we are
 
00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
doing our best to you know participate
 
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
in and and cooperate with we welcome
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
that that kind of help because you're
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
right we're not
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
rule-making authorities we are midwives
 
00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to taking the autonomy
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
away from our
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
profession um the history is like dr
 
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
reinhart had said in her testimony that
 
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
this their profession
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
was actively um trying to wipe out
 
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
midwives and that's still true in this
 
00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
country so new hampshire's wonderful new
 
00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:28.799 align:start position:0%
hampshire's had this law um for 34 years
 
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire where we've certified
 
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
midwives but
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
one of the other
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
people talked about louisiana they had a
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
board just like this and they moved it
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
to advisory and then it's wiped out and
 
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
they're gone they don't have um
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
and we think that the the rules that we
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
go under our law and in our um
 
00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
you know the midwifery rules that keep
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
us you know our scope of practice keeps
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
the public safe i mean if we didn't have
 
00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
that there would be midwives as they
 
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
were prior to having this um rsa 326d
 
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
that made midwifery legal in new
 
00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire they had midwives going and
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
doing twins and they had midwives doing
 
00:26:09.269 --> 00:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
whatever they wanted and they're
 
00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
certainly true in our neighbors into the
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
south of massachusetts they don't have
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
anything on their books and those kinds
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
of births of happening and i'm not
 
00:26:18.149 --> 00:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
saying they're safe or unsafe that's not
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
for me to say but that's what was
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
happening in new hampshire we got our
 
00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
326d we've made our rules what we
 
00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:26.799 align:start position:0%
thought was keeping mid re as a
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
profession and the public safe by doing
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
that and we are accountable um
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
as midwives to follow into that protocol
 
00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
and if we don't follow those protocols
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
we get disciplined right so that's what
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
we are doing to keep the public safe and
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
by certifying people which is the
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
process that we do which oplc now helps
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
us with which is wonderful and by
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
doing our rules keeping our rules that
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
were put in place and just updating them
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
as needed which is pretty minimal and
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
then by doing the discipline which oplc
 
00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
also has taken over and has helped us
 
00:26:59.830 --> 00:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
with and given us more legitimacy if we
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
had no
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
you know subpoena records oplc does that
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
which is better than me in my office
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
doing that right we want that kind of
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
legitimacy so we are really happy to
 
00:27:12.390 --> 00:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
work with them but there's not another
 
00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.830 align:start position:0%
work with them but there's not another
profession

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
profession
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
that i mean okay that's not right there
 
00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:17.919 align:start position:0%
are possibly other professions that are
 
00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:20.799 align:start position:0%
small boards that being an advisory
 
00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
committee would be absolutely wonderful
 
00:27:23.909 --> 00:27:23.919 align:start position:0%
and that's just what they need and that
 
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
that's all the support they need the
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
nursing board the medical board
 
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't do that to them they're
 
00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:30.559 align:start position:0%
not going to do that to them they don't
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
have an intention to do that to them
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
midwifery is a small profession but what
 
00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
we do is really important in our and our
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
being able to have autonomy over that
 
00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
and say over that instead of just being
 
00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
an advisory
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
position is extremely important to us as
 
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
a profession and our clients all right
 
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.080 align:start position:0%

at one of our committee of conference
 
00:28:02.399 --> 00:28:03.430 align:start position:0%
at one of our committee of conference
meetings

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
the chair of our sister committee in the
 
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.549 align:start position:0%
the chair of our sister committee in the
senate

00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
suggested that
 
00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
she would like to see
 
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
to enable
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of these boards to meet
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
either remotely or hybrid
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
with your knowledge of the membership
 
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
of your profession do you feel that
 
00:28:23.909 --> 00:28:23.919 align:start position:0%
would enable you to
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
better obtain quorums and and have
 
00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
robust meetings absolutely um the ob
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
currently travels all the way from keene
 
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
which is a lot for her to do and take
 
00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:36.799 align:start position:0%
out of her time in her practice and a
 
00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:38.559 align:start position:0%
lot of us are on call so if i'm able to
 
00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
stay in my office and have a meeting as
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
opposed to coming all the way down here
 
00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:43.919 align:start position:0%
now i'm an hour and a half from my
 
00:28:46.389 --> 00:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
client it would be much easier for us to
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
meet and we would have much more success
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up just follow-up um
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
and i believe if i recall correctly
 
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
many of your members practice in the
 
00:29:01.029 --> 00:29:01.039 align:start position:0%

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
our only function is to make a
 
00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
recommendation which is not binding on
 
00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.590 align:start position:0%
recommendation which is not binding on
anybody

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation either to
 
00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:45.750 align:start position:0%
make a recommendation either to
to

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:46.789 align:start position:0%
to
recommend

00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:46.799 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
further legislation on the subject
 
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
or to recommend no further legislation
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
but i as a representative and my
 
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
colleagues anyone else in the house is
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
free to file a bill
 
00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
on anything
 
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
relevant to this subject so while the
 
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
present bill is is effectively dead
 
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about that
 
00:30:11.669 --> 00:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
we are still open to
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
offering further legislation so i am
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
seeking uh to find
 
00:30:17.679 --> 00:30:18.549 align:start position:0%
seeking uh to find
some

00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:30:21.190 --> 00:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
framework that will promote
 
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799 align:start position:0%
and support
 
00:30:26.549 --> 00:30:26.559 align:start position:0%
um and maintain and care for
 
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
the practice of midwifery even though my
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
daughter was born in the hospital i
 
00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
think i was born i know i was born in
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
the hospital although i have a question
 
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
please i yeah i'm getting there mr
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
chairman um so
 
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
i i'm very supportive
 
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
but i think this is something that i
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
would recommend that we work on further
 
00:30:49.269 --> 00:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're promoting
 
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
is this something you would be open to
 
00:30:54.149 --> 00:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
it sounds like you are yes absolutely um
 
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
i have honestly not sat down with um
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
you know lindsay and and said what do we
 
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
need to do or what can we do um i'm open
 
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
to that conversation of i understand her
 
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
concerns of of
 
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
um oversight and so i'm open to that
 
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
discussion of what we can do to to
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
you know leave that problem as well so
 
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
yes i would be willing to do that um i
 
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
think that as it's been working
 
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
as oplc has been growing and changing
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
and and organizing and we welcome their
 
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
changes that they're making that's
 
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
wonderful and as our board has been
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
growing and changing and learning um
 
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
what we have right now could work really
 
00:31:37.029 --> 00:31:37.039 align:start position:0%
fine if we need to do something else for
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
some further protection that's a
 
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
conversation we'd be happy to have okay
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh unless there's another question
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
that's uh unique i don't think we're
 
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
covering new ground
 
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
at this point so
 
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
i would uh like thank you for your
 
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
testimony and is there anybody else who
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
would like to speak
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
i'm lindsay courtney i'm the executive
 
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
director of the office um
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
and at first i wish to thank sherry for
 
00:32:18.149 --> 00:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
for coming here for being involved
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
for willingness to work on i think what
 
00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:23.919 align:start position:0%
is a difficult topic um
 
00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
and i also wish to express that
 
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
that the concerns that we have generally
 
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
in the office are not necessarily
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
specific to the midwifery council
 
00:32:35.679 --> 00:32:36.470 align:start position:0%
specific to the midwifery council
so

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
what i've observed um is that well first
 
00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:40.470 align:start position:0%
what i've observed um is that well first
off

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
off
 
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
professions and i think this is somewhat
 
00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:44.799 align:start position:0%
controversial notion in the state of new
 
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire but it shouldn't be
 
00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
professions are not entitled to regulate
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
their own profession that is something
 
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
that the legislature
 
00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
makes a decision as to what the
 
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
framework should be for regulating a
 
00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799 align:start position:0%
particular profession whether
 
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
a profession should be regulated at all
 
00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:05.519 align:start position:0%
and certain states have taken different
 
00:33:05.519 --> 00:33:07.190 align:start position:0%
and certain states have taken different
approaches

00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
approaches
 
00:33:10.149 --> 00:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
our approach has historically been
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
allowing active market professionals to
 
00:33:13.679 --> 00:33:15.029 align:start position:0%
allowing active market professionals to
actively

00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
actively
 
00:33:15.039 --> 00:33:15.830 align:start position:0%
actively
um

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:18.389 --> 00:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
regulate their own profession there are
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
some really good things about that and
 
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
there are some really not so great
 
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
things about that and i think that some
 
00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
of the concerns that oplc has
 
00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%
centers around that structure that new
 
00:33:30.149 --> 00:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire has chosen
 
00:33:32.789 --> 00:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
um ultimately it's not up to me
 
00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
obviously to make a decision about
 
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
whether there should be changes but i do
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
think it's it's
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
incumbent upon me to bring these
 
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
concerns to the legislature's attention
 
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
which is why we sought
 
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
support to file legislation to move some
 
00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:48.559 align:start position:0%
boards to advisory
 
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
there is a concern about oversight um
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
namely because professionals are
 
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
professionals in their field midwives
 
00:33:58.789 --> 00:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
are midwives doctors are doctors they
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
are not and they shouldn't be reasonably
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
expected to be experts in administrative
 
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
law in statutory compliance and
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
regulatory compliance
 
00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
as a state i think we've grown
 
00:34:10.079 --> 00:34:11.510 align:start position:0%
as a state i think we've grown
significantly

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
more complex from a legal standpoint
 
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
um it's no longer that you just look at
 
00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
your practice act and
 
00:34:21.349 --> 00:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
okay it tells you how to you know what
 
00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
you need to comply with in order to meet
 
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
the statutory framework there are other
 
00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
statutes that come into play statutes
 
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
that you need to know about and i
 
00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
wouldn't reasonably expect a
 
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
professional to know for example 541a
 
00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
applies 91a applies oh i need to look at
 
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
the statutes regarding labor because
 
00:34:39.430 --> 00:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
there's a committee that needs to be
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
established or 21g applies these are
 
00:34:45.270 --> 00:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
things that we expect our committees and
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
our boards councils and commissions to
 
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
know and actually in order to actually
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
comply with the statutes and rules that
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
we have in place but it's not reasonable
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
for us to expect them to do that
 
00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
which is why i think the office was
 
00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
created i think the office was created
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
obviously to provide that sort of
 
00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
administrative support to make to make
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
boards councils and commissions have the
 
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
information they need to comply
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
but what we've found is there's no
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
mechanism for us to actually ensure they
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
are complying with the law so we can
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
provide you can you know you can lead a
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
horse to water but you can't force it to
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
drink that sort of thing and we run into
 
00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:22.870 align:start position:0%
drink that sort of thing and we run into
issues

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
um we've and you will you will you will
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
see another lba audit uh coming out and
 
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
it will highlight a lot of issues
 
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
and there have been many audits of
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
boards in the past highlighted a lot of
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
issues and it all centers around the
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
fact that this is not this is a
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
volunteer job for them this is something
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
they come in once a month once every
 
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
quarter to do
 
00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:47.839 align:start position:0%
and so i think that with this model what
 
00:35:50.069 --> 00:35:50.079 align:start position:0%
we get is
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
60 compliance with the law
 
00:35:55.589 --> 00:35:55.599 align:start position:0%
there's no mechanism to provide
 
00:35:55.599 --> 00:35:57.190 align:start position:0%
there's no mechanism to provide
oversight

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
so that's really the basis for um
 
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
for seeking some sort of structural
 
00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.390 align:start position:0%
for seeking some sort of structural
changes

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
but there are more that you know there
 
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
is more than one way to skin the cat so
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
and this uh what was proposed in 1061
 
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be the way
 
00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
but they're in in my opinion there needs
 
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
to be oversight of these ports and it's
 
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
not just midwifery council
 
00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:23.599 align:start position:0%
the supreme court for example in north
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
carolina dental made it very clear that
 
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
when you have active market participants
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
regulating their profession
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
there is an inherent risk that does play
 
00:36:33.599 --> 00:36:34.790 align:start position:0%
there is an inherent risk that does play
out

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
that regulations will be put in place to
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
keep people out and not to protect the
 
00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.710 align:start position:0%
keep people out and not to protect the
public

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
and that is the purpose of licensing is
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
to protect the public it's not to
 
00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
promote the profession and i think that
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
there's often um
 
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
a misunderstanding um
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
among many stakeholders about that
 
00:36:55.829 --> 00:36:55.839 align:start position:0%
so i do think further legislation is
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
needed i don't know that it needs to
 
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:00.640 align:start position:0%
take the form of 1061 i think other
 
00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
states have taken different approaches
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
um safety for example sherry uh ms
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
stevens had mentioned a consultation
 
00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:10.150 align:start position:0%
stevens had mentioned a consultation
requirement

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
safety when it had the mechanical board
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
had a requirement that all regulations
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
had to be approved by the commissioner
 
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
that sort of veto power
 
00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
provided that state supervision
 
00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
there are other states that have
 
00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
different models
 
00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
i do think it's very important that
 
00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:29.750 align:start position:0%
i do think it's very important that
professionals

00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:30.710 align:start position:0%
professionals
have

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
input and
 
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
some decision-making power into criteria
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
and scope of practice
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
but i think that you really need to
 
00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.150 align:start position:0%
but i think that you really need to
combine

00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
combine
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
both state supervision experience with
 
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
administrative law and procedure
 
00:37:48.069 --> 00:37:48.079 align:start position:0%
as well as individuals who have
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
that expert
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
knowledge in order to be successful at
 
00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
regulating a particular profession
 
00:37:57.910 --> 00:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
so with that um i'd be happy to answer
 
00:37:59.430 --> 00:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:38:01.589 --> 00:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
do committee members have a question for
 
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
miss courtney
 
00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.349 align:start position:0%
miss courtney
representative

00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
sorry carol you're in my
 
00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:11.910 align:start position:0%
thank you um
okay

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:38:13.670 --> 00:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
um i was going to ask about
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
administrative rules is that what you
 
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
were going to ask about no okay ms
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
stevens indicated that she's been
 
00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
discussing that
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
with her committee or her counsel and
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
with you
 
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
do you agree with what she said that you
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
can work with her to
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
establish the priorities in
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
administrative rules that will help this
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
division that you're speaking of
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
yeah i think absolutely we can consult
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
with the council
 
00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
and we're more than happy to do that
 
00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.069 align:start position:0%
and we're more than happy to do that
um

00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
regarding yeah i mean yeah absolutely
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i was actually going to
 
00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
ask about uh
 
00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
the the the fees that the board charges
 
00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
and how much what the expenses are of
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
the office
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
could you uh give any highlights on that
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
so i don't know where a midwifery
 
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
council is at at this point i would say
 
00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
they're probably under 100 that's just
 
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head they did have a
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
statutory fee of 110 so we were not able
 
00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
to make any changes to that up until
 
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
recently and i don't know that the
 
00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
governor has signed senate bill 313 but
 
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
if he does sign senate bill 313 that
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
would remove that statutory fee and we
 
00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
would then
 
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
be in a position to promulgate rules
 
00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
regarding fees
 
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:38.480 align:start position:0%
that said i have been advised not to do
 
00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
anything regarding fees at this time
 
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
other than make you know keep things
 
00:39:46.390 --> 00:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
consistent because there were some
 
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
not midwifery related stakeholders who
 
00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
were extremely concerned about oplc's
 
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
ability to set fees
 
00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:53.670 align:start position:0%
ability to set fees
and

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
i was directed not to do anything
 
00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
regarding fees until such time as
 
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
stakeholders can reach consensus on that
 
00:40:03.349 --> 00:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
issue through senate bill 313 which is
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
kind of converted into senate bill 330.
 
00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
well um seeing none then i think we'll
 
00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
just move on to a committee discussion
 
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
i'll express my opinion first if if
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
that's not objectionable
 
00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:24.470 align:start position:0%
that's not objectionable
um

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
the original bill i think intentionally
 
00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
or not was um
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
a little too aggressive and that's what
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
caused the
 
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
i don't want to call it enough roar but
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
the push back
 
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
my inclination is
 
00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
it seems like uh it would be reasonable
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
to recommend
 
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
that legislation be considered in the
 
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
next cycle of course that's almost
 
00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
a non-recommendation because as
 
00:40:55.109 --> 00:40:55.119 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt pointed out
 
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
representatives are free to propose
 
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
legislation regardless of any
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
recommendation or not
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
but it seems that using the amended
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
version of this bill as a framework to
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
begin with
 
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
it would be a reasonable recommendation
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
that it should be pursued
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
and i would like to ask for a committee
 
00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:15.109 align:start position:0%
and i would like to ask for a committee
member's

00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
member's
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire
 
00:41:23.109 --> 00:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i mean i i agree with you
 
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
that there's
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
there are some things that need to be
 
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
changed in the statute and to
 
00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
basically to recognize the existence of
 
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
the oplc and how the how the council
 
00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
will work with it
 
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
and that's as representative schmidt
 
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
says we haven't worked out the details
 
00:41:44.790 --> 00:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
by any means but it does seem like
 
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
something that
 
00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
needs to be done
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
and we since we've been thinking about
 
00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
representative senator anastasia did you
 
00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
uh yeah i basically agree that we should

with the direction that everybody is
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%

the direction you're headed thank you
 
00:43:19.829 --> 00:43:19.839 align:start position:0%
so um correct me if i'm mistaken but it
 
00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
seems to me that the recommendation of
 
00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
this subcommittee is unanimously to
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
recommend future legislation on this
 
00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
topic does anybody disagree with that or
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
want to modify that statement
 
00:43:34.309 --> 00:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
and if not
 
00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
i'll ask for a final comment from any of
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
the committee members
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
and if
 
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
there is none then i'll
 
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
adjourn this
 
00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:49.839 align:start position:0%
well uh
 
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
carol do we have do we have a formal
 
00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
vote here or is it more like a regular
 
00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting it's
 
00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
we could take a formal vote but the full
 
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
committee needs to vote on it on the
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation so you don't have to if
 
00:44:04.150 --> 00:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
you don't want to okay well it's on the
 
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
record that this subcommittee was
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
unanimous and that's what we'll convey
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
to the full edna committee
 
00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
