Total Wine and More is our biggest

competition in New Hampshire they were
 
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
not in New Hampshire uh I'm sorry they
 
00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:56.900 align:start position:0%
weren't in Massachusetts until 2014
 
00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:00.419 align:start position:0%
they're the largest independent liquor
 
00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:02.819 align:start position:0%

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:15.660 align:start position:0%
people say well we do business in New
 
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire well we do and we do we do we
 
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:20.220 align:start position:0%
do a good job of doing business in New
 
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:22.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but 50 percent of our business
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
comes from outside of the state so
 
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
that's one thing that we always need to
 
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
remember as we go through our business
 
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.650 align:start position:0%
remember as we go through our business
needs

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:30.660 align:start position:0%
needs
 
00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:33.419 align:start position:0%

stores they've held liquor licenses for
 
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
years in Massachusetts and in Maine so
 
00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:43.319 align:start position:0%

just bringing that to you
 
00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:58.620 align:start position:0%
because of so much of our business comes
 
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
from outside of the state
 
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%

we've asked for 24 new positions in the
 
00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:57.180 align:start position:0%
budget this year uh in the stores in the
 
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
outlets we've run down employees for a
 
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
number of years and it's time to bolster
 
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
those store employees with some

and I'll turn it over to teen at this
 
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.389 align:start position:0%
and I'll turn it over to teen at this
point

00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:09:13.389 --> 00:09:13.399 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
page 12 is just a listing of the
 
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
state-owned stores that were identified
 
00:09:21.949 --> 00:09:21.959 align:start position:0%
earlier so I will start with page 13
 
00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:25.260 align:start position:0%
which is our net profit history the
 
00:09:27.949 --> 00:09:27.959 align:start position:0%
first chart is the growth since the
 
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
commission started in 1935 and you'll
 
00:09:32.329 --> 00:09:32.339 align:start position:0%
see that the commission has generated
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
4.3 billion in net profit in our 88
 
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:35.930 align:start position:0%
4.3 billion in net profit in our 88
years

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:35.940 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
the other chart is just a 10-year of our
 
00:09:42.769 --> 00:09:42.779 align:start position:0%
annual net profit from FY 13 to FY 22 so
 
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:44.820 align:start position:0%
that you can see the historical Trend
 
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:46.860 align:start position:0%
and then on the next slides I will
 
00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:50.660 align:start position:0%
further Break Down The Five-Year
 
00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
so on page 14 our revenue is broken down
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
into three main Revenue categories and
 
00:09:59.570 --> 00:09:59.580 align:start position:0%
on slide 15 there's a chart that shows
 
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
the five-year history
 
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
first you have beer tax and permits
 
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
which is 30 cents a gallon sold or
 
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
transferred for retail sales or to the
 
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
public from authorized licensees
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
then you have like liquor and wine
 
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
Revenue the sale of wine spirits and
 
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
accessories through our Outlets
 
00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:19.940 align:start position:0%
warehouses to retail customers
 
00:10:21.889 --> 00:10:21.899 align:start position:0%
on-premise customers which are
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
restaurants in lounges and off-premise
 
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
licensees such as grocery stores and
 
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
convenience stores
 
00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
and then our the revenue is primarily
 
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.240 align:start position:0%
from licensing fees which is about 3.6
 
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
million and it also includes direct
 
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
shipping permits of about 1.6 million
 
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:41.220 align:start position:0%
and then Lottery and other miscellaneous
 
00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.769 align:start position:0%
and then Lottery and other miscellaneous
Revenue

00:10:42.769 --> 00:10:42.779 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
so you can see that we had large growth
 
00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
in FY 21 and in FY 22 we were down 11
 
00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:54.899 align:start position:0%
million but you'll see that in FY 22 we
 
00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
still had significant growth over the FY
 
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
20 pre-pandemic of about 15 million
 
00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.050 align:start position:0%
20 pre-pandemic of about 15 million
foreign

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
so slide 16
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
is a five-year history of our revenue
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
and expenses and the line in the middle
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
is our actual net revenue which is
 
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
transferred annually
 
00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:18.860 align:start position:0%
so it goes from 157.4 million in FY 18
 
00:11:21.069 --> 00:11:21.079 align:start position:0%
and to
 
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:24.180 align:start position:0%
166.1 million in FY 22.
 
00:11:26.949 --> 00:11:26.959 align:start position:0%
and you'll uh can note that our Revenue
 
00:11:30.110 --> 00:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
our expense to revenue transfer has I
 
00:11:32.509 --> 00:11:32.519 align:start position:0%
mean ratio has been consistent around 30
 
00:11:32.519 --> 00:11:34.910 align:start position:0%
mean ratio has been consistent around 30
percent

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:38.449 --> 00:11:38.459 align:start position:0%
on slide 17. this is a graph of the
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
five-year transfer history and estimates
 
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
for FY 23 to 25. there are two rsas that
 
00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
govern our Revenue transfers prior to
 
00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:50.100 align:start position:0%
the transfer to the general fund the two
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
rsas are listed on the bottom of the
 
00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
next page the first transfer requirement
 
00:11:56.889 --> 00:11:56.899 align:start position:0%
under RSA
 
00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
17616 is calculated into our Revenue
 
00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
plan since it's five percent of our
 
00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:06.180 align:start position:0%
previous year's gross profit which is
 
00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
the first item listed in the bar chart
 
00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
in the green
 
00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:13.740 align:start position:0%
and then it starts at 6.8 million in FY
 
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
18 and is estimated to be around 11
 
00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:20.519 align:start position:0%
million in FY 2425
 
00:12:25.069 --> 00:12:25.079 align:start position:0%
then there is the RSA 126 AAA colon 3
 
00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:27.300 align:start position:0%
and this is not in our Revenue plan
 
00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:29.700 align:start position:0%
because it's the additional funds that
 
00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
are requested by HHS for the granite
 
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
advantage and you can see this is as the
 
00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
next item in the bar chart for FY 22 23
 
00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
21 22 and 23 and it's 8.2 8.7 and 7.2
 
00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:48.530 align:start position:0%
21 22 and 23 and it's 8.2 8.7 and 7.2
million

00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:52.260 align:start position:0%
then the next item in the chart is beer
 
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
tax which is consistent around 13
 
00:12:58.190 --> 00:12:58.200 align:start position:0%
million and then in the blue is the last
 
00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
item which is the remaining net revenue
 
00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.090 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:07.100 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
so on page 18
 
00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:12.660 align:start position:0%
this lays out the transfers that I
 
00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:14.700 align:start position:0%
mentioned starting with the total
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
revenue and then the five percent
 
00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
transferred to the alcohol abuse and
 
00:13:20.449 --> 00:13:20.459 align:start position:0%
prevention fund
 
00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
and that um that's included in our plan
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
and then we show this so that you can
 
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
see that number compared to our plan
 
00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:29.660 align:start position:0%
which are rows three and four
 
00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
then there's the additional transfer to
 
00:13:35.449 --> 00:13:35.459 align:start position:0%
HHS for the final liquor transfer to the
 
00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
general fund and this is followed then
 
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
by the beer tax and then you have the
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
total transfer to the general fund
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me so our estimates for FY 23 24
 
00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
and 25 are what we've provided in our
 
00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:53.700 align:start position:0%
budget request and we're on target this
 
00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
year for our plan which we think is
 
00:13:58.490 --> 00:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
notable in this ever-changing business
 
00:14:00.769 --> 00:14:00.779 align:start position:0%
environment and unpredictable National
 
00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
economy especially since the current
 
00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:06.740 align:start position:0%
plan was created two years ago
 
00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
uh so we have our FY 24 liquor estimates
 
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
which is 139.5 million and our fy25 is
 
00:14:19.129 --> 00:14:19.139 align:start position:0%
140.1 million with our beer tax flat at
 
00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
on page 19 we have the breakdown for our
 
00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:31.620 align:start position:0%
FY 22 sales by customer type and
 
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
category so the categories are spirits
 
00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
wine and accessories and accessories are
 
00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:40.139 align:start position:0%
the items sold in the stores such as
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
mixers corkscrews items like that
 
00:14:46.009 --> 00:14:46.019 align:start position:0%
so you can see that the retail Spirits
 
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
are 383 million or 50 of our business
 
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
the retail wine is 173 million or 22.6
 
00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:57.180 align:start position:0%
percent of our business and in total
 
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
retail accounts for about 72.7 of our
 
00:15:03.769 --> 00:15:03.779 align:start position:0%
business and the pie charts just show
 
00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
you the breakdown in the spirits and
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:16.009 --> 00:15:16.019 align:start position:0%
on Slide 20. the sales for our top 15
 
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
Outlet locations in FY 22 was 306
 
00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:22.980 align:start position:0%
million and they account for 51 of our
 
00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
slide 21 uh agency stores there are
 
00:15:32.569 --> 00:15:32.579 align:start position:0%
three licensed agency stores that sell
 
00:15:35.689 --> 00:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
spheres and wine one was established in
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
2003 and two in 2005. we have two in the
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
North country and one in the southern
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
part of the state and you'll notice that
 
00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
the arrow location has no sales in FY 22
 
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
and that's because they are in the
 
00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:50.940 align:start position:0%
process of rebuilding because they had a
 
00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:54.769 align:start position:0%
process of rebuilding because they had a
fire

00:15:54.769 --> 00:15:54.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:54.779 --> 00:15:55.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:59.030 --> 00:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me the next slide so these are
 
00:16:02.689 --> 00:16:02.699 align:start position:0%
Outlet changes since uh 2012 we've
 
00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
relocated renovated or constructed 40
 
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:07.740 align:start position:0%
new locations in more than 35
 
00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:10.980 align:start position:0%
communities this year we've opened new
 
00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
outlet locations in ringed Concord and
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
Manchester and we're in the process of
 
00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
new stores in Nashua and Derry
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
so on page 23 you'll see our ringed
 
00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
location which opened in May of 2020 I
 
00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:28.980 align:start position:0%
mean 2022 I went from a little over 5000
 
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:30.660 align:start position:0%
square feet to a little over ten
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
thousand square feet and in FY 23 the
 
00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
sales were 3.5 million which is an
 
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
the next location is Concord exit 17
 
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:46.980 align:start position:0%
which opened in August of 2022. it was 4
 
00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
000 square feet and is moved to uh over
 
00:16:53.569 --> 00:16:53.579 align:start position:0%
13 000 square feet the sales in FY 23 so
 
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
far are 3.1 million and that's an
 
00:16:58.490 --> 00:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
increase of 3.3 percent
 
00:17:01.009 --> 00:17:01.019 align:start position:0%
and then the last Outlet was the
 
00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
Manchester Gold Street location which
 
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
opened in September of 2022 this is a
 
00:17:08.809 --> 00:17:08.819 align:start position:0%
little under 13 000 square feet they've
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
done 2.9 Million for fiscal year 23.
 
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
and at this point I will turn it back
 
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:22.610 --> 00:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
so members of the committee on page 26
 
00:17:26.289 --> 00:17:26.299 align:start position:0%
you'll see hb2 Liquor Commission request
 
00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:31.020 align:start position:0%
in 2011 I proposed uh incentive program
 
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:33.660 align:start position:0%
with then Governor Lynch it was put in
 
00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:35.660 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 when we put it through
 
00:17:39.049 --> 00:17:39.059 align:start position:0%
we've never we've never used it and this
 
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
year we put three three or four
 
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
different proposals in front of the
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
governor there was one in particular
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
that he liked and he has approved for us
 
00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:50.220 align:start position:0%
to put in House Bill 2 and you'll see
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
the language on page 27 and this is this
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
has been approved obviously in 2011 the
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
governor is in support of it and what
 
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do now is to be able to
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
unfund the incentive program through the
 
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
additional profits that the Liquor
 
00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:11.240 align:start position:0%
Commission will make so that it'll be
 
00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
additional incentive for our employees
 
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:16.980 align:start position:0%
our full-time employees and part-time
 
00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:19.740 align:start position:0%
employees in the retail locations only
 
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
so the people that are out in the stores
 
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
that are grossly underpaid quite frankly
 
00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:29.700 align:start position:0%
at 12.38 an hour to start uh need some
 
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
additional income and this is our way to
 
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:38.700 align:start position:0%
so on page 28 just some quick marketing
 
00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
goals I won't you know bore you with the
 
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:44.220 align:start position:0%
details but we do our best to bring the

wow that was impressive that was really
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
concise there's a lot of information
 
00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
that we just so you know at least half
 
00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
of us are freshmen in this room so we
 
00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
might have to slow it back down and go
 
00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:10.380 align:start position:0%
back to one particular page that I think
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
we're interested in
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
um I should mention we're not talking
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
about a bill but I am a liquor licensee
 
00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:17.100 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you the Liquor Commission
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
does an amazing job so what are
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
questions uh over here representative
 
00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:25.740 align:start position:0%
I had maybe a dozen but I'll re refrain
 
00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
and ask one or two yeah yeah the first
 
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
question I had is why the dip in FY 22
 
00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
was post covid so what what do you think
 
00:22:36.289 --> 00:22:36.299 align:start position:0%
caused the dip
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
from 2021
 
00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:41.580 align:start position:0%
it's because we had such significant
 
00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
growth in FY 21 from the pandemic people
 
00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:46.980 align:start position:0%
being at home our retail sales were
 
00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:49.380 align:start position:0%
through the roof we had a lot of people
 
00:22:51.649 --> 00:22:51.659 align:start position:0%
that were moving into the state so we
 
00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
had significant growth in that year so
 
00:22:57.049 --> 00:22:57.059 align:start position:0%
you'll see that the actual FY 22 is
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
still a significant growth over fy20
 
00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
representative fellows thank you
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
um I have a question about you at the
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
beginning you said that you kind of
 
00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
operate separate from the general fund
 
00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:19.380 align:start position:0%
and if that's the case does that mean
 
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
that the new liquor stores that you're
 
00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.510 align:start position:0%
that the new liquor stores that you're
building

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:23:27.289 --> 00:23:27.299 align:start position:0%
did not come out of the word they're
 
00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:29.940 align:start position:0%
charged to the Liquor Commission and not
 
00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:31.799 align:start position:0%
to the general fund they're not part of
 
00:23:34.669 --> 00:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
administrative Services properties
 
00:23:36.649 --> 00:23:36.659 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%

00:24:36.289 --> 00:24:36.299 align:start position:0%
should be considered uh for um 24 and
 
00:24:36.299 --> 00:24:38.450 align:start position:0%

share on do you what has happened on
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
since the pandemic in terms of of the

percentage of customers that are coming
 
00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
from south of us
 
00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
well or all around us well during the
 
00:25:24.289 --> 00:25:24.299 align:start position:0%
pandemic obviously there was a lot less
 
00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
customers coming across the border we
 
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
followed the toll counts and the door
 
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
counts in our stores and at the highway
 
00:25:33.289 --> 00:25:33.299 align:start position:0%
so there was a lot less consumers coming
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
in from out of state at that point total
 
00:25:38.169 --> 00:25:38.179 align:start position:0%

00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
you want to compete with them you have
 
00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:46.980 align:start position:0%
to run like a business if you don't run
 
00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:48.900 align:start position:0%
like a business you don't compete with
 
00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
them that's you know it's owned by Two
 
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
Brothers one of them happens to be a
 
00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
congressman in the sixth district in
 
00:25:58.690 --> 00:25:58.700 align:start position:0%
Maryland and they've owned the business
 
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh since the 80s they started with one
 
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
business their big private label
 
00:26:06.649 --> 00:26:06.659 align:start position:0%
retailer that's something that the
 
00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission does not do we sell
 
00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
brand we sell brand name products they
 
00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:13.400 align:start position:0%
do not
 
00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so um I want to
 
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:22.860 align:start position:0%
focus again on this competition
 
00:26:24.169 --> 00:26:24.179 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned that Total Wine is
 
00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919 align:start position:0%
building more stores and mass and so
 
00:26:25.919 --> 00:26:27.230 align:start position:0%
building more stores and mass and so
forth

00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
forth
 
00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:27.950 align:start position:0%
forth
um

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
what is it that's given us the
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
competitive advantage in the past is it
 
00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:34.919 align:start position:0%
is it price and it and is so even if
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
they build more stores do we still have
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
that advantage or what is it that
 
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
what does that kind of lie well I think
 
00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
were equal to or less with them on price
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
every day
 
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
what we don't do is bait and switch
 
00:26:51.529 --> 00:26:51.539 align:start position:0%
consumers they do it constantly it's
 
00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
part of their marketing scheme they'll
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
advertise a lower price get you in they
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
won't either they won't have the product
 
00:26:59.390 --> 00:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
or they won't have enough of it when
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
people come to New Hampshire to buy
 
00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
most of the time they buy in bulk our
 
00:27:06.769 --> 00:27:06.779 align:start position:0%
business has always been built on that
 
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
bulk buy we don't want people the per
 
00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
the consumer that comes in and buys one
 
00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
bottle and leaves is an important
 
00:27:15.289 --> 00:27:15.299 align:start position:0%
consumer but the consumer that drives
 
00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:17.700 align:start position:0%
the business is the is the person that
 
00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
picks up two or three or four cases
 
00:27:22.669 --> 00:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
recognizing the value I'm from New York
 
00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:25.140 align:start position:0%
it's twenty dollars a bottle less here
 
00:27:27.169 --> 00:27:27.179 align:start position:0%
I'm going to buy it here and take it
 
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
home with me that's where that's where
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
we beat total every day of the week as
 
00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:35.220 align:start position:0%
well as our selection when you go into
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
their stores they do not have the
 
00:27:39.289 --> 00:27:39.299 align:start position:0%
selection that we have they do not have
 
00:27:41.149 --> 00:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
the skew counts that they have that we
 
00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:43.740 align:start position:0%
have they also carry beer which we don't
 
00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:47.220 align:start position:0%
we don't carry they carry party goods
 
00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:49.980 align:start position:0%
and they have humidors in the store as
 
00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
well so they're a little more uh gross
 
00:27:56.269 --> 00:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
reminded in that aspect we're we're more
 
00:27:59.289 --> 00:27:59.299 align:start position:0%
of a wine and spirits Outlet we do have
 
00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
those some of those sundry items and
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
they are important to our business but
 
00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
we don't rely on them as uh for
 
00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:12.049 --> 00:28:12.059 align:start position:0%
okay we'll keep going around the room
 
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
anyone over on this side representative
 
00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:15.169 align:start position:0%
anyone over on this side representative
Malloy

00:28:15.169 --> 00:28:15.179 align:start position:0%
Malloy
 
00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for telling me my
 
00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
question uh this isn't a revenue or
 
00:28:21.649 --> 00:28:21.659 align:start position:0%
expense question this is about emails
 
00:28:24.649 --> 00:28:24.659 align:start position:0%
how do you capture email addresses when
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
we when we run up a program part of the
 
00:28:29.450 --> 00:28:29.460 align:start position:0%
entry to the program is giving us your
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
email address so anything that we do
 
00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:34.919 align:start position:0%
whether it's in store with consumers in
 
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
a tasting we ask people to give us their
 
00:28:39.409 --> 00:28:39.419 align:start position:0%
email address if it's if it's someone
 
00:28:42.289 --> 00:28:42.299 align:start position:0%
wants to enter a contest that we run or
 
00:28:44.029 --> 00:28:44.039 align:start position:0%
they want more information about a
 
00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
product we ask them to give us their
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
email it's total totally voluntary
 
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:53.340 align:start position:0%

through Direct ship is is revenue that's
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
included in the reports that Tina gave
 
00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:11.340 align:start position:0%

and that's handled by our enforcement
division

00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
division
 
00:29:30.529 --> 00:29:30.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:31.980 align:start position:0%
now all the questions on this side of
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
the room right now okay good we'll move
 
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
back around yes representative Schamberg
 
00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my follow-up
 
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:41.240 align:start position:0%
question now
 
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:43.740 align:start position:0%
as representative almi mentioned about
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
the percentage of customers how you try
 
00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:46.860 align:start position:0%
to keep them in there
 
00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
does this flexibility
 
00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:52.740 align:start position:0%
of not being directed by a state statute
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
on price give you the ability to counter
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
the these changes that are on our
 
00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
neighbors absolutely it does
 
00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:02.950 align:start position:0%
neighbors absolutely it does
uh

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:04.740 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
and and we wouldn't be yes I would we
 
00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be really business-minded if we
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
weren't constantly looking at that and
 
00:30:15.049 --> 00:30:15.059 align:start position:0%
doing it every day I mean part of part
 
00:30:18.529 --> 00:30:18.539 align:start position:0%
of what I do on a daily basis is find
 
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
out what other people are doing
 
00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:23.940 align:start position:0%
okay follow up Madam chair final
 
00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:25.919 align:start position:0%
follow-up final follow-up is on a
 
00:30:25.919 --> 00:30:27.049 align:start position:0%
follow-up final follow-up is on a
different

00:30:27.049 --> 00:30:27.059 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
one is uh when you uh uh construct or
 
00:30:32.039 --> 00:30:32.830 align:start position:0%
one is uh when you uh uh construct or
build

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
build
 
00:30:36.769 --> 00:30:36.779 align:start position:0%
uh in a community uh what was your
 
00:30:39.649 --> 00:30:39.659 align:start position:0%
percentage of overrun costs with
 
00:30:39.659 --> 00:30:41.510 align:start position:0%
percentage of overrun costs with
construction

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
construction
 
00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:43.140 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea of that or can you
 
00:30:45.649 --> 00:30:45.659 align:start position:0%
get back to me we I we can get back to
 
00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
you but what I'd like to explain one of
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
the things I'd like to just quickly say
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
when you see us build as you you saw the
 
00:30:54.049 --> 00:30:54.059 align:start position:0%
broke down the breakdown of stores that
 
00:30:58.909 --> 00:30:58.919 align:start position:0%
we own versus what we what we release
 
00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:02.220 align:start position:0%
our landlords we are in a pattern now
 
00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
with our landlords where we add into the
 
00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:07.980 align:start position:0%
square footage for the first 10 years of
 
00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:10.260 align:start position:0%
the lease so we will add in an
 
00:31:12.769 --> 00:31:12.779 align:start position:0%
additional two to five dollars per
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
square foot the landlords actually are
 
00:31:18.529 --> 00:31:18.539 align:start position:0%
paying The Upfront cost for us to build
 
00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
those stores and we are paying for it
 
00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:23.700 align:start position:0%
over the first 10 years of the lease and
 
00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:25.980 align:start position:0%
an additional four to five dollars a
 
00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:28.860 align:start position:0%
square foot so our costs are de minimis
 
00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
this is a question about the employee
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
incentive payments and uh I'm wondering
 
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
if you could back up from that request
 
00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
to what's the situation that that you're
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
facing in terms of recruiting and
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
retaining employees that leads to this
 
00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
request and uh and how are you doing
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
generally in terms of Staff in your
 
00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:04.430 align:start position:0%
generally in terms of Staff in your
stores

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
stores
 
00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:05.930 align:start position:0%
stores
uh

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:05.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:09.169 --> 00:32:09.179 align:start position:0%
I don't think abysmal would cover it
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
I I think we're we're in a very tough
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
situation as are all retailers and all
 
00:32:17.389 --> 00:32:17.399 align:start position:0%
employers but unfortunately the state
 
00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:21.320 align:start position:0%
system only allows us to pay employees
 
00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:24.440 align:start position:0%
what the state system allows us to pay
 
00:32:27.289 --> 00:32:27.299 align:start position:0%
one of and one of the other requests we
 
00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
had asked for some additional uh
 
00:32:34.269 --> 00:32:34.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
12.38 I drove by the McDonald's in
 
00:32:39.049 --> 00:32:39.059 align:start position:0%
Claremont yesterday just as an example
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
eighteen dollars an hour up on the
 
00:32:43.789 --> 00:32:43.799 align:start position:0%
Marquee work today get paid tomorrow
 
00:32:48.769 --> 00:32:48.779 align:start position:0%
free meal with every shift uh 2500 to 5
 
00:32:52.669 --> 00:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
000 in uh incentive for employment
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
things that we just don't do and all
 
00:32:58.630 --> 00:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
cons all
 
00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
employers are recognizing that you have
 
00:33:03.649 --> 00:33:03.659 align:start position:0%
to do more one of the things that we do
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
very poorly unfortunately for our
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
employees is the ability to pay them
 
00:33:12.169 --> 00:33:12.179 align:start position:0%
what they deserve I'm not asking for
 
00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:14.460 align:start position:0%
anything more than what the average is
 
00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:16.740 align:start position:0%
but we need to be able to pay our
 
00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:22.380 align:start position:0%
follow up and keep in mind folks that
 
00:33:24.529 --> 00:33:24.539 align:start position:0%
this will all go to finance too and
 
00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:25.380 align:start position:0%
it'll be part of the budget
 
00:33:27.769 --> 00:33:27.779 align:start position:0%
deliberations okay on that part okay
 
00:33:31.789 --> 00:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
yeah I think you mentioned uh that this
 
00:33:33.649 --> 00:33:33.659 align:start position:0%
isn't the only initiative that you've
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
thought of and you've put forward as a
 
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:36.909 align:start position:0%
thought of and you've put forward as a
possible

00:33:36.909 --> 00:33:36.919 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
option for the Liquor Commission to deal
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
with this problem is it possible you
 
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
could share those other requests
 
00:33:45.289 --> 00:33:45.299 align:start position:0%
absolutely we'd be happy to do that okay
 
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you could you explain to us what
 
00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
the state system is that is setting our
 
00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
employee rates at so low that we can't
 
00:34:04.669 --> 00:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
compete with anyone on anything
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
well that's done through admin Services
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
that's not that's not something that the
 
00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:11.700 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission does yeah it's it's
 
00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere in that admin service that's
 
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:17.460 align:start position:0%
correct and that's a state it's a state
 
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
pay scale that we have to follow when we
 
00:34:22.369 --> 00:34:22.379 align:start position:0%
hire our employees yes
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
okay um moving right along
 
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
representative did you have a question
 
00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.169 align:start position:0%
representative did you have a question
yeah

00:34:27.169 --> 00:34:27.179 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:34:27.179 --> 00:34:28.129 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

00:34:28.129 --> 00:34:28.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
when you add new stores now whoever you
 
00:34:33.589 --> 00:34:33.599 align:start position:0%
do it is that increasing sales or just
 
00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
convenience is it raising your cost
 
00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
without resulting in sales
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
oh it's clearly raising the sales and
 
00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
clearly it's raising the bottom line as
 
00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:47.220 align:start position:0%
well obviously when we do these stores
 
00:34:50.930 --> 00:34:50.940 align:start position:0%
we're thinking of 25 years from now one
 
00:34:52.849 --> 00:34:52.859 align:start position:0%
of the things that the Liquor Commission
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't really good at was thinking about
 
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen 10 years from now
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
15 years from now 20 years from now if
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to be in the alcohol
 
00:35:04.609 --> 00:35:04.619 align:start position:0%
beverage retail business you have to
 
00:35:07.849 --> 00:35:07.859 align:start position:0%
give consumers an inviting opportunity
 
00:35:10.250 --> 00:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
to come into your stores and Shop
 
00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:12.180 align:start position:0%
products that they've never seen before
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
our Outlet price Buster program is one
 
00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:16.280 align:start position:0%
of those
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
opportunities as well as many others but
 
00:35:21.589 --> 00:35:21.599 align:start position:0%
if we don't have the size and the
 
00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
selection you can see we have less
 
00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
stores than we had 10 years ago but we
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
have 245
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
000 Square more square feet of retail so
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
we've gotten away from those dog leg
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
stores in the corners of Plaza that were
 
00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:40.140 align:start position:0%
completely uninviting and gone to this
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
look and feel that consumers now
 
00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:45.180 align:start position:0%
recognize not only from drive you know
 
00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
driving down the highway but wrecking
 
00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
nice from our advertising and marketing
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative Malloy thank you thank
 
00:35:57.470 --> 00:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question this is a tag
 
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
on to the previous question I I think
 
00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:03.900 align:start position:0%
what I'm looking what I want to ask you
 
00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
is with all that work you're doing in
 
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
the new stores and all that where is
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
that Peak and I know it's almost
 
00:36:14.569 --> 00:36:14.579 align:start position:0%
impossible to answer but where when will
 
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
we top out
 
00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
that revenue from liquor that's
 
00:36:21.950 --> 00:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
uh again I don't know that I expect an
 
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
answer here but that's what I'm looking
 
00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:26.220 align:start position:0%
at thank you well I can I can tell you
 
00:36:28.609 --> 00:36:28.619 align:start position:0%
that as as long as the state continues
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
to grow and the state Contin which which
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
it has obviously especially in the North
 
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
country and we continue to be inviting
 
00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:38.820 align:start position:0%
to people to come here we're a tourist
 
00:36:41.569 --> 00:36:41.579 align:start position:0%
State and we have to we have it's a
 
00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
whole gamut of things that bring people
 
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
here to the state not obviously we
 
00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
benefit from it from our general fund
 
00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
revenues from The Liquor Commission but
 
00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:53.700 align:start position:0%
we have to make sure that we watch all
 
00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:55.740 align:start position:0%
those things that bring people here to
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
the state snowmobiling four-wheeling
 
00:37:00.770 --> 00:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
skiing hiking restaurants
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
you know the water sports Etc all that
 
00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
is an important piece of what we do and
 
00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:08.700 align:start position:0%
I think we're probably five to seven
 
00:37:11.150 --> 00:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
years away from seeing any type of peak
 
00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
with sales especially given the
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
availability to do Direct ship starting
 
00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire when our next gen our
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
new POS system launches and then to go
 
00:37:25.609 --> 00:37:25.619 align:start position:0%
out of state as well
 
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
there's a number of states that allow
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
that to happen 13 I believe in total at
 
00:37:32.089 --> 00:37:32.099 align:start position:0%
this point thank you very much for that
 
00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
perspective it's very helpful thank you
 
00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:37.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
representative divorce thank you madam
 
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:45.180 align:start position:0%
question maybe I missed it but in here
 
00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:47.460 align:start position:0%
is there a budget estimate for the
 
00:37:49.849 --> 00:37:49.859 align:start position:0%
incentives for these uh individual
 
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
employees that you want to
 
00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
keep or retain or
 
00:37:58.250 --> 00:37:58.260 align:start position:0%
it's based on sales growth so it depends
 
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
they'll get uh 10 of the growth and at
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
this point
 
00:38:03.119 --> 00:38:03.829 align:start position:0%
this point
um

00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:03.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:07.069 --> 00:38:07.079 align:start position:0%
it could be anywhere from you know half
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
a million to a couple of million okay
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
committee is new and so I'm going to
 
00:39:34.849 --> 00:39:34.859 align:start position:0%
take three or four minutes to talk about
 
00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:36.180 align:start position:0%
the background of the insurance
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
department what our mission and goals
 
00:39:41.089 --> 00:39:41.099 align:start position:0%
are and then uh at about five slide six
 
00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:43.260 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll uh tap Amy here and she'll
 
00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:45.300 align:start position:0%
talk to you about our current revenue
 
00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
and our projected Revenue going forward
 
00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
the mission in New Hampshire insurance
 
00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
department is to promote the public good
 
00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
by ensuring the existence of safe and
 
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
competitive Insurance Marketplace and
 
00:39:58.490 --> 00:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
just about everything we do is directed
 
00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
at that consumer protect consumer
 
00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:02.820 align:start position:0%
protection goal a New Hampshire
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
insurance department has a unique a
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
distinction we were the first state
 
00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
insurance department established in the
 
00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
United States we were established in
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
1851 and for an industry that's almost
 
00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:15.300 align:start position:0%
entirely State regulated that shows the
 
00:40:16.490 --> 00:40:16.500 align:start position:0%
foresight that the state of New
 
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire had
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
our laws are governed and found between
 
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
RSA 400 and 420q
 
00:40:25.849 --> 00:40:25.859 align:start position:0%
and we're we're charged with the
 
00:40:27.109 --> 00:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
enforcement of all state regulated
 
00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:28.980 align:start position:0%
Insurance here in the state that takes
 
00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
many forms I think
 
00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
um some interesting stats there are
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
almost 1300 insurance companies licensed
 
00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
to do business in the state of New
 
00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:38.870 align:start position:0%
to do business in the state of New
Hampshire

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:40:41.089 --> 00:40:41.099 align:start position:0%
on top of that there are nearly two
 
00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand uh we're on page four
 
00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
now nearly 200 000 Insurance licensees
 
00:40:47.810 --> 00:40:47.820 align:start position:0%
and those are made up of Insurance
 
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
Producers and insurance adjusters now
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
I'll be the first to admit that 200 000
 
00:40:55.970 --> 00:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
licensees for 1.3 million people is too
 
00:40:58.609 --> 00:40:58.619 align:start position:0%
many we don't need that many licensees
 
00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:01.380 align:start position:0%
but what the pandemic showed us was
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
National Insurance companies that have
 
00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
large stats that were instantly remote
 
00:41:08.569 --> 00:41:08.579 align:start position:0%
chose to license all of their producers
 
00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
and all of their Adjusters in any place
 
00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
that they could easily do it just in
 
00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
case those people happen to work with
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire consumers and so we saw
 
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
just a meteoric rise in the number of
 
00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
licensees license here in the state we
 
00:41:24.109 --> 00:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
do not believe that that's sustainable
 
00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:26.700 align:start position:0%
or or necessary you don't need a
 
00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:30.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
um I and so furthering our mission of uh
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
protecting the public there are a lot of
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
things we do with insurance companies to
 
00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
make sure that they are able to to meet
 
00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:42.900 align:start position:0%
their obligations to our our citizens
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
and so the first thing we do is
 
00:41:46.730 --> 00:41:46.740 align:start position:0%
financial review of the companies we
 
00:41:48.589 --> 00:41:48.599 align:start position:0%
make sure that their balance sheets are
 
00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
accurate that they have adequate liquid
 
00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:52.740 align:start position:0%
funds that they're investing them
 
00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
appropriately that they're reporting
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
them appropriately and we do that with
 
00:41:59.089 --> 00:41:59.099 align:start position:0%
with 50 other insurance commissions
 
00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
around the nation to make sure these
 
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
insurance companies are fairly
 
00:42:05.569 --> 00:42:05.579 align:start position:0%
representing their financial
 
00:42:08.569 --> 00:42:08.579 align:start position:0%
um uh of standing
 
00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
we then look for each of the 1300
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
companies for every product they sell
 
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
they're required to have those forms
 
00:42:17.170 --> 00:42:17.180 align:start position:0%
approved by somebody in our department
 
00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:19.740 align:start position:0%
and that means that big policy you get
 
00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
at the end of every year that no one
 
00:42:23.089 --> 00:42:23.099 align:start position:0%
ever reads until there's a loss we have
 
00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:25.500 align:start position:0%
a team of people three people uh in in
 
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
one side of our house and and four in
 
00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
the other who read every single line of
 
00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
every single potential policy for New
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to make sure it complies with
 
00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
our state law with federal laws is
 
00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
applicable but also protects consumers
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
rights and uh and complies with how we
 
00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:43.079 align:start position:0%
expect them to handle claims
 
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
we have another group of people who look
 
00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
at Insurance assumptions and actual
 
00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
analysis and so what those people are
 
00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
looking for is to ensure that a company
 
00:42:56.329 --> 00:42:56.339 align:start position:0%
is picking a premium that adequately
 
00:42:58.849 --> 00:42:58.859 align:start position:0%
represents the risk they're taking and
 
00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
that's a not too high not too low
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
analysis we don't want a company
 
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
charging a premium that that provides
 
00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
them excess profits above what risk
 
00:43:08.569 --> 00:43:08.579 align:start position:0%
they're taking and we also want to
 
00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
protect companies and protect our
 
00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
consumers from companies who try to buy
 
00:43:14.569 --> 00:43:14.579 align:start position:0%
market share by pricing their product
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
below what they need to pay claims
 
00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
because that's not sustainable
 
00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:21.900 align:start position:0%
and so our actuaries do an analysis and
 
00:43:23.569 --> 00:43:23.579 align:start position:0%
and look at assumptions made by these
 
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
companies we're fortunate New Hampshire
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
to have a super competitive Marketplace
 
00:43:28.849 --> 00:43:28.859 align:start position:0%
almost all of our markets are
 
00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
competitive and that's in part because
 
00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
we take the live free to die approach to
 
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:35.640 align:start position:0%
regulating businesses we allow them to
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
to do to do business
 
00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
but our number one objective of the
 
00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
insurance department notwithstand the
 
00:43:43.309 --> 00:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
fact that Amy's sitting here is
 
00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
protecting consumers at our consumer
 
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
services division we have seven staff
 
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
members that all they do is manage
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
consumer questions inquiries or
 
00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
complaints that manifests itself in
 
00:43:57.770 --> 00:43:57.780 align:start position:0%
about 5 000 individual touches to our
 
00:43:59.930 --> 00:43:59.940 align:start position:0%
department a year many of those most of
 
00:44:02.329 --> 00:44:02.339 align:start position:0%
those are simple it's a consumer who
 
00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
doesn't understand an EOB or an
 
00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
explanation of benefit from their health
 
00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
carrier or they don't understand what
 
00:44:10.849 --> 00:44:10.859 align:start position:0%
actual cash value means or they don't
 
00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:12.780 align:start position:0%
understand how a company is going to
 
00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:15.839 align:start position:0%
Value their total loss car or how long
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
they have rental car insurance for and
 
00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:19.380 align:start position:0%
so most of those about 85 percent of
 
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
those inquiries were able to handle
 
00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:22.980 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly get people to the right
 
00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:24.839 align:start position:0%
information show them in their policy
 
00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:26.220 align:start position:0%
where something is or where something's
 
00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:27.890 align:start position:0%
where something is or where something's
not

00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:27.900 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:44:30.589 --> 00:44:30.599 align:start position:0%
um but the remaining 15 or 750 turn into
 
00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:32.460 align:start position:0%
consumer we consider consumer complaints
 
00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
those are complaints that we investigate
 
00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:37.380 align:start position:0%
at our uh at our office to ensure that
 
00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
the insurance company is complying with
 
00:44:40.430 --> 00:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
our law that they're treating the
 
00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:42.180 align:start position:0%
consumers fairly that they're paying
 
00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
claims as they're required and they're
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
doing it in a quick and orderly fashion
 
00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:50.220 align:start position:0%
of those 750 after a full analysis about
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
half of them are found to be not
 
00:44:55.309 --> 00:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
violations of law they're just that's
 
00:44:56.809 --> 00:44:56.819 align:start position:0%
that's how the policies are written but
 
00:44:58.730 --> 00:44:58.740 align:start position:0%
we're able to explain to Consumers why
 
00:45:00.829 --> 00:45:00.839 align:start position:0%
and how something's happening and about
 
00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
half of them we find that the company
 
00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
could have done better in all those
 
00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:05.460 align:start position:0%
cases we have the authority to make sure
 
00:45:07.609 --> 00:45:07.619 align:start position:0%
that they do better that they resolve
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
those matters as they're required to by
 
00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.750 align:start position:0%
those matters as they're required to by
law

00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:45:13.849 --> 00:45:13.859 align:start position:0%
um and for those cases for any one of
 
00:45:16.309 --> 00:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
those 750 cases that we open
 
00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
we have a process in our department
 
00:45:20.630 --> 00:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
where none of them can be closed without
 
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
the consumer division
 
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
the director of the consumer division
 
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
our legal team the head of the division
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
and so we have two divisions life and
 
00:45:29.089 --> 00:45:29.099 align:start position:0%
health and PNC the head of the division
 
00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:31.140 align:start position:0%
and then the Deputy Commissioner and I
 
00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:34.140 align:start position:0%
we all sit around a table and uh in
 
00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
triage each one of these cases as they
 
00:45:37.849 --> 00:45:37.859 align:start position:0%
close and we do that for two main
 
00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:40.020 align:start position:0%
purposes one we want to ensure that
 
00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
everybody around that table agrees this
 
00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
is the right result for the consumer but
 
00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:45.660 align:start position:0%
more importantly we want to ensure that
 
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
we all understand what's happening on
 
00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
the ground here in New Hampshire if
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
there's a issue that's emerging a
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
coverage dispute issue or a processing
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
thing with an insurance company that's
 
00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:56.460 align:start position:0%
happening we want to know about that
 
00:45:58.250 --> 00:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
ahead of time so that we can either have
 
00:45:59.450 --> 00:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
an enforcement action or an
 
00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:01.380 align:start position:0%
investigative action to make sure those
 
00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
companies get into line we find it's the
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
best way to deliver consistent and
 
00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
appropriate resolutions for our New
 
00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:15.240 align:start position:0%
um as part of because the insurance is a
 
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
state regulated industry in large part
 
00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:21.300 align:start position:0%
uh there are 56 other Commissioners
 
00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:22.980 align:start position:0%
around the nation and territories that
 
00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:24.660 align:start position:0%
do exactly what I do
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
and because we are such a small part in
 
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
the National Insurance Marketplace we
 
00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
all all the Commissioners get together
 
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
uh several times a year to make sure
 
00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
that we're all doing it kind of growing
 
00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
in the same direction that we're
 
00:46:37.609 --> 00:46:37.619 align:start position:0%
regulating these entities right we
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
belong to a group called The National
 
00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
Association of insurance Commissioners
 
00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
to make sure that happens so that states
 
00:46:44.329 --> 00:46:44.339 align:start position:0%
like New Hampshire can benefit from
 
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
bigger states that are addressing issues
 
00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:49.380 align:start position:0%
before we are but also for when we find
 
00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:51.180 align:start position:0%
out about an issue something like I
 
00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
talked about our consumer division we
 
00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
see a company who's breaking the law we
 
00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:55.800 align:start position:0%
know who to call and all the other
 
00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:56.940 align:start position:0%
states are doing business and saying
 
00:46:58.609 --> 00:46:58.619 align:start position:0%
take a look
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
um it works very well for us
 
00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:02.940 align:start position:0%
I think that's a basic summary of what
 
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
we do obviously we do a lot more at the
 
00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:06.420 align:start position:0%
department that's a basic summary of
 
00:47:08.569 --> 00:47:08.579 align:start position:0%
what we do I think it's important for
 
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
all of you to know that the resources
 
00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
that exist at the department are
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
available to all all constituencies of
 
00:47:15.710 --> 00:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
the state but to you and to your
 
00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:17.460 align:start position:0%
constituents and so when you're
 
00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:20.460 align:start position:0%
somewhere at the parade or town hall or
 
00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
a dump and someone says I'm having a
 
00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
question about
 
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
anything Insurance feel free to call me
 
00:47:29.569 --> 00:47:29.579 align:start position:0%

918

00:48:05.390 --> 00:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
918
 
00:48:08.809 --> 00:48:08.819 align:start position:0%
zero three five nine
 
00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Amy
 
00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me
 
00:48:15.770 --> 00:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
no the trick was I was going to mumble
 
00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:16.809 align:start position:0%
no the trick was I was going to mumble
those

00:48:16.809 --> 00:48:16.819 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:27.180 align:start position:0%
okay so thank you for having me today
 
00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
today I'm going to review with you our
 
00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:32.220 align:start position:0%
historical Revenue uh where that money
 
00:48:35.329 --> 00:48:35.339 align:start position:0%
comes from the factors that will impact
 
00:48:36.829 --> 00:48:36.839 align:start position:0%
that revenue and then we're going to
 
00:48:38.569 --> 00:48:38.579 align:start position:0%
look for it at our projections for the
 
00:48:41.809 --> 00:48:41.819 align:start position:0%
future so we'll start off on slide six
 
00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
that has our planned Revenue to our
 
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
actual results as reported in the annual
 
00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
comprehensive financial report you'll
 
00:48:52.329 --> 00:48:52.339 align:start position:0%
see that fiscal year
 
00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
2022 was a very strong year where it was
 
00:48:59.450 --> 00:48:59.460 align:start position:0%
16 million over the prior fiscal year
 
00:49:02.809 --> 00:49:02.819 align:start position:0%
um I'd also like to point out that in
 
00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
four of those years you're looking at
 
00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:07.260 align:start position:0%
Revenue did decrease from prior fiscal
 
00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:08.150 align:start position:0%
Revenue did decrease from prior fiscal
year

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:10.500 align:start position:0%
so we do tend to have swings in revenue
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
from year to year and one of those
 
00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:16.260 align:start position:0%
reasons right off the bat how we
 
00:49:18.829 --> 00:49:18.839 align:start position:0%
calculate our premium taxes is we calc
 
00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:21.900 align:start position:0%
we collect the premium taxes in advance
 
00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:24.780 align:start position:0%
so when we get our premium tax returns
 
00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
in March we will be collecting the 2022
 
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
taxes we will then subtract out the
 
00:49:35.809 --> 00:49:35.819 align:start position:0%
estimated prepayment that was made on
 
00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:37.980 align:start position:0%
their prior year tax return and that
 
00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:41.700 align:start position:0%
will true up their 2022 taxes and then
 
00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:43.380 align:start position:0%
we will collect a hundred percent of
 
00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:46.020 align:start position:0%
that tax liability as a prepayment for
 
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
2023. so if they are increasing their
 
00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
writings that will increase their true
 
00:49:56.569 --> 00:49:56.579 align:start position:0%
up and increase their prepayment so that
 
00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:03.290 --> 00:50:03.300 align:start position:0%
now to look at where this revenue is
 
00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:05.640 align:start position:0%
coming from our largest source of
 
00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:07.740 align:start position:0%
Revenue is collected through the premium
 
00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:09.660 align:start position:0%
taxes which accounts for about 80
 
00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:10.910 align:start position:0%
taxes which accounts for about 80
percent

00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
of our revenue or 120 million last year
 
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
and the other 20 is coming from our fees
 
00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
and our penalties
 
00:50:23.089 --> 00:50:23.099 align:start position:0%
so the largest source of the premium tax
 
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
revenue is from the licensed insurers we
 
00:50:31.309 --> 00:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
have 49 domestics here in the state the
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
others are domiciled in the other states
 
00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
or foreign companies
 
00:50:38.809 --> 00:50:38.819 align:start position:0%
and like Chris said there's
 
00:50:41.329 --> 00:50:41.339 align:start position:0%
approximately 1300 returns we'll be
 
00:50:43.210 --> 00:50:43.220 align:start position:0%
collecting come March
 
00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:45.900 align:start position:0%
these are Property and Casualty
 
00:50:47.809 --> 00:50:47.819 align:start position:0%
companies that write lines of business
 
00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
such as home and auto and workers comp
 
00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:53.220 align:start position:0%
we collect from life insurance companies
 
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
accident and health insurance and
 
00:50:58.849 --> 00:50:58.859 align:start position:0%
straight health or medical
 
00:51:01.010 --> 00:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
we're also collecting from risk
 
00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
retention groups and purchasing groups
 
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
and from licensed producers that have
 
00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:08.520 align:start position:0%
Surplus lines Authority that accounts
 
00:51:11.089 --> 00:51:11.099 align:start position:0%
for about three and a half percent of
 
00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
the eighty percent I mentioned and we
 
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
are collecting from independently
 
00:51:18.349 --> 00:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
procured business but that's a small
 
00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:20.460 align:start position:0%
piece less than one percent of our
 
00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:21.770 align:start position:0%
piece less than one percent of our
Revenue

00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
from for the taxes and fees the 20 that
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
I mentioned that is primarily from our
 
00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:35.569 --> 00:51:35.579 align:start position:0%
now to dive into the taxes that we're
 
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
collecting a little deeper the licensed
 
00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:40.980 align:start position:0%
companies and the risk retention groups
 
00:51:44.890 --> 00:51:44.900 align:start position:0%
both paying 1.25 on our property cash
 
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
casualty lines of business and two
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
percent on our accident and health lines
 
00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:51.660 align:start position:0%
of business
 
00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:54.660 align:start position:0%
there is a minimum tax of two hundred
 
00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:56.940 align:start position:0%
dollars per licensed company
 
00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
and we do have an employee in place a
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
retaliatory provision which is meant to
 
00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
equalize the tax burden across all
 
00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:06.660 align:start position:0%
states for these companies so we will
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
actually collect the higher of the New
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire tax rate or the tax rate of
 
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
the company state of domicile
 
00:52:17.809 --> 00:52:17.819 align:start position:0%
so come March 15th this year we will be
 
00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:23.460 align:start position:0%
collecting close to 1300 tax returns
 
00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:26.220 align:start position:0%
um and these insurers like I mentioned
 
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to be paying their taxes
 
00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
due for the calendar year 2022.
 
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to take out the estimated
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
prepayment that they made
 
00:52:38.089 --> 00:52:38.099 align:start position:0%
on their tax return last year and then
 
00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:39.300 align:start position:0%
they're going to pay a hundred percent
 
00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:41.640 align:start position:0%
of that tax liability
 
00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:43.740 align:start position:0%
for a prepayment for the calendar year
 
00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:48.530 align:start position:0%
for a prepayment for the calendar year
2023.

00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:51.410 --> 00:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
for the Surplus Lions producers we're
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
collecting three percent
 
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
on any policies that are covering risk
 
00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
in our state
 
00:53:01.849 --> 00:53:01.859 align:start position:0%
we are expecting at least 330 producers
 
00:53:05.569 --> 00:53:05.579 align:start position:0%
to file a uh annual report and pay taxes
 
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
by January 31st so that is a busy time
 
00:53:12.069 --> 00:53:12.079 align:start position:0%
for us right now
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
we will collect from independently
 
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
procured four percent on their the risk
 
00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
that those are cover covering and those
 
00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
are due March 1st but that like I said
 
00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
is a very
 
00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:28.260 align:start position:0%
very small piece of less than one
 
00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:30.049 align:start position:0%
very small piece of less than one
percent

00:53:30.049 --> 00:53:30.059 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
the bar graph on the next page is the
 
00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
historical View for the past 10 years
 
00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
so you will see here in dollars the
 
00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:42.780 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2022 the licensed companies
 
00:53:44.510 --> 00:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
that we just went over
 
00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:46.980 align:start position:0%
it was 120 million
 
00:53:50.530 --> 00:53:50.540 align:start position:0%
Surplus lines a little over 5 million
 
00:53:53.210 --> 00:53:53.220 align:start position:0%
independently procured was less than a
 
00:53:57.470 --> 00:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
million and the fees were 28 million and
 
00:53:59.390 --> 00:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
like Chris mentioned we don't expect the
 
00:54:01.849 --> 00:54:01.859 align:start position:0%
fees to continue at the levels that they
 
00:54:06.589 --> 00:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:08.809 --> 00:54:08.819 align:start position:0%
now what are the factors that impact
 
00:54:12.950 --> 00:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
this Revenue what causes it to swing
 
00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
so for one thing it's the insurance
 
00:54:17.329 --> 00:54:17.339 align:start position:0%
Market the insurance Market operates in
 
00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
two different business Cycles
 
00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:22.200 align:start position:0%
and they don't necessarily coincide with
 
00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:25.980 align:start position:0%
the prevailing economic cycle
 
00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
they can definitely vary by line of
 
00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:29.930 align:start position:0%
they can definitely vary by line of
business

00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:29.940 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:33.180 align:start position:0%
we consider a hard Market to be when the
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
underwriting standards are stringent and
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
the prices will tend to increase and the
 
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
soft Market the underwriting standards
 
00:54:42.890 --> 00:54:42.900 align:start position:0%
are much looser and the prices tend to
 
00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:44.329 align:start position:0%
are much looser and the prices tend to
decrease

00:54:44.329 --> 00:54:44.339 align:start position:0%
decrease
 
00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
but we have all these other variables
 
00:54:50.210 --> 00:54:50.220 align:start position:0%
that can cause Revenue to fluctuate
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
the largest is our tax base which is our
 
00:54:55.849 --> 00:54:55.859 align:start position:0%
premiums written that will go down in
 
00:54:58.430 --> 00:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
detail in the next couple slides
 
00:55:01.790 --> 00:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
then we have the retaliatory premium Tax
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
Rate rates which I mentioned equalizes
 
00:55:07.549 --> 00:55:07.559 align:start position:0%
the tax burden across States
 
00:55:11.329 --> 00:55:11.339 align:start position:0%
that was 10 million of our revenue for
 
00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
last year we have our retaliatory fees
 
00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:16.740 align:start position:0%
and assessments and that accounted for 5
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
million of that Revenue
 
00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:20.450 align:start position:0%
million of that Revenue
so

00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:20.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:22.130 --> 00:55:22.140 align:start position:0%
um let's see what else we have premium
 
00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
tax credits that we give
 
00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
we have amended returns that come in
 
00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:29.700 align:start position:0%
throughout the year or we will revise
 
00:55:32.329 --> 00:55:32.339 align:start position:0%
returns throughout the year as we go
 
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
through our audit process
 
00:55:37.450 --> 00:55:37.460 align:start position:0%
that might cause additional Revenue
 
00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:40.559 align:start position:0%
companies can re-domesticate to other
 
00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:43.140 align:start position:0%
states which may affect their
 
00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
retaliatory taxes or assessments
 
00:55:49.730 --> 00:55:49.740 align:start position:0%
we have the producer in licensing volume
 
00:55:53.329 --> 00:55:53.339 align:start position:0%
that will fluctuate we have examination
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
billing that will fluctuate based on the
 
00:55:59.030 --> 00:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
number of open exams being conducted by
 
00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
our financial regulation division or our
 
00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:03.540 align:start position:0%
Market conduct unit
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
and we have enforcement penalties which
 
00:56:08.950 --> 00:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
are hard to predict based on the nature
 
00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:17.930 --> 00:56:17.940 align:start position:0%
so the next slide with the pie chart
 
00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
breaks out it shows you just our tax
 
00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:22.980 align:start position:0%
base so in New Hampshire the license
 
00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
companies wrote over seven billion
 
00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
dollars worth
 
00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:29.700 align:start position:0%
of premiums in New Hampshire
 
00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
you will see from the pie chart that
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
that is split fairly evenly between the
 
00:56:36.849 --> 00:56:36.859 align:start position:0%
Property and Casualty lines of business
 
00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
at 38 and 39 percent of what was written
 
00:56:43.790 --> 00:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
here followed by the life life insurance
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
at 20 and then the risk retention groups
 
00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
and title insurance is just a little
 
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:52.559 align:start position:0%
sliver of the pie
 
00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
the next SEC slide actually puts those
 
00:56:59.150 --> 00:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
premium dollars in or premium dollars
 
00:57:02.150 --> 00:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
broken out by the type of company
 
00:57:05.089 --> 00:57:05.099 align:start position:0%
so again you'll see the health and the
 
00:57:07.069 --> 00:57:07.079 align:start position:0%
Property and Casualty they're writing
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
over two billion dollars
 
00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:19.849 --> 00:57:19.859 align:start position:0%
next we'll touch on how we derive our
 
00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
projections at the department where we
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
have a team of experts that to get
 
00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
together and discuss where we feel
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
revenue is heading we start with the tax
 
00:57:33.770 --> 00:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
unit we'll analyze the annual statement
 
00:57:35.690 --> 00:57:35.700 align:start position:0%
data that comes in
 
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
and we'll look at Revenue Trends from a
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
historical basis and we do this by
 
00:57:41.870 --> 00:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
product line
 
00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
we'll then sit down with the actuaries
 
00:57:48.170 --> 00:57:48.180 align:start position:0%
at the department and the executives uh
 
00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
the the actuaries are actually receiving
 
00:57:54.290 --> 00:57:54.300 align:start position:0%
the rate filings from companies so they
 
00:57:57.530 --> 00:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
know what requests have been put in what
 
00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:00.300 align:start position:0%
the companies see the marketplace doing
 
00:58:02.809 --> 00:58:02.819 align:start position:0%
whether they want the premiums to go up
 
00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:05.940 align:start position:0%
or down and we rely on their growth
 
00:58:09.049 --> 00:58:09.059 align:start position:0%
projections because there is a lag in
 
00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
the time that we get the premium dot
 
00:58:13.569 --> 00:58:13.579 align:start position:0%
figures from the neic
 
00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
as the companies are do not file their
 
00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
premium data until March of this year so
 
00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
we won't have 2022 premiums until later
 
00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:30.349 --> 00:58:30.359 align:start position:0%
so to take a look at what our fiscal
 
00:58:35.329 --> 00:58:35.339 align:start position:0%
year 2023 authorized budget is we derive
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
this based on our premium tax base and
 
00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
our tax credits and our fees
 
00:58:42.049 --> 00:58:42.059 align:start position:0%
but if we go through line by line You'll
 
00:58:44.809 --> 00:58:44.819 align:start position:0%
see that the premium tax liability
 
00:58:49.730 --> 00:58:49.740 align:start position:0%
expected for 2022 was 18.6 Million
 
00:58:52.370 --> 00:58:52.380 align:start position:0%
and then we're subtracting the
 
00:58:54.410 --> 00:58:54.420 align:start position:0%
prepayment that was applied or what we
 
00:58:57.410 --> 00:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
collected in March of last year you'll
 
00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
see right there there was a 2.4 million
 
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
dollar swing of additional Revenue that
 
00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:04.020 align:start position:0%
we'll be collecting
 
00:59:07.069 --> 00:59:07.079 align:start position:0%
and then the companies need to pay 100
 
00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
of that tax liability so they will for
 
00:59:14.650 --> 00:59:14.660 align:start position:0%
2023 so they'll be submitting
 
00:59:17.809 --> 00:59:17.819 align:start position:0%
118.6 million
 
00:59:20.329 --> 00:59:20.339 align:start position:0%
then we are expecting from the
 
00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
non-admitted market 4.6 million which is
 
00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
primarily from the Surplus line
 
00:59:28.010 --> 00:59:28.020 align:start position:0%
producers so we'll have a total premium
 
00:59:30.670 --> 00:59:30.680 align:start position:0%
tax revenue projected to be
 
00:59:32.930 --> 00:59:32.940 align:start position:0%
125.6 million
 
00:59:35.930 --> 00:59:35.940 align:start position:0%
and then our licenses and fees projected
 
00:59:38.089 --> 00:59:38.099 align:start position:0%
to be 18 million
 
00:59:41.089 --> 00:59:41.099 align:start position:0%
and our transfer to Department of Health
 
00:59:43.250 --> 00:59:43.260 align:start position:0%
and Human Services for the funding of
 
00:59:46.069 --> 00:59:46.079 align:start position:0%
the Granite Health Trust Fund to be 8.6
 
00:59:46.079 --> 00:59:47.450 align:start position:0%
the Granite Health Trust Fund to be 8.6
million

00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:47.460 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:59:49.730 --> 00:59:49.740 align:start position:0%
which means our total revenue projected
 
00:59:53.329 --> 00:59:53.339 align:start position:0%
will be 135 million
 
00:59:55.789 --> 00:59:55.799 align:start position:0%
so looking at where we are so far this
 
00:59:59.289 --> 00:59:59.299 align:start position:0%
fiscal year we've so far we've received
 
01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
14.8 million which is a million less
 
01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
than last year at this time and that is
 
01:00:07.849 --> 01:00:07.859 align:start position:0%
attributable to the fee Revenue
 
01:00:12.289 --> 01:00:12.299 align:start position:0%
decreasing thus far this year so
 
01:00:12.299 --> 01:00:15.010 align:start position:0%
decreasing thus far this year so
um

01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:15.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:18.109 --> 01:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
the last slide here
 
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
lays out our projections looking ahead
 
01:00:23.569 --> 01:00:23.579 align:start position:0%
to fiscal year 24 and 25 in the same
 
01:00:23.579 --> 01:00:25.730 align:start position:0%
to fiscal year 24 and 25 in the same
manner

01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:25.740 align:start position:0%
manner
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
where for fiscal year 24 we're looking
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
for it to increase up to 139 million and
 
01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:35.700 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 25. it will increase
 
01:00:37.870 --> 01:00:37.880 align:start position:0%
further to
 
01:00:42.109 --> 01:00:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:44.089 --> 01:00:44.099 align:start position:0%
that concludes our presentation do you
 
01:00:46.010 --> 01:00:46.020 align:start position:0%
have any questions
 
01:00:48.770 --> 01:00:48.780 align:start position:0%
very good presentation wonderful I had
 
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
served on Commerce for several terms so
 
01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
this is a little bit of a repeat for me
 
01:00:53.089 --> 01:00:53.099 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure there's going to be
 
01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:54.660 align:start position:0%
questions we'll start over here and
 
01:00:55.789 --> 01:00:55.799 align:start position:0%
we'll go around sound good
 
01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
representative Schamberg thank you madam
 
01:00:59.210 --> 01:00:59.220 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
question commissioner just one uh who
 
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
audits uh your department uh is it
 
01:01:08.270 --> 01:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
strictly in-house or do you use any
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
outside of state government uh Auditors
 
01:01:13.789 --> 01:01:13.799 align:start position:0%
uh we we obviously work with the state
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
uh Financial system but the LBA audits
 
01:01:16.079 --> 01:01:18.470 align:start position:0%
uh Financial system but the LBA audits
us

01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:19.980 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:20.990 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
fellows

01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
fellows
 
01:01:23.230 --> 01:01:23.240 align:start position:0%
um can you just explain to me what the
 
01:01:26.329 --> 01:01:26.339 align:start position:0%
retaliatory provision is and how that
 
01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
impacts because I have no idea what
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
you're doing sure it's that's a great
 
01:01:31.370 --> 01:01:31.380 align:start position:0%
question and it it uh it shows that
 
01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:32.460 align:start position:0%
you're paying attention because it
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense but what happens is
 
01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:36.780 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh four PNC products we
 
01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:39.900 align:start position:0%
charge a New Hampshire company who's uh
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
producing Insurance here in the State uh
 
01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:46.140 align:start position:0%
premium a sales tax of 1.25 percent
 
01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
um but if a company outside of New
 
01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is selling Insurance here in
 
01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:53.940 align:start position:0%
the State uh we look at that company's
 
01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:56.940 align:start position:0%
domicile state to see how they treat a
 
01:01:59.270 --> 01:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
domicile New Hampshire company when
 
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
they're paying their sales tax and so if
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
uh if one of our
 
01:02:05.630 --> 01:02:05.640 align:start position:0%
um one of our licensed companies here in
 
01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire sell some insurance in
 
01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts what we're looking at and
 
01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
say what's massive sales tax on this
 
01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:14.220 align:start position:0%
I'm making up a number two percent uh we
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
would charge those Mass companies two
 
01:02:18.289 --> 01:02:18.299 align:start position:0%
percent here in New Hampshire we want to
 
01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
we don't want to provide an incentive
 
01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
for companies to from artists to
 
01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:25.380 align:start position:0%
for other states out of New Hampshire to
 
01:02:27.370 --> 01:02:27.380 align:start position:0%
charge a higher sales tax on our
 
01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
domestic companies and so we treat them
 
01:02:33.289 --> 01:02:33.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
all the questions on this side uh
 
01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:38.450 align:start position:0%
all the questions on this side uh
representative

01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:02:41.450 --> 01:02:41.460 align:start position:0%
taking our questions
 
01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:44.700 align:start position:0%
um do companies pay quarterly the tax
 
01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
they owe or is it uh in March at the um
 
01:02:51.410 --> 01:02:51.420 align:start position:0%
when the tax is due they pay it a
 
01:02:53.390 --> 01:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
hundred percent in advance or I guess
 
01:02:56.270 --> 01:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
they pay it March for the entire year
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
based on their prior Year's sales and so
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
just as an example if a company writes a
 
01:03:04.370 --> 01:03:04.380 align:start position:0%
lot of business in New Hampshire last
 
01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
year and decides well we're not writing
 
01:03:08.569 --> 01:03:08.579 align:start position:0%
business in New Hampshire next year when
 
01:03:10.730 --> 01:03:10.740 align:start position:0%
they file their taxes in March they say
 
01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:12.299 align:start position:0%
what they did for last year they pay the
 
01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
tax and we charge them a projection of
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
tax for next year even though they're
 
01:03:18.349 --> 01:03:18.359 align:start position:0%
not in the market that's how we collect
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
it and then we true it up in the march
 
01:03:21.289 --> 01:03:21.299 align:start position:0%
of the next year
 
01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
that we do that with all 1300 of them
 
01:03:25.789 --> 01:03:25.799 align:start position:0%
I actually had a quick question because
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
I think I understood you you thought
 
01:03:29.930 --> 01:03:29.940 align:start position:0%
that there was an aberration in premiums
 
01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:31.250 align:start position:0%
that there was an aberration in premiums
uh

01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
fees I guess and then it went really
 
01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
high but then when I look at that on
 
01:03:38.210 --> 01:03:38.220 align:start position:0%
your projections you see it looks like
 
01:03:40.730 --> 01:03:40.740 align:start position:0%
it's going higher and higher
 
01:03:43.309 --> 01:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
well um
 
01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
no I think so
 
01:03:47.030 --> 01:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
good question and what you are not
 
01:03:49.309 --> 01:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
seeing is the actual number that came in
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
in the 23 budget uh that what we are
 
01:03:53.390 --> 01:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
showing you here is the authorized
 
01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
budget of 18 million the actual number
 
01:04:01.490 --> 01:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
in 23 was 28 million oh and so
 
01:04:03.170 --> 01:04:03.180 align:start position:0%
um that's the number we think we'll
 
01:04:06.170 --> 01:04:06.180 align:start position:0%
moderate back down to 19. uh and to put
 
01:04:07.490 --> 01:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
that all in context so that you're not
 
01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
only just hearing what parts uh our
 
01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
authorized budget for 23 was 135 million
 
01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:17.640 align:start position:0%
are actual uh Revenue was 155 million
 
01:04:21.170 --> 01:04:21.180 align:start position:0%
okay made up almost half of which by
 
01:04:23.210 --> 01:04:23.220 align:start position:0%
fees that were out of line
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you so much questions yes
 
01:04:26.750 --> 01:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
representative Platt yes this I'm going
 
01:04:28.329 --> 01:04:28.339 align:start position:0%
to show my newness of this committee
 
01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:31.140 align:start position:0%
from Science and Tech
 
01:04:35.030 --> 01:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
um page nine Revenue sources licensed
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
Surplus lines produces independently
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
procured not a bit of Market that's all
 
01:04:40.609 --> 01:04:40.619 align:start position:0%
Greek to me what are they perfect two
 
01:04:43.069 --> 01:04:43.079 align:start position:0%
different things so we have 1300
 
01:04:44.450 --> 01:04:44.460 align:start position:0%
companies that write business in New
 
01:04:46.609 --> 01:04:46.619 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that covers almost all
 
01:04:49.069 --> 01:04:49.079 align:start position:0%
types of risks that we would have here
 
01:04:52.970 --> 01:04:52.980 align:start position:0%
there are risks that are very unique and
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
so think of the kinds of things you've
 
01:04:57.049 --> 01:04:57.059 align:start position:0%
heard of Lloyd's of London insuring you
 
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
know Taylor Swift's legs the possibility
 
01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
of a volcano disrupting a you know Super
 
01:05:06.230 --> 01:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
Bowl things that are hard to kind of uh
 
01:05:09.170 --> 01:05:09.180 align:start position:0%
to to get coverage for in New Hampshire
 
01:05:11.510 --> 01:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
I think medical malpractice insurance is
 
01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
an example of something that's real to
 
01:05:15.410 --> 01:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
us all there aren't a lot of players in
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire selling that so if there
 
01:05:19.549 --> 01:05:19.559 align:start position:0%
is not a market in New Hampshire from a
 
01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:21.839 align:start position:0%
licensed company to get the coverage you
 
01:05:24.109 --> 01:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
need you are permitted to get that
 
01:05:26.569 --> 01:05:26.579 align:start position:0%
coverage from somebody licensed outside
 
01:05:30.349 --> 01:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that's Surplus lines we
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
have requirements for trying to get it
 
01:05:34.250 --> 01:05:34.260 align:start position:0%
in state before you leave the state and
 
01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
purchase it outside so Surplus lines
 
01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
insurance tax is higher because they're
 
01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
not confined to the regulatory
 
01:05:45.170 --> 01:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
control of our state and we don't want
 
01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
to incentivize business to go that way
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
independently procure and so just on
 
01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
service lines to close out that Loop the
 
01:05:56.030 --> 01:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
producer the insurance agent who helps
 
01:05:57.530 --> 01:05:57.540 align:start position:0%
you find that Circle of Science
 
01:05:59.270 --> 01:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
Insurance in New Hampshire collects the
 
01:06:01.370 --> 01:06:01.380 align:start position:0%
three percent and pays it to us
 
01:06:05.589 --> 01:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
if the factor if the case uh existed
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
where a consumer didn't use an agent and
 
01:06:12.049 --> 01:06:12.059 align:start position:0%
somehow directly got in contact with
 
01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
Lloyds of London uh the obligation to
 
01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:20.930 --> 01:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
uh four percent for independently
 
01:06:25.010 --> 01:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
uh chair chairman I think we skipped
 
01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
some people on your right as we were
 
01:06:31.370 --> 01:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
going around did we okay representative
 
01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:32.329 align:start position:0%
going around did we okay representative

01:06:37.970 --> 01:06:37.980 align:start position:0%
this you have not given us the actuals
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
that you actually have for uh FY 23.
 
01:06:48.190 --> 01:06:48.200 align:start position:0%

01:06:58.370 --> 01:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
from license fees and penalties so if
 
01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
you've switched to page slide 15
 
01:07:05.450 --> 01:07:05.460 align:start position:0%
I'm on slide 15. all right um I have
 
01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
rounded numbers here premium tax
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
liability Top Line 124.
 
01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:14.460 align:start position:0%
yep so it was a five point
 
01:07:16.370 --> 01:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
something percent increase million
 
01:07:18.529 --> 01:07:18.539 align:start position:0%
dollar increase uh the prepayment
 
01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
. we're on Slide 15.
 
01:07:28.970 --> 01:07:28.980 align:start position:0%
right is that not
 
01:07:32.329 --> 01:07:32.339 align:start position:0%
no I'm giving you so uh apologize
 
01:07:34.010 --> 01:07:34.020 align:start position:0%
representative if I wasn't being clear
 
01:07:37.069 --> 01:07:37.079 align:start position:0%
what we have in slide 15 is our fiscal
 
01:07:40.130 --> 01:07:40.140 align:start position:0%
year 2023 authorized budget I'm giving
 
01:07:42.049 --> 01:07:42.059 align:start position:0%
you the actual numbers that align with
 
01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
that authorized budget
 
01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry fiscal year 22.
 
01:07:55.490 --> 01:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
the results I'm sorry so it's 124 1.
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
for premium tax liability
 
01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
1241 for prepayment of following year
 
01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
because we charge the tax based on last
 
01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:10.430 align:start position:0%
because we charge the tax based on last
year's

01:08:10.430 --> 01:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
year's
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
we had 6.2 million for premium Tax
 
01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:16.380 align:start position:0%
non-emitted Market
 
01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:17.809 align:start position:0%
non-emitted Market
uh

01:08:17.809 --> 01:08:17.819 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:22.990 --> 01:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:27.709 --> 01:08:27.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
28 million for license fees and
 
01:08:29.759 --> 01:08:32.870 align:start position:0%
28 million for license fees and
penalties

01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:35.759 align:start position:0%
uh 10 million two hundred thousand for
 
01:08:37.789 --> 01:08:37.799 align:start position:0%
the Granite State Health Trust uh
 
01:08:37.799 --> 01:08:38.809 align:start position:0%
the Granite State Health Trust uh
payment

01:08:38.809 --> 01:08:38.819 align:start position:0%
payment
 
01:08:42.650 --> 01:08:42.660 align:start position:0%
for 155. how much was the
 
01:08:44.050 --> 01:08:44.060 align:start position:0%
United States
 
01:08:46.249 --> 01:08:46.259 align:start position:0%
10.2 million
 
01:08:46.259 --> 01:08:48.289 align:start position:0%
10.2 million
to

01:08:48.289 --> 01:08:48.299 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
we will update this slide and send it
 
01:08:52.249 --> 01:08:52.259 align:start position:0%
over yes that'd be very very helpful
 
01:08:56.930 --> 01:08:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
so your reference to volcano sort of
 
01:09:03.650 --> 01:09:03.660 align:start position:0%
triggered this question
 
01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:05.030 align:start position:0%
triggered this question
um

01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:08.689 --> 01:09:08.699 align:start position:0%
that's totally unusual right but what
 
01:09:12.890 --> 01:09:12.900 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if if there are large risk
 
01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:14.269 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if if there are large risk
factors

01:09:14.269 --> 01:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
factors
 
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
that are affecting today's market
 
01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:21.900 align:start position:0%
differently than before or that are new
 
01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
and that are widespread and I guess I'm
 
01:09:27.169 --> 01:09:27.179 align:start position:0%
thinking specifically of the change in
 
01:09:29.510 --> 01:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
weather patterns that we're all
 
01:09:32.150 --> 01:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
experiencing that may create greater
 
01:09:35.209 --> 01:09:35.219 align:start position:0%
risk for insurers
 
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
so that's a good question and I think
 
01:09:39.289 --> 01:09:39.299 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is uniquely positioned to
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
you know we don't have a lot of
 
01:09:43.130 --> 01:09:43.140 align:start position:0%
catastrophic losses here
 
01:09:45.530 --> 01:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
uh but but insurance isn't local
 
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
insurance is National and the players
 
01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:50.460 align:start position:0%
Across the Nation in in in part the
 
01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:52.739 align:start position:0%
reinsurers across the world are looking
 
01:09:56.450 --> 01:09:56.460 align:start position:0%
at weather related losses uh large cat
 
01:09:59.290 --> 01:09:59.300 align:start position:0%
losses and its impact on the marketplace
 
01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:01.140 align:start position:0%
the way we see that here in New
 
01:10:02.270 --> 01:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because there are there isn't
 
01:10:05.570 --> 01:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
a lot of potential kind of risk of of of
 
01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:08.340 align:start position:0%
those kinds of count losses we see it in
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
reinsurance rates that New Hampshire
 
01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:14.219 align:start position:0%
regulated companies are paying to uh to
 
01:10:15.770 --> 01:10:15.780 align:start position:0%
reinsure parts of their books it's
 
01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:17.460 align:start position:0%
getting harder for them to do that and I
 
01:10:18.709 --> 01:10:18.719 align:start position:0%
think that ultimately will will
 
01:10:20.689 --> 01:10:20.699 align:start position:0%
potentially result in some higher
 
01:10:20.699 --> 01:10:24.850 align:start position:0%
potentially result in some higher
premiums

01:10:24.850 --> 01:10:24.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:26.699 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
um let's we'll go back to representative
 
01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
fellows and we'll bounce around and
 
01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to make sure everyone
 
01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
gets the first dibs go ahead
 
01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
um thank you on on page 13.
 
01:10:40.189 --> 01:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
I'm just what I see for a trend there is
 
01:10:42.770 --> 01:10:42.780 align:start position:0%
I see that health insurance is just
 
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
escalating at a
 
01:10:47.209 --> 01:10:47.219 align:start position:0%
alarming rate
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
and in your projections do you
 
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
how are how are you dealing with that
 
01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:55.610 align:start position:0%
how are how are you dealing with that
and

01:10:55.610 --> 01:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:10:57.530 --> 01:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
you know the property Property and
 
01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
Casualty is Flowing up slowly but if you
 
01:11:02.209 --> 01:11:02.219 align:start position:0%
look back just from
 
01:11:05.330 --> 01:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
you know just on this chart
 
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
the health insurance is just
 
01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
out of sight uh there are there are a
 
01:11:13.490 --> 01:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
lot of factors here including that these
 
01:11:15.130 --> 01:11:15.140 align:start position:0%
numbers include MCO
 
01:11:19.010 --> 01:11:19.020 align:start position:0%
Medicare expansion in them
 
01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
um and so these are impacted by by
 
01:11:23.450 --> 01:11:23.460 align:start position:0%
Insurance greater than just the health
 
01:11:25.010 --> 01:11:25.020 align:start position:0%
that you and all you and I are thinking
 
01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:26.330 align:start position:0%
that you and all you and I are thinking
of

01:11:26.330 --> 01:11:26.340 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:11:28.370 --> 01:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:11:32.450 --> 01:11:32.460 align:start position:0%
I think we we base our projections on uh
 
01:11:36.410 --> 01:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
for health uh impacts of the ACA in the
 
01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:38.580 align:start position:0%
State uh we've done what we can to kind
 
01:11:40.669 --> 01:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
of moderate increases in our um in our
 
01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
health insurance premiums for the
 
01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
regulated market uh a few years ago now
 
01:11:47.209 --> 01:11:47.219 align:start position:0%
three years ago now uh we we got
 
01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
permission to have a 1332 waiver which
 
01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
was to use some money from the federal
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
government to provide some reinsurance
 
01:11:55.669 --> 01:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
to our individual Marketplace which took
 
01:11:57.410 --> 01:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
some of the risk out of it we took some
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
federal funds and applied a basically a
 
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
reinsurance program so that those
 
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
individual Market players didn't have
 
01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:06.900 align:start position:0%
all of the downside risk and that was
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
very helpful in moderating our rates
 
01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:11.030 align:start position:0%
very helpful in moderating our rates
um

01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:13.140 align:start position:0%
but you know New Hampshire is not unique
 
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
in dealing with the rise in health care
 
01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:16.970 align:start position:0%
in dealing with the rise in health care
costs

01:12:16.970 --> 01:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:12:19.550 --> 01:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
okay I saw some hands over here anything
 
01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
yes representative Bolton
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um regarding other
 
01:12:26.450 --> 01:12:26.460 align:start position:0%
factors impacting the General Revenue so
 
01:12:28.490 --> 01:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if a couple of minor ones
 
01:12:30.649 --> 01:12:30.659 align:start position:0%
might be like access to certain data
 
01:12:33.050 --> 01:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
sets like the hospital discharge data
 
01:12:36.530 --> 01:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
set or Vital Records to have need or
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
have full access yeah but do believe we
 
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
have a need to we have access to
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
discharge data we also have the best in
 
01:12:46.729 --> 01:12:46.739 align:start position:0%
the nation all claims to pay our
 
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
database New Hampshire was the first
 
01:12:52.189 --> 01:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
it's almost almost 17 years ago now to
 
01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:54.780 align:start position:0%
get permission to start collecting uh
 
01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
virtually all Health Care claims data
 
01:13:01.729 --> 01:13:01.739 align:start position:0%
that data allows us to understand our
 
01:13:03.290 --> 01:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
Market it allows us to create our health
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
cost website which ultimately allows
 
01:13:08.570 --> 01:13:08.580 align:start position:0%
consumers to price uh Health uh health
 
01:13:10.490 --> 01:13:10.500 align:start position:0%
health procedures ahead of time
 
01:13:12.490 --> 01:13:12.500 align:start position:0%
um and so I don't
 
01:13:14.810 --> 01:13:14.820 align:start position:0%
we currently aren't looking at
 
01:13:17.149 --> 01:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
large-scale uh product uh projects
 
01:13:19.310 --> 01:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
dealing with new Health Data though we
 
01:13:21.770 --> 01:13:21.780 align:start position:0%
are anticipating some of the payment
 
01:13:23.450 --> 01:13:23.460 align:start position:0%
transparency requirements under the
 
01:13:26.450 --> 01:13:26.460 align:start position:0%
federal law with kind of anticipation as
 
01:13:29.450 --> 01:13:29.460 align:start position:0%
we see Hospital charges come through on
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
the national level
 
01:13:33.649 --> 01:13:33.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:35.640 align:start position:0%
okay back around second round
 
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative almi
 
01:13:44.990 --> 01:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um so the actuals from FY 22.
 
01:13:48.410 --> 01:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
um the biggest jump was in the license
 
01:13:52.610 --> 01:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
fees apparently and that's and you're
 
01:13:56.090 --> 01:13:56.100 align:start position:0%
taking them down from 28 million to 19
 
01:14:00.410 --> 01:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
million for well for 24. I'm not sure
 
01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:01.310 align:start position:0%
million for well for 24. I'm not sure
what

01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:02.209 align:start position:0%
what
um

01:14:02.209 --> 01:14:02.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:06.770 --> 01:14:06.780 align:start position:0%
23 was set up in 21 so
 
01:14:10.610 --> 01:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure where 23 fits in this
 
01:14:13.570 --> 01:14:13.580 align:start position:0%
but how you
 
01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
we we jumped up about a third and we're
 
01:14:20.090 --> 01:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
going to lose that third is that what
 
01:14:21.709 --> 01:14:21.719 align:start position:0%
we're looking at
 
01:14:25.370 --> 01:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
it is not all in license fees it is
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
primarily license fees the the 200 000
 
01:14:29.930 --> 01:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
licensees that were licensed Across the
 
01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:31.189 align:start position:0%
licensees that were licensed Across the
Nation

01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
Nation
 
01:14:34.490 --> 01:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
um there are two things one license uh
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
license renewals happen on a a two-year
 
01:14:39.050 --> 01:14:39.060 align:start position:0%
basis and so you have years that are
 
01:14:41.450 --> 01:14:41.460 align:start position:0%
strong years and weak years uh coveted
 
01:14:45.530 --> 01:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
covid changed that there are
 
01:14:46.910 --> 01:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
um tens of thousands of insurance
 
01:14:49.310 --> 01:14:49.320 align:start position:0%
licensees that either in this cycle or
 
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
next cycle will not be renewing a New
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire insurance license they just
 
01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
don't need that many
 
01:14:56.090 --> 01:14:56.100 align:start position:0%
um I don't we don't know when that's
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
um but our team
 
01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
can't rationalize that never staying at
 
01:15:05.450 --> 01:15:05.460 align:start position:0%
28 million dollars there were also some
 
01:15:07.729 --> 01:15:07.739 align:start position:0%
penalties in here uh which were one-time
 
01:15:10.850 --> 01:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
payments not enough to to move the
 
01:15:14.209 --> 01:15:14.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:14.219 --> 01:15:15.890 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:15:15.890 --> 01:15:15.900 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:21.169 align:start position:0%
 
this

01:15:21.169 --> 01:15:21.179 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:15:25.010 --> 01:15:25.020 align:start position:0%
these Cycles happen differently in each
 
01:15:26.570 --> 01:15:26.580 align:start position:0%
state and that's why you can't
 
01:15:29.570 --> 01:15:29.580 align:start position:0%
anticipate when you're going to get
 
01:15:32.930 --> 01:15:32.940 align:start position:0%
hit with a low license here
 
01:15:35.810 --> 01:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
um no the license our license is every
 
01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
two years
 
01:15:39.470 --> 01:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
they individual licensees who have
 
01:15:41.930 --> 01:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
licensed in multiple States uh do not
 
01:15:43.910 --> 01:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
need to keep all of their license it's
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
not you know if you're licensed in 13
 
01:15:47.930 --> 01:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
states you know next year you may only
 
01:15:50.810 --> 01:15:50.820 align:start position:0%
renew eight because you're not you don't
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
have a client that's in New Hampshire
 
01:15:55.370 --> 01:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
anymore or or as you've Consolidated
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
your a Workforce you now have people
 
01:15:58.970 --> 01:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
directed specifically to the New
 
01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:01.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Market again I think
 
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
our best estimate is that during covid
 
01:16:06.290 --> 01:16:06.300 align:start position:0%
they said license everybody everywhere
 
01:16:07.669 --> 01:16:07.679 align:start position:0%
because we don't know who's going to be
 
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
working and we don't know where they're
 
01:16:09.950 --> 01:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
going to be working because they didn't
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
have the call centers they used to
 
01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:14.390 align:start position:0%
have the call centers they used to
um

01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:16.010 --> 01:16:16.020 align:start position:0%
I may be back here in two years saying
 
01:16:17.930 --> 01:16:17.940 align:start position:0%
I'm surprised but they've all kept the
 
01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:20.689 align:start position:0%
I'm surprised but they've all kept the
licenses

01:16:20.689 --> 01:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:22.610 --> 01:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
but our best estimates are that we're
 
01:16:25.189 --> 01:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
not going to that's
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you great thank you so much
 
01:16:30.770 --> 01:16:30.780 align:start position:0%
um if you could update us and email the
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
committee an update on actual
 
01:16:36.410 --> 01:16:36.420 align:start position:0%
we will we will provide that in a
 
01:16:38.570 --> 01:16:38.580 align:start position:0%
replacement fantastic thank you so much
 
01:16:45.229 --> 01:16:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
okay we will now recognize the judicial
 
01:17:04.930 --> 01:17:04.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:07.850 --> 01:17:07.860 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
my name is Diane Martin I'm the director
 
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
of the administrative office of the
 
01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
courts with me today is Donna Raymond
 
01:17:17.149 --> 01:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
our fiscal manager who is really the
 
01:17:19.370 --> 01:17:19.380 align:start position:0%
genius behind all of these numbers but
 
01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
I'm here uh to to accompany her
 
01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
um I'm relatively new to the judicial
 
01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
branch so this is my first time with
 
01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
this committee so nice to meet and see
 
01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:34.010 align:start position:0%
this committee so nice to meet and see
everyone

01:17:34.010 --> 01:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
01:17:35.990 --> 01:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
um so I'll walk you through sort of the
 
01:17:38.090 --> 01:17:38.100 align:start position:0%
high level information and then Donna is
 
01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:39.540 align:start position:0%
going to jump in and walk you through
 
01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
the numbers
 
01:17:44.090 --> 01:17:44.100 align:start position:0%
I know all of you know most of most of
 
01:17:45.530 --> 01:17:45.540 align:start position:0%
this but I think it's helpful to
 
01:17:49.149 --> 01:17:49.159 align:start position:0%
understand the judicial branch Mission
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
which is to preserve the rule of law
 
01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
while protecting the rights and
 
01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
Liberties guaranteed by the United
 
01:17:56.689 --> 01:17:56.699 align:start position:0%
States and New Hampshire constitutions
 
01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
and our goal really is is detailed
 
01:18:03.229 --> 01:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
further below and that is to provide
 
01:18:05.630 --> 01:18:05.640 align:start position:0%
accessible prompt and efficient forms
 
01:18:07.610 --> 01:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
for the fair and independent
 
01:18:10.370 --> 01:18:10.380 align:start position:0%
administration of justice with respect
 
01:18:13.070 --> 01:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
for the Dignity of all that we serve we
 
01:18:15.770 --> 01:18:15.780 align:start position:0%
take that very seriously
 
01:18:18.649 --> 01:18:18.659 align:start position:0%
um on the next page slide three you see
 
01:18:21.169 --> 01:18:21.179 align:start position:0%
the breakdown of the judicial branch it
 
01:18:23.810 --> 01:18:23.820 align:start position:0%
really has four major components Supreme
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
Court Superior Court Circuit Court and
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
then the administrative office of the
 
01:18:29.689 --> 01:18:29.699 align:start position:0%
courts which provides all of the
 
01:18:32.450 --> 01:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
Operational Support to all of the courts
 
01:18:34.689 --> 01:18:34.699 align:start position:0%
including budgeting
 
01:18:37.490 --> 01:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
the trial courts really are where we
 
01:18:40.570 --> 01:18:40.580 align:start position:0%
produce all of the unrestricted Revenue
 
01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
mainly the circuit court because that's
 
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
where you see the majority of the cases
 
01:18:48.530 --> 01:18:48.540 align:start position:0%
that come to the judicial branch
 
01:18:51.410 --> 01:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
uh our unrestricted Revenue breaks down
 
01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
into several categories which I think
 
01:18:54.649 --> 01:18:54.659 align:start position:0%
it's helpful to understand at a high
 
01:18:54.659 --> 01:18:55.390 align:start position:0%
it's helpful to understand at a high
level

01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:18:58.790 --> 01:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
the first category is the fines that are
 
01:19:02.330 --> 01:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
levied on individuals those generally
 
01:19:04.729 --> 01:19:04.739 align:start position:0%
are motor vehicle fines which we all
 
01:19:07.850 --> 01:19:07.860 align:start position:0%
know what those are criminal fines and
 
01:19:09.709 --> 01:19:09.719 align:start position:0%
penalty assessments
 
01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
another category of unrestricted Revenue
 
01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
that the branch generates is the entry
 
01:19:18.169 --> 01:19:18.179 align:start position:0%
fees and those are for when you file a
 
01:19:20.209 --> 01:19:20.219 align:start position:0%
cause of action in the branch or you
 
01:19:22.010 --> 01:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
bring emotion there's generally speaking
 
01:19:25.250 --> 01:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
a fee associated with those
 
01:19:26.810 --> 01:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
um then there's this miscellaneous
 
01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:30.060 align:start position:0%
category of other fees and um it it
 
01:19:33.169 --> 01:19:33.179 align:start position:0%
really houses a number of fees I think
 
01:19:35.810 --> 01:19:35.820 align:start position:0%
Donna did a search yesterday and there
 
01:19:38.390 --> 01:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
was something like 40 different fees in
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
that other fee category some are tiny
 
01:19:44.510 --> 01:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
some are bigger one of those is I
 
01:19:45.970 --> 01:19:45.980 align:start position:0%
highlighted separately the record
 
01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
research requests and that's something
 
01:19:51.169 --> 01:19:51.179 align:start position:0%
that's relatively new to the branch in
 
01:19:51.179 --> 01:19:52.689 align:start position:0%
that's relatively new to the branch in
2015

01:19:52.689 --> 01:19:52.699 align:start position:0%
2015
 
01:19:56.090 --> 01:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
judge king the administrative judge of
 
01:19:57.970 --> 01:19:57.980 align:start position:0%
the Circuit Court
 
01:20:01.010 --> 01:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
had encountered I think
 
01:20:03.649 --> 01:20:03.659 align:start position:0%
a real resource issue with the number of
 
01:20:05.689 --> 01:20:05.699 align:start position:0%
requests the judicial branch gets for
 
01:20:05.699 --> 01:20:06.850 align:start position:0%
requests the judicial branch gets for
information

01:20:06.850 --> 01:20:06.860 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:20:10.729 --> 01:20:10.739 align:start position:0%
from generally from businesses
 
01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:12.719 align:start position:0%
in and outside of the State of New
 
01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire looking for information about
 
01:20:16.729 --> 01:20:16.739 align:start position:0%
people and so these are the not
 
01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
litigants coming in and saying I need
 
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
information about my case here's my case
 
01:20:23.149 --> 01:20:23.159 align:start position:0%
number these are
 
01:20:26.270 --> 01:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
businesses who want to do a research on
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
a person they're hiring or or a landlord
 
01:20:32.090 --> 01:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
and so he was having a problem with our
 
01:20:33.530 --> 01:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
court staff
 
01:20:35.630 --> 01:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
doing research essentially for companies
 
01:20:37.490 --> 01:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
and not being able to do the job that
 
01:20:39.310 --> 01:20:39.320 align:start position:0%
they were there for so
 
01:20:42.290 --> 01:20:42.300 align:start position:0%
he worked with the Supreme Court to
 
01:20:44.689 --> 01:20:44.699 align:start position:0%
create a system where those record
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
requests are treated differently and we
 
01:20:48.770 --> 01:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
actually have dedicated staff who focus
 
01:20:52.130 --> 01:20:52.140 align:start position:0%
on those and since I had them run the
 
01:20:55.669 --> 01:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
numbers yesterday since 2015 when that
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
was instituted I think it's generated
 
01:21:00.290 --> 01:21:00.300 align:start position:0%
approximately 36 million dollars for the
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
general fund and it's been very
 
01:21:05.330 --> 01:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
effective for the court as well so
 
01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:08.940 align:start position:0%
wanted to highlight that success for you
 
01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
so that's the general categories of
 
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
unrestricted Revenue
 
01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:15.050 align:start position:0%
unrestricted Revenue
um

01:21:15.050 --> 01:21:15.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:17.390 --> 01:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
I can go into greater detail about the
 
01:21:19.130 --> 01:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
specifics of Motor Vehicle criminal
 
01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
penalty assessments anything that is of
 
01:21:24.050 --> 01:21:24.060 align:start position:0%
interest to you or we can turn it over
 
01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:25.070 align:start position:0%
interest to you or we can turn it over
to

01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:21:27.169 --> 01:21:27.179 align:start position:0%
to Donna
 
01:21:29.630 --> 01:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
morning so I thank you so I thought what
 
01:21:32.090 --> 01:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
I'd do is just start with some a little
 
01:21:34.729 --> 01:21:34.739 align:start position:0%
more detail about the types of revenues
 
01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
that we collect and where it deposits to
 
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
and then at the end we look at the
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
actual numbers for fiscal year 22 23
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
projected and 24 and 25.
 
01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
so starting out with fines two main
 
01:21:51.169 --> 01:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
types motor vehicle related and Criminal
 
01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
so motor vehicle binds as you may have
 
01:21:57.050 --> 01:21:57.060 align:start position:0%
some experience with are imposed by
 
01:21:57.060 --> 01:21:58.130 align:start position:0%
some experience with are imposed by
either

01:21:58.130 --> 01:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
state and local police
 
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
and they depending upon the level of
 
01:22:06.530 --> 01:22:06.540 align:start position:0%
fine it may be plea by mail which means
 
01:22:08.810 --> 01:22:08.820 align:start position:0%
you can just pay the fine directly to
 
01:22:11.090 --> 01:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
the Department of Safety if it is a
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
higher level offense or if you wish you
 
01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
have to have your case
 
01:22:18.050 --> 01:22:18.060 align:start position:0%
um reviewed it will go to the courts but
 
01:22:19.970 --> 01:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
assuming it's a plea by mail you pay it
 
01:22:22.430 --> 01:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
directly to the Department of Safety
 
01:22:24.649 --> 01:22:24.659 align:start position:0%
and along with it we'll get to that a
 
01:22:26.209 --> 01:22:26.219 align:start position:0%
little bit later let's say you have a
 
01:22:27.770 --> 01:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
hundred dollar fine that you can pay to
 
01:22:29.330 --> 01:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
them there's also a penalty assessment
 
01:22:32.090 --> 01:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
that gets tacked on of 24 so the actual
 
01:22:35.090 --> 01:22:35.100 align:start position:0%
amount you would pay is 124 dollars but
 
01:22:37.490 --> 01:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
of the hundred dollar amount that amount
 
01:22:39.890 --> 01:22:39.900 align:start position:0%
is deposited to the highway fund
 
01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
if you want to either it's something
 
01:22:43.729 --> 01:22:43.739 align:start position:0%
that's a must appear and you have to go
 
01:22:44.810 --> 01:22:44.820 align:start position:0%
to the court or if you want your case
 
01:22:46.130 --> 01:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
heard before the court
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
and you are found guilty uh you have
 
01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
your hearing and then the fine is also
 
01:22:52.430 --> 01:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
imposed so you may have that same
 
01:22:53.930 --> 01:22:53.940 align:start position:0%
hundred dollar fine that you have to pay
 
01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
and you'll also be paying that twenty
 
01:22:57.470 --> 01:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
four dollars for the penalty assessment
 
01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
that gets tacked on same thing um that
 
01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars deposits to the highway
 
01:23:05.330 --> 01:23:05.340 align:start position:0%
fund so think of it as safety and the
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
court sort of doing motor vehicle and
 
01:23:09.530 --> 01:23:09.540 align:start position:0%
they both are handled the same way the
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
fine portion goes to the general excuse
 
01:23:13.970 --> 01:23:13.980 align:start position:0%
me the highway fund and then the penalty
 
01:23:15.229 --> 01:23:15.239 align:start position:0%
assessment will get to a little bit
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
later and that splits in a few different
 
01:23:19.550 --> 01:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
ways for criminal fines those are
 
01:23:21.169 --> 01:23:21.179 align:start position:0%
imposed by the courts
 
01:23:23.330 --> 01:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
they can be collected by Department of
 
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
Corrections field offices if an
 
01:23:28.610 --> 01:23:28.620 align:start position:0%
individual is on probation or parole the
 
01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections collects the
 
01:23:32.330 --> 01:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
criminal fines and they are deposited
 
01:23:33.890 --> 01:23:33.900 align:start position:0%
into the general fund directly they do
 
01:23:35.209 --> 01:23:35.219 align:start position:0%
not flow through us
 
01:23:38.510 --> 01:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
if it's collected by the courts at the
 
01:23:40.370 --> 01:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
time of sentencing the courts make every
 
01:23:42.530 --> 01:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
effort to have you pay your fine at that
 
01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:43.510 align:start position:0%
effort to have you pay your fine at that
time

01:23:43.510 --> 01:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:23:46.610 --> 01:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
on your way out and if you are on the
 
01:23:48.169 --> 01:23:48.179 align:start position:0%
individual is unable to pay their fine
 
01:23:50.390 --> 01:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
at that time then they are LED into the
 
01:23:51.950 --> 01:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
clerk's office and they have to sign
 
01:23:54.410 --> 01:23:54.420 align:start position:0%
some forms whereby they are put on a
 
01:23:57.169 --> 01:23:57.179 align:start position:0%
time payment plan there's also a 25 time
 
01:23:59.330 --> 01:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
payment setup fee that they have to pay
 
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
as well so we don't always collect the
 
01:24:04.250 --> 01:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
total fine amount at the time of
 
01:24:06.350 --> 01:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
sentencing but the judges are trained to
 
01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
make every effort to collect it at that
 
01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:08.750 align:start position:0%
make every effort to collect it at that
time

01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:24:10.850 --> 01:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
and again all of that is deposited to
 
01:24:13.790 --> 01:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:15.290 --> 01:24:15.300 align:start position:0%
so now we talk a little bit more about
 
01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:18.719 align:start position:0%
penalty assessments so they're levied on
 
01:24:20.810 --> 01:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
fines imposed for criminal offenses
 
01:24:23.090 --> 01:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle and violations of
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
Municipal ordinances
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
and by Statute the minimum is two
 
01:24:30.169 --> 01:24:30.179 align:start position:0%
dollars or twenty four percent of the
 
01:24:31.669 --> 01:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
fine I don't know anything we've ever
 
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
collected that's two dollars so I think
 
01:24:36.649 --> 01:24:36.659 align:start position:0%
it's usually 24 of the fine
 
01:24:38.630 --> 01:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
um and it used to be for those who have
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
been here a while
 
01:24:43.090 --> 01:24:43.100 align:start position:0%
um prior to 2017
 
01:24:45.229 --> 01:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the penalty assessment
 
01:24:47.209 --> 01:24:47.219 align:start position:0%
that we collected went to police
 
01:24:49.550 --> 01:24:49.560 align:start position:0%
standards and training but over the
 
01:24:52.130 --> 01:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
years penalty assessment revenues have
 
01:24:53.750 --> 01:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
decreased to the point where police
 
01:24:55.310 --> 01:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
standards and training said that they
 
01:24:57.169 --> 01:24:57.179 align:start position:0%
could no longer operate with I think
 
01:24:59.810 --> 01:24:59.820 align:start position:0%
that was their only source of funding so
 
01:25:02.689 --> 01:25:02.699 align:start position:0%
things were changed and as a fiscal year
 
01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
2017 the two-thirds that we collect of
 
01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
it as well as safety now are deposited
 
01:25:12.169 --> 01:25:12.179 align:start position:0%
to the general fund and police standards
 
01:25:14.090 --> 01:25:14.100 align:start position:0%
and training is I believe funded by
 
01:25:16.189 --> 01:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
General funds as well
 
01:25:18.229 --> 01:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
so and just to complete that picture of
 
01:25:20.030 --> 01:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
penalty assessment so the two-thirds now
 
01:25:22.610 --> 01:25:22.620 align:start position:0%
are going to the general fund the other
 
01:25:26.689 --> 01:25:26.699 align:start position:0%
two-thirds are split 1 6 going to a
 
01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund which is the judicial
 
01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
Branch's I.T dedicated fund and the
 
01:25:33.410 --> 01:25:33.420 align:start position:0%
other one six going to the Department of
 
01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
Justice's victims assistance fund which
 
01:25:41.930 --> 01:25:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:43.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:44.570 --> 01:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
and then in terms of fines
 
01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:46.610 align:start position:0%
and then in terms of fines
collectibility

01:25:46.610 --> 01:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
collectibility
 
01:25:49.430 --> 01:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
um so individuals who have to pay court
 
01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
ordered motor vehicle fines are
 
01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
defaulted through the department of who
 
01:25:55.370 --> 01:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
fail to pay I'm sorry are defaulted
 
01:25:57.770 --> 01:25:57.780 align:start position:0%
through the department of safety so
 
01:25:59.390 --> 01:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety sends a warning
 
01:26:00.830 --> 01:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
notice to the individual if the fine
 
01:26:03.169 --> 01:26:03.179 align:start position:0%
remains unpaid the driver's license and
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
registration are suspended
 
01:26:08.270 --> 01:26:08.280 align:start position:0%
and if it gets suspended many states
 
01:26:11.149 --> 01:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
have reciprocity so meaning a driver's
 
01:26:12.890 --> 01:26:12.900 align:start position:0%
license will be suspended in the state
 
01:26:14.689 --> 01:26:14.699 align:start position:0%
in which they reside if they have that
 
01:26:17.090 --> 01:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
on paid fine in New Hampshire
 
01:26:19.490 --> 01:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
and if they wish to clear the default a
 
01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
50 administrative fee is collected when
 
01:26:24.290 --> 01:26:24.300 align:start position:0%
that fine is paid and that is also
 
01:26:27.770 --> 01:26:27.780 align:start position:0%
deposited to the general fund
 
01:26:29.330 --> 01:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
um rest orders are issued for unpaid
 
01:26:31.490 --> 01:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
fines also in misdemeanor and felony
 
01:26:34.250 --> 01:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
cases and there's a electronic registry
 
01:26:36.890 --> 01:26:36.900 align:start position:0%
of bench warrants that get issued and
 
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
law enforcement can search the
 
01:26:39.950 --> 01:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
repository for all outstanding bench
 
01:26:41.209 --> 01:26:41.219 align:start position:0%
warrants in the state so if you get
 
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
stopped for something else they can see
 
01:26:45.530 --> 01:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
that you may have an outstanding bench
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
warrant for an unpaid fine and address
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
so the next type of
 
01:26:59.810 --> 01:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
fee that we collect are the entry fees
 
01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
they're also called filing fees entry
 
01:27:05.629 --> 01:27:05.639 align:start position:0%
fees are set by Court rule and are paid
 
01:27:07.930 --> 01:27:07.940 align:start position:0%
at the time of filing and they range
 
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
from forty five dollars to 225 dollars
 
01:27:14.330 --> 01:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
and some of the common types that we
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
have are small claims landlord tenant
 
01:27:19.610 --> 01:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
family civil petition to a null a
 
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
criminal record motion to bring forward
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
and the distribution of the entry fees
 
01:27:26.689 --> 01:27:26.699 align:start position:0%
is set by Statute so 64 percent
 
01:27:29.570 --> 01:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
currently of Entry fees are deposited to
 
01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
the general fund
 
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
and then just to complete that picture
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
the remaining 36 percent of Entry fees
 
01:27:38.750 --> 01:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
are deposited into judicial branch
 
01:27:41.689 --> 01:27:41.699 align:start position:0%
restricted funds 30 to our I.T dedicated
 
01:27:43.970 --> 01:27:43.980 align:start position:0%
fund and six percent to facilities
 
01:27:46.669 --> 01:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
escrow so again there's two components
 
01:27:48.590 --> 01:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
to that the actual amount of the entry
 
01:27:51.290 --> 01:27:51.300 align:start position:0%
fee which the court sets and then how
 
01:27:53.390 --> 01:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
that monies get distributed which is set
 
01:27:55.729 --> 01:27:55.739 align:start position:0%
in statute
 
01:27:57.770 --> 01:27:57.780 align:start position:0%
there can be a waiver of filing fee so
 
01:28:00.410 --> 01:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
judges have the discretion to waive
 
01:28:02.689 --> 01:28:02.699 align:start position:0%
entry fees for people who cannot afford
 
01:28:05.090 --> 01:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
to pay because all citizens are entitled
 
01:28:06.830 --> 01:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
to access to the courts to resolve their
 
01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:09.050 align:start position:0%
to access to the courts to resolve their
disputes

01:28:09.050 --> 01:28:09.060 align:start position:0%
disputes
 
01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:10.310 align:start position:0%
disputes
foreign

01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:28:13.129 --> 01:28:13.139 align:start position:0%
and then there are the other fees so the
 
01:28:14.570 --> 01:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
majority of revenues and other fees as
 
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
Diane mentioned is records research fees
 
01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
and we did a study an analysis of fiscal
 
01:28:24.770 --> 01:28:24.780 align:start position:0%
year 22 actuals in the other category
 
01:28:28.129 --> 01:28:28.139 align:start position:0%
and 78 percent of it in the order of 6.5
 
01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
million dollars was records research fee
 
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
so it is a significant amount of Revenue
 
01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
and we charge uh twenty dollars per name
 
01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
for the first five names and five
 
01:28:42.290 --> 01:28:42.300 align:start position:0%
dollars per game for each additional
 
01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:43.850 align:start position:0%
dollars per game for each additional
search

01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:43.860 align:start position:0%
search
 
01:28:47.689 --> 01:28:47.699 align:start position:0%
and then the majority of the the rest of
 
01:28:50.149 --> 01:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
it is motions and petitions
 
01:28:52.850 --> 01:28:52.860 align:start position:0%
and those fees range from 25 to 250
 
01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
dollars but again they panel in
 
01:28:56.270 --> 01:28:56.280 align:start position:0%
comparison to what records research fees
 
01:28:59.870 --> 01:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
brings in in the other fees category
 
01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
we also charge a 25 surcharge to civil
 
01:29:06.110 --> 01:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
and family case filing fees
 
01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
but there are some to which we don't
 
01:29:10.729 --> 01:29:10.739 align:start position:0%
um criminal juvenile domestic violence
 
01:29:12.590 --> 01:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
stalking small claims and landlord
 
01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:14.209 align:start position:0%
stalking small claims and landlord
tenant

01:29:14.209 --> 01:29:14.219 align:start position:0%
tenant
 
01:29:16.370 --> 01:29:16.380 align:start position:0%
and again if you're going to do a time
 
01:29:18.169 --> 01:29:18.179 align:start position:0%
payment as I mentioned earlier there's a
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
25 setup fee that's assessed for that to
 
01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:22.910 align:start position:0%
25 setup fee that's assessed for that to
happen

01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:29:24.890 --> 01:29:24.900 align:start position:0%
I just want to and I know it's on the
 
01:29:27.890 --> 01:29:27.900 align:start position:0%
slide but point out that those fees are
 
01:29:30.890 --> 01:29:30.900 align:start position:0%
are set by Statute and so
 
01:29:32.510 --> 01:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
um the legislature has determined that
 
01:29:35.330 --> 01:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
those fees should either be assessed or
 
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:45.410 --> 01:29:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:46.910 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:29:46.910 --> 01:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
so we have a description of the type of
 
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
Revenue that we collect and there's two
 
01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
sections there's the revenues that go to
 
01:29:56.930 --> 01:29:56.940 align:start position:0%
the general fund at the top and at the
 
01:29:59.090 --> 01:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
very lower section there is the revenue
 
01:30:00.770 --> 01:30:00.780 align:start position:0%
that goes to the highway fund which is
 
01:30:02.510 --> 01:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
our motor vehicle fines
 
01:30:05.629 --> 01:30:05.639 align:start position:0%
so on the top section we look at actuals
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 2022
 
01:30:09.950 --> 01:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
actuals through the first half of fiscal
 
01:30:12.290 --> 01:30:12.300 align:start position:0%
year 23 then we do a production for all
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
of 23 and then projections for 24 and 25
 
01:30:18.590 --> 01:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
based on what we've seen over the years
 
01:30:22.970 --> 01:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
so as you can see here the other fees
 
01:30:24.530 --> 01:30:24.540 align:start position:0%
category again which contains the
 
01:30:26.510 --> 01:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
records research fees is the largest
 
01:30:28.970 --> 01:30:28.980 align:start position:0%
portion of that Revenue in excess of
 
01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:30.719 align:start position:0%
eight million dollars
 
01:30:32.629 --> 01:30:32.639 align:start position:0%
entry fees are next
 
01:30:34.010 --> 01:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
and again those are filings for
 
01:30:35.810 --> 01:30:35.820 align:start position:0%
different types of motions and petitions
 
01:30:39.250 --> 01:30:39.260 align:start position:0%
and whatnot at 3.4 percent
 
01:30:43.790 --> 01:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
penalty assessments is also fairly large
 
01:30:46.090 --> 01:30:46.100 align:start position:0%
around 1.2 million
 
01:30:48.169 --> 01:30:48.179 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:30:50.090 --> 01:30:50.100 align:start position:0%
we if anyone has any questions I'll
 
01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
answer them but then we look at the
 
01:30:56.209 --> 01:30:56.219 align:start position:0%
first half of fiscal year 23 and those
 
01:31:00.050 --> 01:31:00.060 align:start position:0%
revenues are coming in lower than fiscal
 
01:31:02.270 --> 01:31:02.280 align:start position:0%
year 22 and I was a little surprised by
 
01:31:05.090 --> 01:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
that obviously we saw the impact of the
 
01:31:07.610 --> 01:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
pandemic on the last quarter of fiscal
 
01:31:11.330 --> 01:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
year 20 and then fiscal year 21.
 
01:31:13.729 --> 01:31:13.739 align:start position:0%
and we're seeing a nice rebound into 22
 
01:31:15.229 --> 01:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
and I was hoping we would continue to
 
01:31:18.050 --> 01:31:18.060 align:start position:0%
see that Trend in 23.
 
01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:18.590 align:start position:0%
see that Trend in 23.
um

01:31:18.590 --> 01:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
and we thought about that and I think
 
01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
some of that may just be General economy
 
01:31:25.310 --> 01:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
right now I mean grocery prices are
 
01:31:27.350 --> 01:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
frightening and food is something that
 
01:31:30.530 --> 01:31:30.540 align:start position:0%
everybody needs to buy oil prices have
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
been very fluctuating people have to
 
01:31:34.850 --> 01:31:34.860 align:start position:0%
heat their homes with oil it's been I
 
01:31:37.129 --> 01:31:37.139 align:start position:0%
mean my last oil fill up was over a
 
01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars I mean I have never had
 
01:31:40.250 --> 01:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
to pay that much for oil so I think
 
01:31:43.729 --> 01:31:43.739 align:start position:0%
people are really feeling it and also we
 
01:31:45.470 --> 01:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
have some really nasty viruses that
 
01:31:47.570 --> 01:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
aren't even covid going around people
 
01:31:50.209 --> 01:31:50.219 align:start position:0%
have been sick for a month so that may
 
01:31:52.729 --> 01:31:52.739 align:start position:0%
contribute to people out of necessity
 
01:31:54.890 --> 01:31:54.900 align:start position:0%
not being on the roads as much or just
 
01:31:57.649 --> 01:31:57.659 align:start position:0%
trying in any way they can to save money
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
here or there and you have a lot more
 
01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
work from home that is accepted than
 
01:32:03.410 --> 01:32:03.420 align:start position:0%
used to be prior to the pandemic so they
 
01:32:06.770 --> 01:32:06.780 align:start position:0%
may be utilizing that option as well so
 
01:32:08.570 --> 01:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
it may be that we're just seeing fewer
 
01:32:11.209 --> 01:32:11.219 align:start position:0%
cars on the road as well affecting motor
 
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
vehicle fines I mean that's like a 7.3
 
01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:15.590 align:start position:0%
vehicle fines I mean that's like a 7.3
percent

01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:32:19.310 --> 01:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
projected reduction in 23 versus 22
 
01:32:21.470 --> 01:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
that's pretty significant I don't like
 
01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
to be the Debbie Downer and I'd love to
 
01:32:26.209 --> 01:32:26.219 align:start position:0%
be proved wrong but I didn't just take
 
01:32:28.850 --> 01:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
the the first half of 23 and multiply it
 
01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
by two I did look at you know the second
 
01:32:32.990 --> 01:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
half of the year there's a slight uptick
 
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
over the first half of the year and I
 
01:32:36.169 --> 01:32:36.179 align:start position:0%
did incorporate that versus what I've
 
01:32:36.179 --> 01:32:37.250 align:start position:0%
did incorporate that versus what I've
seen

01:32:37.250 --> 01:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
seen
 
01:32:40.310 --> 01:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
over several fiscal years in the past as
 
01:32:43.550 --> 01:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
well to sort of inform what I think you
 
01:32:45.649 --> 01:32:45.659 align:start position:0%
know the the second half of 23 would be
 
01:32:48.110 --> 01:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
we're still coming in pretty low
 
01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:49.430 align:start position:0%
we're still coming in pretty low
mhm

01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
mhm
 
01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to add too I I did um
 
01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
talk this through a little bit with uh
 
01:32:57.470 --> 01:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
judge Kane to get a sense of what his
 
01:33:01.250 --> 01:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
impression of the the um
 
01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
reduction is and and he said on the fine
 
01:33:06.649 --> 01:33:06.659 align:start position:0%
side he can't say this with scientific
 
01:33:09.470 --> 01:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
certainty but his impression was that to
 
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
a certain extent the lack of
 
01:33:13.850 --> 01:33:13.860 align:start position:0%
availability of public defenders
 
01:33:17.209 --> 01:33:17.219 align:start position:0%
has caused the criminal cases to back up
 
01:33:18.770 --> 01:33:18.780 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
um you're not seeing the outcomes of
 
01:33:23.689 --> 01:33:23.699 align:start position:0%
that which often include fines
 
01:33:25.370 --> 01:33:25.380 align:start position:0%
um so just that was another piece and
 
01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
then all of the similar things that
 
01:33:30.110 --> 01:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
Donna said related to the economy
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
um also being part of why there may not
 
01:33:38.510 --> 01:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:40.669 --> 01:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
so then I applied sort of the same
 
01:33:43.070 --> 01:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
rationale looking at the last several
 
01:33:45.709 --> 01:33:45.719 align:start position:0%
fiscal years to see how revenues have
 
01:33:45.719 --> 01:33:47.090 align:start position:0%
fiscal years to see how revenues have
trended

01:33:47.090 --> 01:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
trended
 
01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%

01:33:50.400 --> 01:33:51.950 align:start position:0%
to look at fiscal year 24 and excuse me
n25

01:33:51.950 --> 01:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
n25
 
01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:53.810 align:start position:0%
n25
and

01:33:53.810 --> 01:33:53.820 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:55.790 --> 01:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
so that first line default fees
 
01:33:57.950 --> 01:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
collected by safety I spoke with Steve
 
01:34:00.709 --> 01:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
Lavoy to get his insights as to where he
 
01:34:03.110 --> 01:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
thought that was going he thought he
 
01:34:05.149 --> 01:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
hoped that they would Trend up in fiscal
 
01:34:07.010 --> 01:34:07.020 align:start position:0%
year 23
 
01:34:10.310 --> 01:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
um 24 and 25. I'm hoping he's right
 
01:34:13.550 --> 01:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
um but you know the first half of 23 is
 
01:34:16.910 --> 01:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
a little over 250 000 so double that is
 
01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
500 so he's hoping for I think for a big
 
01:34:21.890 --> 01:34:21.900 align:start position:0%
uptick in the second half of this fiscal
 
01:34:23.810 --> 01:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
year and again I hope that comes true
 
01:34:26.990 --> 01:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
and he's got some moderate increases for
 
01:34:30.110 --> 01:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
24 and 25.
 
01:34:31.729 --> 01:34:31.739 align:start position:0%
um some of these numbers are really
 
01:34:35.209 --> 01:34:35.219 align:start position:0%
small so the for instance interest you
 
01:34:35.219 --> 01:34:36.050 align:start position:0%
small so the for instance interest you
know

01:34:36.050 --> 01:34:36.060 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:34:38.030 --> 01:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
it's going to be really small so it's
 
01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
you see it you know a 30 percent decline
 
01:34:43.129 --> 01:34:43.139 align:start position:0%
predicted it doesn't really have a big
 
01:34:44.450 --> 01:34:44.460 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact one way or the other
 
01:34:45.890 --> 01:34:45.900 align:start position:0%
because we're literally talking a few
 
01:34:47.330 --> 01:34:47.340 align:start position:0%
dollars here so I don't really worry
 
01:34:48.890 --> 01:34:48.900 align:start position:0%
about those
 
01:34:51.229 --> 01:34:51.239 align:start position:0%
um the bigger hitters would obviously be
 
01:34:54.110 --> 01:34:54.120 align:start position:0%
um fines as Diane commented on Entry
 
01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:55.129 align:start position:0%
um fines as Diane commented on Entry
fees

01:34:55.129 --> 01:34:55.139 align:start position:0%
fees
 
01:34:57.709 --> 01:34:57.719 align:start position:0%
and again we're seeing a reduction this
 
01:34:59.870 --> 01:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
year and it may just be people being
 
01:35:02.209 --> 01:35:02.219 align:start position:0%
more careful about or selective about
 
01:35:04.910 --> 01:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
what they go to court for
 
01:35:07.310 --> 01:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
and So based on some of the things I've
 
01:35:08.689 --> 01:35:08.699 align:start position:0%
seen in the past
 
01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking there may be a decline in
 
01:35:13.729 --> 01:35:13.739 align:start position:0%
24 but hoping for an uptick in 25 as we
 
01:35:15.530 --> 01:35:15.540 align:start position:0%
really hopefully get away from the
 
01:35:15.540 --> 01:35:16.970 align:start position:0%
really hopefully get away from the
pandemic

01:35:16.970 --> 01:35:16.980 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:35:20.590 --> 01:35:20.600 align:start position:0%
and another big one is other fees Again
 
01:35:23.689 --> 01:35:23.699 align:start position:0%
Records research but that's been you
 
01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
know that's been healthy over the years
 
01:35:27.950 --> 01:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
so I've kind of kept that at a moderate
 
01:35:30.050 --> 01:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
increase year after year
 
01:35:33.050 --> 01:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
for the next couple of fiscal years and
 
01:35:35.090 --> 01:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
then penalty assessments I do see going
 
01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
down penalty assessments like motor
 
01:35:39.169 --> 01:35:39.179 align:start position:0%
vehicle has been one of those that over
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
the years has just had a steady decline
 
01:35:44.689 --> 01:35:44.699 align:start position:0%
um maybe there will be some upticks like
 
01:35:46.490 --> 01:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
again I hope I'm wrong but I just want
 
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
it to be realistic about what I've seen
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
probably over the last 10 fiscal years
 
01:35:52.430 --> 01:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of what's been going on with
 
01:35:54.169 --> 01:35:54.179 align:start position:0%
that and wanted to reflect that in these
 
01:35:56.149 --> 01:35:56.159 align:start position:0%
projections so as not to be too overly
 
01:35:57.649 --> 01:35:57.659 align:start position:0%
optimistic because I know you have to
 
01:36:00.050 --> 01:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
use these numbers for determining what
 
01:36:01.610 --> 01:36:01.620 align:start position:0%
you think you'll have for General funds
 
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
for 24 and 25. motor vehicle again
 
01:36:08.149 --> 01:36:08.159 align:start position:0%
sort of related to penalty assessments
 
01:36:10.669 --> 01:36:10.679 align:start position:0%
and fines that's been coming down over
 
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
the years I'm hoping clearly that it
 
01:36:14.689 --> 01:36:14.699 align:start position:0%
will not be a steep a decline as I'm
 
01:36:19.010 --> 01:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
looking at in 23 so we thought maybe a
 
01:36:22.129 --> 01:36:22.139 align:start position:0%
one percent reduction in each of 24 and
 
01:36:22.139 --> 01:36:26.169 align:start position:0%
one percent reduction in each of 24 and
25.

01:36:26.169 --> 01:36:26.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:29.090 --> 01:36:29.100 align:start position:0%
and then I don't we can go to questions
 
01:36:30.649 --> 01:36:30.659 align:start position:0%
on the numbers
 
01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
um but then the last page is just a more
 
01:36:36.229 --> 01:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
detailed description of what is in each
 
01:36:37.490 --> 01:36:37.500 align:start position:0%
of those
 
01:36:41.090 --> 01:36:41.100 align:start position:0%
fine cat you know Revenue categories
 
01:36:43.550 --> 01:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
and what's been happening perhaps over
 
01:36:45.050 --> 01:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
the years because things have changed in
 
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
terms of what has happened what the
 
01:36:48.410 --> 01:36:48.420 align:start position:0%
fines one thing I will point out is bar
 
01:36:50.330 --> 01:36:50.340 align:start position:0%
exam fees
 
01:36:52.129 --> 01:36:52.139 align:start position:0%
um they're not bar exam fees anymore
 
01:36:54.189 --> 01:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
back in
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
2012. they had been bar exam fees and
 
01:37:01.250 --> 01:37:01.260 align:start position:0%
were assigned to revenue code 402477 but
 
01:37:03.950 --> 01:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
then there was a change by Supreme Court
 
01:37:07.850 --> 01:37:07.860 align:start position:0%
rule on September 1 of 2012 and those
 
01:37:10.189 --> 01:37:10.199 align:start position:0%
bar exam fees were then deposited to the
 
01:37:12.050 --> 01:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
office of bar admissions
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
so instead of them being bar exam fees
 
01:37:17.510 --> 01:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
now it's really certificates of good
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
standing that are collected there and I
 
01:37:21.110 --> 01:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
had at the time talked to I think it was
 
01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:22.980 align:start position:0%
then fdm to see if we could get that
 
01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
name changed the problem is the name
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
changes historically all the way back so
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
they weren't too keen on doing that an
 
01:37:32.570 --> 01:37:32.580 align:start position:0%
alternative would be just to keep this
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
explanation so you know it's not really
 
01:37:36.110 --> 01:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
bar exam fees or to ask for another
 
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
revenue account I I know boa doesn't
 
01:37:40.490 --> 01:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
have a ton of them that they like to
 
01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
give out but if this committee really
 
01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't like this or isn't comfortable
 
01:37:46.189 --> 01:37:46.199 align:start position:0%
with it I can request to have a new
 
01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
revenue account set up I don't know if
 
01:37:50.510 --> 01:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
they'd be able to take though
 
01:37:52.610 --> 01:37:52.620 align:start position:0%
the revenues that are currently being
 
01:37:54.050 --> 01:37:54.060 align:start position:0%
put into this that are really
 
01:37:55.550 --> 01:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
certificates of good standing and move
 
01:37:56.990 --> 01:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
it to this new revenue account so I'm
 
01:37:58.550 --> 01:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
not even sure how clean that transition
 
01:38:00.410 --> 01:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
could be but I just I put it out there
 
01:38:02.149 --> 01:38:02.159 align:start position:0%
just so you're clear it's not an
 
01:38:03.709 --> 01:38:03.719 align:start position:0%
accurate description of what the revenue
 
01:38:05.810 --> 01:38:05.820 align:start position:0%
is in there
 
01:38:08.810 --> 01:38:08.820 align:start position:0%
excellent very good presentation okay
 
01:38:10.250 --> 01:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
questions starting with uh
 
01:38:12.290 --> 01:38:12.300 align:start position:0%
representative Schamberg
 
01:38:14.510 --> 01:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you madam
 
01:38:17.330 --> 01:38:17.340 align:start position:0%
director uh just one question who audits
 
01:38:19.970 --> 01:38:19.980 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch how often and one
 
01:38:21.950 --> 01:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
was the most recent one if you don't
 
01:38:23.570 --> 01:38:23.580 align:start position:0%
have that information maybe you can send
 
01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:24.709 align:start position:0%
have that information maybe you can send
it

01:38:24.709 --> 01:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:38:26.450 --> 01:38:26.460 align:start position:0%
um I cannot remember off the top of my
 
01:38:29.570 --> 01:38:29.580 align:start position:0%
head the last external audit at the
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
internal components of the judicial
 
01:38:34.729 --> 01:38:34.739 align:start position:0%
branch are audited for example our I.T
 
01:38:37.850 --> 01:38:37.860 align:start position:0%
department just had an audit focused on
 
01:38:40.129 --> 01:38:40.139 align:start position:0%
certain parts we also have internal
 
01:38:43.010 --> 01:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
audit and they routinely audit the trial
 
01:38:46.129 --> 01:38:46.139 align:start position:0%
courts and end of
 
01:38:46.139 --> 01:38:46.729 align:start position:0%
courts and end of
um

01:38:46.729 --> 01:38:46.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:49.250 --> 01:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
this calendar year did a full risk
 
01:38:51.709 --> 01:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
assessment of the judicial branch and
 
01:38:53.870 --> 01:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
are currently auditing the various
 
01:38:56.810 --> 01:38:56.820 align:start position:0%
components based on risk so internally
 
01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
it's ongoing externally LBA but I can't
 
01:39:03.649 --> 01:39:03.659 align:start position:0%
recall the last one but I'll get you
 
01:39:03.659 --> 01:39:06.770 align:start position:0%
recall the last one but I'll get you
that

01:39:06.770 --> 01:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:09.290 --> 01:39:09.300 align:start position:0%
representative self-worth
 
01:39:11.450 --> 01:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I've
 
01:39:14.450 --> 01:39:14.460 align:start position:0%
heard a couple reports about the fact
 
01:39:16.250 --> 01:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
that speeding has increased and that
 
01:39:19.370 --> 01:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
also the speeding is at higher speeds so
 
01:39:24.110 --> 01:39:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:27.110 --> 01:39:27.120 align:start position:0%
yeah that's always a hard one
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
to discuss because it's it's probably a
 
01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
few factors that are involved in it um
 
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
again people working from home more
 
01:39:36.890 --> 01:39:36.900 align:start position:0%
probably less cars on the road
 
01:39:38.629 --> 01:39:38.639 align:start position:0%
um bad Economic Times I mean I can't
 
01:39:40.669 --> 01:39:40.679 align:start position:0%
speak for what goes on out there um if
 
01:39:43.790 --> 01:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
you get stopped and you're in tears and
 
01:39:45.530 --> 01:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
saying you're going to a job interview I
 
01:39:46.729 --> 01:39:46.739 align:start position:0%
don't know what happens you know it's
 
01:39:49.850 --> 01:39:49.860 align:start position:0%
not for me to speak to that there may be
 
01:39:51.470 --> 01:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
some of that going on some forgiveness
 
01:39:54.649 --> 01:39:54.659 align:start position:0%
of you know imposing a fine
 
01:39:56.930 --> 01:39:56.940 align:start position:0%
um and obviously we had the speed limits
 
01:39:58.669 --> 01:39:58.679 align:start position:0%
increased up in the north country from
 
01:40:00.590 --> 01:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
you know 65 to 70. I think we saw a
 
01:40:02.390 --> 01:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
little bit of a difference in fines as a
 
01:40:04.370 --> 01:40:04.380 align:start position:0%
result of that change that happened a
 
01:40:06.470 --> 01:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
few years ago or 2017 whatever that was
 
01:40:09.110 --> 01:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:40:11.090 --> 01:40:11.100 align:start position:0%
other questions on this side uh
 
01:40:11.100 --> 01:40:13.310 align:start position:0%
other questions on this side uh
representative

01:40:13.310 --> 01:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:40:14.930 --> 01:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:40:16.970 --> 01:40:16.980 align:start position:0%
taking us question
 
01:40:16.980 --> 01:40:18.169 align:start position:0%
taking us question
um

01:40:18.169 --> 01:40:18.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:20.930 --> 01:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
I was just wondering if um maybe the
 
01:40:23.330 --> 01:40:23.340 align:start position:0%
increase in 2022 some of it might be
 
01:40:25.070 --> 01:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
from the fact that I know
 
01:40:27.470 --> 01:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
being a landlord myself and talking to
 
01:40:29.330 --> 01:40:29.340 align:start position:0%
other landlords they were frustrated for
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
a while that they couldn't bring you
 
01:40:32.750 --> 01:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
know tenant actions so there was a big
 
01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
backlog but in 2022 that backlog started
 
01:40:37.550 --> 01:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
breaking so I'm wondering if maybe that
 
01:40:41.810 --> 01:40:41.820 align:start position:0%
helped push up did you did you see a big
 
01:40:43.250 --> 01:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
increase in that category that might
 
01:40:45.950 --> 01:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
account for some of this
 
01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
we haven't looked at it to that level I
 
01:40:50.629 --> 01:40:50.639 align:start position:0%
believe we have the ability to do that
 
01:40:52.189 --> 01:40:52.199 align:start position:0%
so I would be happy to go back and
 
01:40:53.629 --> 01:40:53.639 align:start position:0%
research that if you would like that
 
01:40:53.639 --> 01:40:55.910 align:start position:0%
research that if you would like that
answer

01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:57.590 --> 01:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
that'd be great
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
I will say though I think and and it is
 
01:41:02.450 --> 01:41:02.460 align:start position:0%
it is going to take some time to see why
 
01:41:07.370 --> 01:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
we saw a rebound in FY 22 and then sort
 
01:41:09.470 --> 01:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
of this drop off I don't know if this is
 
01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:10.729 align:start position:0%
of this drop off I don't know if this is
just

01:41:10.729 --> 01:41:10.739 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:41:12.950 --> 01:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
um as Donna said the economy and then
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
multiple factors or and we're going to
 
01:41:17.870 --> 01:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
see that rebound but what you're seeing
 
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
here is as compared to FY 22 so prior to
 
01:41:23.149 --> 01:41:23.159 align:start position:0%
that we had a couple of years where you
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
know we were lower I think we definitely
 
01:41:29.510 --> 01:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
saw an increase in court activity in FY
 
01:41:31.970 --> 01:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
22 as we came out of that people were
 
01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
coming back to the courts the courts
 
01:41:36.229 --> 01:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
were operating in the way that they
 
01:41:38.330 --> 01:41:38.340 align:start position:0%
normally did so I think we saw an
 
01:41:39.709 --> 01:41:39.719 align:start position:0%
increase I'm not sure if it was just in
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:47.810 --> 01:41:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis
 
01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm just wondering what the chart
 
01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:55.320 align:start position:0%
might look like on page 10 if if it had
 
01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
gone back a couple more years so it was
 
01:42:00.290 --> 01:42:00.300 align:start position:0%
before covid
 
01:42:03.890 --> 01:42:03.900 align:start position:0%
did do you recall what that looks like I
 
01:42:05.270 --> 01:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
have those numbers I did not bring them
 
01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
to this presentation but yeah I have
 
01:42:08.570 --> 01:42:08.580 align:start position:0%
them going back quite a few years
 
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:16.550 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:42:16.550 --> 01:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:18.350 --> 01:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
trying to remember
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
I mean obviously 21 was not great
 
01:42:24.290 --> 01:42:24.300 align:start position:0%
um 20 wasn't I mean it was a deep cut at
 
01:42:26.990 --> 01:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
the last quarter of 20 as well if you
 
01:42:29.149 --> 01:42:29.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind why don't we why don't we
 
01:42:31.189 --> 01:42:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh request that if we could if you could
 
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
update that page 10
 
01:42:36.050 --> 01:42:36.060 align:start position:0%
um with a new one and go back how many
 
01:42:37.970 --> 01:42:37.980 align:start position:0%
years would we thinking
 
01:42:40.189 --> 01:42:40.199 align:start position:0%
I was just wanting to see what it looked
 
01:42:42.050 --> 01:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
like before covid right so maybe go back
 
01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
could you go back four years three four
 
01:42:47.649 --> 01:42:47.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:50.030 --> 01:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
I was going to say Donna did actually
 
01:42:52.010 --> 01:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
put that together so I have a
 
01:42:53.689 --> 01:42:53.699 align:start position:0%
perspective I think that's helpful going
 
01:42:56.209 --> 01:42:56.219 align:start position:0%
back to about 2015 and you really can
 
01:42:58.550 --> 01:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
see the impacts of statutory changes
 
01:43:01.010 --> 01:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
that are unrelated to the pandemic then
 
01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
you can see that's 2015 2017. then you
 
01:43:05.090 --> 01:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
can see
 
01:43:07.669 --> 01:43:07.679 align:start position:0%
um the the significant impact of the
 
01:43:10.129 --> 01:43:10.139 align:start position:0%
pandemic in 2020
 
01:43:12.770 --> 01:43:12.780 align:start position:0%
and and the downside and then this 22
 
01:43:14.629 --> 01:43:14.639 align:start position:0%
uptick so it's I think it would be
 
01:43:16.669 --> 01:43:16.679 align:start position:0%
really helpful to have I mean there were
 
01:43:18.290 --> 01:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
two things that come to mind that
 
01:43:20.330 --> 01:43:20.340 align:start position:0%
impacted it one was
 
01:43:22.609 --> 01:43:22.619 align:start position:0%
um there were eight case Types on the
 
01:43:24.830 --> 01:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
uniform fine schedule that safety puts
 
01:43:27.290 --> 01:43:27.300 align:start position:0%
out that went from um must appear to
 
01:43:29.810 --> 01:43:29.820 align:start position:0%
plea uh to plea by mail so hopefully the
 
01:43:31.850 --> 01:43:31.860 align:start position:0%
same amount of Revenue but you're seeing
 
01:43:33.709 --> 01:43:33.719 align:start position:0%
a decrease on the court side and an
 
01:43:35.209 --> 01:43:35.219 align:start position:0%
increase probably on the department of
 
01:43:36.590 --> 01:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
safety side because people can now do
 
01:43:38.810 --> 01:43:38.820 align:start position:0%
plea by mail for those the other thing
 
01:43:41.830 --> 01:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
was the decriminalization of marijuana
 
01:43:44.330 --> 01:43:44.340 align:start position:0%
that had about a seven hundred thousand
 
01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
dollar reduction to
 
01:43:49.609 --> 01:43:49.619 align:start position:0%
um what we collected in fines
 
01:43:52.430 --> 01:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
um going forward so
 
01:43:54.050 --> 01:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
uh I see your questions over here
 
01:43:55.850 --> 01:43:55.860 align:start position:0%
representative Platt yeah I did go back
 
01:43:59.570 --> 01:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
to uh 20 at least 2019 maybe 2018 2020
 
01:44:02.209 --> 01:44:02.219 align:start position:0%
is when covet hit almost died from it
 
01:44:04.609 --> 01:44:04.619 align:start position:0%
but it happened in 2020. yeah I was
 
01:44:06.830 --> 01:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
going to do fiscal year 17 and on
 
01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:09.709 align:start position:0%
going to do fiscal year 17 and on
so

01:44:09.709 --> 01:44:09.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:11.510 --> 01:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
and just a reminder folks we're going to
 
01:44:12.709 --> 01:44:12.719 align:start position:0%
be hearing from the Department of Safety
 
01:44:14.450 --> 01:44:14.460 align:start position:0%
a little bit later today so we can maybe
 
01:44:16.490 --> 01:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
ask them a few of these questions okay
 
01:44:18.890 --> 01:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
great thank you so much
 
01:44:23.209 --> 01:44:23.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
okay looks like we have the Lottery
 
01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:43.129 --> 01:44:43.139 align:start position:0%
okay we have Charlie McIntyre and James
 
01:44:46.250 --> 01:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
durris welcome
 
01:44:48.649 --> 01:44:48.659 align:start position:0%
as a reminder for the record I am a
 
01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
lottery licensee love a lot of their
 
01:44:59.090 --> 01:44:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:59.100 --> 01:45:03.169 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:45:03.169 --> 01:45:03.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:05.870 --> 01:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
um good morning uh Madam chair members
 
01:45:07.790 --> 01:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
of the Ways and Means Committee my name
 
01:45:10.250 --> 01:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
is Charlie McIntyre this says Charles
 
01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
only my mom calls me Charles
 
01:45:14.270 --> 01:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
um and with me is our Chief Financial
 
01:45:16.490 --> 01:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
Officer Jim Durst and I'll go through
 
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
the slides rather briefly Madam chair if
 
01:45:20.689 --> 01:45:20.699 align:start position:0%
please the commit committee and then
 
01:45:21.649 --> 01:45:21.659 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to answer questions
 
01:45:22.970 --> 01:45:22.980 align:start position:0%
remember Jim and I will answer questions
 
01:45:25.129 --> 01:45:25.139 align:start position:0%
afterwards the presentation was
 
01:45:27.129 --> 01:45:27.139 align:start position:0%
essentially to explain what it is we do
 
01:45:29.870 --> 01:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
and certainly this hopefully will at
 
01:45:31.490 --> 01:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
least start the process of explaining
 
01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
what does we do
 
01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:33.890 align:start position:0%
what does we do
um

01:45:33.890 --> 01:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:35.570 --> 01:45:35.580 align:start position:0%
so if you go to the first slide that's
 
01:45:36.649 --> 01:45:36.659 align:start position:0%
essentially a breakdown of our
 
01:45:38.330 --> 01:45:38.340 align:start position:0%
organizational chart
 
01:45:40.370 --> 01:45:40.380 align:start position:0%
of how the lottery is now situated we've
 
01:45:41.450 --> 01:45:41.460 align:start position:0%
gone through a number of organizational
 
01:45:44.149 --> 01:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
changes and we'll continue to do so as
 
01:45:48.169 --> 01:45:48.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:49.729 --> 01:45:49.739 align:start position:0%
obviously it's broken down in such a
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
three major components product and
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
program is really sales marketing
 
01:45:55.790 --> 01:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
and it's equivalent
 
01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:56.390 align:start position:0%
and it's equivalent
um

01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:58.129 --> 01:45:58.139 align:start position:0%
our chief compliance officer is the
 
01:45:59.450 --> 01:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
individual responsible for making sure
 
01:46:02.570 --> 01:46:02.580 align:start position:0%
both we and the retail retailers we
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
license and operate are in compliance
 
01:46:07.850 --> 01:46:07.860 align:start position:0%
with our rules regs and the law and
 
01:46:09.669 --> 01:46:09.679 align:start position:0%
operations is in charge of obviously
 
01:46:13.189 --> 01:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
maintaining the trains on time uh day to
 
01:46:16.010 --> 01:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:17.810 --> 01:46:17.820 align:start position:0%
we have three appointed Commissioners
 
01:46:19.669 --> 01:46:19.679 align:start position:0%
the lottery acts a little differently
 
01:46:21.169 --> 01:46:21.179 align:start position:0%
than most departments
 
01:46:22.850 --> 01:46:22.860 align:start position:0%
um we have three appointed Commissioners
 
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
who act like a board of directors who
 
01:46:27.290 --> 01:46:27.300 align:start position:0%
meet monthly to determine sort of core
 
01:46:29.810 --> 01:46:29.820 align:start position:0%
strategy long term very much like a
 
01:46:29.820 --> 01:46:34.970 align:start position:0%
strategy long term very much like a
corporation

01:46:34.970 --> 01:46:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
I'll go through sort of each product
 
01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:37.850 align:start position:0%
I'll go through sort of each product
category

Mega Millions was sold by some states
 
01:48:30.350 --> 01:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
and then they cross sold and they've
 
01:48:33.770 --> 01:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
been in existence for 15 years Lucky for
 
01:48:37.490 --> 01:48:37.500 align:start position:0%
Life was launched in 2014 I believe
 
01:48:39.530 --> 01:48:39.540 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry 2012.
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%

ilottery was launched the following year

ilottery was launched the following year
um

01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:17.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:20.570 --> 01:49:20.580 align:start position:0%

million
 
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
and then DraftKings was launched in 2019
 
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
our sports betting platform as our
 
01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:36.590 align:start position:0%

it's more of a we own the rights to it
 
01:49:41.450 --> 01:49:41.460 align:start position:0%
and DraftKings is our vendor we have a
 
01:49:42.770 --> 01:49:42.780 align:start position:0%
contract with them which is approved by
 
01:49:44.229 --> 01:49:44.239 align:start position:0%
the executive Council
 
01:49:46.609 --> 01:49:46.619 align:start position:0%
last year our profitability for that was
 
01:49:48.590 --> 01:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
23 million dollars
 
01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:49.370 align:start position:0%
23 million dollars
um

01:49:49.370 --> 01:49:49.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:51.169 --> 01:49:51.179 align:start position:0%
and uh something we're particularly
 
01:49:53.030 --> 01:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
proud of the next slide
 
01:49:56.570 --> 01:49:56.580 align:start position:0%
this is last fiscal years revenues by
 
01:49:59.510 --> 01:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
state what the state received New
 
01:50:01.010 --> 01:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was number two
 
01:50:03.770 --> 01:50:03.780 align:start position:0%
we received 23 million dollars for a per
 
01:50:07.490 --> 01:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
capita state revenue of 16.95
 
01:50:10.129 --> 01:50:10.139 align:start position:0%
that compares favorably with virtually
 
01:50:13.250 --> 01:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
everybody else and so we were able to
 
01:50:15.290 --> 01:50:15.300 align:start position:0%
retain the funds that other states gave
 
01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
away to others
 
01:50:19.129 --> 01:50:19.139 align:start position:0%
in some states you're talking two or
 
01:50:21.350 --> 01:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
three dollars uh the factor of eight to
 
01:50:23.689 --> 01:50:23.699 align:start position:0%
one versus other states
 
01:50:23.699 --> 01:50:24.470 align:start position:0%
one versus other states
um

01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:26.270 --> 01:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
the next slide is essentially sports
 
01:50:28.490 --> 01:50:28.500 align:start position:0%
betting since we launched
 
01:50:30.709 --> 01:50:30.719 align:start position:0%
um the first year was
 
01:50:33.669 --> 01:50:33.679 align:start position:0%
hampered significantly by covid
 
01:50:36.410 --> 01:50:36.420 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine in the summer of 20
 
01:50:38.090 --> 01:50:38.100 align:start position:0%
there was virtually nothing to bet on
 
01:50:40.490 --> 01:50:40.500 align:start position:0%
because there were no Sports we were
 
01:50:44.570 --> 01:50:44.580 align:start position:0%
taking action in burundian soccer and
 
01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
you know Russian table tennis I'm not
 
01:50:49.129 --> 01:50:49.139 align:start position:0%
kidding Russian table tennis at the time
 
01:50:50.930 --> 01:50:50.940 align:start position:0%
was our number one product
 
01:50:53.090 --> 01:50:53.100 align:start position:0%
and you will know that we banned Russian
 
01:50:55.490 --> 01:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
table tennis betting along with Russian
 
01:50:58.550 --> 01:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
vodka uh happened similarly
 
01:51:00.290 --> 01:51:00.300 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
01:51:01.729 --> 01:51:01.739 align:start position:0%
um we are one of the most profitable
 
01:51:03.109 --> 01:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions in the world for sports
 
01:51:04.609 --> 01:51:04.619 align:start position:0%
betting in terms of the for the state
 
01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
getting Revenue uh and New York is now
 
01:51:09.470 --> 01:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
number one and they copied us quite
 
01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
literally so
 
01:51:12.950 --> 01:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
um all that leads to my our next slide
 
01:51:15.590 --> 01:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
which is the which is my chief our chief
 
01:51:17.689 --> 01:51:17.699 align:start position:0%
financial officer's favorite Slide the
 
01:51:20.330 --> 01:51:20.340 align:start position:0%
distributions to education
 
01:51:22.490 --> 01:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
uh over the last 15 years you'll see
 
01:51:23.930 --> 01:51:23.940 align:start position:0%
significant growth
 
01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
what you will not see which is really
 
01:51:29.450 --> 01:51:29.460 align:start position:0%
what our CFO was most proud of is an
 
01:51:31.430 --> 01:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
increase in our administrative expenses
 
01:51:34.669 --> 01:51:34.679 align:start position:0%
that blue line is essentially flat year
 
01:51:36.410 --> 01:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
over year so that we've been able to
 
01:51:40.669 --> 01:51:40.679 align:start position:0%
grow revenue and not increase expenses
 
01:51:40.679 --> 01:51:41.870 align:start position:0%
grow revenue and not increase expenses
um

01:51:41.870 --> 01:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:43.370 --> 01:51:43.380 align:start position:0%
you know we run the lottery like a
 
01:51:44.990 --> 01:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
business very much so because that's how
 
01:51:46.490 --> 01:51:46.500 align:start position:0%
we're asked to do it to maximize Revenue
 
01:51:48.050 --> 01:51:48.060 align:start position:0%
in a responsible way so that's what we
 
01:51:48.060 --> 01:51:48.970 align:start position:0%
in a responsible way so that's what we
do

01:51:48.970 --> 01:51:48.980 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
and the suggestion would be is because
 
01:51:53.450 --> 01:51:53.460 align:start position:0%
we added all these products
 
01:51:55.970 --> 01:51:55.980 align:start position:0%
that's how we grew Revenue
 
01:51:57.709 --> 01:51:57.719 align:start position:0%
um I'm proud to announce that we're the
 
01:51:58.970 --> 01:51:58.980 align:start position:0%
number one jurisdiction in North America
 
01:52:01.729 --> 01:52:01.739 align:start position:0%
in Powerball sales per capita where the
 
01:52:02.990 --> 01:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
number one jurisdiction in North America
 
01:52:05.209 --> 01:52:05.219 align:start position:0%
for high lottery sales we're number two
 
01:52:06.770 --> 01:52:06.780 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction for Mega Million sales per
 
01:52:08.629 --> 01:52:08.639 align:start position:0%
capita we're the number two jurisdiction
 
01:52:11.390 --> 01:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
for Keno sales per capita and number two
 
01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
slash three for sports betting per
 
01:52:16.070 --> 01:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
capita so it's not just a matter of you
 
01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
added more stuff
 
01:52:19.550 --> 01:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
um we have done it really efficiently
 
01:52:22.430 --> 01:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
really effectively uh really well and
 
01:52:25.010 --> 01:52:25.020 align:start position:0%
we're super proud of that so the last
 
01:52:26.810 --> 01:52:26.820 align:start position:0%
slide I don't expect you to read and
 
01:52:29.109 --> 01:52:29.119 align:start position:0%
digest immediately it is essentially
 
01:52:31.070 --> 01:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
revenues expenses
 
01:52:32.330 --> 01:52:32.340 align:start position:0%
um changes in that position for the last
 
01:52:33.310 --> 01:52:33.320 align:start position:0%
10 years
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
and this is our this is our Bible this
 
01:52:38.330 --> 01:52:38.340 align:start position:0%
is our this is technically Gemini's
 
01:52:39.770 --> 01:52:39.780 align:start position:0%
report card
 
01:52:41.689 --> 01:52:41.699 align:start position:0%
um and this is also in our financial
 
01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
report available on our website
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
previously we used to send you folks a
 
01:52:47.149 --> 01:52:47.159 align:start position:0%
copy of that we got in trouble with
 
01:52:49.070 --> 01:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
admin services for making 400 copies of
 
01:52:50.870 --> 01:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
a document this big
 
01:52:52.310 --> 01:52:52.320 align:start position:0%
um so it's now available on our website
 
01:52:54.590 --> 01:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
to download or read it's very long I
 
01:52:56.930 --> 01:52:56.940 align:start position:0%
suggest not printing it at home
 
01:52:56.940 --> 01:52:57.950 align:start position:0%
suggest not printing it at home
um

01:52:57.950 --> 01:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:59.570 --> 01:52:59.580 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to be fast I know you folks
 
01:53:01.490 --> 01:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
are behind happy to answer any questions
 
01:53:03.770 --> 01:53:03.780 align:start position:0%
we do or what we do as to how we do it
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:09.250 --> 01:53:09.260 align:start position:0%
wow that was fast
 
01:53:11.390 --> 01:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
I see folks behind I don't know what I
 
01:53:14.510 --> 01:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
know sorry lunch is upon us right okay
 
01:53:15.770 --> 01:53:15.780 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna start over here questions
 
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative shamberg
 
01:53:20.629 --> 01:53:20.639 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:53:24.590 --> 01:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
Mr director uh just one question it has
 
01:53:25.910 --> 01:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
to do with equipment
 
01:53:28.010 --> 01:53:28.020 align:start position:0%
does the Lottery Commission do
 
01:53:30.590 --> 01:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
investment in equipment for the outlets
 
01:53:33.229 --> 01:53:33.239 align:start position:0%
without the cost to the store owner and
 
01:53:35.030 --> 01:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
the reason I bring this up is that it
 
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
seems that some of the places I stopped
 
01:53:40.129 --> 01:53:40.139 align:start position:0%
continually tell me we can't do your
 
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
ticket today or because
 
01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
we're shut down or something I don't
 
01:53:45.709 --> 01:53:45.719 align:start position:0%
know if there's a connection between
 
01:53:48.649 --> 01:53:48.659 align:start position:0%
that or something with the store
 
01:53:51.229 --> 01:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
um certainly when um the central system
 
01:53:54.169 --> 01:53:54.179 align:start position:0%
and the terminals that are at retail are
 
01:53:56.450 --> 01:53:56.460 align:start position:0%
part of an overall contract that we bid
 
01:53:58.850 --> 01:53:58.860 align:start position:0%
out for procurement and we're at the end
 
01:54:01.010 --> 01:54:01.020 align:start position:0%
of that contract
 
01:54:04.129 --> 01:54:04.139 align:start position:0%
um the capital expenses for that are
 
01:54:07.550 --> 01:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
extreme so we have to have a longer term
 
01:54:10.189 --> 01:54:10.199 align:start position:0%
contract than we'd ideally like because
 
01:54:10.199 --> 01:54:11.450 align:start position:0%
contract than we'd ideally like because
it's

01:54:11.450 --> 01:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:54:13.970 --> 01:54:13.980 align:start position:0%
essentially buying a computer at every
 
01:54:16.669 --> 01:54:16.679 align:start position:0%
terminal at every store
 
01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
buying a large terminal which holds the
 
01:54:22.570 --> 01:54:22.580 align:start position:0%
tickets you'll pass in a supermarket
 
01:54:26.330 --> 01:54:26.340 align:start position:0%
those collectively are like 17 18 000.
 
01:54:28.970 --> 01:54:28.980 align:start position:0%
a central system which costs Millions to
 
01:54:28.980 --> 01:54:29.810 align:start position:0%
a central system which costs Millions to
build

01:54:29.810 --> 01:54:29.820 align:start position:0%
build
 
01:54:31.850 --> 01:54:31.860 align:start position:0%
and three other duplicate locations
 
01:54:33.770 --> 01:54:33.780 align:start position:0%
which maintain our data so for example
 
01:54:35.930 --> 01:54:35.940 align:start position:0%
if you place a Powerball wager at your
 
01:54:38.330 --> 01:54:38.340 align:start position:0%
store that signal
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
if you can do it yeah that signal hits
 
01:54:43.430 --> 01:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
our Central system and our backup data
 
01:54:45.770 --> 01:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
center simultaneously that signal is
 
01:54:47.930 --> 01:54:47.940 align:start position:0%
then split and it goes to two separate
 
01:54:50.510 --> 01:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
systems which are called ICS
 
01:54:53.390 --> 01:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
it's it all all four low systems match
 
01:54:55.550 --> 01:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
the wager send it back through the
 
01:54:57.290 --> 01:54:57.300 align:start position:0%
communications Network which there are
 
01:54:58.790 --> 01:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
four Communications networks we support
 
01:55:01.010 --> 01:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
that has to occur under four seconds or
 
01:55:03.709 --> 01:55:03.719 align:start position:0%
less with an accuracy of 100 percent
 
01:55:05.930 --> 01:55:05.940 align:start position:0%
we do not have failures if it's a
 
01:55:08.450 --> 01:55:08.460 align:start position:0%
failure it's a non-ticket every drawing
 
01:55:10.189 --> 01:55:10.199 align:start position:0%
we have to balance every dollar and
 
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
every ticket we do not have errors uh in
 
01:55:15.050 --> 01:55:15.060 align:start position:0%
fact if we have an error the drawing is
 
01:55:17.209 --> 01:55:17.219 align:start position:0%
held back and that's across the nation
 
01:55:19.609 --> 01:55:19.619 align:start position:0%
every night so it's a it's a very
 
01:55:21.229 --> 01:55:21.239 align:start position:0%
complicated system because that all has
 
01:55:23.510 --> 01:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
to happen oh sorry in four seconds or
 
01:55:25.790 --> 01:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
less so we're end of life on the
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
technology we have in the field now and
 
01:55:29.149 --> 01:55:29.159 align:start position:0%
we're about to go out to bid for new
 
01:55:31.609 --> 01:55:31.619 align:start position:0%
technology and new investment of product
 
01:55:33.530 --> 01:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
and that that gets expensive as you can
 
01:55:33.540 --> 01:55:34.970 align:start position:0%
and that that gets expensive as you can
imagine

01:55:34.970 --> 01:55:34.980 align:start position:0%
imagine
 
01:55:38.209 --> 01:55:38.219 align:start position:0%
so it's one of those we we rely on a
 
01:55:40.669 --> 01:55:40.679 align:start position:0%
vendor oit could never do that are you
 
01:55:41.930 --> 01:55:41.940 align:start position:0%
telling me I should go to another store
 
01:55:44.149 --> 01:55:44.159 align:start position:0%
Yeah okay or actually actually more
 
01:55:46.010 --> 01:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
importantly you can use your phone
 
01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
I've tried that approach I'm not even
 
01:55:53.090 --> 01:55:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:54.830 --> 01:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
now I see a lot we'll start with this
 
01:55:57.050 --> 01:55:57.060 align:start position:0%
corner representative yes thank you I'm
 
01:55:59.149 --> 01:55:59.159 align:start position:0%
just looking at the last page here and
 
01:56:00.830 --> 01:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
it may just be my inability to
 
01:56:03.050 --> 01:56:03.060 align:start position:0%
understand what I'm reading here
 
01:56:05.209 --> 01:56:05.219 align:start position:0%
um the revenues expenses changes in net
 
01:56:08.090 --> 01:56:08.100 align:start position:0%
position for the last 10 years
 
01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
it is the net position I mean I'm
 
01:56:12.890 --> 01:56:12.900 align:start position:0%
looking with the parentheses around
 
01:56:15.470 --> 01:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
those bottom numbers I would it's not a
 
01:56:18.649 --> 01:56:18.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:20.810 --> 01:56:20.820 align:start position:0%
it is a negative number it's a retained
 
01:56:23.629 --> 01:56:23.639 align:start position:0%
earnings number okay all right all right
 
01:56:26.390 --> 01:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
all right here's that yep okay all right
 
01:56:28.490 --> 01:56:28.500 align:start position:0%
again it's just the change we have
 
01:56:30.530 --> 01:56:30.540 align:start position:0%
Holdings that are with uh muscle and
 
01:56:33.350 --> 01:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
Tri-State and and for uh
 
01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh inflows of Revenue or restricted
 
01:56:38.090 --> 01:56:38.100 align:start position:0%
funds excuse me and changes in that are
 
01:56:39.530 --> 01:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
generally what affect our net position
 
01:56:41.990 --> 01:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year okay uh this year
 
01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
was a little bit different which you'll
 
01:56:44.689 --> 01:56:44.699 align:start position:0%
see there was a little bit more of a
 
01:56:46.609 --> 01:56:46.619 align:start position:0%
change than normal but that goes back to
 
01:56:48.649 --> 01:56:48.659 align:start position:0%
the purchase of our building but that's
 
01:56:50.090 --> 01:56:50.100 align:start position:0%
generally the only thing that really
 
01:56:52.129 --> 01:56:52.139 align:start position:0%
affects that change so retained earnings
 
01:56:54.970 --> 01:56:54.980 align:start position:0%
would be inaccurate okay thank you
 
01:56:57.530 --> 01:56:57.540 align:start position:0%
representative fellows thank you madam
 
01:56:57.540 --> 01:56:58.250 align:start position:0%
representative fellows thank you madam
chair

01:56:58.250 --> 01:56:58.260 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:57:00.290 --> 01:57:00.300 align:start position:0%
um I was just looking through here and I
 
01:57:02.689 --> 01:57:02.699 align:start position:0%
don't see anything about
 
01:57:05.090 --> 01:57:05.100 align:start position:0%
um the current fiscal year to date or
 
01:57:08.629 --> 01:57:08.639 align:start position:0%
your estimate for the biennium okay
 
01:57:10.790 --> 01:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
um I wasn't I didn't know I was supposed
 
01:57:13.490 --> 01:57:13.500 align:start position:0%
to do that I happily to submit one
 
01:57:15.470 --> 01:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
um I mean certainly currently we are 21
 
01:57:17.209 --> 01:57:17.219 align:start position:0%
million I had a plan
 
01:57:19.490 --> 01:57:19.500 align:start position:0%
and our current plan is for 139 million
 
01:57:19.500 --> 01:57:23.169 align:start position:0%
and our current plan is for 139 million
dollars

01:57:23.169 --> 01:57:23.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:25.729 --> 01:57:25.739 align:start position:0%
so you know the red we've asked for
 
01:57:27.229 --> 01:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
these presentations at a high level
 
01:57:29.149 --> 01:57:29.159 align:start position:0%
overview some of them were able to
 
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
provide Revenue estimates already some
 
01:57:34.010 --> 01:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
are not able to uh we will begin more
 
01:57:38.109 --> 01:57:38.119 align:start position:0%
in-depth actual Revenue analysis on the
 
01:57:41.629 --> 01:57:41.639 align:start position:0%
22nd I think we decided of February
 
01:57:43.970 --> 01:57:43.980 align:start position:0%
because we do need to hear the budget's
 
01:57:45.890 --> 01:57:45.900 align:start position:0%
address at the budget address from the
 
01:57:48.169 --> 01:57:48.179 align:start position:0%
governor then it goes to finance and
 
01:57:49.550 --> 01:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
then we need a little bit of time to get
 
01:57:52.189 --> 01:57:52.199 align:start position:0%
it from lbao to us so there's a little
 
01:57:54.109 --> 01:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
bit of a delay there but I wanted to
 
01:57:55.910 --> 01:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
make sure you had a great high-level
 
01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
overview of what all these agencies do
 
01:58:03.050 --> 01:58:03.060 align:start position:0%
okay next representative self-worth
 
01:58:05.629 --> 01:58:05.639 align:start position:0%
thanks this is partly for later but um
 
01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
are you sensing I'd say stability uh in
 
01:58:09.950 --> 01:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
your older
 
01:58:12.350 --> 01:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
um items and then maybe room for growth
 
01:58:13.490 --> 01:58:13.500 align:start position:0%
in the newer things that you've just
 
01:58:13.500 --> 01:58:15.229 align:start position:0%
in the newer things that you've just
added

01:58:15.229 --> 01:58:15.239 align:start position:0%
added
 
01:58:15.239 --> 01:58:16.010 align:start position:0%
added
um

01:58:16.010 --> 01:58:16.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:18.050 --> 01:58:18.060 align:start position:0%
the short answer is yes the short answer
 
01:58:20.810 --> 01:58:20.820 align:start position:0%
is yes and yes with a caveat
 
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
we're still seeing
 
01:58:26.030 --> 01:58:26.040 align:start position:0%
sales growth in older products in new
 
01:58:27.770 --> 01:58:27.780 align:start position:0%
channels and what I mean by that is
 
01:58:30.050 --> 01:58:30.060 align:start position:0%
another Powerball is you're going to buy
 
01:58:32.209 --> 01:58:32.219 align:start position:0%
it through your phone no one fears a
 
01:58:35.270 --> 01:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:36.890 --> 01:58:36.900 align:start position:0%
um or Mega Millions ticket you can now
 
01:58:38.990 --> 01:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
buy it on a Friday use your phone use
 
01:58:40.490 --> 01:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
your computer and you don't have to go
 
01:58:42.229 --> 01:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
to a store and risk you know
 
01:58:44.510 --> 01:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
brisk it so the insurance but otherwise
 
01:58:46.729 --> 01:58:46.739 align:start position:0%
yes uh sports betting is continuing to
 
01:58:46.739 --> 01:58:47.750 align:start position:0%
yes uh sports betting is continuing to
grow

01:58:47.750 --> 01:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
grow
 
01:58:50.810 --> 01:58:50.820 align:start position:0%
um that may be impacted by masses launch
 
01:58:52.790 --> 01:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
this week retail and then mobile they
 
01:58:55.430 --> 01:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
launch in March but we'll know then you
 
01:58:59.209 --> 01:58:59.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:04.129 --> 01:59:04.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:04.139 --> 01:59:05.450 align:start position:0%
 
sure

01:59:05.450 --> 01:59:05.460 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:59:05.460 --> 01:59:08.870 align:start position:0%
sure
sorry

01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:11.750 --> 01:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
um do we have and you said that the
 
01:59:14.270 --> 01:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts going online with
 
01:59:18.950 --> 01:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
something may impact this on do we have
 
01:59:22.070 --> 01:59:22.080 align:start position:0%
an idea how many people were getting
 
01:59:24.649 --> 01:59:24.659 align:start position:0%
coming across the border to
 
01:59:28.669 --> 01:59:28.679 align:start position:0%
so for mobile we for mobile we do more
 
01:59:30.410 --> 01:59:30.420 align:start position:0%
actually than we do for retail mobile
 
01:59:33.470 --> 01:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
because you sign up with your phone you
 
01:59:34.850 --> 01:59:34.860 align:start position:0%
can sign up in Massachusetts but you
 
01:59:36.350 --> 01:59:36.360 align:start position:0%
have to be in physical locations New
 
01:59:38.570 --> 01:59:38.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire before you can bet so we know
 
01:59:40.550 --> 01:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
how many folks in Mass it's about 25
 
01:59:44.450 --> 01:59:44.460 align:start position:0%
percent a little more wow and so retail
 
01:59:47.270 --> 01:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
we don't specifically know because you
 
01:59:49.850 --> 01:59:49.860 align:start position:0%
can walk in about 100 and we wouldn't
 
01:59:52.129 --> 01:59:52.139 align:start position:0%
know who you were we would only know who
 
01:59:53.870 --> 01:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
you were if you bet above certain levels
 
01:59:57.290 --> 01:59:57.300 align:start position:0%
uh and you had to fill out paperwork
 
02:00:00.169 --> 02:00:00.179 align:start position:0%
yeah but we could lose a significant
 
02:00:02.570 --> 02:00:02.580 align:start position:0%
amount of money with yeah so certainly
 
02:00:05.750 --> 02:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's it's in play I mean
 
02:00:07.310 --> 02:00:07.320 align:start position:0%
that's a good question I don't know the
 
02:00:09.830 --> 02:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
answer yet I I was more fearful until I
 
02:00:12.169 --> 02:00:12.179 align:start position:0%
saw New York New Jersey when New York
 
02:00:13.609 --> 02:00:13.619 align:start position:0%
went live New Jersey thought it would
 
02:00:15.890 --> 02:00:15.900 align:start position:0%
lose a lot of Revenue it hasn't yet so
 
02:00:18.109 --> 02:00:18.119 align:start position:0%
I'm optimistic
 
02:00:19.609 --> 02:00:19.619 align:start position:0%
but but certainly it's in play
 
02:00:21.290 --> 02:00:21.300 align:start position:0%
representative it's a good question
 
02:00:26.149 --> 02:00:26.159 align:start position:0%
and if I could follow up what is the uh
 
02:00:28.970 --> 02:00:28.980 align:start position:0%
the general idea of how much it's going
 
02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
to cost you for Capital costs to do the
 
02:00:33.169 --> 02:00:33.179 align:start position:0%
new bid
 
02:00:36.709 --> 02:00:36.719 align:start position:0%
uh so our business how do you package
 
02:00:39.410 --> 02:00:39.420 align:start position:0%
that out over years yeah exactly so one
 
02:00:40.729 --> 02:00:40.739 align:start position:0%
of the reasons we do the bid for as long
 
02:00:42.530 --> 02:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
as we do is because the cap X costs are
 
02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
so high
 
02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:45.109 align:start position:0%
so high
um

02:00:45.109 --> 02:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:47.390 --> 02:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
but it's a part of a REV share model and
 
02:00:49.129 --> 02:00:49.139 align:start position:0%
so the contract is done based on a
 
02:00:50.990 --> 02:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
percentage of sales so our current
 
02:00:53.589 --> 02:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
platform is about
 
02:00:57.229 --> 02:00:57.239 align:start position:0%
1.9 cents per dollar estimating
 
02:00:59.570 --> 02:00:59.580 align:start position:0%
for sales of Lottery through terminals
 
02:01:01.370 --> 02:01:01.380 align:start position:0%
that's how the vendor gets paid
 
02:01:03.050 --> 02:01:03.060 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it's not a budget item if
 
02:01:05.750 --> 02:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's your question representative
 
02:01:09.890 --> 02:01:09.900 align:start position:0%
yes representative Platt yes I see the
 
02:01:12.229 --> 02:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
number of type different types of
 
02:01:16.010 --> 02:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
lottery games you have and be gamble if
 
02:01:18.589 --> 02:01:18.599 align:start position:0%
I pick the right one uh how do you you
 
02:01:20.930 --> 02:01:20.940 align:start position:0%
keep track of revenues by each I presume
 
02:01:23.689 --> 02:01:23.699 align:start position:0%
and would drop one that's lost its
 
02:01:23.699 --> 02:01:25.010 align:start position:0%
and would drop one that's lost its
popularity

02:01:25.010 --> 02:01:25.020 align:start position:0%
popularity
 
02:01:27.410 --> 02:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
yes and we have in the past there have
 
02:01:28.790 --> 02:01:28.800 align:start position:0%
been multiple certainly but during my
 
02:01:30.530 --> 02:01:30.540 align:start position:0%
tenure there's been multiple games we've
 
02:01:34.490 --> 02:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
dropped and changed to adapt
 
02:01:36.709 --> 02:01:36.719 align:start position:0%
fundamentally the the strategy of the
 
02:01:40.609 --> 02:01:40.619 align:start position:0%
last seven years has been to be additive
 
02:01:44.209 --> 02:01:44.219 align:start position:0%
for example Keno sales
 
02:01:45.950 --> 02:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
previously I was the general counsel of
 
02:01:46.970 --> 02:01:46.980 align:start position:0%
the Mass lottery
 
02:01:48.530 --> 02:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
about 20 million dollars in keynote
 
02:01:50.330 --> 02:01:50.340 align:start position:0%
sales was happening in Massachusetts by
 
02:01:52.189 --> 02:01:52.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens so a lot of the
 
02:01:54.229 --> 02:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
money that's Keno sales is money we just
 
02:01:54.239 --> 02:01:55.609 align:start position:0%
money that's Keno sales is money we just
repatriated

02:01:55.609 --> 02:01:55.619 align:start position:0%
repatriated
 
02:01:59.390 --> 02:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
similarly sports betting I I use a joke
 
02:02:00.950 --> 02:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
all the time but I guarantee you there
 
02:02:02.089 --> 02:02:02.099 align:start position:0%
were sports betting going on in the
 
02:02:05.390 --> 02:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
state before we legalized it uh and so
 
02:02:07.430 --> 02:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
as a former prosecutor of organized
 
02:02:09.410 --> 02:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
crime my friends in law enforcement tell
 
02:02:11.089 --> 02:02:11.099 align:start position:0%
me we have absolutely annihilated the
 
02:02:13.189 --> 02:02:13.199 align:start position:0%
bookmakers absolutely annihilated them
 
02:02:15.830 --> 02:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
because we offer a better product faster
 
02:02:18.649 --> 02:02:18.659 align:start position:0%
service government regulation guaranteed
 
02:02:20.450 --> 02:02:20.460 align:start position:0%
payouts at a product that is similar to
 
02:02:22.970 --> 02:02:22.980 align:start position:0%
the legal market and so
 
02:02:22.980 --> 02:02:24.169 align:start position:0%
the legal market and so
um

02:02:24.169 --> 02:02:24.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:25.970 --> 02:02:25.980 align:start position:0%
where it has made sense we have drop
 
02:02:28.490 --> 02:02:28.500 align:start position:0%
products and change or change them and
 
02:02:29.510 --> 02:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
where it has made sense we've added
 
02:02:31.629 --> 02:02:31.639 align:start position:0%
products that were not
 
02:02:34.370 --> 02:02:34.380 align:start position:0%
cannibalization it would be the correct
 
02:02:34.380 --> 02:02:37.490 align:start position:0%
cannibalization it would be the correct
term

02:02:37.490 --> 02:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:39.050 --> 02:02:39.060 align:start position:0%
all the questions on this side of the
 
02:02:39.060 --> 02:02:40.550 align:start position:0%
all the questions on this side of the
room

02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
room
 
02:02:43.250 --> 02:02:43.260 align:start position:0%
no back over here other questions
 
02:02:46.330 --> 02:02:46.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:49.189 --> 02:02:49.199 align:start position:0%
great thank you so much and uh we'll
 
02:02:50.750 --> 02:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
have you come back so if you can be
 
02:02:52.310 --> 02:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
prepared to bring your Revenue estimates
 
02:02:58.089 --> 02:02:58.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:00.709 --> 02:03:00.719 align:start position:0%
Chris Shea is with us he is the master
 
02:03:02.390 --> 02:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
of everything that we're doing now with
 
02:03:04.850 --> 02:03:04.860 align:start position:0%
revenues he is also coordinating the
 
02:03:07.550 --> 02:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
agendas for us and everything so big
 
02:03:09.490 --> 02:03:09.500 align:start position:0%
round of applause
 
02:03:11.950 --> 02:03:11.960 align:start position:0%
let me succeed first
 
02:03:15.470 --> 02:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to tell everybody that you
 
02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
have this the actor in front of you so
 
02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
that's the annual comprehensive
 
02:03:20.870 --> 02:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
financial report if you're really
 
02:03:23.149 --> 02:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
interested in it fiscal committee on
 
02:03:25.490 --> 02:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
Friday there's a presentation by the
 
02:03:27.410 --> 02:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
Auditors so it'll be in the afternoon at
 
02:03:30.290 --> 02:03:30.300 align:start position:0%
one o'clock it'll be streamed obviously
 
02:03:31.910 --> 02:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
so if you want to watch it you know this
 
02:03:33.709 --> 02:03:33.719 align:start position:0%
weekend when you have nothing else to do
 
02:03:36.410 --> 02:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
you're able to do that what I did want
 
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
to just point out to you is that on page
 
02:03:42.830 --> 02:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:45.530 --> 02:03:45.540 align:start position:0%
so that's a a table showing you all your
 
02:03:47.510 --> 02:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
unrestricted general fund and education
 
02:03:49.189 --> 02:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
trust fund revenues
 
02:03:50.870 --> 02:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
and it shows you what was collected in
 
02:03:52.250 --> 02:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20
 
02:03:56.089 --> 02:03:56.099 align:start position:0%
21 and 22 and then the last column shows
 
02:03:58.310 --> 02:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
you the combined plan so you can get a
 
02:03:59.450 --> 02:03:59.460 align:start position:0%
sense of
 
02:04:01.790 --> 02:04:01.800 align:start position:0%
where you came in with 22 and how did it
 
02:04:03.589 --> 02:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
compare to the plan that was in place
 
02:04:08.030 --> 02:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:10.729 --> 02:04:10.739 align:start position:0%
the other place I wanted to bring your
 
02:04:17.089 --> 02:04:17.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:19.970 --> 02:04:19.980 align:start position:0%
and that page is a 10-year history of
 
02:04:23.570 --> 02:04:23.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:25.129 --> 02:04:25.139 align:start position:0%
so if you just wanted to see how they
 
02:04:26.570 --> 02:04:26.580 align:start position:0%
were trending you could get a sense
 
02:04:26.580 --> 02:04:27.410 align:start position:0%
were trending you could get a sense
there

02:04:27.410 --> 02:04:27.420 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:04:29.510 --> 02:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
just keep in mind if you see big dips or
 
02:04:31.490 --> 02:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
or growths you may want to explore a
 
02:04:32.629 --> 02:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
little bit more to see why that might
 
02:04:34.010 --> 02:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
have occurred
 
02:04:35.510 --> 02:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:04:37.970 --> 02:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
um go to page 150 will be education
 
02:04:45.229 --> 02:04:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:46.850 --> 02:04:46.860 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more stuff in this report
 
02:04:48.290 --> 02:04:48.300 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted to draw this
 
02:04:49.490 --> 02:04:49.500 align:start position:0%
committee's attention to those three
 
02:04:49.500 --> 02:04:51.530 align:start position:0%
committee's attention to those three
places

02:04:51.530 --> 02:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
places
 
02:04:53.149 --> 02:04:53.159 align:start position:0%
um and just to make you aware that the
 
02:04:55.070 --> 02:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
audit presentation would be happening on
 
02:04:57.229 --> 02:04:57.239 align:start position:0%
Friday if anybody was interested in
 
02:05:01.250 --> 02:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
listening or attending or or
 
02:05:04.910 --> 02:05:04.920 align:start position:0%
excuse me uh Friday it's in room 210 and
 
02:05:08.870 --> 02:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:10.609 --> 02:05:10.619 align:start position:0%
um and as representative Sanborn had
 
02:05:12.290 --> 02:05:12.300 align:start position:0%
said um you know I'm in the process of
 
02:05:14.270 --> 02:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
trying to schedule reschedule your
 
02:05:15.830 --> 02:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
Monday I think we're going to be meeting
 
02:05:18.050 --> 02:05:18.060 align:start position:0%
on February 7th with those agencies that
 
02:05:20.750 --> 02:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
were scheduled for Monday
 
02:05:23.089 --> 02:05:23.099 align:start position:0%
um with the addition of Health and Human
 
02:05:25.910 --> 02:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
Services and the Department of Justice
 
02:05:27.410 --> 02:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice will talk to you
 
02:05:29.689 --> 02:05:29.699 align:start position:0%
about tobacco settlement and um
 
02:05:31.370 --> 02:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services we'll talk to
 
02:05:33.410 --> 02:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
you about recoveries
 
02:05:35.750 --> 02:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
I get to speak to you this afternoon in
 
02:05:38.350 --> 02:05:38.360 align:start position:0%
lieu of Health and Human Services
 
02:05:41.149 --> 02:05:41.159 align:start position:0%
unfortunately because of the delay some
 
02:05:42.770 --> 02:05:42.780 align:start position:0%
we weren't able to kind of I wasn't able
 
02:05:44.390 --> 02:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
to give you a kind of a
 
02:05:46.070 --> 02:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
here's what's going to what's to expect
 
02:05:48.290 --> 02:05:48.300 align:start position:0%
these few days and you got Charlie who
 
02:05:51.350 --> 02:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
didn't give you the 23 24 25 the
 
02:05:53.930 --> 02:05:53.940 align:start position:0%
presentation to the agencies was you're
 
02:05:57.589 --> 02:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
coming into explaining to the house Ways
 
02:05:59.270 --> 02:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
and Means Committee who you are and what
 
02:06:01.310 --> 02:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
types of revenues you collect we'll
 
02:06:03.530 --> 02:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
bring you back later if we need to as we
 
02:06:05.149 --> 02:06:05.159 align:start position:0%
need to to talk about your revenues
 
02:06:07.370 --> 02:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
knowing that some agencies as you've
 
02:06:09.770 --> 02:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
seen are providing you that 23 24 and
 
02:06:13.729 --> 02:06:13.739 align:start position:0%
25. if we had met on Monday dra would
 
02:06:15.109 --> 02:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
have just talked about the revenues that
 
02:06:15.950 --> 02:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
they collect but you wouldn't have
 
02:06:18.530 --> 02:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
gotten any estimates because
 
02:06:20.450 --> 02:06:20.460 align:start position:0%
we would like them to get their
 
02:06:22.550 --> 02:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
estimates you know close to the end of
 
02:06:24.169 --> 02:06:24.179 align:start position:0%
this month or estimate the end of
 
02:06:26.870 --> 02:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
February so you can see
 
02:06:28.370 --> 02:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
um a better sense of what the the
 
02:06:29.810 --> 02:06:29.820 align:start position:0%
revenues are as well as the governors
 
02:06:30.890 --> 02:06:30.900 align:start position:0%
would be out so you'd have an
 
02:06:32.510 --> 02:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
understanding when if you see a
 
02:06:34.370 --> 02:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
Governor's estimate in business taxes
 
02:06:36.350 --> 02:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
it's higher than you would have expected
 
02:06:38.270 --> 02:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
you could talk to dras to what might
 
02:06:40.550 --> 02:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
have caused that to occur because they
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
they're involved with that
 
02:06:45.470 --> 02:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
um but at 2 30 today when I get to speak
 
02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
I'll just kind of go through what my
 
02:06:48.229 --> 02:06:48.239 align:start position:0%
role will be with the committee some of
 
02:06:49.550 --> 02:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
you are familiar with that others may
 
02:06:50.990 --> 02:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
not know
 
02:06:52.189 --> 02:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
um but again I don't want to take away
 
02:06:53.330 --> 02:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
from your lunch but I just want to make
 
02:06:54.589 --> 02:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
sure everybody understood why this
 
02:06:56.510 --> 02:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
document was in front of you and a
 
02:06:58.669 --> 02:06:58.679 align:start position:0%
couple of key pages to look at if you
 
02:06:58.679 --> 02:06:59.450 align:start position:0%
couple of key pages to look at if you
wanted

02:06:59.450 --> 02:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
02:07:02.030 --> 02:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
thank you so much we will reconvene at
 
02:07:03.830 --> 02:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
one o'clock to continue presentations
 
02:07:05.930 --> 02:07:05.940 align:start position:0%
and then I'll give you another update on
 
02:16:29.629 --> 02:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:29.639 --> 03:01:57.490 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:01:57.490 --> 03:01:57.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:59.389 --> 03:01:59.399 align:start position:0%
especially since there may be some
 
03:02:03.590 --> 03:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:06.110 --> 03:02:06.120 align:start position:0%
welcome to rays and means uh we have
 
03:02:08.030 --> 03:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety Steve Lavoy and
 
03:02:09.410 --> 03:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
Scott Breyer here to give us a
 
03:02:14.990 --> 03:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:22.190 --> 03:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:24.050 --> 03:02:24.060 align:start position:0%
so good afternoon Madam chair members of
 
03:02:25.309 --> 03:02:25.319 align:start position:0%

director of administration for the
 
03:02:28.910 --> 03:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety and with me is

Scott Breyer who is the bureau chief of
 
03:02:32.809 --> 03:02:32.819 align:start position:0%
the road toll Bureau on the road till
 
03:02:34.429 --> 03:02:34.439 align:start position:0%
Bureau is what collects the state's gas
 
03:02:36.830 --> 03:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
tax for the highway fund so we'll be
 
03:02:39.889 --> 03:02:39.899 align:start position:0%
presenting today on our our Highway fund
 
03:02:42.710 --> 03:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
unrestricted Revenue collections I do
 
03:02:45.230 --> 03:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
have a one slide or two on General funds
 
03:02:46.550 --> 03:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
which are a very small portion of what
 
03:02:47.750 --> 03:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
we collect just for situational
 
03:02:49.429 --> 03:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
awareness but we'll go into a lot of
 
03:02:51.050 --> 03:02:51.060 align:start position:0%
detail about the highway fund portion
 
03:02:53.570 --> 03:02:53.580 align:start position:0%
which is predominantly road toll and DMV
 
03:02:56.269 --> 03:02:56.279 align:start position:0%
related Revenue collections so on your
 
03:02:59.030 --> 03:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
presentation on page two as a brief
 
03:03:00.889 --> 03:03:00.899 align:start position:0%
overview of the Department of Safety our
 
03:03:02.389 --> 03:03:02.399 align:start position:0%
vision is to make New Hampshire the
 
03:03:03.769 --> 03:03:03.779 align:start position:0%
safest state in the nation with the
 
03:03:06.050 --> 03:03:06.060 align:start position:0%
highest quality of life for all and our
 
03:03:07.730 --> 03:03:07.740 align:start position:0%
mission is to continually enhance the
 
03:03:09.650 --> 03:03:09.660 align:start position:0%
safety security and quality of life in
 
03:03:11.210 --> 03:03:11.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire through professional
 
03:03:13.070 --> 03:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
collaborative and Innovative service to
 
03:03:13.080 --> 03:03:14.210 align:start position:0%
collaborative and Innovative service to
all

03:03:14.210 --> 03:03:14.220 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:03:17.210 --> 03:03:17.220 align:start position:0%
we have seven divisions within the
 
03:03:18.950 --> 03:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
department of safety and also the office
 
03:03:20.210 --> 03:03:20.220 align:start position:0%
of the commissioner that provides
 
03:03:22.309 --> 03:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
overall leadership and support to all of
 
03:03:24.710 --> 03:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
those functions the seven divisions are
 
03:03:26.090 --> 03:03:26.100 align:start position:0%
listed here and as I mentioned the
 
03:03:27.590 --> 03:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
division of administration which is
 
03:03:30.050 --> 03:03:30.060 align:start position:0%
where the road toll Bureau sits and also
 
03:03:31.670 --> 03:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
the Division of Motor Vehicles are the
 
03:03:34.250 --> 03:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
two points of collection for Highway
 
03:03:36.889 --> 03:03:36.899 align:start position:0%
fund revenues
 
03:03:40.370 --> 03:03:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:42.889 --> 03:03:42.899 align:start position:0%
the two Revenue sources for unrestricted
 
03:03:44.630 --> 03:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
funding include Highway funds of
 
03:03:47.410 --> 03:03:47.420 align:start position:0%
approximately 258 million
 
03:03:49.790 --> 03:03:49.800 align:start position:0%
those funds are collected through road
 
03:03:52.010 --> 03:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
toll which is the state's gas tax Motor
 
03:03:54.650 --> 03:03:54.660 align:start position:0%
Vehicle registrations operate operators
 
03:03:57.050 --> 03:03:57.060 align:start position:0%
which is a driver license program motor
 
03:03:58.490 --> 03:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
vehicle certificates of title
 
03:03:59.750 --> 03:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
inspections and then there's
 
03:04:02.269 --> 03:04:02.279 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous revenues as well and there
 
03:04:03.769 --> 03:04:03.779 align:start position:0%
are some significant general fund
 
03:04:06.290 --> 03:04:06.300 align:start position:0%
resources Revenue sources of 9 million
 
03:04:08.389 --> 03:04:08.399 align:start position:0%
in total those are collected at the DMV
 
03:04:10.910 --> 03:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
admin and then also fire safety and
 
03:04:12.110 --> 03:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
State Police
 
03:04:14.269 --> 03:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
and there's uh those will go into a
 
03:04:15.290 --> 03:04:15.300 align:start position:0%
little bit of detail at the end of the
 
03:04:15.300 --> 03:04:16.490 align:start position:0%
little bit of detail at the end of the
presentation

03:04:16.490 --> 03:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
03:04:18.710 --> 03:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
so we'll start off with Highway funds if
 
03:04:22.610 --> 03:04:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:24.889 --> 03:04:24.899 align:start position:0%
total Highway funds collected in fiscal
 
03:04:28.730 --> 03:04:28.740 align:start position:0%
year 22 or 258.3 million
 
03:04:31.490 --> 03:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
and that amount was 7.4 million more
 
03:04:35.090 --> 03:04:35.100 align:start position:0%
than our plan of 250.9 million
 
03:04:37.630 --> 03:04:37.640 align:start position:0%
in FY 23 we're projecting to collect
 
03:04:40.190 --> 03:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
257.5 million in Highway fund Revenue
 
03:04:42.830 --> 03:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
which is about 4 million less than our
 
03:04:46.849 --> 03:04:46.859 align:start position:0%
plan of 253.5 million I'm sorry more
 
03:04:49.190 --> 03:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
than 253.5 million
 
03:04:49.200 --> 03:04:49.910 align:start position:0%
than 253.5 million
um

03:04:49.910 --> 03:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:52.130 --> 03:04:52.140 align:start position:0%
overall Highway fund revenues in general
 
03:04:55.370 --> 03:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
have increased at an annual rate of 1.2
 
03:04:59.210 --> 03:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
percent between FY 16 and FY 22. so
 
03:05:00.889 --> 03:05:00.899 align:start position:0%
really the increases in revenues have
 
03:05:02.570 --> 03:05:02.580 align:start position:0%
not kept pace with the increases in
 
03:05:04.389 --> 03:05:04.399 align:start position:0%
costs that those revenues support
 
03:05:06.530 --> 03:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
revenues in the highway fund support
 
03:05:08.530 --> 03:05:08.540 align:start position:0%
both the Department of Transportation
 
03:05:11.450 --> 03:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
work on New Hampshire's roads as well as
 
03:05:13.550 --> 03:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
the department of safety areas of state
 
03:05:15.650 --> 03:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
police commissioner's office some other
 
03:05:18.590 --> 03:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
areas as well so this has really created
 
03:05:20.389 --> 03:05:20.399 align:start position:0%
a structural deficit in the fund itself
 
03:05:22.309 --> 03:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
where the revenues aren't sufficient to
 
03:05:25.550 --> 03:05:25.560 align:start position:0%
meet the operating needs as intended in
 
03:05:27.769 --> 03:05:27.779 align:start position:0%
fact last biennium the legislature
 
03:05:29.269 --> 03:05:29.279 align:start position:0%
transferred 50 million dollars in
 
03:05:32.090 --> 03:05:32.100 align:start position:0%
general funds into the highway fund just
 
03:05:33.889 --> 03:05:33.899 align:start position:0%
to ensure that that fund could balance
 
03:05:36.650 --> 03:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
in the next in the next biennium so it's
 
03:05:39.530 --> 03:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
important to to note that the revenues
 
03:05:41.570 --> 03:05:41.580 align:start position:0%
are being collected but fees haven't
 
03:05:43.910 --> 03:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
increased in in some time and so the
 
03:05:47.690 --> 03:05:47.700 align:start position:0%
overall Revenue growth is um I mean less
 
03:05:49.070 --> 03:05:49.080 align:start position:0%
than one percent is not a significant
 
03:05:50.570 --> 03:05:50.580 align:start position:0%
growth area it's not keeping up with
 
03:05:50.580 --> 03:05:52.730 align:start position:0%
growth area it's not keeping up with
expenditures

03:05:52.730 --> 03:05:52.740 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
03:05:55.010 --> 03:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
next I'll turn it over to our bureau
 
03:05:56.750 --> 03:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
chief Scott Breyer to talk a little bit
 
03:05:58.690 --> 03:05:58.700 align:start position:0%
about road toll operations
 
03:06:01.849 --> 03:06:01.859 align:start position:0%
my name is Scott Breyer the road toll
 
03:06:03.469 --> 03:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
Bureau is stately responsible for
 
03:06:05.990 --> 03:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
collecting all the motor fuel tolls also
 
03:06:08.330 --> 03:06:08.340 align:start position:0%
known as the gas tax and we enforce
 
03:06:10.070 --> 03:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
compliance with a motor vehicle road
 
03:06:11.929 --> 03:06:11.939 align:start position:0%
toll law through its uh through our
 
03:06:13.670 --> 03:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
field audit Bureau
 
03:06:15.830 --> 03:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh the road toll are is not related to
 
03:06:17.630 --> 03:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
the toll booths on the turnpike system
 
03:06:19.490 --> 03:06:19.500 align:start position:0%
which are operated by the Department of
 
03:06:19.500 --> 03:06:20.990 align:start position:0%
which are operated by the Department of
Transportation

03:06:20.990 --> 03:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
Transportation
 
03:06:22.849 --> 03:06:22.859 align:start position:0%
so I just want to give you an idea of
 
03:06:24.950 --> 03:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
how many licensees we have we have about
 
03:06:27.710 --> 03:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
180 motor fuel distributors
 
03:06:31.450 --> 03:06:31.460 align:start position:0%
70 motor fuel transporter license and
 
03:06:34.910 --> 03:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
approximately I'll round it off to 1800
 
03:06:36.530 --> 03:06:36.540 align:start position:0%
international field tax agreement
 
03:06:40.670 --> 03:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
licensees and we also have about 246 oil
 
03:06:41.990 --> 03:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
discharge and Pollution Control
 
03:06:42.000 --> 03:06:43.490 align:start position:0%
discharge and Pollution Control
licensees

03:06:43.490 --> 03:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
licensees
 
03:06:45.710 --> 03:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
uh the oil discharge Pollution Control
 
03:06:47.630 --> 03:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
licensees we actually collect the
 
03:06:49.969 --> 03:06:49.979 align:start position:0%
environmental fees for the cleanup funds
 
03:06:52.269 --> 03:06:52.279 align:start position:0%
for Department of Environmental Services
 
03:06:55.309 --> 03:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
while we kind of do that in in
 
03:06:59.330 --> 03:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:59.340 --> 03:07:00.170 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:07:00.170 --> 03:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:03.830 --> 03:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
you turn over to the page seven I just
 
03:07:05.870 --> 03:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
this is kind of a
 
03:07:09.110 --> 03:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
a draw kind of a spreadsheet on how the
 
03:07:11.990 --> 03:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
Tax Works uh in New Hampshire appointed
 
03:07:14.570 --> 03:07:14.580 align:start position:0%
taxation for motor fuels uh is a
 
03:07:17.450 --> 03:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
distributor so those 180 Distributors
 
03:07:19.010 --> 03:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned on the previous page
 
03:07:22.070 --> 03:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
collect the bulk of the fuel tax so what
 
03:07:23.809 --> 03:07:23.819 align:start position:0%
happens is uh most of the fields coming
 
03:07:27.110 --> 03:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
in the State uh to uh barge fuel tank
 
03:07:29.929 --> 03:07:29.939 align:start position:0%
farms uh most of our gasoline actually
 
03:07:31.910 --> 03:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
comes in by truck out of Boston or the
 
03:07:33.410 --> 03:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
Portland area
 
03:07:35.750 --> 03:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
and then that goes to the terminal
 
03:07:37.849 --> 03:07:37.859 align:start position:0%
the terminals go down
 
03:07:39.889 --> 03:07:39.899 align:start position:0%
to a truck and then the truck delivers
 
03:07:42.889 --> 03:07:42.899 align:start position:0%
it so the difference with us is uh our
 
03:07:45.349 --> 03:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
tax is actually imposed right before it
 
03:07:47.870 --> 03:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
goes into retail station so that when
 
03:07:50.510 --> 03:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
you actually purchase your uh
 
03:07:52.309 --> 03:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
purchase your fuel at the retail station
 
03:07:55.550 --> 03:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
the taxes are already included
 
03:07:59.990 --> 03:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
and if you turn to page eight uh just
 
03:08:02.150 --> 03:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
put some together some factors uh
 
03:08:04.910 --> 03:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
impacting estimates for road toll
 
03:08:06.889 --> 03:08:06.899 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about price
 
03:08:09.410 --> 03:08:09.420 align:start position:0%
after reaching a high of almost five
 
03:08:13.610 --> 03:08:13.620 align:start position:0%
dollars a gallon on June of 22 gas
 
03:08:15.769 --> 03:08:15.779 align:start position:0%
prices have declined to stabilized
 
03:08:18.290 --> 03:08:18.300 align:start position:0%
according to AAA the average price per
 
03:08:22.309 --> 03:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
gallon in New Hampshire uh as of 124 is
 
03:08:26.210 --> 03:08:26.220 align:start position:0%
three dollars and 32 cents a gallon this
 
03:08:28.370 --> 03:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
is up fives about five cents from last
 
03:08:32.870 --> 03:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
year's average of uh 320 327.
 
03:08:35.510 --> 03:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh the U.S Energy Information forecast
 
03:08:37.910 --> 03:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
motor gasoline prices that declined to
 
03:08:41.450 --> 03:08:41.460 align:start position:0%
330 a gallon in 2023 and 310 a gallon in
 
03:08:41.460 --> 03:08:43.070 align:start position:0%
330 a gallon in 2023 and 310 a gallon in
2024.

03:08:43.070 --> 03:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
2024.
 
03:08:46.969 --> 03:08:46.979 align:start position:0%
uh the energy uh the Energy Information
 
03:08:49.130 --> 03:08:49.140 align:start position:0%
Administration also expects crude oil
 
03:08:52.309 --> 03:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
prices to average out about 83 dollars a
 
03:08:55.730 --> 03:08:55.740 align:start position:0%
barrel in both 2023 and fall to 78
 
03:08:59.690 --> 03:08:59.700 align:start position:0%
dollars a barrel in uh 2024. I want to
 
03:09:00.889 --> 03:09:00.899 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about the weather
 
03:09:03.050 --> 03:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
because that weather has an impact on
 
03:09:05.330 --> 03:09:05.340 align:start position:0%
our revenues also so if you've got like
 
03:09:07.969 --> 03:09:07.979 align:start position:0%
a dry dry sum isn't snow we went there's
 
03:09:09.710 --> 03:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
actually increases tourism in New
 
03:09:12.530 --> 03:09:12.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and result in increased fuel
 
03:09:12.540 --> 03:09:14.150 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and result in increased fuel
consumption

03:09:14.150 --> 03:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
consumption
 
03:09:17.769 --> 03:09:17.779 align:start position:0%
uh lack of snow until the other day
 
03:09:20.450 --> 03:09:20.460 align:start position:0%
in a warm temperatures Place pressure on
 
03:09:22.969 --> 03:09:22.979 align:start position:0%
the fuel consumption in the winter I
 
03:09:25.190 --> 03:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
think you might see revenues go up a
 
03:09:26.450 --> 03:09:26.460 align:start position:0%
little bit now that we got some more
 
03:09:26.460 --> 03:09:27.590 align:start position:0%
little bit now that we got some more
snow

03:09:27.590 --> 03:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
snow
 
03:09:30.469 --> 03:09:30.479 align:start position:0%
uh as far as the economy Youth
 
03:09:31.790 --> 03:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Commerce Bureau of
 
03:09:33.469 --> 03:09:33.479 align:start position:0%
economic analysis
 
03:09:36.530 --> 03:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
uh domestic gross product increased at
 
03:09:38.870 --> 03:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
an average of 3.2 percent in the third
 
03:09:41.809 --> 03:09:41.819 align:start position:0%
quarter of 2022 in the second quarter of
 
03:09:45.590 --> 03:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
2022 the real uh gross domestic product
 
03:09:49.670 --> 03:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
decreased at a rate of about 0.6 percent
 
03:09:52.010 --> 03:09:52.020 align:start position:0%
uh the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics
 
03:09:54.950 --> 03:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
reported that on January 12th that the
 
03:09:56.929 --> 03:09:56.939 align:start position:0%
Consumer Price Index for all items Rose
 
03:09:59.210 --> 03:09:59.220 align:start position:0%
about six and a half percent from
 
03:10:03.370 --> 03:10:03.380 align:start position:0%
December 2021 to December 2022 The cpin
 
03:10:05.630 --> 03:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
increased by seven percent between
 
03:10:10.130 --> 03:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
December 2020 and December 2021
 
03:10:12.110 --> 03:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
and now I'm going to turn it back over
 
03:10:15.410 --> 03:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
to director LaVoy
 
03:10:17.510 --> 03:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
so those three factors are really
 
03:10:20.570 --> 03:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
critical and one doesn't have any real
 
03:10:22.490 --> 03:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
priority over the other so typically if
 
03:10:25.190 --> 03:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
we see low prices the economy is doing
 
03:10:27.170 --> 03:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
well and the weather's great
 
03:10:29.450 --> 03:10:29.460 align:start position:0%
we've got a lot of consumption of fuel
 
03:10:31.370 --> 03:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
in the state a lot of Tourism dollars
 
03:10:32.570 --> 03:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
are coming in people are coming up into
 
03:10:34.969 --> 03:10:34.979 align:start position:0%
the state if one of those is off we
 
03:10:37.010 --> 03:10:37.020 align:start position:0%
start to see a decline it could be price
 
03:10:39.230 --> 03:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
it but the weather's great but the price
 
03:10:40.730 --> 03:10:40.740 align:start position:0%
is making people change their behaviors
 
03:10:42.170 --> 03:10:42.180 align:start position:0%
it could be the weather because people
 
03:10:44.030 --> 03:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
then aren't going to to come up for
 
03:10:45.170 --> 03:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
skiing they're not going to come up to
 
03:10:46.790 --> 03:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
the Lakes if it's been raining the
 
03:10:49.610 --> 03:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
entire time during the summer so right
 
03:10:51.290 --> 03:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
now we've got downward pressure really
 
03:10:55.130 --> 03:10:55.140 align:start position:0%
from all of those factors that being
 
03:10:59.570 --> 03:10:59.580 align:start position:0%
said we're not seeing a huge decrease in
 
03:11:01.490 --> 03:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
fuel consumption we're still recovering
 
03:11:04.849 --> 03:11:04.859 align:start position:0%
somewhat from the decline from covid and
 
03:11:06.889 --> 03:11:06.899 align:start position:0%
our projections as you can see really
 
03:11:09.950 --> 03:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
reflect conservative estimate that we're
 
03:11:11.929 --> 03:11:11.939 align:start position:0%
going to continue to get better even
 
03:11:13.969 --> 03:11:13.979 align:start position:0%
though there's downward pressure people
 
03:11:15.290 --> 03:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
are still visiting the state they're
 
03:11:17.690 --> 03:11:17.700 align:start position:0%
still consuming fuel so in fiscal year
 
03:11:21.530 --> 03:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
22 we collected 124 million in Road till
 
03:11:23.870 --> 03:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
revenues which was two percent more than
 
03:11:26.590 --> 03:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
our plan and we're projecting to collect
 
03:11:30.290 --> 03:11:30.300 align:start position:0%
124.3 million in revenues which is 2.5
 
03:11:33.710 --> 03:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
million more than our plan for FY 23.
 
03:11:36.950 --> 03:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
and FY 24 and 25 we're assuming an
 
03:11:39.550 --> 03:11:39.560 align:start position:0%
increase of half a percent in each year
 
03:11:41.750 --> 03:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
due to that downward pressure that we
 
03:11:43.429 --> 03:11:43.439 align:start position:0%
just talked about and kind of the slow
 
03:11:46.370 --> 03:11:46.380 align:start position:0%
and steady recovery to to pre-covered
 
03:11:49.370 --> 03:11:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:51.230 --> 03:11:51.240 align:start position:0%
any questions on road toll before we
 
03:11:53.269 --> 03:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
move on
 
03:11:54.950 --> 03:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
that's a great idea why don't we start
 
03:11:56.090 --> 03:11:56.100 align:start position:0%
at this end of the room we'll work our
 
03:12:01.190 --> 03:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:05.750 --> 03:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:08.870 --> 03:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
the highway fund just goes back there uh
 
03:12:12.530 --> 03:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
said fiscal year 22 your Highway fund
 
03:12:14.389 --> 03:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
Revenue was up
 
03:12:17.990 --> 03:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
by 7 million 7.4 million dollars and
 
03:12:20.590 --> 03:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
you're projecting it to actually be down
 
03:12:25.010 --> 03:12:25.020 align:start position:0%
uh for fiscal year 23.
 
03:12:25.020 --> 03:12:26.690 align:start position:0%
uh for fiscal year 23.
um

03:12:26.690 --> 03:12:26.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:28.910 --> 03:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
can you just
 
03:12:31.429 --> 03:12:31.439 align:start position:0%
get into a little bit why you you know
 
03:12:34.070 --> 03:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
why why you and maybe you did through
 
03:12:35.389 --> 03:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
those three points that you just
 
03:12:38.030 --> 03:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
discussed but a little more detail would
 
03:12:39.530 --> 03:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
be helpful as far as why we're
 
03:12:39.540 --> 03:12:41.330 align:start position:0%
be helpful as far as why we're
projecting

03:12:41.330 --> 03:12:41.340 align:start position:0%
projecting
 
03:12:44.330 --> 03:12:44.340 align:start position:0%
um the revenue to be two percent less
 
03:12:46.130 --> 03:12:46.140 align:start position:0%
than than the plan
 
03:12:47.990 --> 03:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
and so there's a number of factors there
 
03:12:50.150 --> 03:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
some some of them are DMV related
 
03:12:52.190 --> 03:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
revenues which we'll get into in the
 
03:12:53.570 --> 03:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
next section
 
03:12:56.750 --> 03:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
um in the DMV cycle we didn't see a
 
03:12:59.150 --> 03:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
significant decline in DMV related
 
03:13:01.490 --> 03:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
revenues due to covid because people
 
03:13:03.650 --> 03:13:03.660 align:start position:0%
still need to register their vehicles
 
03:13:05.750 --> 03:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
Drive their vehicles have access across
 
03:13:08.210 --> 03:13:08.220 align:start position:0%
the state but there was some pent-up
 
03:13:10.550 --> 03:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
demand that we experienced an increase
 
03:13:13.190 --> 03:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
that was higher than expected in 22 and
 
03:13:15.550 --> 03:13:15.560 align:start position:0%
so we expect 23 to level off slightly
 
03:13:19.010 --> 03:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
and be be back to the normal expected
 
03:13:22.269 --> 03:13:22.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:26.030 --> 03:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
I also like to mention it's not having a
 
03:13:28.429 --> 03:13:28.439 align:start position:0%
real significant impact but as warm more
 
03:13:30.349 --> 03:13:30.359 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles and these new heights
 
03:13:32.450 --> 03:13:32.460 align:start position:0%
going to start affecting the road so a
 
03:13:34.309 --> 03:13:34.319 align:start position:0%
little bit every year it's not a Major
 
03:13:36.769 --> 03:13:36.779 align:start position:0%
Impact yet but I was looking at some of
 
03:13:39.530 --> 03:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
the numbers in uh we're up over five to
 
03:13:41.090 --> 03:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
six thousand electric vehicles
 
03:13:43.610 --> 03:13:43.620 align:start position:0%
registered in the state previous year it
 
03:13:44.389 --> 03:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
was like
 
03:13:46.309 --> 03:13:46.319 align:start position:0%
I want to say between four and five so
 
03:13:49.309 --> 03:13:49.319 align:start position:0%
it's going up it's it's going up consist
 
03:13:51.590 --> 03:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
consistently every year for more and
 
03:13:52.849 --> 03:13:52.859 align:start position:0%
more electric vehicles are being
 
03:13:52.859 --> 03:13:54.769 align:start position:0%
more electric vehicles are being
registered

03:13:54.769 --> 03:13:54.779 align:start position:0%
registered
 
03:13:56.929 --> 03:13:56.939 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis thank you madam
 
03:13:56.939 --> 03:13:57.889 align:start position:0%
representative Phyllis thank you madam
chair

03:13:57.889 --> 03:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:14:02.389 --> 03:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
um so this is gas tax money but the
 
03:14:06.650 --> 03:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
titles call it toll road tolls so what
 
03:14:09.830 --> 03:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
happens to the money that's actually
 
03:14:11.990 --> 03:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
um either paid at the toll booth or or
 
03:14:14.110 --> 03:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
from the transponders
 
03:14:16.070 --> 03:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
registered by the Department of
 
03:14:18.769 --> 03:14:18.779 align:start position:0%
Transportation okay speaking after we do
 
03:14:21.530 --> 03:14:21.540 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and in New Hampshire
 
03:14:24.650 --> 03:14:24.660 align:start position:0%
what's unique is the um it's it's a road
 
03:14:26.929 --> 03:14:26.939 align:start position:0%
toll for the use of New Hampshire roads
 
03:14:29.990 --> 03:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a tax applied to the sale
 
03:14:32.330 --> 03:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
of gasoline and so we do have refunds
 
03:14:35.510 --> 03:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
for individuals who are putting gasoline
 
03:14:37.849 --> 03:14:37.859 align:start position:0%
in their vehicles or engines that are
 
03:14:39.769 --> 03:14:39.779 align:start position:0%
not using the roads not using the ways
 
03:14:41.750 --> 03:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
of the state and that's why it's a toll
 
03:14:44.870 --> 03:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
as opposed to a tax but the reality is
 
03:14:46.849 --> 03:14:46.859 align:start position:0%
it's the equivalent of a gas tax from
 
03:14:48.170 --> 03:14:48.180 align:start position:0%
other states
 
03:14:49.730 --> 03:14:49.740 align:start position:0%
right so if you have a boat and you put
 
03:14:51.710 --> 03:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
fuel in it you can get a refund on that
 
03:14:51.720 --> 03:14:55.130 align:start position:0%
fuel in it you can get a refund on that
tax

03:14:55.130 --> 03:14:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:56.570 --> 03:14:56.580 align:start position:0%
okay working around the room
 
03:14:59.870 --> 03:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:07.429 --> 03:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:13.610 --> 03:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
is when your truck gets to the retail
 
03:15:17.990 --> 03:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
outlet yes and you measure it based on
 
03:15:18.000 --> 03:15:19.309 align:start position:0%
outlet yes and you measure it based on
the

03:15:19.309 --> 03:15:19.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:15:22.610 --> 03:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
the measuring devices of that retail
 
03:15:22.620 --> 03:15:25.130 align:start position:0%
the measuring devices of that retail
outlet

03:15:25.130 --> 03:15:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:27.650 --> 03:15:27.660 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of a it's two there's
 
03:15:29.269 --> 03:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
actually a medium when it comes off the
 
03:15:29.279 --> 03:15:30.349 align:start position:0%
actually a medium when it comes off the
truck

03:15:30.349 --> 03:15:30.359 align:start position:0%
truck
 
03:15:32.510 --> 03:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
and there's also a Vita root usually
 
03:15:34.070 --> 03:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
that the retail stations that can tell
 
03:15:35.570 --> 03:15:35.580 align:start position:0%
how much is going in the tank to keep
 
03:15:39.050 --> 03:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
track of inventory but specific the
 
03:15:41.450 --> 03:15:41.460 align:start position:0%
taxes the person actually paying the tax
 
03:15:44.210 --> 03:15:44.220 align:start position:0%
is the distributor the truck you know
 
03:15:46.730 --> 03:15:46.740 align:start position:0%
the distributor that's uh hide the truck
 
03:15:49.130 --> 03:15:49.140 align:start position:0%
to deliver to the retail station
 
03:15:51.889 --> 03:15:51.899 align:start position:0%
so typically what will happen is the uh
 
03:15:54.769 --> 03:15:54.779 align:start position:0%
when the retail pays for the price per
 
03:15:56.990 --> 03:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
gallon uh that that New Hampshire tax
 
03:15:58.849 --> 03:15:58.859 align:start position:0%
rate is incorporated into that price
 
03:16:00.889 --> 03:16:00.899 align:start position:0%
sometimes they'll break it up and show
 
03:16:01.849 --> 03:16:01.859 align:start position:0%
it but
 
03:16:04.429 --> 03:16:04.439 align:start position:0%
typically that the price is incorporated
 
03:16:06.050 --> 03:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
into the price per gallon when they sell
 
03:16:08.210 --> 03:16:08.220 align:start position:0%
it to the retail
 
03:16:11.809 --> 03:16:11.819 align:start position:0%
so if I could follow up follow up I am
 
03:16:14.690 --> 03:16:14.700 align:start position:0%
asking this is that a fair number of
 
03:16:19.790 --> 03:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
years back now on the on
 
03:16:23.269 --> 03:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture weights and
 
03:16:26.570 --> 03:16:26.580 align:start position:0%
measures group on managed to convince
 
03:16:30.290 --> 03:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
the legislature to that it was a
 
03:16:33.230 --> 03:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest on
 
03:16:37.250 --> 03:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
for the consumer by that
 
03:16:42.590 --> 03:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
the owners of the gas stations or
 
03:16:45.410 --> 03:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
managers on
 
03:16:49.330 --> 03:16:49.340 align:start position:0%
hired the people that checked the
 
03:16:52.030 --> 03:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
accuracy of those meters
 
03:16:55.429 --> 03:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
and they collected the data for I think
 
03:16:58.130 --> 03:16:58.140 align:start position:0%
it was 14 months before another bill
 
03:17:00.710 --> 03:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
came in and they got closed down
 
03:17:03.950 --> 03:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
and what they found was that the large
 
03:17:06.530 --> 03:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
stations were
 
03:17:06.540 --> 03:17:07.429 align:start position:0%
stations were
um

03:17:07.429 --> 03:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:12.050 --> 03:17:12.060 align:start position:0%
providing less gas than what on they
 
03:17:14.889 --> 03:17:14.899 align:start position:0%
said they were providing and the small
 
03:17:17.929 --> 03:17:17.939 align:start position:0%
mom-and-pop stations were providing more
 
03:17:17.939 --> 03:17:19.130 align:start position:0%
mom-and-pop stations were providing more
gas

03:17:19.130 --> 03:17:19.140 align:start position:0%
gas
 
03:17:22.130 --> 03:17:22.140 align:start position:0%
on is there a question there yes the
 
03:17:23.750 --> 03:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
question is
 
03:17:23.760 --> 03:17:24.469 align:start position:0%
question is
um

03:17:24.469 --> 03:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:28.610 --> 03:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
who who inspects these meters
 
03:17:31.250 --> 03:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
that are tax is based on
 
03:17:33.469 --> 03:17:33.479 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert in that but I do know
 
03:17:36.290 --> 03:17:36.300 align:start position:0%
that the program isn't administered by
 
03:17:38.330 --> 03:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture awaits and
 
03:17:40.670 --> 03:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
measures Bureau it's still administered
 
03:17:42.170 --> 03:17:42.180 align:start position:0%
by them
 
03:17:43.849 --> 03:17:43.859 align:start position:0%
um I think it'd probably be better to
 
03:17:46.070 --> 03:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
talk to them with direct directly to get
 
03:17:48.290 --> 03:17:48.300 align:start position:0%
better information but I'm pretty sure
 
03:17:50.630 --> 03:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
that uh people go in there and they take
 
03:17:53.150 --> 03:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
you know they license these people to go
 
03:17:55.370 --> 03:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
out and inspect the pumps but I I would
 
03:17:56.990 --> 03:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
probably defer to them to get a better
 
03:18:00.290 --> 03:18:00.300 align:start position:0%
explanation thank you they told us that
 
03:18:00.300 --> 03:18:02.150 align:start position:0%
explanation thank you they told us that
on

03:18:02.150 --> 03:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:18:05.269 --> 03:18:05.279 align:start position:0%
I was there when they they passed the
 
03:18:07.130 --> 03:18:07.140 align:start position:0%
bill that was going to remove that
 
03:18:09.650 --> 03:18:09.660 align:start position:0%
Authority so
 
03:18:11.690 --> 03:18:11.700 align:start position:0%
okay other questions yes representative
 
03:18:15.290 --> 03:18:15.300 align:start position:0%
Platt I just found what the fee was 222.
 
03:18:19.070 --> 03:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
uh yeah and you see the 50 million
 
03:18:21.469 --> 03:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
dollar deficit uh that you're not
 
03:18:24.950 --> 03:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
covering uh the cost of uh you need 50
 
03:18:26.690 --> 03:18:26.700 align:start position:0%
million more you're taking from the
 
03:18:29.210 --> 03:18:29.220 align:start position:0%
general fund is that right I'll defread
 
03:18:31.849 --> 03:18:31.859 align:start position:0%
well Steve that was that was last
 
03:18:34.550 --> 03:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
biennium okay to make last biennium's
 
03:18:35.990 --> 03:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
budget uh balance through the highway
 
03:18:38.990 --> 03:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
fund all right so my mass tells me it
 
03:18:41.150 --> 03:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
would have to be 31 cents
 
03:18:44.210 --> 03:18:44.220 align:start position:0%
rather than 20 to 222 I'm not suggesting
 
03:18:46.730 --> 03:18:46.740 align:start position:0%
that because the whole infrastructure is
 
03:18:49.429 --> 03:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
changing with more electric and hybrid
 
03:18:51.050 --> 03:18:51.060 align:start position:0%
vehicles but that's what would have to
 
03:18:52.790 --> 03:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
be to break even
 
03:18:55.190 --> 03:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
in that root range there's a number of
 
03:18:56.990 --> 03:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
approaches so that if you're looking to
 
03:18:59.269 --> 03:18:59.279 align:start position:0%
only capture the deficit through the
 
03:19:00.650 --> 03:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
road toll
 
03:19:03.110 --> 03:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
um then then you would need to increase
 
03:19:05.389 --> 03:19:05.399 align:start position:0%
increase the gas tax but there's also
 
03:19:08.870 --> 03:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
fees that from the DMV that support the
 
03:19:11.269 --> 03:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
highway fund and and um to your point
 
03:19:14.230 --> 03:19:14.240 align:start position:0%
and to what Scott had mentioned the EV
 
03:19:17.870 --> 03:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
uh electric vehicles hybrid vehicles
 
03:19:19.429 --> 03:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
um determining if there's a way that
 
03:19:22.070 --> 03:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
they can contribute to the road toll
 
03:19:25.010 --> 03:19:25.020 align:start position:0%
um based on their usage as well and just
 
03:19:28.010 --> 03:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
to add to that uh I close my office
 
03:19:30.530 --> 03:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
collects approximately I want to say
 
03:19:34.730 --> 03:19:34.740 align:start position:0%
about 800 to 20 820 million gallons
 
03:19:37.010 --> 03:19:37.020 align:start position:0%
versus uh somewhere in that rate so
 
03:19:38.990 --> 03:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
basically for every penny of the road
 
03:19:41.269 --> 03:19:41.279 align:start position:0%
toll a penny will bring in just over
 
03:19:44.090 --> 03:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
eight million dollars with 15 uh 12
 
03:19:45.650 --> 03:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
percent of that going back to the local
 
03:19:56.090 --> 03:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:58.429 --> 03:19:58.439 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative all
 
03:20:02.210 --> 03:20:02.220 align:start position:0%
me thank you this is a very uh different
 
03:20:02.220 --> 03:20:03.769 align:start position:0%
me thank you this is a very uh different
question

03:20:03.769 --> 03:20:03.779 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:20:06.650 --> 03:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
um I was trying to estimate how much it
 
03:20:09.410 --> 03:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
would cost to rebuild our roads inside
 
03:20:13.250 --> 03:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
of my homeowners complex which I run and
 
03:20:15.889 --> 03:20:15.899 align:start position:0%
I found a federal index in the
 
03:20:19.429 --> 03:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
department of highways which uh for
 
03:20:21.590 --> 03:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
quite a few years now has been
 
03:20:24.590 --> 03:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
estimating the average cost of
 
03:20:24.600 --> 03:20:26.530 align:start position:0%
estimating the average cost of
rebuilding

03:20:26.530 --> 03:20:26.540 align:start position:0%
rebuilding
 
03:20:29.929 --> 03:20:29.939 align:start position:0%
roads and and bridges
 
03:20:33.650 --> 03:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
at various levels do you use that at all
 
03:20:33.660 --> 03:20:36.530 align:start position:0%
at various levels do you use that at all
to

03:20:36.530 --> 03:20:36.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:39.170 --> 03:20:39.180 align:start position:0%
or is that into that would be in in the
 
03:20:41.809 --> 03:20:41.819 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation sorry yes
 
03:20:43.730 --> 03:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
you collect the money and they and they
 
03:20:46.130 --> 03:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
build the rules right right sorry wrong
 
03:20:46.140 --> 03:20:48.889 align:start position:0%
build the rules right right sorry wrong
Department

03:20:48.889 --> 03:20:48.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:48.899 --> 03:20:50.570 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:20:50.570 --> 03:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:20:50.580 --> 03:20:53.150 align:start position:0%
yeah
yes

03:20:53.150 --> 03:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:54.349 --> 03:20:54.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:20:54.359 --> 03:20:55.490 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

03:20:55.490 --> 03:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:58.429 --> 03:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm interested in uh information
 
03:21:01.610 --> 03:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
about the electric vehicle or more
 
03:21:03.889 --> 03:21:03.899 align:start position:0%
broadly the more efficient hybrid to
 
03:21:06.050 --> 03:21:06.060 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle movement that's
 
03:21:09.050 --> 03:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
happening in our vehicles and you
 
03:21:13.370 --> 03:21:13.380 align:start position:0%
mentioned that as a a coming factor and
 
03:21:14.990 --> 03:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that you've done a fair amount
 
03:21:17.570 --> 03:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
of analysis on this partly in response
 
03:21:19.429 --> 03:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
to legislation that
 
03:21:22.370 --> 03:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
uh seeks to find some way of capturing
 
03:21:24.790 --> 03:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
the wear and tear that those vehicles
 
03:21:28.070 --> 03:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
are responsible for so I'm wondering if
 
03:21:31.130 --> 03:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
you have report a report on this issue
 
03:21:33.769 --> 03:21:33.779 align:start position:0%
that would be easy for you to provide to
 
03:21:35.690 --> 03:21:35.700 align:start position:0%
this committee so we can get a sort of
 
03:21:37.790 --> 03:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
better handle on where this might be
 
03:21:37.800 --> 03:21:44.630 align:start position:0%
better handle on where this might be
going

03:21:44.630 --> 03:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:47.690 --> 03:21:47.700 align:start position:0%
representative Majors had done numerous
 
03:21:50.929 --> 03:21:50.939 align:start position:0%
studies but I can tell you that
 
03:21:53.929 --> 03:21:53.939 align:start position:0%
approximately the average citizen pays
 
03:21:53.939 --> 03:21:54.610 align:start position:0%
approximately the average citizen pays
about

03:21:54.610 --> 03:21:54.620 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:21:59.090 --> 03:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
108 to 115 dollars a year in road toll
 
03:22:01.370 --> 03:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
so if somebody has a purely electric
 
03:22:01.380 --> 03:22:03.050 align:start position:0%
so if somebody has a purely electric
vehicle

03:22:03.050 --> 03:22:03.060 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
03:22:05.510 --> 03:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
that'd be about the month if if that was
 
03:22:07.070 --> 03:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
the equivalent if they paid the
 
03:22:09.769 --> 03:22:09.779 align:start position:0%
equivalent amounts it's about 108 to 115
 
03:22:15.469 --> 03:22:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:17.750 --> 03:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
and we'll be looking just to follow up
 
03:22:17.760 --> 03:22:19.130 align:start position:0%
and we'll be looking just to follow up
just

03:22:19.130 --> 03:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:22:21.410 --> 03:22:21.420 align:start position:0%
comment on that we'll we'll be losing
 
03:22:21.420 --> 03:22:22.309 align:start position:0%
comment on that we'll we'll be losing
that

03:22:22.309 --> 03:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:22:25.750 --> 03:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
each time an electric vehicle replaces a
 
03:22:28.550 --> 03:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
regular vehicle yeah because the
 
03:22:30.349 --> 03:22:30.359 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle is not using a
 
03:22:32.889 --> 03:22:32.899 align:start position:0%
petroleum-based product to fill up it
 
03:22:34.910 --> 03:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
obviously using electric
 
03:22:36.950 --> 03:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
ity yeah thank you do we have any idea
 
03:22:39.290 --> 03:22:39.300 align:start position:0%
at what rate that degradation is
 
03:22:40.550 --> 03:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
happening or are you saying we should
 
03:22:41.510 --> 03:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
check with
 
03:22:41.520 --> 03:22:43.910 align:start position:0%
check with
Dot

03:22:43.910 --> 03:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
Dot
 
03:22:47.269 --> 03:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
like how how how many people are we
 
03:22:49.790 --> 03:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
losing you know to electric vehicles I
 
03:22:51.950 --> 03:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
mean so the this is where it gets really
 
03:22:53.809 --> 03:22:53.819 align:start position:0%
challenging because Scott mentioned in
 
03:22:55.010 --> 03:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire there was
 
03:22:57.410 --> 03:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
what four thousand well right now
 
03:22:59.450 --> 03:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
looking at the numbers I got it from DMV
 
03:23:00.769 --> 03:23:00.779 align:start position:0%
because I was doing an analysis for
 
03:23:03.650 --> 03:23:03.660 align:start position:0%
another build but for it's a little it's
 
03:23:05.990 --> 03:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
getting close to 6 000 registered okay
 
03:23:08.510 --> 03:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
two five and six thousand so close to
 
03:23:10.610 --> 03:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
six thousand in New Hampshire
 
03:23:12.590 --> 03:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
um but a lot of our vehicle traffic is
 
03:23:14.809 --> 03:23:14.819 align:start position:0%
from out of state and so that's where
 
03:23:16.729 --> 03:23:16.739 align:start position:0%
some of the challenges come in the the
 
03:23:19.250 --> 03:23:19.260 align:start position:0%
6000 is not going to help us uh how do
 
03:23:20.870 --> 03:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
we capture
 
03:23:22.790 --> 03:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
um capture the people who are visiting
 
03:23:25.990 --> 03:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
and making sure that that those gasoline
 
03:23:28.550 --> 03:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
collection losses are recovered somehow
 
03:23:31.190 --> 03:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
right thank you uh let me go to
 
03:23:33.170 --> 03:23:33.180 align:start position:0%
representative roachford thank you Mr
 
03:23:35.630 --> 03:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
chair so with that could you just I mean
 
03:23:35.640 --> 03:23:36.950 align:start position:0%
chair so with that could you just I mean
conceivably

03:23:36.950 --> 03:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
conceivably
 
03:23:39.590 --> 03:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
we could study we know how many are in
 
03:23:43.250 --> 03:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
state we know it's about 120 115 a year
 
03:23:46.429 --> 03:23:46.439 align:start position:0%
I mean it's a fairly easy number to
 
03:23:48.830 --> 03:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
to to find out we could add that to like
 
03:23:51.250 --> 03:23:51.260 align:start position:0%
a registration fee well the
 
03:23:54.469 --> 03:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
someone who registers electric vehicle
 
03:23:57.290 --> 03:23:57.300 align:start position:0%
you'd pay an extra X number of dollars
 
03:23:59.210 --> 03:23:59.220 align:start position:0%
per year there's been there's been
 
03:24:01.010 --> 03:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
several bills over the last you know
 
03:24:03.050 --> 03:24:03.060 align:start position:0%
three to five years that have taken
 
03:24:05.150 --> 03:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
approaches similar to that
 
03:24:07.969 --> 03:24:07.979 align:start position:0%
um factoring in a full EV versus a
 
03:24:11.450 --> 03:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
hybrid and and prorating those amounts
 
03:24:15.229 --> 03:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
um and uh that's that that's one
 
03:24:16.849 --> 03:24:16.859 align:start position:0%
approach absolutely
 
03:24:19.250 --> 03:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
yes there have been a number of bills I
 
03:24:21.590 --> 03:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
don't think any one of them has uh stuck
 
03:24:24.410 --> 03:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
yet so but uh we certainly are trending
 
03:24:26.150 --> 03:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
towards the fact that we do need to do
 
03:24:29.450 --> 03:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
something representative Almy yeah just
 
03:24:32.450 --> 03:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
to add on to that first on I've had a
 
03:24:35.450 --> 03:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
hybrid for a long time it used to get 35
 
03:24:38.030 --> 03:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
miles per gallon in the winter it's now
 
03:24:39.950 --> 03:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
getting about 40. I don't know if that's
 
03:24:44.990 --> 03:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
because the winters are warmer but on so
 
03:24:48.050 --> 03:24:48.060 align:start position:0%
it's getting about twice what what our
 
03:24:50.389 --> 03:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
expectations used to be for what a car
 
03:24:50.399 --> 03:24:52.490 align:start position:0%
expectations used to be for what a car
did

03:24:52.490 --> 03:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
did
 
03:24:55.490 --> 03:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
um and it's just a hybrid so then there
 
03:24:57.349 --> 03:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
are a lot more hybrids than there are
 
03:24:59.330 --> 03:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles on the road at this
 
03:24:59.340 --> 03:25:00.530 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles on the road at this
point

03:25:00.530 --> 03:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
point
 
03:25:03.889 --> 03:25:03.899 align:start position:0%
um but on
 
03:25:06.889 --> 03:25:06.899 align:start position:0%
the the other piece of that
 
03:25:12.110 --> 03:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
was on there is a commission which is
 
03:25:15.349 --> 03:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
being reestablished which on
 
03:25:19.910 --> 03:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
ended last year too quickly on and to
 
03:25:22.330 --> 03:25:22.340 align:start position:0%
finish doing the analyzes about
 
03:25:25.849 --> 03:25:25.859 align:start position:0%
representative Majors work and hopefully
 
03:25:28.870 --> 03:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
finally come up with some kind of
 
03:25:32.510 --> 03:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
compromise between Public Works and
 
03:25:34.849 --> 03:25:34.859 align:start position:0%
the legislature that's that's a would
 
03:25:37.070 --> 03:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
you believe question okay I believe
 
03:25:41.150 --> 03:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
question representative Aras
 
03:25:43.130 --> 03:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
03:25:45.469 --> 03:25:45.479 align:start position:0%
my question so is there a possibility of
 
03:25:48.110 --> 03:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
we just uh putting a toll on the cars
 
03:25:50.330 --> 03:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
coming in from out of state
 
03:25:52.550 --> 03:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
especially electric vehicles I mean
 
03:25:55.190 --> 03:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
we're we're we're collecting a higher
 
03:25:55.200 --> 03:25:58.070 align:start position:0%
we're we're we're collecting a higher
toll

03:25:58.070 --> 03:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:01.010 --> 03:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
full premature but uh
 
03:26:05.330 --> 03:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
the department uh all the states and uh
 
03:26:07.849 --> 03:26:07.859 align:start position:0%
kind of a Canadian frog
 
03:26:07.859 --> 03:26:09.950 align:start position:0%
kind of a Canadian frog
yeah

03:26:09.950 --> 03:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:26:12.190 --> 03:26:12.200 align:start position:0%
the 48
 
03:26:14.389 --> 03:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
Continental contiguous states and
 
03:26:17.450 --> 03:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
Canadian provinces belong to a program
 
03:26:19.370 --> 03:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
called the international fuel tax
 
03:26:19.380 --> 03:26:20.690 align:start position:0%
called the international fuel tax
agreement

03:26:20.690 --> 03:26:20.700 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
03:26:23.929 --> 03:26:23.939 align:start position:0%
and right now if your vehicle's over 26
 
03:26:25.250 --> 03:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
000 pounds like a truck commercial
 
03:26:28.070 --> 03:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
trucks they have to report all that
 
03:26:30.769 --> 03:26:30.779 align:start position:0%
where they purchase all their fuel and
 
03:26:33.050 --> 03:26:33.060 align:start position:0%
where they drive they so our office
 
03:26:35.870 --> 03:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
takes all that information and puts it
 
03:26:38.090 --> 03:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
through the system and figures out how
 
03:26:39.710 --> 03:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
you know what we go to the other states
 
03:26:41.570 --> 03:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
with the other States owe to us so the
 
03:26:45.050 --> 03:26:45.060 align:start position:0%
Canadian provinces and I know that I'm
 
03:26:46.910 --> 03:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
very active in that I'm currently on the
 
03:26:48.710 --> 03:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
Board of Trustees for that organization
 
03:26:52.190 --> 03:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
and after trying to look at a way to
 
03:26:55.190 --> 03:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
take the if the model and bring it down
 
03:26:57.349 --> 03:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
to passenger vehicles but it's still
 
03:26:59.690 --> 03:26:59.700 align:start position:0%
very premature right now but because you
 
03:27:02.510 --> 03:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
got other issues like for example uh
 
03:27:04.309 --> 03:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
you got a lot of people that live in New
 
03:27:06.590 --> 03:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire travel to Boston every day and
 
03:27:08.870 --> 03:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
vice versa you got a ton of people in
 
03:27:10.729 --> 03:27:10.739 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts coming up here to stay for
 
03:27:13.429 --> 03:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
the weekend how do we capture the
 
03:27:15.349 --> 03:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
revenue on those Vehicles when they come
 
03:27:17.150 --> 03:27:17.160 align:start position:0%
from out of state or vice versa how does
 
03:27:19.070 --> 03:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts get their fish here for
 
03:27:20.389 --> 03:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
the people commuting down the Boston
 
03:27:22.490 --> 03:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
area every day to work
 
03:27:22.500 --> 03:27:24.110 align:start position:0%
area every day to work
yes

03:27:24.110 --> 03:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:27:26.330 --> 03:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
um any any other questions
 
03:27:29.929 --> 03:27:29.939 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none we will continue
 
03:27:31.610 --> 03:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time
 
03:27:33.950 --> 03:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
um I'll move rather quickly through the
 
03:27:36.469 --> 03:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
next section but please stop me at any
 
03:27:39.710 --> 03:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
point if you have any questions so DMV
 
03:27:41.630 --> 03:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
fees we talked about this a little bit
 
03:27:41.640 --> 03:27:42.490 align:start position:0%
fees we talked about this a little bit
already

03:27:42.490 --> 03:27:42.500 align:start position:0%
already
 
03:27:46.130 --> 03:27:46.140 align:start position:0%
DMV revenues that are collected uh don't
 
03:27:48.710 --> 03:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
experience a lot of change they're
 
03:27:51.349 --> 03:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
rather inelastic to price demand because
 
03:27:53.870 --> 03:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
we're we're a rural State there aren't a
 
03:27:56.570 --> 03:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
lot of public uh Transportation options
 
03:27:59.030 --> 03:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
for us people need vehicles to obtain
 
03:28:00.530 --> 03:28:00.540 align:start position:0%
goods and services and get to where they
 
03:28:03.650 --> 03:28:03.660 align:start position:0%
need to vehicle sales have been impacted
 
03:28:05.269 --> 03:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
due to lack of inventory over the last
 
03:28:06.550 --> 03:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
several years
 
03:28:09.889 --> 03:28:09.899 align:start position:0%
we're starting to see inventory levels
 
03:28:09.899 --> 03:28:10.969 align:start position:0%
we're starting to see inventory levels
um

03:28:10.969 --> 03:28:10.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:13.190 --> 03:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
be replenished so we should see some
 
03:28:15.290 --> 03:28:15.300 align:start position:0%
increased automobile sales over the next
 
03:28:18.349 --> 03:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
six to 12 months and there is some
 
03:28:21.349 --> 03:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
pent-up demand for vehicle purchases and
 
03:28:22.550 --> 03:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
so we think that's going to offset
 
03:28:24.110 --> 03:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
downward pressure from The increased
 
03:28:25.670 --> 03:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
pricing that we've seen and we spoke
 
03:28:27.889 --> 03:28:27.899 align:start position:0%
about earlier so we're expecting a
 
03:28:29.870 --> 03:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
slight positive impact on registration's
 
03:28:31.490 --> 03:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
title and inspection revenues moving
 
03:28:34.130 --> 03:28:34.140 align:start position:0%
forward so on page 11 Motor Vehicle
 
03:28:36.349 --> 03:28:36.359 align:start position:0%
Registration Revenue
 
03:28:39.469 --> 03:28:39.479 align:start position:0%
um in FY 22 we collected 90 million
 
03:28:41.870 --> 03:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
dollars which was 1.8 million over plan
 
03:28:45.710 --> 03:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
and 23 we're projecting to collect 89.2
 
03:28:48.710 --> 03:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
million which is 900 000 over plan and
 
03:28:50.389 --> 03:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
we're projecting to increase those
 
03:28:53.330 --> 03:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
revenues in 24 and 25 by about a half a
 
03:28:56.269 --> 03:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
percent so 89.7 and 90.1 million
 
03:28:58.010 --> 03:28:58.020 align:start position:0%
respectively and these are the
 
03:28:59.630 --> 03:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
registration fees that are collected on
 
03:29:01.490 --> 03:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
the state side of the equation there's
 
03:29:03.410 --> 03:29:03.420 align:start position:0%
still the local portion that's collected
 
03:29:05.389 --> 03:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
but this is the state share those go
 
03:29:07.550 --> 03:29:07.560 align:start position:0%
directly into the highway fund
 
03:29:10.130 --> 03:29:10.140 align:start position:0%
page 12 motor vehicle operators this is
 
03:29:12.590 --> 03:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
these are your licenses the key piece
 
03:29:14.269 --> 03:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
here to understand is that there's a
 
03:29:16.610 --> 03:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
five-year dip based on when the licenses
 
03:29:18.650 --> 03:29:18.660 align:start position:0%
uh changed from a four-year to a
 
03:29:20.450 --> 03:29:20.460 align:start position:0%
five-year license and so you see that in
 
03:29:23.450 --> 03:29:23.460 align:start position:0%
FY 16 and an FY 21 and you can see that
 
03:29:26.389 --> 03:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
dip over time is leveling off we're
 
03:29:27.950 --> 03:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
projecting that that dip will be
 
03:29:31.910 --> 03:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:35.389 --> 03:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
and so we will see that dip the next dip
 
03:29:38.690 --> 03:29:38.700 align:start position:0%
will occur in fiscal year 26. the other
 
03:29:40.309 --> 03:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
piece to understand is the real ID
 
03:29:42.229 --> 03:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
driver license requirements which keep
 
03:29:44.990 --> 03:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
getting delayed the most recent date is
 
03:29:48.170 --> 03:29:48.180 align:start position:0%
May 7th of 2025 and that's at that time
 
03:29:49.969 --> 03:29:49.979 align:start position:0%
a real ID will be required for any
 
03:29:53.389 --> 03:29:53.399 align:start position:0%
domestic air travel or to enter secure
 
03:29:55.309 --> 03:29:55.319 align:start position:0%
Federal facilities and so we do think
 
03:29:57.229 --> 03:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
that as that date gets closer we have
 
03:29:58.790 --> 03:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
some people who will be transitioning to
 
03:30:00.469 --> 03:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
the real ID piece so those
 
03:30:02.750 --> 03:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
considerations have been factored in and
 
03:30:05.870 --> 03:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
we're projecting just under 15 million
 
03:30:08.570 --> 03:30:08.580 align:start position:0%
to be collected in the next uh in 23 24
 
03:30:11.330 --> 03:30:11.340 align:start position:0%
and 25.
 
03:30:14.030 --> 03:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
on page 13 motor vehicle title revenues
 
03:30:16.490 --> 03:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
again relatively consistent across the
 
03:30:16.500 --> 03:30:17.590 align:start position:0%
again relatively consistent across the
board

03:30:17.590 --> 03:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
board
 
03:30:20.030 --> 03:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
we've got some slight increases that
 
03:30:22.849 --> 03:30:22.859 align:start position:0%
we're projecting in 24 and 25 a two
 
03:30:24.290 --> 03:30:24.300 align:start position:0%
percent increase and that's because of
 
03:30:25.790 --> 03:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
what we spoke about earlier with some
 
03:30:28.130 --> 03:30:28.140 align:start position:0%
inventories finally coming to be
 
03:30:29.870 --> 03:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
available for people to purchase and so
 
03:30:31.729 --> 03:30:31.739 align:start position:0%
there may be some new title processing
 
03:30:33.550 --> 03:30:33.560 align:start position:0%
that will be done associated with those
 
03:30:37.010 --> 03:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
with those transactions
 
03:30:41.570 --> 03:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:43.309 --> 03:30:43.319 align:start position:0%
another area that's that that's
 
03:30:45.229 --> 03:30:45.239 align:start position:0%
relatively consistent
 
03:30:47.090 --> 03:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
um we collect four million in one year
 
03:30:49.610 --> 03:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
3.9 in the next that's because of this
 
03:30:51.590 --> 03:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
station fee the inspection station fee
 
03:30:54.410 --> 03:30:54.420 align:start position:0%
uh it's a two-year fee that's collected
 
03:30:57.170 --> 03:30:57.180 align:start position:0%
and so you see that reflected in in the
 
03:30:57.180 --> 03:30:58.309 align:start position:0%
and so you see that reflected in in the
revenues

03:30:58.309 --> 03:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
03:31:01.370 --> 03:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
um throughout so no real changes here
 
03:31:02.630 --> 03:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
um the number of stations hasn't
 
03:31:04.550 --> 03:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
increased dramatically and the number of
 
03:31:07.070 --> 03:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
inspections hasn't either
 
03:31:09.650 --> 03:31:09.660 align:start position:0%
on page 15 this is the miscellaneous
 
03:31:11.570 --> 03:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle fees
 
03:31:13.429 --> 03:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
um what sticks out what you'll see is in
 
03:31:15.349 --> 03:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
starting in fiscal year 20 The Plea by
 
03:31:17.030 --> 03:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
mail revenues which used to go to the
 
03:31:18.650 --> 03:31:18.660 align:start position:0%
general fund are now being recorded in
 
03:31:21.170 --> 03:31:21.180 align:start position:0%
the highway fund and so that's helping
 
03:31:22.610 --> 03:31:22.620 align:start position:0%
to address some of that structural
 
03:31:24.670 --> 03:31:24.680 align:start position:0%
deficit that we talked about
 
03:31:27.290 --> 03:31:27.300 align:start position:0%
and in in general we don't see any
 
03:31:29.210 --> 03:31:29.220 align:start position:0%
significant Revenue growth opportunities
 
03:31:31.030 --> 03:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
here this is going to be Hold the Line
 
03:31:34.130 --> 03:31:34.140 align:start position:0%
similar collections that we've seen
 
03:31:36.229 --> 03:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
um coming out of covid where we'll have
 
03:31:39.710 --> 03:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
about 5.9 million in plea by mail about
 
03:31:43.849 --> 03:31:43.859 align:start position:0%
5.6 million in judicial motor vehicle
 
03:31:45.590 --> 03:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
fines collected by the judicial branch
 
03:31:47.990 --> 03:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
and then other motor vehicle fees of
 
03:31:51.469 --> 03:31:51.479 align:start position:0%
about 3.9 3.8 million
 
03:31:55.370 --> 03:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
uh and then lastly on page 17 uh is a
 
03:31:57.650 --> 03:31:57.660 align:start position:0%
brief summary of our general funds can I
 
03:31:59.630 --> 03:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
stop you for one second you have a
 
03:32:02.210 --> 03:32:02.220 align:start position:0%
question uh representative almond uh
 
03:32:06.170 --> 03:32:06.180 align:start position:0%
just very briefly play by mail and also
 
03:32:10.070 --> 03:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
what the courts uh have to adjudicate on
 
03:32:13.490 --> 03:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
and I've under for a long time we've
 
03:32:15.229 --> 03:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
been being told
 
03:32:18.830 --> 03:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh the state police are slowing down on
 
03:32:21.469 --> 03:32:21.479 align:start position:0%
tickets because it's a bad year and
 
03:32:23.389 --> 03:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
people and they're they don't want to
 
03:32:26.690 --> 03:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
hurt people or something like that and
 
03:32:29.990 --> 03:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
then they'll speed up again in doing
 
03:32:33.410 --> 03:32:33.420 align:start position:0%
tickets is that what happened in
 
03:32:33.420 --> 03:32:34.929 align:start position:0%
tickets is that what happened in
21

03:32:34.929 --> 03:32:34.939 align:start position:0%
21
 
03:32:37.969 --> 03:32:37.979 align:start position:0%
that they just dissect the state police
 
03:32:40.670 --> 03:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
were out there a lot more because
 
03:32:42.530 --> 03:32:42.540 align:start position:0%
people had been misbehaving in the
 
03:32:46.309 --> 03:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
pandemic yeah so um in 21 you started to
 
03:32:48.469 --> 03:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
see an increase in motor vehicle traffic
 
03:32:51.830 --> 03:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
coming out of the pandemic so a lot of
 
03:32:54.429 --> 03:32:54.439 align:start position:0%
people who were working from home
 
03:32:56.990 --> 03:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
quarantined those scenarios started to
 
03:32:58.969 --> 03:32:58.979 align:start position:0%
decline and so there was an uptick in
 
03:33:00.650 --> 03:33:00.660 align:start position:0%
traffic and so you saw an uptick in
 
03:33:03.590 --> 03:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement activities as well there is
 
03:33:06.410 --> 03:33:06.420 align:start position:0%
always that that question about
 
03:33:08.150 --> 03:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
um you know when the economic conditions
 
03:33:11.929 --> 03:33:11.939 align:start position:0%
are are challenging the courts the
 
03:33:13.849 --> 03:33:13.859 align:start position:0%
judges everyone involved sometimes will
 
03:33:17.510 --> 03:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
reduce penalties reduce fines and so
 
03:33:20.090 --> 03:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
there's some of that that likely may be
 
03:33:21.530 --> 03:33:21.540 align:start position:0%
going on but there's no way for us to
 
03:33:23.750 --> 03:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
really capture that level of information
 
03:33:26.870 --> 03:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
or just let them go with a warning
 
03:33:28.790 --> 03:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
do you push them
 
03:33:30.769 --> 03:33:30.779 align:start position:0%
do we push them
 
03:33:32.410 --> 03:33:32.420 align:start position:0%
to give more tickets
 
03:33:35.510 --> 03:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh no no
 
03:33:38.570 --> 03:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
little outside the purview
 
03:33:41.030 --> 03:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:33:43.370 --> 03:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
okay let's continue
 
03:33:46.309 --> 03:33:46.319 align:start position:0%
and so for General funds uh
 
03:33:47.870 --> 03:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
again this is really more for
 
03:33:50.809 --> 03:33:50.819 align:start position:0%
informational purposes uh not very much
 
03:33:52.729 --> 03:33:52.739 align:start position:0%
about 8 million that we collect each
 
03:33:55.130 --> 03:33:55.140 align:start position:0%
year it's gone down over time primarily
 
03:33:56.510 --> 03:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
because certain functions have
 
03:33:58.070 --> 03:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
transitioned out of the Department of
 
03:34:00.469 --> 03:34:00.479 align:start position:0%
Safety into other areas the biggest one
 
03:34:03.889 --> 03:34:03.899 align:start position:0%
being the mechanical licensing function
 
03:34:06.410 --> 03:34:06.420 align:start position:0%
which is uh now at the office of
 
03:34:08.150 --> 03:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
03:34:10.190 --> 03:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
and so those revenues traveled with that
 
03:34:12.229 --> 03:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
function as well
 
03:34:12.239 --> 03:34:13.010 align:start position:0%
function as well
um

03:34:13.010 --> 03:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:15.050 --> 03:34:15.060 align:start position:0%
page 18 provides a little bit of summary
 
03:34:17.210 --> 03:34:17.220 align:start position:0%
on the key areas the initial license and
 
03:34:19.150 --> 03:34:19.160 align:start position:0%
vanity plate fees that are collected
 
03:34:21.889 --> 03:34:21.899 align:start position:0%
those revenues are con projected to
 
03:34:24.309 --> 03:34:24.319 align:start position:0%
remain consistent the penalty assessment
 
03:34:27.530 --> 03:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
that's levied at the courts that's a two
 
03:34:29.150 --> 03:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
dollars or twenty four percent whichever
 
03:34:31.550 --> 03:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
is greater on each finer penalty so
 
03:34:33.050 --> 03:34:33.060 align:start position:0%
we're showing the general fund portion
 
03:34:34.429 --> 03:34:34.439 align:start position:0%
there but there's revenues that support
 
03:34:36.290 --> 03:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
the victims assistance fund and then the
 
03:34:38.090 --> 03:34:38.100 align:start position:0%
judicial branch Information Technology
 
03:34:40.490 --> 03:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
fund and then permits and Licensing has
 
03:34:43.550 --> 03:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
decreased steadily over time that's a
 
03:34:45.290 --> 03:34:45.300 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars for non-resident pistol
 
03:34:47.510 --> 03:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
license fees which was a significant
 
03:34:51.889 --> 03:34:51.899 align:start position:0%
Revenue Source but as reciprocity a lot
 
03:34:53.570 --> 03:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
of individuals who have the ability to
 
03:34:55.490 --> 03:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
get an out-of-state permit have already
 
03:34:57.290 --> 03:34:57.300 align:start position:0%
received it and so we're seeing demand
 
03:35:01.130 --> 03:35:01.140 align:start position:0%
for that continue to decline over time
 
03:35:05.090 --> 03:35:05.100 align:start position:0%
uh and on the very last page we have a
 
03:35:07.550 --> 03:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
summary of the highway fund revenues uh
 
03:35:10.790 --> 03:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
over the last 10 years by Source type
 
03:35:12.590 --> 03:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
um I know that the committee often likes
 
03:35:15.290 --> 03:35:15.300 align:start position:0%
to work from documents like this so
 
03:35:18.469 --> 03:35:18.479 align:start position:0%
that's for your use moving forward
 
03:35:19.969 --> 03:35:19.979 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any additional
 
03:35:19.979 --> 03:35:20.990 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any additional
questions

03:35:20.990 --> 03:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:35:22.929 --> 03:35:22.939 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:35:25.070 --> 03:35:25.080 align:start position:0%
representative Platt
 
03:35:27.410 --> 03:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
new Merchant fees is that something you
 
03:35:29.870 --> 03:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
have the ability to set such as Affinity
 
03:35:32.690 --> 03:35:32.700 align:start position:0%
plate fee or is that incorporated into
 
03:35:32.700 --> 03:35:34.370 align:start position:0%
plate fee or is that incorporated into
law

03:35:34.370 --> 03:35:34.380 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:35:37.010 --> 03:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
um it depends on the fee itself so the
 
03:35:40.250 --> 03:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
vanity plate fees are in statute there's
 
03:35:42.349 --> 03:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
some fees that are in administrative
 
03:35:42.359 --> 03:35:43.610 align:start position:0%
some fees that are in administrative
rule

03:35:43.610 --> 03:35:43.620 align:start position:0%
rule
 
03:35:45.710 --> 03:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
um so whether it's administrative rule
 
03:35:47.990 --> 03:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
or statute there's always involvement of
 
03:35:52.630 --> 03:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:56.150 --> 03:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative roachford yes thank you
 
03:35:56.160 --> 03:35:57.710 align:start position:0%
representative roachford yes thank you
um

03:35:57.710 --> 03:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:59.870 --> 03:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
just to go back here a little bit to
 
03:36:01.550 --> 03:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
understand a little bit about the
 
03:36:03.650 --> 03:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
department uh
 
03:36:05.330 --> 03:36:05.340 align:start position:0%
well first of all I'm happy to give
 
03:36:07.790 --> 03:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
warnings out around Plymouth exit 25 so
 
03:36:09.710 --> 03:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
I'll take those warnings every time they
 
03:36:11.110 --> 03:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
give them to me so
 
03:36:13.429 --> 03:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
so you can pass that along keep doing
 
03:36:15.170 --> 03:36:15.180 align:start position:0%
keep up the good work
 
03:36:18.530 --> 03:36:18.540 align:start position:0%
um just I just want to understand uh so
 
03:36:21.889 --> 03:36:21.899 align:start position:0%
I again this is very a rudimentary
 
03:36:21.899 --> 03:36:22.910 align:start position:0%
I again this is very a rudimentary
question

03:36:22.910 --> 03:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:36:27.050 --> 03:36:27.060 align:start position:0%
understanding that uh your department is
 
03:36:27.060 --> 03:36:28.510 align:start position:0%
understanding that uh your department is
um

03:36:28.510 --> 03:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:31.010 --> 03:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles Administration State
 
03:36:32.330 --> 03:36:32.340 align:start position:0%
Police Homeland Security and then I'm
 
03:36:35.570 --> 03:36:35.580 align:start position:0%
looking back on five as far as the the
 
03:36:38.510 --> 03:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
the total Highway fund revenues remain
 
03:36:40.610 --> 03:36:40.620 align:start position:0%
relatively fat flat leading to a
 
03:36:42.110 --> 03:36:42.120 align:start position:0%
structural deficit within the highway
 
03:36:45.950 --> 03:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
fund due to regular increases associated
 
03:36:47.929 --> 03:36:47.939 align:start position:0%
in the costs associated with road
 
03:36:50.030 --> 03:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
maintenance so are you guys doing the
 
03:36:51.170 --> 03:36:51.180 align:start position:0%

orientation an overview of the D.O.T and
 
03:39:00.229 --> 03:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
a little discussion of the very small
 
03:39:03.170 --> 03:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
amount of Highway fund Revenue that that
 
03:39:06.769 --> 03:39:06.779 align:start position:0%

of our organizational structure
 
03:40:14.389 --> 03:40:14.399 align:start position:0%
so in our Commissioner's Office it's
 
03:40:16.210 --> 03:40:16.220 align:start position:0%
myself and the two
 
03:40:18.769 --> 03:40:18.779 align:start position:0%
other Commissioners assistant and Deputy
 
03:40:21.769 --> 03:40:21.779 align:start position:0%
Commissioner we oversee five divisions
 
03:40:23.269 --> 03:40:23.279 align:start position:0%
within the department so the assistant
 
03:40:25.849 --> 03:40:25.859 align:start position:0%
commissioner Dave to my left generally
 
03:40:28.370 --> 03:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
oversees all of the operational aspects
 
03:40:31.670 --> 03:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
that's uh project development the group
 
03:40:34.190 --> 03:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
that administers and does all the
 
03:40:36.769 --> 03:40:36.779 align:start position:0%
transportation projects
 
03:40:40.210 --> 03:40:40.220 align:start position:0%
plans builds designs constructs
 
03:40:42.050 --> 03:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
requires the right-of-way and things
 
03:40:44.150 --> 03:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
like that as well as all of the
 
03:40:48.590 --> 03:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
operational aspects in maintaining the
 
03:40:50.269 --> 03:40:50.279 align:start position:0%
um the highway and I see it's starting
 
03:40:53.030 --> 03:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
to snow now so our folks will be out all
 
03:40:54.290 --> 03:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
night tonight
 
03:40:56.210 --> 03:40:56.220 align:start position:0%
um taking care of maintaining the
 
03:40:58.969 --> 03:40:58.979 align:start position:0%
highways on the administration side on
 
03:41:01.130 --> 03:41:01.140 align:start position:0%
the deputy commission aside he oversees
 
03:41:03.950 --> 03:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of the uh more kind of the Chief
 
03:41:06.830 --> 03:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer and overseeing
 
03:41:09.070 --> 03:41:09.080 align:start position:0%
um you know kind of the non-highway
 
03:41:12.290 --> 03:41:12.300 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so he's overseas Finance
 
03:41:16.070 --> 03:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
all the policy and administration HR and
 
03:41:19.010 --> 03:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
some of our labor compliance bureaus as
 
03:41:23.330 --> 03:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
well as the division of Aeronautics Rail
 
03:41:25.370 --> 03:41:25.380 align:start position:0%
and Transit
 
03:41:25.380 --> 03:41:26.510 align:start position:0%
and Transit
um

03:41:26.510 --> 03:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:28.790 --> 03:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
so some very quick facts just to give a
 
03:41:31.429 --> 03:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
quick size and uh overview of the dot so
 
03:41:33.969 --> 03:41:33.979 align:start position:0%
we have about 1650
 
03:41:37.010 --> 03:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
permanent positions
 
03:41:37.020 --> 03:41:37.969 align:start position:0%
permanent positions
um

03:41:37.969 --> 03:41:37.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:43.330 --> 03:41:43.340 align:start position:0%
we maintain and oversee 21 about 2150
 
03:41:47.570 --> 03:41:47.580 align:start position:0%
2159 State Bridges we've talked a lot
 
03:41:49.429 --> 03:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
about redless bridges which are
 
03:41:51.290 --> 03:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
structurally deficient Bridges and that
 
03:41:54.469 --> 03:41:54.479 align:start position:0%
redless count is at 114.
 
03:41:56.809 --> 03:41:56.819 align:start position:0%
um that number has been driven down over
 
03:41:58.610 --> 03:41:58.620 align:start position:0%
the years we continue to focus our
 
03:42:00.349 --> 03:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
efforts on preservation and maintenance
 
03:42:03.130 --> 03:42:03.140 align:start position:0%
of the existing infrastructures first
 
03:42:06.969 --> 03:42:06.979 align:start position:0%
and that red list Bridge number
 
03:42:09.769 --> 03:42:09.779 align:start position:0%
is indicative of of that as we continue
 
03:42:13.070 --> 03:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
to drive that number down we also have
 
03:42:15.769 --> 03:42:15.779 align:start position:0%
Administration in a way over the
 
03:42:18.729 --> 03:42:18.739 align:start position:0%
approximately 1700 Municipal Bridges
 
03:42:21.830 --> 03:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
even though those are Town owned Bridges
 
03:42:24.590 --> 03:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh the state of New Hampshire State you
 
03:42:25.729 --> 03:42:25.739 align:start position:0%
know the New Hampshire dot is
 
03:42:27.530 --> 03:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
responsible for inspecting all of the
 
03:42:29.269 --> 03:42:29.279 align:start position:0%
bridges in the state so all of the state
 
03:42:31.309 --> 03:42:31.319 align:start position:0%
and all of the municipal Bridges get
 
03:42:34.429 --> 03:42:34.439 align:start position:0%
inspected by dot Personnel usually twice
 
03:42:36.469 --> 03:42:36.479 align:start position:0%
a year I mean usually once every two
 
03:42:37.969 --> 03:42:37.979 align:start position:0%
years a regular closed captioning not
 
03:42:37.979 --> 03:42:44.210 align:start position:0%
years a regular closed captioning not
available

03:42:44.210 --> 03:42:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:47.269 --> 03:42:47.279 align:start position:0%
safe and reliable we oversee and
 
03:42:49.849 --> 03:42:49.859 align:start position:0%
maintain about 4 600 Centerline miles of
 
03:42:52.370 --> 03:42:52.380 align:start position:0%
roadway and along that roadway or a
 
03:42:54.710 --> 03:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand signs about 68 million
 
03:42:57.710 --> 03:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
feet of Lane striping that we try to get
 
03:42:59.650 --> 03:42:59.660 align:start position:0%
to each and every year
 
03:43:03.830 --> 03:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
440 traffic signals and 550 traffic
 
03:43:03.840 --> 03:43:05.050 align:start position:0%
440 traffic signals and 550 traffic
beacons

03:43:05.050 --> 03:43:05.060 align:start position:0%
beacons
 
03:43:10.190 --> 03:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
we also have oversight of 195 194 miles
 
03:43:13.790 --> 03:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
of active state-owned Rail lines that's
 
03:43:15.950 --> 03:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a misnomer Andre may hit
 
03:43:18.370 --> 03:43:18.380 align:start position:0%
on some of the numbers there are
 
03:43:21.830 --> 03:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of miles of uh I think close to
 
03:43:24.950 --> 03:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
250 miles or so of of inactive
 
03:43:26.929 --> 03:43:26.939 align:start position:0%
state-owned railroad lines that are that
 
03:43:28.670 --> 03:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
are still under our purview as well too
 
03:43:30.590 --> 03:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
we oversee
 
03:43:30.600 --> 03:43:31.250 align:start position:0%
we oversee
um

03:43:31.250 --> 03:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:34.610 --> 03:43:34.620 align:start position:0%
funding and compliance at 25 publicly
 
03:43:37.010 --> 03:43:37.020 align:start position:0%
accessible airports and 11 public
 
03:43:39.229 --> 03:43:39.239 align:start position:0%
transit systems that funding comes
 
03:43:41.510 --> 03:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
through the dot rfta funding that goes
 
03:43:43.969 --> 03:43:43.979 align:start position:0%
to those agencies
 
03:43:47.750 --> 03:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
so on slide four as a very high level
 
03:43:51.830 --> 03:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
snapshot of our budget size and just
 
03:43:54.590 --> 03:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
general overview so our FY 22
 
03:43:57.590 --> 03:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
expenditures was close to 600 million
 
03:43:57.600 --> 03:43:59.469 align:start position:0%
expenditures was close to 600 million
dollars

03:43:59.469 --> 03:43:59.479 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:44:02.809 --> 03:44:02.819 align:start position:0%
we divide our budget into kind of two
 
03:44:05.090 --> 03:44:05.100 align:start position:0%
halves the municipal Aid and
 
03:44:08.450 --> 03:44:08.460 align:start position:0%
construction costs were about 305
 
03:44:10.490 --> 03:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
million dollars of that of that budget
 
03:44:12.889 --> 03:44:12.899 align:start position:0%
Municipal Aid and construction is all of
 
03:44:14.630 --> 03:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
our construction programs and all of the
 
03:44:17.090 --> 03:44:17.100 align:start position:0%
money that flows through dot to the
 
03:44:19.070 --> 03:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities that's the block grant
 
03:44:21.710 --> 03:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
Aid some of the federal aid that comes
 
03:44:23.750 --> 03:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
through us to municipalities for their
 
03:44:26.510 --> 03:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
projects things like that so we so we
 
03:44:28.429 --> 03:44:28.439 align:start position:0%
kind of blocked that out separately
 
03:44:30.910 --> 03:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
because a lot of that is flowed through
 
03:44:33.769 --> 03:44:33.779 align:start position:0%
uh money in terms of Grants and other
 
03:44:36.469 --> 03:44:36.479 align:start position:0%
things to municipalities as well as our
 
03:44:38.870 --> 03:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
overall construction program the other
 
03:44:41.210 --> 03:44:41.220 align:start position:0%
part of our budget to 282 million
 
03:44:44.210 --> 03:44:44.220 align:start position:0%
dollars there designated in the pie
 
03:44:46.670 --> 03:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
piece in Orange is our operating cost
 
03:44:48.290 --> 03:44:48.300 align:start position:0%
that's the operating budget of the
 
03:44:51.710 --> 03:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
department that's largely the uh the
 
03:44:55.010 --> 03:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
personnel and uh equipment and
 
03:44:57.710 --> 03:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
commodities the salt and everything that
 
03:45:00.650 --> 03:45:00.660 align:start position:0%
that's needed to run and maintain the
 
03:45:00.660 --> 03:45:01.670 align:start position:0%
that's needed to run and maintain the
department

03:45:01.670 --> 03:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:45:05.090 --> 03:45:05.100 align:start position:0%
so if you look at our budget it is a
 
03:45:07.670 --> 03:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
multi-funded through a variety of of
 
03:45:09.590 --> 03:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
funds and the breakdown is there in
 
03:45:12.290 --> 03:45:12.300 align:start position:0%
terms of percentages but our overall
 
03:45:14.389 --> 03:45:14.399 align:start position:0%
budget is funded by you know the highway
 
03:45:17.450 --> 03:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
fund federal funds Turnpike funds other
 
03:45:19.790 --> 03:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
funds and a very small percentage of
 
03:45:21.530 --> 03:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
General funds that support the division
 
03:45:24.650 --> 03:45:24.660 align:start position:0%
of Aeronautics Rail and Transit the bulk
 
03:45:26.389 --> 03:45:26.399 align:start position:0%
of our operating budget I will say
 
03:45:29.330 --> 03:45:29.340 align:start position:0%
because we're in uh budget season the
 
03:45:32.150 --> 03:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
bulk of our operating budget is funded
 
03:45:35.030 --> 03:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
through the highway fund bulk of our uh
 
03:45:36.889 --> 03:45:36.899 align:start position:0%
Municipal High Municipal Aid and
 
03:45:39.650 --> 03:45:39.660 align:start position:0%
construction is uh leans higher toward
 
03:45:43.010 --> 03:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
the toward the federal funds
 
03:45:44.450 --> 03:45:44.460 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
03:45:47.809 --> 03:45:47.819 align:start position:0%
um I'll have um Dave just go over some
 
03:45:49.849 --> 03:45:49.859 align:start position:0%
uh quick bullets a little bit of the
 
03:45:51.830 --> 03:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
couple of Divisions onto his purview and
 
03:45:53.570 --> 03:45:53.580 align:start position:0%
then uh have Andre do the same and he'll
 
03:45:56.570 --> 03:45:56.580 align:start position:0%
get into some of the finances that that
 
03:45:56.580 --> 03:45:57.530 align:start position:0%
get into some of the finances that that
uh

03:45:57.530 --> 03:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:45:59.389 --> 03:45:59.399 align:start position:0%
some of the finances on the highway fund
 
03:46:01.370 --> 03:46:01.380 align:start position:0%
and the small amount of Highway fund
 
03:46:04.070 --> 03:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
Revenue that the dot collects so
 
03:46:12.710 --> 03:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:15.469 --> 03:46:15.479 align:start position:0%
so good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
03:46:17.570 --> 03:46:17.580 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
03:46:21.110 --> 03:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
taking time to hear from us today
 
03:46:23.210 --> 03:46:23.220 align:start position:0%
um I will touch briefly on my
 
03:46:24.830 --> 03:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
responsibilities as the assistant
 
03:46:27.710 --> 03:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the chief engineer for
 
03:46:29.710 --> 03:46:29.720 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation so
 
03:46:32.690 --> 03:46:32.700 align:start position:0%
under under the assistant commissioner
 
03:46:35.630 --> 03:46:35.640 align:start position:0%
is basically two divisions the division
 
03:46:38.030 --> 03:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
of project development project
 
03:46:40.490 --> 03:46:40.500 align:start position:0%
development includes our Highway design
 
03:46:42.710 --> 03:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
Bureau that
 
03:46:45.650 --> 03:46:45.660 align:start position:0%
um designs the projects that that we
 
03:46:48.469 --> 03:46:48.479 align:start position:0%
advertise it also includes our project
 
03:46:51.229 --> 03:46:51.239 align:start position:0%
managers that set up the project
 
03:46:53.990 --> 03:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
schedules and funding and keep track of
 
03:46:56.990 --> 03:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
them through the 10-year plan process in
 
03:46:59.750 --> 03:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
the interaction with the communities as
 
03:47:02.290 --> 03:47:02.300 align:start position:0%
the project said designed and developed
 
03:47:05.150 --> 03:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
project development also includes at
 
03:47:07.429 --> 03:47:07.439 align:start position:0%
Bureau bridge design bridge design
 
03:47:10.309 --> 03:47:10.319 align:start position:0%
obviously designs uh the bridges that we
 
03:47:13.550 --> 03:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
have they also oversee the the bridge
 
03:47:16.309 --> 03:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
inspection section that inspects a
 
03:47:19.670 --> 03:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
bridge Bridges as Bill described and
 
03:47:22.130 --> 03:47:22.140 align:start position:0%
keeps the records that we report to
 
03:47:24.650 --> 03:47:24.660 align:start position:0%
Federal Highway and the FEDS on US state
 
03:47:27.050 --> 03:47:27.060 align:start position:0%
Bridges and the condition of our bridges

project development includes the Bureau
 
03:47:32.870 --> 03:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
of Construction Construction oversees
 
03:47:37.550 --> 03:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
our contracts once a project is designed
 
03:47:40.570 --> 03:47:40.580 align:start position:0%
and advertised and a private contractor
 
03:47:43.969 --> 03:47:43.979 align:start position:0%
builds a construction folks oversee that
 
03:47:46.070 --> 03:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
construction they paid the contractor
 
03:47:48.530 --> 03:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
and make sure that the work is done
 
03:47:50.269 --> 03:47:50.279 align:start position:0%
according to the plans and
 
03:47:53.210 --> 03:47:53.220 align:start position:0%
specifications and solve the day-to-day
 
03:47:56.389 --> 03:47:56.399 align:start position:0%
problems that come up in executing a
 
03:47:59.090 --> 03:47:59.100 align:start position:0%
large complex construction project we
 
03:48:00.889 --> 03:48:00.899 align:start position:0%
have the Bureau of right-of-way that
 
03:48:03.710 --> 03:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
deals with all our land purchases and
 
03:48:06.349 --> 03:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
manages some of the properties that we
 
03:48:08.990 --> 03:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
own our Bureau of environment to make
 
03:48:11.750 --> 03:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
sure that as we design projects we
 
03:48:13.910 --> 03:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
design them according to environmental
 
03:48:16.610 --> 03:48:16.620 align:start position:0%
regulations and then follow through
 
03:48:19.070 --> 03:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
construction and operations and
 
03:48:20.630 --> 03:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
maintenance to make sure that we're
 
03:48:24.469 --> 03:48:24.479 align:start position:0%
environmentally compliant we also have a
 
03:48:26.030 --> 03:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
bureau of planning and Community
 
03:48:29.630 --> 03:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
Assistance who helps us put together the
 
03:48:34.250 --> 03:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
10-year plan who helps to also provide
 
03:48:36.889 --> 03:48:36.899 align:start position:0%
support to the communities and so forth
 
03:48:39.590 --> 03:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
and oversee municipally managed projects
 
03:48:41.570 --> 03:48:41.580 align:start position:0%
and that Bureau of materials and
 
03:48:44.269 --> 03:48:44.279 align:start position:0%
research make sure that all our
 
03:48:47.210 --> 03:48:47.220 align:start position:0%
specifications for materials and
 
03:48:50.950 --> 03:48:50.960 align:start position:0%
supplies that go into our projects meet
 
03:48:54.710 --> 03:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
requirements and are up to Snuff as as
 
03:48:58.309 --> 03:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
well the project development Bureau or
 
03:49:00.950 --> 03:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
division puts together our 10-year
 
03:49:03.950 --> 03:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
Transportation plan that's updated every
 
03:49:09.469 --> 03:49:09.479 align:start position:0%
two years and we administer about 225
 
03:49:12.530 --> 03:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
million dollars worth of federal funds
 
03:49:15.469 --> 03:49:15.479 align:start position:0%
using construction projects every year
 
03:49:19.969 --> 03:49:19.979 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 22 we had 57 new
 
03:49:22.670 --> 03:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
construction cut contracts and went out
 
03:49:24.950 --> 03:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
to bid in our Bureau of construction
 
03:49:28.790 --> 03:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
over saw 84 active construction projects
 
03:49:32.269 --> 03:49:32.279 align:start position:0%
with a total value of 750 million
 
03:49:32.279 --> 03:49:33.429 align:start position:0%
with a total value of 750 million
dollars

03:49:33.429 --> 03:49:33.439 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:49:38.690 --> 03:49:38.700 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 we advertise 233 million
 
03:49:41.030 --> 03:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of projects
 
03:49:43.729 --> 03:49:43.739 align:start position:0%
moving over to our division of
 
03:49:43.739 --> 03:49:45.410 align:start position:0%
moving over to our division of
operations

03:49:45.410 --> 03:49:45.420 align:start position:0%
operations
 
03:49:47.809 --> 03:49:47.819 align:start position:0%
um operations is responsible for
 
03:49:50.570 --> 03:49:50.580 align:start position:0%
operations and maintenance of our
 
03:49:53.150 --> 03:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
transportation system we do that with
 
03:49:55.250 --> 03:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
six bureaus
 
03:49:57.050 --> 03:49:57.060 align:start position:0%
um the first is a bureau of Highway
 
03:49:59.690 --> 03:49:59.700 align:start position:0%
Maintenance Highway Maintenance is
 
03:50:01.849 --> 03:50:01.859 align:start position:0%
Statewide we have six Highway
 
03:50:04.910 --> 03:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
Maintenance districts all responsible
 
03:50:07.490 --> 03:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
for a portion of the state
 
03:50:09.650 --> 03:50:09.660 align:start position:0%
um those are largely the the folks who
 
03:50:11.570 --> 03:50:11.580 align:start position:0%
will be out plowing snow tonight
 
03:50:11.580 --> 03:50:13.910 align:start position:0%
will be out plowing snow tonight
interestingly

03:50:13.910 --> 03:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
interestingly
 
03:50:17.630 --> 03:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
um we plow snow with about half of our
 
03:50:20.510 --> 03:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
people and vehicles in about half
 
03:50:23.090 --> 03:50:23.100 align:start position:0%
contract rented
 
03:50:26.389 --> 03:50:26.399 align:start position:0%
um vehicles and and people as well so
 
03:50:28.610 --> 03:50:28.620 align:start position:0%
when you see us out there working it's
 
03:50:32.210 --> 03:50:32.220 align:start position:0%
not just us we have great Partnerships
 
03:50:34.610 --> 03:50:34.620 align:start position:0%
um with contractors who help us get that
 
03:50:35.690 --> 03:50:35.700 align:start position:0%
work done
 
03:50:39.710 --> 03:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
we have 87 Patrol sections Statewide it
 
03:50:41.870 --> 03:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
sounds like a lot but that's one Patrol
 
03:50:45.830 --> 03:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
section for about every 2.6 town so it's
 
03:50:47.809 --> 03:50:47.819 align:start position:0%
really spread out
 
03:50:49.910 --> 03:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
um pretty well and that's why we're
 
03:50:52.670 --> 03:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
successful because we have that logistic
 
03:50:55.729 --> 03:50:55.739 align:start position:0%
distribution across the state
 
03:50:58.729 --> 03:50:58.739 align:start position:0%
um Highway Maintenance also responds to
 
03:51:00.830 --> 03:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
emergency events
 
03:51:03.410 --> 03:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
um and does the tree trimming the mowing
 
03:51:06.170 --> 03:51:06.180 align:start position:0%
the cleanup the drainage the ditching
 
03:51:09.950 --> 03:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
and everything during the summer
 
03:51:13.070 --> 03:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
other operations Bureau includes the
 
03:51:15.650 --> 03:51:15.660 align:start position:0%
Bureau of traffic they do all our line
 
03:51:18.349 --> 03:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
striping take care about traffic signals
 
03:51:21.229 --> 03:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
and signs they also do our traffic
 
03:51:23.870 --> 03:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
counting keeping track of volumes they
 
03:51:26.690 --> 03:51:26.700 align:start position:0%
have a traffic research section
 
03:51:29.150 --> 03:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
um they look at the traffic impact
 
03:51:31.330 --> 03:51:31.340 align:start position:0%
studies for our major
 
03:51:34.370 --> 03:51:34.380 align:start position:0%
developments that get built and impact
 
03:51:37.250 --> 03:51:37.260 align:start position:0%
the transportation system uh Bureau of
 
03:51:40.670 --> 03:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
bridge maintenance we have 12 Crews
 
03:51:42.889 --> 03:51:42.899 align:start position:0%
um one Crews responsible for the lip
 
03:51:45.910 --> 03:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
Bridges and Portsmouth the remaining 11
 
03:51:49.550 --> 03:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
work around the state maintaining and
 
03:51:51.590 --> 03:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
preserving our bridges washing the
 
03:51:53.630 --> 03:51:53.640 align:start position:0%
bridges in the spring and keeping them
 
03:51:55.030 --> 03:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
in good condition
 
03:51:58.490 --> 03:51:58.500 align:start position:0%
Mechanical Services overseas a fleet
 
03:52:01.309 --> 03:52:01.319 align:start position:0%
worth about a hundred ten million
 
03:52:04.070 --> 03:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
dollars and keeps that going the the
 
03:52:07.130 --> 03:52:07.140 align:start position:0%
vast majority of that flea is the plow
 
03:52:07.140 --> 03:52:08.389 align:start position:0%
vast majority of that flea is the plow
trucks

03:52:08.389 --> 03:52:08.399 align:start position:0%
trucks
 
03:52:10.610 --> 03:52:10.620 align:start position:0%
um that serve dual purpose they plow
 
03:52:12.650 --> 03:52:12.660 align:start position:0%
snow in the winter and they haul
 
03:52:14.750 --> 03:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
material in the summer
 
03:52:18.710 --> 03:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
we run a fuel distribution system as
 
03:52:20.929 --> 03:52:20.939 align:start position:0%
well and we have our transportation
 
03:52:24.410 --> 03:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
systems management and operations Bureau
 
03:52:28.790 --> 03:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
that helps to monitor what's going on
 
03:52:31.490 --> 03:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
the roadway and provide Travelers
 
03:52:35.570 --> 03:52:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:37.670 --> 03:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
in addition we have our Bureau of
 
03:52:41.389 --> 03:52:41.399 align:start position:0%
turnpikes our Turnpike system is an
 
03:52:44.090 --> 03:52:44.100 align:start position:0%
enterprise system so all the funds
 
03:52:46.910 --> 03:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
collected on the turnpike stay on the
 
03:52:51.050 --> 03:52:51.060 align:start position:0%
turnpike in fiscal year 22 we collected
 
03:52:55.130 --> 03:52:55.140 align:start position:0%
about 123 million dollars of toll
 
03:53:00.229 --> 03:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
revenue and we project in 2024 to
 
03:53:04.370 --> 03:53:04.380 align:start position:0%
collect about 125 million in in 2025
 
03:53:04.380 --> 03:53:05.710 align:start position:0%
collect about 125 million in in 2025
about

03:53:05.710 --> 03:53:05.720 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:53:09.170 --> 03:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
144 million dollars
 
03:53:17.090 --> 03:53:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:19.910 --> 03:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Dave and thank you uh Mr
 
03:53:22.429 --> 03:53:22.439 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee I'm
 
03:53:26.929 --> 03:53:26.939 align:start position:0%
Andre Briere I've been Deputy uh here at
 
03:53:28.910 --> 03:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
dot for a little over a year and a half
 
03:53:31.370 --> 03:53:31.380 align:start position:0%
now I spent most of my career in the U.S
 
03:53:33.650 --> 03:53:33.660 align:start position:0%
Air Force as a retired Colonel spent
 
03:53:36.710 --> 03:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
most of that time as a as a pilot but
 
03:53:39.110 --> 03:53:39.120 align:start position:0%
also a good portion in transportation
 
03:53:41.690 --> 03:53:41.700 align:start position:0%
leadership so uh
 
03:53:44.330 --> 03:53:44.340 align:start position:0%
a lot of that comes in handy uh here at
 
03:53:45.950 --> 03:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
dot I'll just walk you briefly through
 
03:53:47.870 --> 03:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
my portfolios which include as the
 
03:53:50.870 --> 03:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
commissioner said Aviation rail Transit
 
03:53:54.050 --> 03:53:54.060 align:start position:0%
as well as finance and administration on
 
03:53:55.610 --> 03:53:55.620 align:start position:0%
the Aeronautics side as the commissioner
 
03:53:57.410 --> 03:53:57.420 align:start position:0%
mentioned we have 25 open to the public
 
03:54:00.349 --> 03:54:00.359 align:start position:0%
airports in New Hampshire of those 12
 
03:54:04.429 --> 03:54:04.439 align:start position:0%
are federally funded we act as a
 
03:54:06.469 --> 03:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
pass-through for a lot of these funds
 
03:54:08.630 --> 03:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
we're one of 10 states that are what
 
03:54:11.510 --> 03:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
what are called block grant States so
 
03:54:12.950 --> 03:54:12.960 align:start position:0%
what that really means is we have
 
03:54:15.229 --> 03:54:15.239 align:start position:0%
additional authorities and permissions
 
03:54:16.550 --> 03:54:16.560 align:start position:0%
from the U.S Department of
 
03:54:20.030 --> 03:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
Transportation to act as proxies when
 
03:54:21.530 --> 03:54:21.540 align:start position:0%
we're providing funding to these
 
03:54:24.710 --> 03:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
airports that's something that that's a
 
03:54:26.269 --> 03:54:26.279 align:start position:0%
privilege we enjoy and we work very
 
03:54:29.929 --> 03:54:29.939 align:start position:0%
closely with our FAA office in Boston as
 
03:54:32.330 --> 03:54:32.340 align:start position:0%
we execute that plan three of those
 
03:54:34.729 --> 03:54:34.739 align:start position:0%
airports are commercial uh as as you
 
03:54:37.250 --> 03:54:37.260 align:start position:0%
would know Manchester Portsmouth peas
 
03:54:39.469 --> 03:54:39.479 align:start position:0%
and Lebanon
 
03:54:41.630 --> 03:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
um for the airports uh that we have
 
03:54:43.610 --> 03:54:43.620 align:start position:0%
opened the public that are not federally
 
03:54:46.370 --> 03:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
funded uh what we do and you can see at
 
03:54:47.750 --> 03:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
the bottom of that Aeronautics section
 
03:54:50.510 --> 03:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
we take in about 470
 
03:54:53.929 --> 03:54:53.939 align:start position:0%
000 or so in aviation registration fees
 
03:54:55.849 --> 03:54:55.859 align:start position:0%
that funding goes right to our
 
03:54:58.250 --> 03:54:58.260 align:start position:0%
operations and also we use that to fund
 
03:55:00.290 --> 03:55:00.300 align:start position:0%
projects that are non uh federally
 
03:55:01.849 --> 03:55:01.859 align:start position:0%
funded airports
 
03:55:04.729 --> 03:55:04.739 align:start position:0%
one thing that's not on here as well in
 
03:55:07.010 --> 03:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
the uh on the Aeronautics side is our
 
03:55:10.429 --> 03:55:10.439 align:start position:0%
growing and uh very uh lean and
 
03:55:13.189 --> 03:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
efficient uas programs that's uas drones
 
03:55:17.150 --> 03:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
we at dot take pictures of projects not
 
03:55:20.570 --> 03:55:20.580 align:start position:0%
people so all of our drones are aimed at
 
03:55:23.030 --> 03:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh our construction projects and also a
 
03:55:25.729 --> 03:55:25.739 align:start position:0%
Disaster Response we're very proud of
 
03:55:28.429 --> 03:55:28.439 align:start position:0%
how that program's developing it's a lot
 
03:55:30.050 --> 03:55:30.060 align:start position:0%
cheaper for the Department to run it
 
03:55:32.269 --> 03:55:32.279 align:start position:0%
ourselves versus Contracting that out
 
03:55:35.750 --> 03:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
which comes at a premium these days and
 
03:55:39.050 --> 03:55:39.060 align:start position:0%
we have an excellent drone pilot program
 
03:55:41.570 --> 03:55:41.580 align:start position:0%
we're developing more operators all the
 
03:55:46.429 --> 03:55:46.439 align:start position:0%
time on the rail side uh we do manage
 
03:55:50.210 --> 03:55:50.220 align:start position:0%
about 194 little little south of 2000 or
 
03:55:50.220 --> 03:55:51.530 align:start position:0%
about 194 little little south of 2000 or
200

03:55:51.530 --> 03:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
200
 
03:55:53.389 --> 03:55:53.399 align:start position:0%
um miles of rail
 
03:55:56.150 --> 03:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
far more abandoned rail line so what we
 
03:55:58.490 --> 03:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
do with that is that's converted into
 
03:56:01.189 --> 03:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
rail trails in some cases it's also
 
03:56:04.309 --> 03:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
leased out to commercial operators that
 
03:56:06.170 --> 03:56:06.180 align:start position:0%
do things like rail bikes that you may
 
03:56:09.110 --> 03:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
be familiar with in Laconia or near here
 
03:56:10.790 --> 03:56:10.800 align:start position:0%
in Concord
 
03:56:13.010 --> 03:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
but we uh we're developing additional
 
03:56:15.710 --> 03:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
uses for that those corridors all the
 
03:56:19.070 --> 03:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
time the reason we maintain them is uh
 
03:56:21.710 --> 03:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
to preserve them for future use is if it
 
03:56:23.750 --> 03:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
sometime down the road any decision is
 
03:56:27.229 --> 03:56:27.239 align:start position:0%
made to revive rail on those routes
 
03:56:29.510 --> 03:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh finally on this slide is our public
 
03:56:31.729 --> 03:56:31.739 align:start position:0%
transit we have 11 local public transit
 
03:56:35.030 --> 03:56:35.040 align:start position:0%
providers who we work very closely with
 
03:56:37.250 --> 03:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
um we have excellent Partnerships with
 
03:56:39.769 --> 03:56:39.779 align:start position:0%
companies like coast and Concord Coach
 
03:56:41.750 --> 03:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
Boston Express Etc
 
03:56:44.150 --> 03:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
uh the big point I want to make on this
 
03:56:45.950 --> 03:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
section is that uh
 
03:56:48.889 --> 03:56:48.899 align:start position:0%
as you may be familiar uh post 2020
 
03:56:51.710 --> 03:56:51.720 align:start position:0%
there's been evolving commuting patterns
 
03:56:53.510 --> 03:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing among our Transit
 
03:56:57.050 --> 03:56:57.060 align:start position:0%
providers is a slow return to pre-2020
 
03:57:00.250 --> 03:57:00.260 align:start position:0%
levels that's a little patchy you see
 
03:57:03.229 --> 03:57:03.239 align:start position:0%
Peaks very close to normal Tuesdays
 
03:57:05.750 --> 03:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
through through Thursdays slightly
 
03:57:07.630 --> 03:57:07.640 align:start position:0%
different but we continue to track
 
03:57:10.550 --> 03:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
improving uh improving revenues on that
 
03:57:10.560 --> 03:57:12.469 align:start position:0%
improving uh improving revenues on that
side

03:57:12.469 --> 03:57:12.479 align:start position:0%
side
 
03:57:15.170 --> 03:57:15.180 align:start position:0%
on the administration uh side our
 
03:57:16.790 --> 03:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
executive office does what what all
 
03:57:18.889 --> 03:57:18.899 align:start position:0%
departments Executives offices do make
 
03:57:21.469 --> 03:57:21.479 align:start position:0%
sure we utilize the funds distributed
 
03:57:23.630 --> 03:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
and granted by this body in the most
 
03:57:26.210 --> 03:57:26.220 align:start position:0%
efficient way possible our finance team
 
03:57:28.969 --> 03:57:28.979 align:start position:0%
is excellent they deal with a lot of
 
03:57:31.010 --> 03:57:31.020 align:start position:0%
different colors of money
 
03:57:32.630 --> 03:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
um and their
 
03:57:34.790 --> 03:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
they have ever uh more efficient
 
03:57:37.370 --> 03:57:37.380 align:start position:0%
processes to do that we have a new
 
03:57:40.010 --> 03:57:40.020 align:start position:0%
Director of Finance sitting behind us
 
03:57:43.490 --> 03:57:43.500 align:start position:0%
here Danielle chandanae and she is a
 
03:57:44.830 --> 03:57:44.840 align:start position:0%
really excellent asset to the department
 
03:57:48.950 --> 03:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
and is doing a wonderful job at that on
 
03:57:50.389 --> 03:57:50.399 align:start position:0%
the policy Administration side as the
 
03:57:53.150 --> 03:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner mentioned I also oversee HR
 
03:57:54.650 --> 03:57:54.660 align:start position:0%
internal audit health and safety Federal
 
03:57:56.090 --> 03:57:56.100 align:start position:0%
compliance all those things we need to
 
03:57:57.830 --> 03:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
do to make sure we can spend our federal
 
03:57:57.840 --> 03:57:59.870 align:start position:0%
do to make sure we can spend our federal
funds

03:57:59.870 --> 03:57:59.880 align:start position:0%
funds
 
03:58:02.990 --> 03:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
so the next slide is really uh I think I
 
03:58:05.570 --> 03:58:05.580 align:start position:0%
don't want to reiterate what Mr Lavoy
 
03:58:07.550 --> 03:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
probably told you but just to make the
 
03:58:09.950 --> 03:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
point that although the highway fund is
 
03:58:13.429 --> 03:58:13.439 align:start position:0%
traditionally associated with DOT as you
 
03:58:15.290 --> 03:58:15.300 align:start position:0%
heard from him it is not the Department
 
03:58:18.189 --> 03:58:18.199 align:start position:0%
of Transportation and we don't collect
 
03:58:21.910 --> 03:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
most funds that go into the highway fund
 
03:58:24.889 --> 03:58:24.899 align:start position:0%
and that's comprised of the gas gas and
 
03:58:28.370 --> 03:58:28.380 align:start position:0%
road toll registration fees Etc we also
 
03:58:31.790 --> 03:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh the highway fund is also where we uh
 
03:58:34.370 --> 03:58:34.380 align:start position:0%
wear proceeds from tiffia Garvey bonds
 
03:58:36.830 --> 03:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
are deposited it is the primary source
 
03:58:38.750 --> 03:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
of funding for our operating budget as
 
03:58:40.750 --> 03:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner Cass mentioned
 
03:58:43.790 --> 03:58:43.800 align:start position:0%
and the the revenues go to dot safety
 
03:58:46.910 --> 03:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
judicial branch and Justice the majority
 
03:58:48.830 --> 03:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
of it does come to Dot and that's what
 
03:58:50.750 --> 03:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
we use for our projects and maintenance
 
03:58:54.349 --> 03:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
of of our transportation system
 
03:58:58.010 --> 03:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
the next slide is addresses a question
 
03:58:59.510 --> 03:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
we were
 
03:59:02.630 --> 03:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
um asked to to address uh in this body
 
03:59:05.389 --> 03:59:05.399 align:start position:0%
and that is the highway fund revenues
 
03:59:07.309 --> 03:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
that we actually collect now it's a very
 
03:59:09.349 --> 03:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
very small sliver of the overall Highway
 
03:59:12.229 --> 03:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
fund but we do collect annually
 
03:59:12.239 --> 03:59:12.830 align:start position:0%
fund but we do collect annually
um

03:59:12.830 --> 03:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:14.990 --> 03:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
what we budget at about two hundred
 
03:59:17.630 --> 03:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars you can see on the
 
03:59:19.550 --> 03:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
bottom chart that that does vary year to
 
03:59:22.490 --> 03:59:22.500 align:start position:0%
year but there are four main categories
 
03:59:25.550 --> 03:59:25.560 align:start position:0%
uh of funds that that
 
03:59:27.790 --> 03:59:27.800 align:start position:0%
flow through us into the highway fund
 
03:59:30.650 --> 03:59:30.660 align:start position:0%
that's the highway portion of surplus
 
03:59:34.130 --> 03:59:34.140 align:start position:0%
property sales that the department has
 
03:59:36.349 --> 03:59:36.359 align:start position:0%
acquired over the years and then we
 
03:59:38.809 --> 03:59:38.819 align:start position:0%
liquidate over time as as they're not
 
03:59:41.450 --> 03:59:41.460 align:start position:0%
needed for Highway purposes Surplus
 
03:59:41.460 --> 03:59:43.070 align:start position:0%
needed for Highway purposes Surplus
equipment

03:59:43.070 --> 03:59:43.080 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
03:59:45.410 --> 03:59:45.420 align:start position:0%
um and end of useful life type equipment
 
03:59:48.889 --> 03:59:48.899 align:start position:0%
sign advertising junkyard licenses court
 
03:59:51.590 --> 03:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
fees things like that it's a very small
 
03:59:54.349 --> 03:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
portion of the highway fund but it does
 
03:59:58.550 --> 03:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
flow through us into the into the fund
 
04:00:00.710 --> 04:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
so with that I will pass it to
 
04:00:02.150 --> 04:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner Cass unless there are any
 
04:00:09.710 --> 04:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:11.990 --> 04:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know
 
04:00:12.000 --> 04:00:13.070 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know
um

04:00:13.070 --> 04:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:15.110 --> 04:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
was there a question I'll tell you
 
04:00:15.120 --> 04:00:17.090 align:start position:0%
was there a question I'll tell you
yes

04:00:17.090 --> 04:00:17.100 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:00:20.510 --> 04:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
I can see your hands yeah representative
 
04:00:22.550 --> 04:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
Southworth would like a question thank
 
04:00:22.560 --> 04:00:23.269 align:start position:0%
Southworth would like a question thank
you

04:00:23.269 --> 04:00:23.279 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:00:24.530 --> 04:00:24.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:00:26.689 --> 04:00:26.699 align:start position:0%
um I live near the lime bridge in the
 
04:00:28.729 --> 04:00:28.739 align:start position:0%
summer so I'm very glad that it's been
 
04:00:31.429 --> 04:00:31.439 align:start position:0%
moved up on your red list but in part of
 
04:00:33.349 --> 04:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
the discussion I believe it was home for
 
04:00:35.630 --> 04:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
your department it was shared that it's
 
04:00:38.450 --> 04:00:38.460 align:start position:0%
getting very hard to put these type of
 
04:00:41.870 --> 04:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
bridges out to Bid And if that was you
 
04:00:43.429 --> 04:00:43.439 align:start position:0%
know causing a challenge but I didn't
 
04:00:45.469 --> 04:00:45.479 align:start position:0%
know if that's affecting you or not but
 
04:00:47.590 --> 04:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
that's what was stated in the report
 
04:00:49.969 --> 04:00:49.979 align:start position:0%
yeah is that the lime theft food Bridge
 
04:00:49.979 --> 04:00:50.990 align:start position:0%
yeah is that the lime theft food Bridge
yes

04:00:50.990 --> 04:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:00:51.000 --> 04:00:52.370 align:start position:0%
yes
um

04:00:52.370 --> 04:00:52.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:55.309 --> 04:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
yeah um and I'll just digress for a
 
04:00:57.530 --> 04:00:57.540 align:start position:0%
minute uh Madam chair the rest of the
 
04:00:59.389 --> 04:00:59.399 align:start position:0%
presentation is kind of uh what we had
 
04:01:01.010 --> 04:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
done for our introductory budget
 
04:01:02.510 --> 04:01:02.520 align:start position:0%
presentation just some of the challenges
 
04:01:03.469 --> 04:01:03.479 align:start position:0%
and stuff I don't know if that's
 
04:01:05.870 --> 04:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate for this body or or I'm
 
04:01:07.490 --> 04:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
happy to go through it but it does
 
04:01:10.010 --> 04:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
address a little bit of uh your question
 
04:01:12.710 --> 04:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the issues
 
04:01:15.050 --> 04:01:15.060 align:start position:0%
um that is that that we do highlight on
 
04:01:16.969 --> 04:01:16.979 align:start position:0%
on the issues and challenges is is
 
04:01:19.370 --> 04:01:19.380 align:start position:0%
inflation uh and increasing labor and
 
04:01:22.809 --> 04:01:22.819 align:start position:0%
material costs so what your um
 
04:01:26.090 --> 04:01:26.100 align:start position:0%
referring to is is directly related to
 
04:01:28.729 --> 04:01:28.739 align:start position:0%
that to that issue so when we had
 
04:01:30.349 --> 04:01:30.359 align:start position:0%
advertised the line Thetford Bridge
 
04:01:34.610 --> 04:01:34.620 align:start position:0%
originally uh we got no no bidders and
 
04:01:36.349 --> 04:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
we had some
 
04:01:38.090 --> 04:01:38.100 align:start position:0%
construction requirements and some
 
04:01:40.309 --> 04:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
schedule requirements that in a debrief
 
04:01:42.170 --> 04:01:42.180 align:start position:0%
with the construction industry we found
 
04:01:44.450 --> 04:01:44.460 align:start position:0%
out that was fairly onerous and and it
 
04:01:47.630 --> 04:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
really deterred uh some some contractors
 
04:01:51.790 --> 04:01:51.800 align:start position:0%
from from bidding on the on the project
 
04:01:55.010 --> 04:01:55.020 align:start position:0%
we changed some of those uh requirements
 
04:01:56.870 --> 04:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
and and if you're from the area you know
 
04:01:59.750 --> 04:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
some of the consternation that that that
 
04:02:02.929 --> 04:02:02.939 align:start position:0%
I'm well aware that that created but um
 
04:02:04.849 --> 04:02:04.859 align:start position:0%
you know we had to make those
 
04:02:06.650 --> 04:02:06.660 align:start position:0%
um changes to the construction
 
04:02:08.030 --> 04:02:08.040 align:start position:0%
requirements and the construction
 
04:02:09.950 --> 04:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
schedule lengthening it out a little bit
 
04:02:12.050 --> 04:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
and we received three bidders the bids
 
04:02:13.610 --> 04:02:13.620 align:start position:0%
did come in
 
04:02:15.710 --> 04:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
um higher than our estimate so it is it
 
04:02:17.570 --> 04:02:17.580 align:start position:0%
is a challenge but it's directly related
 
04:02:19.370 --> 04:02:19.380 align:start position:0%
to difficulties that you refer to are
 
04:02:21.349 --> 04:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
directly related to the inflationary
 
04:02:23.929 --> 04:02:23.939 align:start position:0%
costs as well as
 
04:02:26.269 --> 04:02:26.279 align:start position:0%
um you know the uh increasingly tight
 
04:02:28.610 --> 04:02:28.620 align:start position:0%
labor market and trying to find uh
 
04:02:31.490 --> 04:02:31.500 align:start position:0%
workers there so so thank you so it's
 
04:02:33.650 --> 04:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
really applies to the whole big picture
 
04:02:36.050 --> 04:02:36.060 align:start position:0%
the trouble we're having there yes thank
 
04:02:38.570 --> 04:02:38.580 align:start position:0%
you yes exactly representative Ames has
 
04:02:40.910 --> 04:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
a question and then let's talk where we
 
04:02:42.530 --> 04:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
are and what time it is and what we need
 
04:02:44.809 --> 04:02:44.819 align:start position:0%
to do okay thanks go ahead please oh
 
04:02:46.550 --> 04:02:46.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:02:49.790 --> 04:02:49.800 align:start position:0%
um yeah when the Liquor Commission was
 
04:02:52.070 --> 04:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
here well we talked a little bit about
 
04:02:54.590 --> 04:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
struggles they're having with uh
 
04:02:56.630 --> 04:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
retention of employees
 
04:03:00.370 --> 04:03:00.380 align:start position:0%
you have a lot of employees I wonder uh
 
04:03:03.349 --> 04:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
how you're faring in in this regard
 
04:03:06.469 --> 04:03:06.479 align:start position:0%
whether this is a a problem that you're
 
04:03:08.510 --> 04:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
on top of and I'm sure you're on top of
 
04:03:10.490 --> 04:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
it but uh you know that it's going all
 
04:03:14.210 --> 04:03:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:16.250 --> 04:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
we're on top of it to the degree that
 
04:03:18.410 --> 04:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
we're we're managing it I don't have any
 
04:03:20.110 --> 04:03:20.120 align:start position:0%
any any any
 
04:03:23.450 --> 04:03:23.460 align:start position:0%
great Solutions uh but the the
 
04:03:25.370 --> 04:03:25.380 align:start position:0%
challenges that you said liquor had had
 
04:03:27.229 --> 04:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
referred to I mean we're facing those it
 
04:03:28.670 --> 04:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
is one of these challenges that I've
 
04:03:30.110 --> 04:03:30.120 align:start position:0%
highlighted here
 
04:03:32.269 --> 04:03:32.279 align:start position:0%
um we've had historically High
 
04:03:34.490 --> 04:03:34.500 align:start position:0%
um we've had historically High vacancy
 
04:03:34.500 --> 04:03:35.870 align:start position:0%
um we've had historically High vacancy
rates

04:03:35.870 --> 04:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
rates
 
04:03:38.750 --> 04:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
um upwards of uh department-wide around
 
04:03:42.229 --> 04:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
25 so that's one in every four positions
 
04:03:44.929 --> 04:03:44.939 align:start position:0%
being vacant and certain bureaus uh you
 
04:03:44.939 --> 04:03:45.710 align:start position:0%
being vacant and certain bureaus uh you
know

04:03:45.710 --> 04:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:03:48.830 --> 04:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
um have have higher vacancy rates
 
04:03:48.840 --> 04:03:49.429 align:start position:0%
um have have higher vacancy rates
um

04:03:49.429 --> 04:03:49.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:51.729 --> 04:03:51.739 align:start position:0%
some of our design bureaus are are
 
04:03:54.830 --> 04:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
facing you know 40 to 50 vacancy rates
 
04:03:56.809 --> 04:03:56.819 align:start position:0%
hiring Engineers
 
04:03:59.450 --> 04:03:59.460 align:start position:0%
um and some of our um I think it was
 
04:04:01.729 --> 04:04:01.739 align:start position:0%
Bridge maintenance in particular had uh
 
04:04:05.150 --> 04:04:05.160 align:start position:0%
around 30 to 35 vacancy rates at one
 
04:04:07.429 --> 04:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
point so it is a challenge one of the
 
04:04:08.929 --> 04:04:08.939 align:start position:0%
things that the legislature or or
 
04:04:10.910 --> 04:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
through the governor's office and the
 
04:04:12.110 --> 04:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
governor and Council and fiscal
 
04:04:14.630 --> 04:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
committee we did in the fall there was
 
04:04:18.410 --> 04:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
approval for a um winter maintenance
 
04:04:18.420 --> 04:04:19.010 align:start position:0%
approval for a um winter maintenance
um

04:04:19.010 --> 04:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:21.950 --> 04:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
incentive bonus retention bonus of five
 
04:04:24.349 --> 04:04:24.359 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for the season so we
 
04:04:27.769 --> 04:04:27.779 align:start position:0%
were seeing a continually climbing uh
 
04:04:29.689 --> 04:04:29.699 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate
 
04:04:31.790 --> 04:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
um it seemed to stem the tide I don't
 
04:04:34.010 --> 04:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
know if that five thousand dollar bonus
 
04:04:34.020 --> 04:04:35.090 align:start position:0%
know if that five thousand dollar bonus
had

04:04:35.090 --> 04:04:35.100 align:start position:0%
had
 
04:04:35.100 --> 04:04:36.889 align:start position:0%
had
um

04:04:36.889 --> 04:04:36.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:39.349 --> 04:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily brought more people in but
 
04:04:41.450 --> 04:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
at least for the time being seem to
 
04:04:45.950 --> 04:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
level off the um The Exodus and our
 
04:04:47.689 --> 04:04:47.699 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate has been holding steady
 
04:04:49.130 --> 04:04:49.140 align:start position:0%
about that
 
04:04:53.870 --> 04:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
uh it also was a very needed uh uh boost
 
04:04:56.330 --> 04:04:56.340 align:start position:0%
for the morale uh recognition of their
 
04:04:58.670 --> 04:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
hard work and efforts and recognition
 
04:05:00.650 --> 04:05:00.660 align:start position:0%
that that they uh
 
04:05:02.330 --> 04:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
um that their compensation is is
 
04:05:06.050 --> 04:05:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:07.729 --> 04:05:07.739 align:start position:0%
thank you for the answer that's very
 
04:05:09.290 --> 04:05:09.300 align:start position:0%
helpful sure
 
04:05:10.910 --> 04:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
we all love getting these agency
 
04:05:12.290 --> 04:05:12.300 align:start position:0%
presentations because we like meeting
 
04:05:14.269 --> 04:05:14.279 align:start position:0%
you and finding about what you do we
 
04:05:15.830 --> 04:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
like to hear about your problems and
 
04:05:17.689 --> 04:05:17.699 align:start position:0%
opportunities but we do have to stay a
 
04:05:19.309 --> 04:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
little bit focused on the revenue side
 
04:05:21.170 --> 04:05:21.180 align:start position:0%
and of course we have a schedule to
 
04:05:23.090 --> 04:05:23.100 align:start position:0%
comply with so I don't know if you had
 
04:05:24.950 --> 04:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
any more to talk about revenues right
 
04:05:27.530 --> 04:05:27.540 align:start position:0%
now or what where you are in the
 
04:05:29.570 --> 04:05:29.580 align:start position:0%
presentation I apologize that's exactly
 
04:05:31.849 --> 04:05:31.859 align:start position:0%
where we were like like I said we we've
 
04:05:34.370 --> 04:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
mentioned a few times I I thought the
 
04:05:35.689 --> 04:05:35.699 align:start position:0%
department of safety did an excellent
 
04:05:37.550 --> 04:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
presentation on on the bulk of the
 
04:05:39.590 --> 04:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
revenue and the highway fund we have a
 
04:05:41.450 --> 04:05:41.460 align:start position:0%
very very small it's fairly kind of
 
04:05:43.610 --> 04:05:43.620 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous type of type of stuff but
 
04:05:45.889 --> 04:05:45.899 align:start position:0%
we wanted to just have that information
 
04:05:48.170 --> 04:05:48.180 align:start position:0%
so well maybe we can have you come back
 
04:05:50.630 --> 04:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
but we really are interested and we
 
04:05:52.130 --> 04:05:52.140 align:start position:0%
appreciate everything that you do very
 
04:05:54.650 --> 04:05:54.660 align:start position:0%
very much and then you know we'll be
 
04:05:56.570 --> 04:05:56.580 align:start position:0%
going back to do actually pen to paper
 
04:05:58.490 --> 04:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
on Revenue estimates so if we need you
 
04:06:00.469 --> 04:06:00.479 align:start position:0%

04:06:02.330 --> 04:06:02.340 align:start position:0%

know still
 
04:07:46.729 --> 04:07:46.739 align:start position:0%
a significant contribution in terms of
 
04:07:49.490 --> 04:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
Revenue to the general fund just to
 
04:07:52.969 --> 04:07:52.979 align:start position:0%

04:08:55.550 --> 04:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
then any other form including
 
04:08:57.229 --> 04:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
presentations to any of your
 
04:08:59.150 --> 04:08:59.160 align:start position:0%
constituents if you would like us to
 
04:08:59.160 --> 04:09:00.650 align:start position:0%
constituents if you would like us to
present

04:09:00.650 --> 04:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
present
 
04:09:03.429 --> 04:09:03.439 align:start position:0%
in addition we also perform regular
 
04:09:06.950 --> 04:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
in-person audits of firms that are
 
04:09:10.969 --> 04:09:10.979 align:start position:0%
engaged in security sales we also do
 
04:09:13.010 --> 04:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
those on an unannounced basis and find
 
04:09:15.290 --> 04:09:15.300 align:start position:0%
that very effective a significant
 
04:09:17.510 --> 04:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
portion of our activity is is actually
 
04:09:20.870 --> 04:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
related to enforcement matters now this
 
04:09:22.030 --> 04:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
would include
 
04:09:25.370 --> 04:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
investor fraud unlawful sales practices
 
04:09:27.830 --> 04:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
in a variety of investor education or
 
04:09:29.450 --> 04:09:29.460 align:start position:0%
excuse me investor complaints that we
 
04:09:32.389 --> 04:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
receive throughout the year as you'll
 
04:09:35.870 --> 04:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
see on page three of the handout this
 
04:09:37.490 --> 04:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
provides you with a just a brief
 
04:09:40.670 --> 04:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
snapshot of our licensing activity and
 
04:09:44.630 --> 04:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
you'll note that as of the end of 12 31
 
04:09:50.630 --> 04:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
of 2022 we registered 148 620 broker
 
04:09:52.729 --> 04:09:52.739 align:start position:0%
dealer Representatives that are
 
04:09:55.070 --> 04:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
authorized to solicit into the state so
 
04:09:57.729 --> 04:09:57.739 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire really is
 
04:10:00.170 --> 04:10:00.180 align:start position:0%
an interest for broker-dealers and
 
04:10:02.150 --> 04:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
investment advisors we are a wealth
 
04:10:04.570 --> 04:10:04.580 align:start position:0%
Center we have an older population
 
04:10:07.429 --> 04:10:07.439 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of money actually retirees
 
04:10:10.610 --> 04:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
in the state and as a result we have
 
04:10:12.889 --> 04:10:12.899 align:start position:0%
firms you know seeking to do business in
 
04:10:14.030 --> 04:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and they certainly do
 
04:10:16.849 --> 04:10:16.859 align:start position:0%
given that number 2 800 investment
 
04:10:19.130 --> 04:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
advisors and approximately 5200
 
04:10:21.769 --> 04:10:21.779 align:start position:0%
investment advisor representatives and
 
04:10:24.229 --> 04:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
we register 29 000 or thereabouts
 
04:10:26.389 --> 04:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
various investment products a good
 
04:10:27.950 --> 04:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
portion of those are Investment Company
 
04:10:29.990 --> 04:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
products known as otherwise known as
 
04:10:32.210 --> 04:10:32.220 align:start position:0%
mutual funds approximately fifteen
 
04:10:33.830 --> 04:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
thousand of those
 
04:10:35.269 --> 04:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
I would like to point out that the
 
04:10:38.410 --> 04:10:38.420 align:start position:0%
bureau is self-funded all of our
 
04:10:41.570 --> 04:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
administrative expenses are paid by the
 
04:10:44.750 --> 04:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
way of fines and penalties that we
 
04:10:46.610 --> 04:10:46.620 align:start position:0%
receive through our enforcement actions
 
04:10:49.130 --> 04:10:49.140 align:start position:0%
uh with that said I would like to direct
 
04:10:51.530 --> 04:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
your attention really to the last page
 
04:10:54.229 --> 04:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
which will note the various general fund
 
04:10:56.450 --> 04:10:56.460 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources and they're really there
 
04:10:59.450 --> 04:10:59.460 align:start position:0%
are two the first is the broker dealer
 
04:11:02.990 --> 04:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
an investment advisor licensing fees and
 
04:11:05.330 --> 04:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
the second is the Securities product
 
04:11:08.570 --> 04:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
registration fees if I could just
 
04:11:11.030 --> 04:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
briefly explain as I said broker-dealers
 
04:11:13.309 --> 04:11:13.319 align:start position:0%
that conduct business in the state are
 
04:11:14.929 --> 04:11:14.939 align:start position:0%
required to pay an annual registration
 
04:11:17.990 --> 04:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
fee at the firm level and agents and
 
04:11:19.550 --> 04:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
then every Securities product depending
 
04:11:22.309 --> 04:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
upon the product will also pay an annual
 
04:11:25.670 --> 04:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
fee last year the bureau generated 24
 
04:11:29.929 --> 04:11:29.939 align:start position:0%
million in firm licensing fees and 23.6
 
04:11:31.729 --> 04:11:31.739 align:start position:0%
million in Securities project
 
04:11:33.830 --> 04:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
registration fees
 
04:11:36.110 --> 04:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
now as you look at that I would just ask
 
04:11:38.990 --> 04:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
that you not be alarmed by the uh 2023
 
04:11:41.750 --> 04:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year numbers uh that only shows
 
04:11:44.210 --> 04:11:44.220 align:start position:0%
currently 2.7 million uh in
 
04:11:46.070 --> 04:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
broker-dealer and investment advisor
 
04:11:48.110 --> 04:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
fees and that's largely due to the fact
 
04:11:50.570 --> 04:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
that the majority of those uh fees are
 
04:11:52.429 --> 04:11:52.439 align:start position:0%
booked during the month of January and
 
04:11:55.370 --> 04:11:55.380 align:start position:0%
are not yet reflected uh here however I
 
04:11:57.590 --> 04:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
did take a look prior to coming to the
 
04:12:00.590 --> 04:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
hearing today and we expect to see at
 
04:12:04.790 --> 04:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
least 16.2 million to be booked by
 
04:12:07.070 --> 04:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
month's end and ultimately we project
 
04:12:11.269 --> 04:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
that out to be 21.2 million for fiscal
 
04:12:13.309 --> 04:12:13.319 align:start position:0%
year 2023.
 
04:12:15.729 --> 04:12:15.739 align:start position:0%
on the Securities registration side
 
04:12:17.990 --> 04:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
those revenues have been relatively
 
04:12:19.849 --> 04:12:19.859 align:start position:0%
consistent over the past two or three
 
04:12:22.429 --> 04:12:22.439 align:start position:0%
years however they have not really grown
 
04:12:24.710 --> 04:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
at the same rate as I've shown you the
 
04:12:26.630 --> 04:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
past five years they haven't grown at
 
04:12:28.790 --> 04:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
the same rate as on the licensing side
 
04:12:31.130 --> 04:12:31.140 align:start position:0%
and I think that this is largely due to
 
04:12:34.070 --> 04:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
a continued contraction of the mutual
 
04:12:37.370 --> 04:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
fund industry firms have been looking at
 
04:12:39.410 --> 04:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
their family of funds and consolidating
 
04:12:43.250 --> 04:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
and we've seen reduction there however
 
04:12:46.969 --> 04:12:46.979 align:start position:0%
uh we do anticipate that we will settle
 
04:12:53.210 --> 04:12:53.220 align:start position:0%
out uh fiscal 2023 at 23.8 million most
 
04:12:54.950 --> 04:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
of that revenue is booked during the
 
04:12:56.929 --> 04:12:56.939 align:start position:0%
months of April and May when they all
 
04:12:58.370 --> 04:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
have to require they're required to
 
04:13:01.790 --> 04:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
renew by May 1st of of each year so
 
04:13:04.309 --> 04:13:04.319 align:start position:0%
overall looking at our at our bottom
 
04:13:07.130 --> 04:13:07.140 align:start position:0%
line the bureau is projecting for fiscal
 
04:13:10.610 --> 04:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
year 2023 to close at 45 million dollars
 
04:13:13.670 --> 04:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
which is an increase of 870 000 over
 
04:13:16.790 --> 04:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
last year or prior year and then similar
 
04:13:21.889 --> 04:13:21.899 align:start position:0%
growth in 2024 and 2025.
 
04:13:24.229 --> 04:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
um so that that's what we're currently
 
04:13:26.870 --> 04:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
showing for existing revenue and what we
 
04:13:29.269 --> 04:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
see the close of fiscal year and
 
04:13:31.309 --> 04:13:31.319 align:start position:0%
projected forward be happy to answer any
 
04:13:33.290 --> 04:13:33.300 align:start position:0%
questions Madam chair
 
04:13:34.969 --> 04:13:34.979 align:start position:0%
thank you that was wonderful uh
 
04:13:36.050 --> 04:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
questions around the room yes
 
04:13:38.450 --> 04:13:38.460 align:start position:0%
representative Schamberg just one
 
04:13:40.550 --> 04:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
question Madam chair uh on the last
 
04:13:43.670 --> 04:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
figure you gave you said the 170 000 was
 
04:13:49.309 --> 04:13:49.319 align:start position:0%
an increase well 24 and 25 beat plus 870
 
04:13:51.590 --> 04:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
or will it just be recorded
 
04:13:55.969 --> 04:13:55.979 align:start position:0%
uh 45 million 870 000. it would be uh
 
04:13:59.150 --> 04:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
showing 870 year over year yeah eight
 
04:14:03.769 --> 04:14:03.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:05.929 --> 04:14:05.939 align:start position:0%
representative Ames
 
04:14:07.370 --> 04:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:14:07.380 --> 04:14:08.510 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

04:14:08.510 --> 04:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:10.370 --> 04:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
with regard to your enforcement
 
04:14:10.380 --> 04:14:12.290 align:start position:0%
with regard to your enforcement
activities

04:14:12.290 --> 04:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
activities
 
04:14:15.229 --> 04:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
which are significant and uh
 
04:14:17.389 --> 04:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering about the interface with
 
04:14:18.830 --> 04:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office do you
 
04:14:21.650 --> 04:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
have your own legal staff that handle
 
04:14:24.590 --> 04:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
handle that legal work or do you work
 
04:14:26.990 --> 04:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
with the Attorney General's office uh
 
04:14:30.469 --> 04:14:30.479 align:start position:0%
yes uh to to both we do work with the
 
04:14:32.870 --> 04:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office when we see
 
04:14:35.750 --> 04:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
that a case elevates from civil to
 
04:14:39.469 --> 04:14:39.479 align:start position:0%
criminal uh and the criminal
 
04:14:41.450 --> 04:14:41.460 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and Authority actually you
 
04:14:42.950 --> 04:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
know to handle those matters but we do
 
04:14:45.650 --> 04:14:45.660 align:start position:0%
work very closely with them uh with
 
04:14:47.990 --> 04:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
respect to your initial uh inquiry
 
04:14:50.210 --> 04:14:50.220 align:start position:0%
question uh we do have attorneys on
 
04:14:53.050 --> 04:14:53.060 align:start position:0%
staff this is really highly complex
 
04:14:56.450 --> 04:14:56.460 align:start position:0%
material uh and it was when it comes to
 
04:14:58.150 --> 04:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions we're dealing with
 
04:15:01.910 --> 04:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh certainly large firms large law firms
 
04:15:03.830 --> 04:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
and you know they they just love the
 
04:15:06.170 --> 04:15:06.180 align:start position:0%
paper us and the administrative process
 
04:15:07.969 --> 04:15:07.979 align:start position:0%
does involve a series of motions and
 
04:15:11.150 --> 04:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
hearings and the like so uh it keeps us
 
04:15:13.250 --> 04:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
busy for certain
 
04:15:16.250 --> 04:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:18.710 --> 04:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:15:20.870 --> 04:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
oh yes representative Janine
 
04:15:23.030 --> 04:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
this might be thank you madam chair
 
04:15:24.769 --> 04:15:24.779 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question this
 
04:15:27.410 --> 04:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
might be a little bit unrelated but
 
04:15:29.929 --> 04:15:29.939 align:start position:0%
um I think you're in the right branch of
 
04:15:31.969 --> 04:15:31.979 align:start position:0%
the state to answer it and that is uh
 
04:15:35.689 --> 04:15:35.699 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin about a year ago I attempted to
 
04:15:38.809 --> 04:15:38.819 align:start position:0%
buy some Bitcoin and I wasn't able to it
 
04:15:40.309 --> 04:15:40.319 align:start position:0%
said New Hampshire you cannot buy
 
04:15:42.229 --> 04:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
Bitcoin in New Hampshire is that still
 
04:15:43.729 --> 04:15:43.739 align:start position:0%
true or do you know anything about that
 
04:15:46.969 --> 04:15:46.979 align:start position:0%
well they were they were firms that I
 
04:15:48.950 --> 04:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
can't speak with with real precisons
 
04:15:51.290 --> 04:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
here but as I understand
 
04:15:54.710 --> 04:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
um uh a year or two back that some of
 
04:15:56.450 --> 04:15:56.460 align:start position:0%
these entities were seeking licensure
 
04:15:57.650 --> 04:15:57.660 align:start position:0%
through the New Hampshire banking
 
04:16:00.170 --> 04:16:00.180 align:start position:0%
Department some of them as money
 
04:16:02.030 --> 04:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
transmitters which I guess that that
 
04:16:04.429 --> 04:16:04.439 align:start position:0%
means something in terms of the the type
 
04:16:06.469 --> 04:16:06.479 align:start position:0%
of activity that they do and they may
 
04:16:07.910 --> 04:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
characterize themselves as money
 
04:16:10.490 --> 04:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
transmitters but when in fact many of
 
04:16:12.410 --> 04:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
them are actually acting as a holding
 
04:16:15.650 --> 04:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
agent for for Bitcoin some offer to to
 
04:16:19.130 --> 04:16:19.140 align:start position:0%
buy and sell on behalf of a client uh so
 
04:16:22.729 --> 04:16:22.739 align:start position:0%
it was I I would have to uh guess if and
 
04:16:25.250 --> 04:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
I hate to guess but at that point in
 
04:16:26.510 --> 04:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
time they may have been seeking
 
04:16:29.510 --> 04:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
licensure and were not yet approved uh
 
04:16:31.670 --> 04:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
it's still a largely unregulated area
 
04:16:37.670 --> 04:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
frankly uh and we will see I believe the
 
04:16:39.830 --> 04:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
the SEC Securities Exchange Commission
 
04:16:42.170 --> 04:16:42.180 align:start position:0%
and other regulatory boughters maybe the
 
04:16:45.410 --> 04:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
body's a cftc uh you know may step in
 
04:16:47.450 --> 04:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
and regulate this space we're all aware
 
04:16:50.090 --> 04:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
of the more recent activities including
 
04:16:53.090 --> 04:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
you know FTX uh and some of the turmoil
 
04:16:55.969 --> 04:16:55.979 align:start position:0%
in the markets uh we have a couple
 
04:16:59.389 --> 04:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
pending actions right now uh it's it's
 
04:17:01.490 --> 04:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
an unsettled area and we really just
 
04:17:04.189 --> 04:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
caution uh folks who are considering
 
04:17:07.309 --> 04:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
investing that to be careful as far as
 
04:17:09.229 --> 04:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
who they're doing business with
 
04:17:09.239 --> 04:17:10.610 align:start position:0%

04:19:53.450 --> 04:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
from the legislative budget Assistance
 
04:19:53.460 --> 04:19:54.410 align:start position:0%
from the legislative budget Assistance
Office

04:19:54.410 --> 04:19:54.420 align:start position:0%
Office
 
04:19:58.010 --> 04:19:58.020 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to kind of start with who
 
04:20:00.349 --> 04:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
I am we did it briefly on the first day
 
04:20:02.210 --> 04:20:02.220 align:start position:0%
that you met your organization day but
 
04:20:04.010 --> 04:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
I'm the deputy legislative budget
 
04:20:06.830 --> 04:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
assistant I am assigned to Ways and
 
04:20:08.389 --> 04:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
Means to assist you with your revenues
 
04:20:10.130 --> 04:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
during the budget process as well as
 
04:20:11.990 --> 04:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
Public Works to help them with the
 
04:20:14.030 --> 04:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
capital budget so there may be some
 
04:20:15.650 --> 04:20:15.660 align:start position:0%
times when you're working on revenues
 
04:20:17.650 --> 04:20:17.660 align:start position:0%
that I got to pull next to the next door
 
04:20:20.030 --> 04:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
and and see what's going on with capital
 
04:20:23.510 --> 04:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
budget but we'll try to not do that
 
04:20:26.330 --> 04:20:26.340 align:start position:0%
um but our office if you did attend the
 
04:20:28.490 --> 04:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
economic briefing with Mike Kane the LBA
 
04:20:30.110 --> 04:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
did present he talked about our staffing
 
04:20:30.120 --> 04:20:31.070 align:start position:0%
did present he talked about our staffing
structure

04:20:31.070 --> 04:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
structure
 
04:20:33.170 --> 04:20:33.180 align:start position:0%
so we have in our budget side we have
 
04:20:34.849 --> 04:20:34.859 align:start position:0%
four analysts that are assigned to the
 
04:20:37.130 --> 04:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
finance committee and they have various
 
04:20:39.170 --> 04:20:39.180 align:start position:0%
expertise that they deal with and I just
 
04:20:42.050 --> 04:20:42.060 align:start position:0%
explained what I did and then Mike is
 
04:20:43.729 --> 04:20:43.739 align:start position:0%
the sixth person in our office is the
 
04:20:46.250 --> 04:20:46.260 align:start position:0%
LBA and he kind of oversees all of us to
 
04:20:47.809 --> 04:20:47.819 align:start position:0%
make sure we do our job and then we have
 
04:20:50.689 --> 04:20:50.699 align:start position:0%
an admin Pam Ellis who really runs the
 
04:20:51.950 --> 04:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
office and make sure we do what we need
 
04:20:55.309 --> 04:20:55.319 align:start position:0%
to do so most of our staff is located on
 
04:20:56.870 --> 04:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
our audit side and I think represent
 
04:20:58.130 --> 04:20:58.140 align:start position:0%
Schamberg has kind of hit it at home
 
04:20:59.330 --> 04:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
with some of the questions earlier
 
04:21:01.610 --> 04:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
throughout the day and that our office
 
04:21:03.530 --> 04:21:03.540 align:start position:0%
does audit state agencies we do
 
04:21:05.090 --> 04:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
Financial audits we do performance
 
04:21:08.030 --> 04:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
audits we do the Statewide audit so that
 
04:21:10.790 --> 04:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
we work with KPMG who we contract with
 
04:21:12.769 --> 04:21:12.779 align:start position:0%
and we assign staff to work with them to
 
04:21:14.809 --> 04:21:14.819 align:start position:0%
do that Statewide audit which is the act
 
04:21:17.030 --> 04:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
for that I handed out earlier today
 
04:21:20.269 --> 04:21:20.279 align:start position:0%
my purpose today right now is uh you
 
04:21:21.830 --> 04:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
know in the last two weeks you've been
 
04:21:23.570 --> 04:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
getting bombarded with a ton of
 
04:21:27.110 --> 04:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
information on the economy on revenues
 
04:21:29.929 --> 04:21:29.939 align:start position:0%
you know what trends are occurring
 
04:21:31.370 --> 04:21:31.380 align:start position:0%
and you're probably wondering what am I
 
04:21:32.510 --> 04:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to do with all this information
 
04:21:35.389 --> 04:21:35.399 align:start position:0%
and how do I organize it to meet the end
 
04:21:38.030 --> 04:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
line or the goal so that's what this
 
04:21:39.410 --> 04:21:39.420 align:start position:0%
packet is hopefully going to help you
 
04:21:41.450 --> 04:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
with and I'll start walking you through
 
04:21:44.090 --> 04:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
that so if you flip the page
 
04:21:46.130 --> 04:21:46.140 align:start position:0%
you'll see contact information for our
 
04:21:46.140 --> 04:21:48.229 align:start position:0%
you'll see contact information for our
office

04:21:48.229 --> 04:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
office
 
04:21:50.330 --> 04:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
under the telephone number you'll see
 
04:21:52.670 --> 04:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
our website and right beneath that is a
 
04:21:55.130 --> 04:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
specific link to the revenue documents
 
04:21:57.410 --> 04:21:57.420 align:start position:0%
so everything you're doing in here I'm
 
04:21:59.210 --> 04:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
trying to post to the website I say
 
04:22:00.650 --> 04:22:00.660 align:start position:0%
trying because it may take me a day or
 
04:22:03.769 --> 04:22:03.779 align:start position:0%
two but every presentation to date is on
 
04:22:05.050 --> 04:22:05.060 align:start position:0%
our website
 
04:22:07.130 --> 04:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
and if there's corrections I think
 
04:22:08.389 --> 04:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
there's two agencies that are going to
 
04:22:09.650 --> 04:22:09.660 align:start position:0%
correct slides that they had in their
 
04:22:11.269 --> 04:22:11.279 align:start position:0%
presentations we'll update that and I'll
 
04:22:13.790 --> 04:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
email the members that here's the
 
04:22:16.429 --> 04:22:16.439 align:start position:0%
updated version of the slide
 
04:22:18.290 --> 04:22:18.300 align:start position:0%
there's the contact information for each
 
04:22:19.849 --> 04:22:19.859 align:start position:0%
of us in the office a phone number and
 
04:22:20.929 --> 04:22:20.939 align:start position:0%
an email
 
04:22:22.429 --> 04:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
and then at the bottom of the page
 
04:22:24.650 --> 04:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
there's links to the Department of
 
04:22:26.090 --> 04:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
administrative services and revenue
 
04:22:30.530 --> 04:22:30.540 align:start position:0%
Administration both of those places have
 
04:22:32.389 --> 04:22:32.399 align:start position:0%
financial information that you may be
 
04:22:34.010 --> 04:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
interested in with the administrative
 
04:22:36.769 --> 04:22:36.779 align:start position:0%
Services it's the akfer so the revenue
 
04:22:38.870 --> 04:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
focus and the revenue plan and that link
 
04:22:41.210 --> 04:22:41.220 align:start position:0%
would take it to those documents
 
04:22:42.469 --> 04:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Revenue
 
04:22:44.710 --> 04:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
Administration it's their annual report
 
04:22:48.110 --> 04:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
as well as the tax tax expenditure
 
04:22:50.389 --> 04:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
report which is basically the report
 
04:22:51.950 --> 04:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
that's done to tell you what kind of
 
04:22:54.769 --> 04:22:54.779 align:start position:0%
credits we're given in the last I think
 
04:22:57.010 --> 04:22:57.020 align:start position:0%
they do for five years cycle
 
04:22:59.870 --> 04:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
so you'll hear things like the carry
 
04:23:02.769 --> 04:23:02.779 align:start position:0%
credit and how that's at 300 million
 
04:23:05.269 --> 04:23:05.279 align:start position:0%
that's caught up in the tax expenditure
 
04:23:08.030 --> 04:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
report you know BPT credits against the
 
04:23:08.040 --> 04:23:09.469 align:start position:0%
report you know BPT credits against the
BET

04:23:09.469 --> 04:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
BET
 
04:23:10.910 --> 04:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
um you know those types of things are
 
04:23:13.689 --> 04:23:13.699 align:start position:0%
found within that tax expenditure report
 
04:23:16.910 --> 04:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
so that first page is just a good
 
04:23:18.229 --> 04:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
reference tool if you have questions
 
04:23:21.290 --> 04:23:21.300 align:start position:0%
email me call me do whatever you need to
 
04:23:22.729 --> 04:23:22.739 align:start position:0%
do to get in touch with me I will
 
04:23:24.250 --> 04:23:24.260 align:start position:0%
respond to you it just may not be
 
04:23:26.689 --> 04:23:26.699 align:start position:0%
immediately and maybe it may take a few
 
04:23:27.950 --> 04:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
minutes to get back to you but I will
 
04:23:29.990 --> 04:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
get back to you
 
04:23:33.170 --> 04:23:33.180 align:start position:0%
the rest of the document is basically
 
04:23:34.490 --> 04:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
going to just kind of walk you through
 
04:23:35.870 --> 04:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
the process that you're going to go
 
04:23:35.880 --> 04:23:36.769 align:start position:0%
the process that you're going to go
through

04:23:36.769 --> 04:23:36.779 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:23:39.889 --> 04:23:39.899 align:start position:0%
so page one is just some assorted
 
04:23:41.510 --> 04:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
acronyms and terms that you might hear
 
04:23:43.849 --> 04:23:43.859 align:start position:0%
you know you heard Road told today you
 
04:23:47.150 --> 04:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
heard gas tax those two are go together
 
04:23:49.969 --> 04:23:49.979 align:start position:0%
the turnpike tools are not the same as
 
04:23:51.710 --> 04:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
the road toll and and that gets
 
04:23:54.110 --> 04:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
confusing sometimes for people you might
 
04:23:56.150 --> 04:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
hear about the rainy day fund well
 
04:23:57.530 --> 04:23:57.540 align:start position:0%
that's also considered the revenue
 
04:24:00.469 --> 04:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
stabilization fund so I just tried to
 
04:24:04.010 --> 04:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:06.349 --> 04:24:06.359 align:start position:0%
few acronyms or abbreviations you might
 
04:24:08.090 --> 04:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
hear through your process here you'll
 
04:24:10.309 --> 04:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
hear about House Bill 2 uh Liquor
 
04:24:12.170 --> 04:24:12.180 align:start position:0%
Commission provided some language that
 
04:24:14.150 --> 04:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
they're going to ask be included in
 
04:24:15.769 --> 04:24:15.779 align:start position:0%
House Bill too House Bill 2 is
 
04:24:17.870 --> 04:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
considered the trailer bill of the
 
04:24:20.570 --> 04:24:20.580 align:start position:0%
operating budget so the operating budget
 
04:24:22.189 --> 04:24:22.199 align:start position:0%
is House Bill one typically and that's
 
04:24:25.130 --> 04:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
the numbers and the revenue unrestricted
 
04:24:27.650 --> 04:24:27.660 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates will go into that if
 
04:24:29.510 --> 04:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
there's legislative changes that need to
 
04:24:31.849 --> 04:24:31.859 align:start position:0%
occur changes in statute that can't be
 
04:24:33.290 --> 04:24:33.300 align:start position:0%
done in house bill one it needs to be
 
04:24:35.269 --> 04:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
done in this trailer Bill and so that
 
04:24:37.250 --> 04:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
gets introduced when the governor comes
 
04:24:39.530 --> 04:24:39.540 align:start position:0%
forward he'll introduce both versions as
 
04:24:41.990 --> 04:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
well as the capital budget and then um
 
04:24:45.469 --> 04:24:45.479 align:start position:0%
you guys will be off and running
 
04:24:47.090 --> 04:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
um page two
 
04:24:49.729 --> 04:24:49.739 align:start position:0%
is just to give you a here's the tax
 
04:24:51.950 --> 04:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
rates as they are at this moment and I
 
04:24:53.630 --> 04:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
did put in where some are changing or
 
04:24:56.330 --> 04:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
have just changed and then to give you
 
04:24:57.769 --> 04:24:57.779 align:start position:0%
the split of where they might go so the
 
04:24:59.929 --> 04:24:59.939 align:start position:0%
business profits tax
 
04:25:03.950 --> 04:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
um the rate just went down to 7.5
 
04:25:06.469 --> 04:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
for a periods ending on or after 12 31
 
04:25:09.290 --> 04:25:09.300 align:start position:0%
23 and you can see that six percent of
 
04:25:10.790 --> 04:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
that collected will go into the general
 
04:25:13.370 --> 04:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
fund 1.5 percent of that collected will
 
04:25:15.349 --> 04:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
go into the education trust fund and
 
04:25:17.330 --> 04:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
that's statutorily set and there's some
 
04:25:22.070 --> 04:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:23.510 --> 04:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm just going to keep kind of
 
04:25:24.769 --> 04:25:24.779 align:start position:0%
chugging along because I know it's
 
04:25:25.969 --> 04:25:25.979 align:start position:0%
snowing out and people may be looking
 
04:25:29.330 --> 04:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
out the window go to page four
 
04:25:31.189 --> 04:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
this is a document that our office has
 
04:25:32.689 --> 04:25:32.699 align:start position:0%
prepared for this committee for a number
 
04:25:34.070 --> 04:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
of years
 
04:25:34.080 --> 04:25:34.670 align:start position:0%
of years
um

04:25:34.670 --> 04:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:37.969 --> 04:25:37.979 align:start position:0%
well over 10 years and what we do here
 
04:25:39.229 --> 04:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
is we try to take all the information
 
04:25:40.910 --> 04:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
you're getting as it relates to
 
04:25:43.010 --> 04:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenue and the
 
04:25:44.570 --> 04:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
unrestricted Revenue that you're dealing
 
04:25:47.450 --> 04:25:47.460 align:start position:0%
with is general fund education trust
 
04:25:51.050 --> 04:25:51.060 align:start position:0%
fund Highway fund and Fish and Game fund
 
04:25:53.210 --> 04:25:53.220 align:start position:0%
so those are the four areas that you'll
 
04:25:56.570 --> 04:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
be addressing you've heard uh mention of
 
04:25:58.429 --> 04:25:58.439 align:start position:0%
the turnpike fund as a restricted fund
 
04:26:00.229 --> 04:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
there's a number of funds that have
 
04:26:03.769 --> 04:26:03.779 align:start position:0%
already been designated for a purpose by
 
04:26:06.050 --> 04:26:06.060 align:start position:0%
the legislature over the years and those
 
04:26:08.269 --> 04:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
would be budgeted for those purposes and
 
04:26:09.649 --> 04:26:09.659 align:start position:0%
they'd be dealt with in the operating
 
04:26:11.990 --> 04:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
budget but you don't have to set the
 
04:26:17.809 --> 04:26:17.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:20.450 --> 04:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
so if you flip the page six
 
04:26:23.689 --> 04:26:23.699 align:start position:0%
dra will come in right now we're they're
 
04:26:25.309 --> 04:26:25.319 align:start position:0%
coming in on the seventh to do kind of a
 
04:26:27.290 --> 04:26:27.300 align:start position:0%
high level presentation to you they're
 
04:26:28.849 --> 04:26:28.859 align:start position:0%
not going to give you numbers at that
 
04:26:30.050 --> 04:26:30.060 align:start position:0%
point it's just going to be to explain
 
04:26:32.210 --> 04:26:32.220 align:start position:0%
the tax and how they would do their
 
04:26:34.010 --> 04:26:34.020 align:start position:0%
estimates they're going to come back on
 
04:26:37.670 --> 04:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
the 22nd and provide you their revenue
 
04:26:39.649 --> 04:26:39.659 align:start position:0%
estimate ranges for the various taxes
 
04:26:40.910 --> 04:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
that they collect
 
04:26:43.010 --> 04:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
what I end up doing is putting it in a
 
04:26:44.570 --> 04:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
page like this and I'll give you the
 
04:26:46.250 --> 04:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
high low range that they give you for
 
04:26:47.450 --> 04:26:47.460 align:start position:0%
the year
 
04:26:48.769 --> 04:26:48.779 align:start position:0%
so the current year we're in would be
 
04:26:50.990 --> 04:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
2023 and then they have some growth
 
04:26:52.610 --> 04:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
percentages that they might apply and
 
04:26:54.889 --> 04:26:54.899 align:start position:0%
then I'll put those in the low high
 
04:27:00.290 --> 04:27:00.300 align:start position:0%
going to the 22 and 23 or 24 25.
 
04:27:01.849 --> 04:27:01.859 align:start position:0%
then when you flip the page to page
 
04:27:01.859 --> 04:27:06.590 align:start position:0%
then when you flip the page to page
seven

04:27:06.590 --> 04:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:08.990 --> 04:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to see the current fiscal
 
04:27:11.210 --> 04:27:11.220 align:start position:0%
year that just completed so fiscal year
 
04:27:13.010 --> 04:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
22 and so in this case it's because it's
 
04:27:15.110 --> 04:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
last Cycles you're going to see fiscal
 
04:27:19.189 --> 04:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
year 20 but you would see 22 23 24 and
 
04:27:19.199 --> 04:27:20.750 align:start position:0%
year 20 but you would see 22 23 24 and
25.

04:27:20.750 --> 04:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
25.
 
04:27:22.729 --> 04:27:22.739 align:start position:0%
22 would show you what the official plan
 
04:27:24.950 --> 04:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
was and then what the year closed out at
 
04:27:26.990 --> 04:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
so you get a sense of that page I
 
04:27:28.490 --> 04:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
suggested you look at in the act for
 
04:27:30.769 --> 04:27:30.779 align:start position:0%
just before lunch that would be carried
 
04:27:32.090 --> 04:27:32.100 align:start position:0%
forward here so you could see that and
 
04:27:34.849 --> 04:27:34.859 align:start position:0%
see the difference and then on 20 for
 
04:27:37.550 --> 04:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 3 we would load in what
 
04:27:40.070 --> 04:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
the revenue plan is that was developed
 
04:27:42.349 --> 04:27:42.359 align:start position:0%
after the last operating budget and then
 
04:27:43.910 --> 04:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
we'd give you the governor's estimate so
 
04:27:44.990 --> 04:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
the governor is going to be coming out
 
04:27:47.389 --> 04:27:47.399 align:start position:0%
with his operating budget which would
 
04:27:49.550 --> 04:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
include revenues on Valentine's Day
 
04:27:52.189 --> 04:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
February 14th I believe he's going to be
 
04:27:55.010 --> 04:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
presenting to the house and the Senate
 
04:27:56.689 --> 04:27:56.699 align:start position:0%
um and so that at that point that
 
04:27:58.130 --> 04:27:58.140 align:start position:0%
information would be public and we'd
 
04:27:59.809 --> 04:27:59.819 align:start position:0%
have that information to load into this
 
04:27:59.819 --> 04:28:01.610 align:start position:0%
have that information to load into this
document

04:28:01.610 --> 04:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
document
 
04:28:01.620 --> 04:28:02.210 align:start position:0%
document
um

04:28:02.210 --> 04:28:02.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:03.769 --> 04:28:03.779 align:start position:0%
and then we wouldn't we start to
 
04:28:06.050 --> 04:28:06.060 align:start position:0%
incorporate the Agency information that
 
04:28:07.490 --> 04:28:07.500 align:start position:0%
you've been hearing today and then you
 
04:28:09.290 --> 04:28:09.300 align:start position:0%
will hear as you go forward and we put
 
04:28:11.929 --> 04:28:11.939 align:start position:0%
it high in a low mainly for the dra
 
04:28:13.429 --> 04:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
estimates because most agencies just
 
04:28:14.870 --> 04:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
give you a single number as you've seen
 
04:28:17.269 --> 04:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
today they don't give you a high low as
 
04:28:22.969 --> 04:28:22.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:24.889 --> 04:28:24.899 align:start position:0%
when we do this document I keep
 
04:28:28.130 --> 04:28:28.140 align:start position:0%
everything combined at I don't split out
 
04:28:29.870 --> 04:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
the General on the education trust fund
 
04:28:31.250 --> 04:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
I keep it combined as you're doing your
 
04:28:33.830 --> 04:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
estimates and then after you're done
 
04:28:35.149 --> 04:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
with your estimates we'll split out
 
04:28:37.550 --> 04:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
we'll do the splits to show how much is
 
04:28:39.170 --> 04:28:39.180 align:start position:0%
general fund how much is education trust
 
04:28:41.030 --> 04:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
fund but if you look at the top of the
 
04:28:43.250 --> 04:28:43.260 align:start position:0%
columns you know a b c you'll see
 
04:28:46.130 --> 04:28:46.140 align:start position:0%
General gen and ETF that just means that
 
04:28:48.290 --> 04:28:48.300 align:start position:0%
that Revenue Source goes to both those
 
04:28:48.300 --> 04:28:49.370 align:start position:0%
that Revenue Source goes to both those
funds

04:28:49.370 --> 04:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
funds
 
04:28:51.530 --> 04:28:51.540 align:start position:0%
you'll see that liquor transfer is just
 
04:28:56.809 --> 04:28:56.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:59.149 --> 04:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
you do this we do the same thing to the
 
04:29:06.349 --> 04:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:07.790 --> 04:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
. and for the highway fund you only have
 
04:29:10.070 --> 04:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
three Revenue sources essentially
 
04:29:12.349 --> 04:29:12.359 align:start position:0%
you have the road toll you have the
 
04:29:14.689 --> 04:29:14.699 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles which is the and then the
 
04:29:16.070 --> 04:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous the miscellaneous is what
 
04:29:18.649 --> 04:29:18.659 align:start position:0%
you just heard from dot so all the the
 
04:29:20.870 --> 04:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
page that you you saw from safety that
 
04:29:22.130 --> 04:29:22.140 align:start position:0%
listed out all the different Revenue
 
04:29:24.530 --> 04:29:24.540 align:start position:0%
sources I roll that up to give you these
 
04:29:26.750 --> 04:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
numbers as you see here and under each
 
04:29:31.849 --> 04:29:31.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:35.450 --> 04:29:35.460 align:start position:0%
fishing game again the same thing
 
04:29:38.030 --> 04:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
so so that's the working document that
 
04:29:39.769 --> 04:29:39.779 align:start position:0%
I'll be producing for this committee as
 
04:29:42.290 --> 04:29:42.300 align:start position:0%
you go through the process so you have a
 
04:29:44.950 --> 04:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
meeting you've made some suggested
 
04:29:46.729 --> 04:29:46.739 align:start position:0%
suggestions on what you think the
 
04:29:48.710 --> 04:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
estimate should be I would put populate
 
04:29:50.809 --> 04:29:50.819 align:start position:0%
the document re
 
04:29:52.250 --> 04:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
um send it to you so you'd have it come
 
04:29:55.010 --> 04:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
to the next meeting with hard copies and
 
04:29:56.990 --> 04:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
go through that whole process
 
04:29:58.250 --> 04:29:58.260 align:start position:0%
you'll get to a point where this
 
04:29:59.570 --> 04:29:59.580 align:start position:0%
committee will say
 
04:30:02.030 --> 04:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
we agree that these are the numbers and
 
04:30:03.769 --> 04:30:03.779 align:start position:0%
you vote that these are unrestricted
 
04:30:05.510 --> 04:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
revenues that we want to present
 
04:30:08.090 --> 04:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
at that point what we've done is we've
 
04:30:10.250 --> 04:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
worked to get a house resolution so if
 
04:30:12.349 --> 04:30:12.359 align:start position:0%
you turn to page 14
 
04:30:13.610 --> 04:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
you'll see last time it was house
 
04:30:15.830 --> 04:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
resolution number 11 the chair of the
 
04:30:17.929 --> 04:30:17.939 align:start position:0%
committee is the sponsor
 
04:30:20.510 --> 04:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
and if you flip to page 15
 
04:30:23.570 --> 04:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
basically we restate the current fiscal
 
04:30:24.710 --> 04:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
year we're in we'll give you what the
 
04:30:26.450 --> 04:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
official plan was and then if this
 
04:30:27.950 --> 04:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
committee has made adjustments to that
 
04:30:29.809 --> 04:30:29.819 align:start position:0%
so if you say
 
04:30:32.689 --> 04:30:32.699 align:start position:0%
um the business tax revenue is going to
 
04:30:35.210 --> 04:30:35.220 align:start position:0%
be 25 million dollars higher than what
 
04:30:37.490 --> 04:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
the existing plan is that would be what
 
04:30:39.469 --> 04:30:39.479 align:start position:0%
would be the committee estimate and so
 
04:30:40.969 --> 04:30:40.979 align:start position:0%
that would show up in this
 
04:30:43.250 --> 04:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
and then whatever the estimates would be
 
04:30:46.250 --> 04:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
for 24 and 25. so the official plan
 
04:30:48.950 --> 04:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
which gets um presented at the end of
 
04:30:50.929 --> 04:30:50.939 align:start position:0%
the operating budget doesn't change
 
04:30:52.729 --> 04:30:52.739 align:start position:0%
throughout the process administrative
 
04:30:55.729 --> 04:30:55.739 align:start position:0%
Services takes the information and does
 
04:30:57.889 --> 04:30:57.899 align:start position:0%
the all their work from the existing
 
04:30:59.269 --> 04:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
Revenue plan and I'll get to that in
 
04:31:00.830 --> 04:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
just a second
 
04:31:02.889 --> 04:31:02.899 align:start position:0%
so this house resolution is typically
 
04:31:06.250 --> 04:31:06.260 align:start position:0%
offered to the full body to to consider
 
04:31:09.349 --> 04:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
and then after the discussion is had
 
04:31:11.750 --> 04:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
with that in the past the committee the
 
04:31:15.290 --> 04:31:15.300 align:start position:0%
house has tabled this resolution so you
 
04:31:17.990 --> 04:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
you vote on it and then you table it and
 
04:31:19.370 --> 04:31:19.380 align:start position:0%
just let it sit there
 
04:31:20.929 --> 04:31:20.939 align:start position:0%
from that
 
04:31:22.969 --> 04:31:22.979 align:start position:0%
I provide the finance committee with
 
04:31:24.830 --> 04:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
your unrestricted revenues that will end
 
04:31:27.769 --> 04:31:27.779 align:start position:0%
up in the back of house bill one
 
04:31:29.929 --> 04:31:29.939 align:start position:0%
so if you turn to page 18 that's the
 
04:31:31.370 --> 04:31:31.380 align:start position:0%
start of what would be considered House
 
04:31:34.010 --> 04:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
Bill one house bill one again is the all
 
04:31:35.269 --> 04:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
the numbers
 
04:31:36.950 --> 04:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
at the back of house bill one there's
 
04:31:38.750 --> 04:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
what we call sections back of the budget
 
04:31:42.410 --> 04:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
sections they so Pages 19
 
04:31:44.929 --> 04:31:44.939 align:start position:0%
through 24 are what we call back of the
 
04:31:46.790 --> 04:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
budget section so there's some budget
 
04:31:49.309 --> 04:31:49.319 align:start position:0%
notes there's some can language related
 
04:31:51.830 --> 04:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
to Lottery and then there may be some
 
04:31:54.830 --> 04:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
additional Appropriations for agencies
 
04:31:58.550 --> 04:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
there should not be any RSA restrictions
 
04:32:00.769 --> 04:32:00.779 align:start position:0%
or changes here it's just how they can
 
04:32:04.370 --> 04:32:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:06.830 --> 04:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
but you get to page 23
 
04:32:10.010 --> 04:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
those would be your unrestricted Revenue
 
04:32:10.020 --> 04:32:11.929 align:start position:0%
those would be your unrestricted Revenue
estimates

04:32:11.929 --> 04:32:11.939 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
04:32:14.330 --> 04:32:14.340 align:start position:0%
your Revenue estimates are based on
 
04:32:15.769 --> 04:32:15.779 align:start position:0%
current law
 
04:32:17.630 --> 04:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
so you this committee May deal with a
 
04:32:19.849 --> 04:32:19.859 align:start position:0%
bill you may agree on a bill and pass it
 
04:32:22.870 --> 04:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
out of here it may pass the Full House
 
04:32:26.389 --> 04:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
your Revenue estimates don't change here
 
04:32:28.070 --> 04:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
we track that on what we call the
 
04:32:30.050 --> 04:32:30.060 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement and I'll show you that
 
04:32:35.330 --> 04:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:37.429 --> 04:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
and if anybody has any questions please
 
04:32:39.469 --> 04:32:39.479 align:start position:0%
stop me
 
04:32:39.479 --> 04:32:47.389 align:start position:0%
stop me
yep

04:32:47.389 --> 04:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:50.870 --> 04:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
back on page 15 and 16.
 
04:32:55.070 --> 04:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
the the column that says 2021 on here is
 
04:32:58.969 --> 04:32:58.979 align:start position:0%
going to say 2023. correct so
 
04:33:02.389 --> 04:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
are we involved with that yes so okay
 
04:33:04.730 --> 04:33:04.740 align:start position:0%
yep so so what this committee is doing
 
04:33:06.830 --> 04:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
is that because it's been almost 18
 
04:33:08.570 --> 04:33:08.580 align:start position:0%
months since the revenue plans have been
 
04:33:08.580 --> 04:33:09.650 align:start position:0%
months since the revenue plans have been
set

04:33:09.650 --> 04:33:09.660 align:start position:0%
set
 
04:33:11.810 --> 04:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
thing you have a better view of what's
 
04:33:13.970 --> 04:33:13.980 align:start position:0%
going on we know that Revenue was about
 
04:33:16.189 --> 04:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
400 million dollars ahead of projections
 
04:33:18.470 --> 04:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
last year you're seeing some trending
 
04:33:20.449 --> 04:33:20.459 align:start position:0%
this year where revenue is already over
 
04:33:22.609 --> 04:33:22.619 align:start position:0%
200 million dollars ahead of plan is
 
04:33:24.590 --> 04:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
that going going to continue or not
 
04:33:26.570 --> 04:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
there'll be some discussions in this
 
04:33:28.970 --> 04:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
committee based on what you've heard
 
04:33:30.590 --> 04:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
um from the various presentations
 
04:33:31.910 --> 04:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
earlier what you're going to hear from
 
04:33:33.289 --> 04:33:33.299 align:start position:0%
the agencies going forward and you'll
 
04:33:35.330 --> 04:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
make some decisions about what you
 
04:33:37.849 --> 04:33:37.859 align:start position:0%
believe where you believe the revenues
 
04:33:40.551 --> 04:33:40.561 align:start position:0%
will end for fiscal year 23 which may be
 
04:33:41.869 --> 04:33:41.879 align:start position:0%
different than what the official plan
 
04:33:41.879 --> 04:33:43.609 align:start position:0%
different than what the official plan
was

04:33:43.609 --> 04:33:43.619 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:33:46.310 --> 04:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
the column that says official estimate
 
04:33:48.051 --> 04:33:48.061 align:start position:0%
is was that is that the original
 
04:33:51.289 --> 04:33:51.299 align:start position:0%
estimate yes okay yep
 
04:33:51.299 --> 04:34:05.769 align:start position:0%
estimate yes okay yep
yep

04:34:05.769 --> 04:34:05.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:08.990 --> 04:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
everybody's all set I'll continue on
 
04:34:11.449 --> 04:34:11.459 align:start position:0%
um if you go to page 25 that's the start
 
04:34:13.670 --> 04:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
of um
 
04:34:16.070 --> 04:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
the general fund education trust fund
 
04:34:18.709 --> 04:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement so our office will
 
04:34:20.990 --> 04:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
manage this through the finance with the
 
04:34:22.310 --> 04:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
finance division as they're making
 
04:34:22.320 --> 04:34:24.051 align:start position:0%
finance division as they're making
decisions

04:34:24.051 --> 04:34:24.061 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
04:34:24.061 --> 04:34:24.769 align:start position:0%
decisions
um

04:34:24.769 --> 04:34:24.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:27.410 --> 04:34:27.420 align:start position:0%
so as I started to say your Revenue
 
04:34:29.209 --> 04:34:29.219 align:start position:0%
estimates are on current law but if a
 
04:34:31.369 --> 04:34:31.379 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass the full body were to
 
04:34:33.230 --> 04:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
adopt that had an impact on your Revenue
 
04:34:37.970 --> 04:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
we would make an adjustment on the um
 
04:34:39.709 --> 04:34:39.719 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement so if you turn to page
 
04:34:39.719 --> 04:34:41.810 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement so if you turn to page
29

04:34:41.810 --> 04:34:41.820 align:start position:0%
29
 
04:34:43.369 --> 04:34:43.379 align:start position:0%
it's going to be schedule two at the top
 
04:34:44.570 --> 04:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
of it
 
04:34:46.670 --> 04:34:46.680 align:start position:0%
and you'll see Row one says Revenue
 
04:34:48.650 --> 04:34:48.660 align:start position:0%
adjustments excuse me Revenue
 
04:34:51.189 --> 04:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
adjustments and then rows
 
04:34:54.310 --> 04:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
basically 2 through 13 are all
 
04:34:57.170 --> 04:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
adjustments that occurred throughout the
 
04:35:00.289 --> 04:35:00.299 align:start position:0%
budget building process
 
04:35:01.429 --> 04:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
now you're going to see what the
 
04:35:02.929 --> 04:35:02.939 align:start position:0%
governor had you're going to see what
 
04:35:04.250 --> 04:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
the house does you'll be able to see
 
04:35:05.990 --> 04:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
what the Senate does and then when it
 
04:35:07.189 --> 04:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
gets time to committee a conference
 
04:35:11.209 --> 04:35:11.219 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:13.310 --> 04:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
we also do the same thing obviously for
 
04:35:15.289 --> 04:35:15.299 align:start position:0%
anything that impacts the expenditure
 
04:35:16.789 --> 04:35:16.799 align:start position:0%
side of the equation too and that's the
 
04:35:19.369 --> 04:35:19.379 align:start position:0%
bottom half of the page going on to the
 
04:35:24.109 --> 04:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:26.650 --> 04:35:26.660 align:start position:0%
rips and games
 
04:35:28.789 --> 04:35:28.799 align:start position:0%
just want to point out and you can
 
04:35:32.150 --> 04:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
confirm this that this is an active
 
04:35:35.150 --> 04:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
document that you keep posted up to date
 
04:35:37.131 --> 04:35:37.141 align:start position:0%
as you're going through a process that
 
04:35:40.010 --> 04:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
not all of us are privy to because it
 
04:35:42.170 --> 04:35:42.180 align:start position:0%
just can't be that way you know so
 
04:35:45.170 --> 04:35:45.180 align:start position:0%
decisions are made there's an adjustment
 
04:35:47.150 --> 04:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
that needs to be made it reaches that
 
04:35:51.470 --> 04:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
point in this Surplus statement then the
 
04:35:53.289 --> 04:35:53.299 align:start position:0%
end of the day or whenever
 
04:35:56.570 --> 04:35:56.580 align:start position:0%
lbao will be updating what's posted
 
04:35:58.369 --> 04:35:58.379 align:start position:0%
there isn't that is that correct so we
 
04:36:01.369 --> 04:36:01.379 align:start position:0%
WE Post all the Surplus statement would
 
04:36:03.529 --> 04:36:03.539 align:start position:0%
be at the end that we'll start with one
 
04:36:04.970 --> 04:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
I think Mike talked about doing a
 
04:36:06.949 --> 04:36:06.959 align:start position:0%
snapshot when it comes time
 
04:36:08.750 --> 04:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
and that's basically just taking where
 
04:36:11.510 --> 04:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
we're at today at this moment then we'll
 
04:36:12.949 --> 04:36:12.959 align:start position:0%
start building the Surplus statement
 
04:36:15.230 --> 04:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
based on what the governor has done and
 
04:36:17.750 --> 04:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
then as finance committee starts to make
 
04:36:17.760 --> 04:36:19.429 align:start position:0%
then as finance committee starts to make
decisions

04:36:19.429 --> 04:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
04:36:21.349 --> 04:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
there'll be some adjustments but also as
 
04:36:23.869 --> 04:36:23.879 align:start position:0%
the committee start to pass bills so if
 
04:36:25.609 --> 04:36:25.619 align:start position:0%
your committee not your committee but if
 
04:36:27.529 --> 04:36:27.539 align:start position:0%
a committee passes a bill that say has
 
04:36:29.990 --> 04:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
appropriation in it and the full body
 
04:36:31.730 --> 04:36:31.740 align:start position:0%
adopts that we would carry it on this
 
04:36:33.070 --> 04:36:33.080 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement
 
04:36:35.330 --> 04:36:35.340 align:start position:0%
so that you have the what we would call
 
04:36:37.189 --> 04:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
the house position
 
04:36:39.470 --> 04:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
so that you you know this is what we as
 
04:36:41.631 --> 04:36:41.641 align:start position:0%
the body had supported and that that
 
04:36:43.070 --> 04:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
becomes important when you get to the
 
04:36:44.689 --> 04:36:44.699 align:start position:0%
committee conference time so you know
 
04:36:47.269 --> 04:36:47.279 align:start position:0%
what your positions were so you if you
 
04:36:49.189 --> 04:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
want to negotiate with the Senate they
 
04:36:50.449 --> 04:36:50.459 align:start position:0%
know what their positions were and you
 
04:36:51.769 --> 04:36:51.779 align:start position:0%
can come to some hopefully some
 
04:36:53.631 --> 04:36:53.641 align:start position:0%
consensus that works and gets a an
 
04:36:56.209 --> 04:36:56.219 align:start position:0%
agreed upon final product
 
04:36:56.219 --> 04:36:57.890 align:start position:0%
agreed upon final product
um

04:36:57.890 --> 04:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:00.650 --> 04:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
so at the end of the finance phase there
 
04:37:02.750 --> 04:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
would be an updated Surplus statement at
 
04:37:05.330 --> 04:37:05.340 align:start position:0%
the end of the Senate Finance stage that
 
04:37:08.449 --> 04:37:08.459 align:start position:0%
would be an updated Surplus statement
 
04:37:08.459 --> 04:37:09.109 align:start position:0%
would be an updated Surplus statement
um

04:37:09.109 --> 04:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:11.209 --> 04:37:11.219 align:start position:0%
yet when the Full House or full Senate
 
04:37:13.070 --> 04:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
votes on it if there was any changes to
 
04:37:13.080 --> 04:37:13.970 align:start position:0%
votes on it if there was any changes to
the

04:37:13.970 --> 04:37:13.980 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:37:15.470 --> 04:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
um the budget bills at that time if
 
04:37:16.849 --> 04:37:16.859 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment adopted and it
 
04:37:18.470 --> 04:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
needed to update the Surplus we would do
 
04:37:21.410 --> 04:37:21.420 align:start position:0%
that as well it'll all be on our website
 
04:37:23.150 --> 04:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
but you're correct in building the
 
04:37:25.131 --> 04:37:25.141 align:start position:0%
document it's not like we show it every
 
04:37:27.051 --> 04:37:27.061 align:start position:0%
day like oh here's a new line because
 
04:37:29.689 --> 04:37:29.699 align:start position:0%
something's come on and off
 
04:37:32.750 --> 04:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
um the best laid plans you know that you
 
04:37:34.970 --> 04:37:34.980 align:start position:0%
think a commit the body might adopt
 
04:37:36.529 --> 04:37:36.539 align:start position:0%
something and then they don't you know
 
04:37:38.929 --> 04:37:38.939 align:start position:0%
maybe an item gets tabled
 
04:37:40.310 --> 04:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
um you know the all indication was it
 
04:37:41.810 --> 04:37:41.820 align:start position:0%
was going to pass but in the end they
 
04:37:43.670 --> 04:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
decide the table it
 
04:37:45.529 --> 04:37:45.539 align:start position:0%
so we don't include that because it's
 
04:37:48.051 --> 04:37:48.061 align:start position:0%
not I'm active at that moment
 
04:37:48.061 --> 04:37:51.470 align:start position:0%
not I'm active at that moment
representative

04:37:51.470 --> 04:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:53.929 --> 04:37:53.939 align:start position:0%
I'm just so I understand I'm reading
 
04:37:55.551 --> 04:37:55.561 align:start position:0%
this right
 
04:37:55.561 --> 04:37:56.150 align:start position:0%
this right
um

04:37:56.150 --> 04:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:59.029 --> 04:37:59.039 align:start position:0%
so all of these numbers are like
 
04:38:01.070 --> 04:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
Governor house senate committee of
 
04:38:04.310 --> 04:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
conference the numbers are either adding
 
04:38:06.769 --> 04:38:06.779 align:start position:0%
or subtracting to the appropriation
 
04:38:10.490 --> 04:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
right to the the the top Revenue number
 
04:38:13.929 --> 04:38:13.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:16.609 --> 04:38:16.619 align:start position:0%
uh yeah number 29.
 
04:38:19.429 --> 04:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
20 yep so if you see brackets it's a
 
04:38:21.170 --> 04:38:21.180 align:start position:0%
negative if you see no bracket it's a
 
04:38:25.730 --> 04:38:25.740 align:start position:0%
positive so row row two is in 500 000
 
04:38:27.289 --> 04:38:27.299 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:38:29.631 --> 04:38:29.641 align:start position:0%
um 2.1 million and 23 of additional
 
04:38:31.609 --> 04:38:31.619 align:start position:0%
Revenue that would be expected to be
 
04:38:33.410 --> 04:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
generated as a result of adding these
 
04:38:35.090 --> 04:38:35.100 align:start position:0%
Auditors okay
 
04:38:37.429 --> 04:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
um row four
 
04:38:40.551 --> 04:38:40.561 align:start position:0%
was a decrease in the meals tax yep so
 
04:38:42.289 --> 04:38:42.299 align:start position:0%
so we're taking that out taking that out
 
04:38:45.230 --> 04:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
I see so we get Governor house senate
 
04:38:47.929 --> 04:38:47.939 align:start position:0%
yep the committee of conference and
 
04:38:49.910 --> 04:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's all right and then we end up with
 
04:38:52.490 --> 04:38:52.500 align:start position:0%
the final number because as as you've
 
04:38:54.590 --> 04:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
heard and probably are aware you need a
 
04:38:55.910 --> 04:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
balanced budget by the time you're done
 
04:38:58.490 --> 04:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
so we account for all that stuff that
 
04:39:01.010 --> 04:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
occurs we put it in the wash and and
 
04:39:02.330 --> 04:39:02.340 align:start position:0%
hopefully it comes out with a balance
 
04:39:03.830 --> 04:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
with some sort of a surplus so that you
 
04:39:05.269 --> 04:39:05.279 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of wiggle room
 
04:39:07.429 --> 04:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
04:39:10.189 --> 04:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
so so the what we're just looking at now
 
04:39:12.830 --> 04:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
the one that's on page 29 that doesn't
 
04:39:17.029 --> 04:39:17.039 align:start position:0%
this doesn't really appear until after
 
04:39:20.510 --> 04:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
what point does this schedule appear so
 
04:39:21.890 --> 04:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
you'll see it at the end of the fine
 
04:39:24.109 --> 04:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
house finance phase that's when it will
 
04:39:25.789 --> 04:39:25.799 align:start position:0%
come out because it's a living document
 
04:39:28.789 --> 04:39:28.799 align:start position:0%
that will be added and subtracted to
 
04:39:31.609 --> 04:39:31.619 align:start position:0%
um but just keep in mind that
 
04:39:33.529 --> 04:39:33.539 align:start position:0%
you'll know what bills are being passed
 
04:39:34.970 --> 04:39:34.980 align:start position:0%
what Appropriations essentially because
 
04:39:36.289 --> 04:39:36.299 align:start position:0%
you'll see them on the floor you'll know
 
04:39:39.170 --> 04:39:39.180 align:start position:0%
what this committee did with revenues
 
04:39:41.448 --> 04:39:41.458 align:start position:0%
so if you did if you pass a bill that's
 
04:39:42.948 --> 04:39:42.958 align:start position:0%
going to increase or decrease your
 
04:39:45.170 --> 04:39:45.180 align:start position:0%
revenues we'll carry that on the Surplus
 
04:39:47.750 --> 04:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
statement typically we use what the
 
04:39:52.190 --> 04:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
agencies projected as the impact so it
 
04:39:53.868 --> 04:39:53.878 align:start position:0%
it could it's the best number that we
 
04:39:56.090 --> 04:39:56.100 align:start position:0%
have in some instances and like for Dra
 
04:39:58.730 --> 04:39:58.740 align:start position:0%
we talk a lot about static analysis so
 
04:40:01.430 --> 04:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
it's not a dynamic analysis so you may
 
04:40:02.690 --> 04:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
not be able to
 
04:40:02.700 --> 04:40:03.770 align:start position:0%
not be able to
um

04:40:03.770 --> 04:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:05.750 --> 04:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
you know see the true impact because you
 
04:40:06.830 --> 04:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
don't know what the behavior of the
 
04:40:09.770 --> 04:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
taxpayer might be now I say that there
 
04:40:11.948 --> 04:40:11.958 align:start position:0%
may be also Direction provided by
 
04:40:15.470 --> 04:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
leadership that says you know we think
 
04:40:17.990 --> 04:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
the estimate by the agency's too high or
 
04:40:20.390 --> 04:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
low we want you to carry this number on
 
04:40:22.070 --> 04:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
the Surplus statement
 
04:40:27.230 --> 04:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:28.850 --> 04:40:28.860 align:start position:0%
but for the most part you should be able
 
04:40:30.770 --> 04:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
to find it a reason for the number
 
04:40:32.868 --> 04:40:32.878 align:start position:0%
that's there and and we'll be able to
 
04:40:33.890 --> 04:40:33.900 align:start position:0%
help you with that if you have any
 
04:40:33.900 --> 04:40:38.390 align:start position:0%
help you with that if you have any
questions

04:40:38.390 --> 04:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:40.250 --> 04:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
keep going
 
04:40:42.170 --> 04:40:42.180 align:start position:0%
so the
 
04:40:44.090 --> 04:40:44.100 align:start position:0%
we'll keep flipping we do the same thing
 
04:40:47.208 --> 04:40:47.218 align:start position:0%
for a highway that's on page 34. it's
 
04:40:48.470 --> 04:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
much smaller
 
04:40:50.810 --> 04:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
and then 35 is the fish and game Surplus
 
04:40:50.820 --> 04:40:52.910 align:start position:0%
and then 35 is the fish and game Surplus
statements

04:40:52.910 --> 04:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
statements
 
04:40:56.510 --> 04:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
um page 36 is now the what we call the
 
04:40:58.190 --> 04:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
official Revenue
 
04:40:59.930 --> 04:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
um monthly Revenue plan
 
04:41:02.750 --> 04:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
so once the legislature finishes its
 
04:41:02.760 --> 04:41:03.770 align:start position:0%
so once the legislature finishes its
process

04:41:03.770 --> 04:41:03.780 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:41:05.990 --> 04:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
and the governor has signed the bill or
 
04:41:08.510 --> 04:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
let it become law without his signature
 
04:41:10.250 --> 04:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative services
 
04:41:11.750 --> 04:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
will work with the agencies that
 
04:41:13.430 --> 04:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
generate this revenue and come up with a
 
04:41:14.630 --> 04:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
monthly plan
 
04:41:15.948 --> 04:41:15.958 align:start position:0%
how much are we going to get each month
 
04:41:18.350 --> 04:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
in these areas
 
04:41:20.330 --> 04:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
understand it's an estimate and
 
04:41:22.128 --> 04:41:22.138 align:start position:0%
sometimes it you'll see more or less
 
04:41:24.288 --> 04:41:24.298 align:start position:0%
than a month
 
04:41:26.030 --> 04:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
um there's reasons often for that
 
04:41:27.590 --> 04:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes it can be explained sometimes
 
04:41:29.868 --> 04:41:29.878 align:start position:0%
they can't easily be explained because
 
04:41:32.868 --> 04:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
um if it's a business or a tax at dra
 
04:41:34.368 --> 04:41:34.378 align:start position:0%
collects and maybe there's a single
 
04:41:37.490 --> 04:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
entity that's causing that month to
 
04:41:40.310 --> 04:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
curve upwards or downwards then they
 
04:41:41.868 --> 04:41:41.878 align:start position:0%
can't tell us that they've got to keep
 
04:41:43.250 --> 04:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
that quiet
 
04:41:45.110 --> 04:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
but what you do get at the end of every
 
04:41:48.050 --> 04:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
month is on page 40
 
04:41:50.628 --> 04:41:50.638 align:start position:0%
is the monthly Revenue Focus again this
 
04:41:52.788 --> 04:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
is a document produced by administrative
 
04:41:56.030 --> 04:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
Services I think this is probably
 
04:41:57.590 --> 04:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
any you're probably getting daily
 
04:42:00.350 --> 04:42:00.360 align:start position:0%
revenue emails from myself from
 
04:42:03.650 --> 04:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
administrative services and from dra
 
04:42:07.310 --> 04:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
I would suggest that they're not overly
 
04:42:08.690 --> 04:42:08.700 align:start position:0%
important you don't need to read them
 
04:42:10.610 --> 04:42:10.620 align:start position:0%
every day
 
04:42:12.948 --> 04:42:12.958 align:start position:0%
um you can
 
04:42:15.230 --> 04:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
ignore them for the most part um but you
 
04:42:17.090 --> 04:42:17.100 align:start position:0%
know I think I think some of the dra
 
04:42:19.070 --> 04:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
ones can be kind of interesting but more
 
04:42:20.868 --> 04:42:20.878 align:start position:0%
so they're end of month ones
 
04:42:22.850 --> 04:42:22.860 align:start position:0%
the revenue focus is what you really
 
04:42:24.470 --> 04:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
should be looking at that comes out
 
04:42:24.480 --> 04:42:26.810 align:start position:0%
should be looking at that comes out
usually

04:42:26.810 --> 04:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
usually
 
04:42:29.030 --> 04:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
three business days after the close of
 
04:42:30.890 --> 04:42:30.900 align:start position:0%
the month approximately
 
04:42:33.110 --> 04:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
the first page of that will tell you did
 
04:42:34.788 --> 04:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
you make plan or not make plan for the
 
04:42:36.350 --> 04:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
four unrestricted Revenue sources that's
 
04:42:39.050 --> 04:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
the Box on the up upper left corner
 
04:42:40.490 --> 04:42:40.500 align:start position:0%
right underneath that is the current
 
04:42:42.170 --> 04:42:42.180 align:start position:0%
month for your general education trust
 
04:42:44.390 --> 04:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
fund so it'll show you what the actual
 
04:42:47.030 --> 04:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
amount collected for the month and then
 
04:42:48.650 --> 04:42:48.660 align:start position:0%
what the plan was for that month and if
 
04:42:49.970 --> 04:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
you're up or down
 
04:42:52.368 --> 04:42:52.378 align:start position:0%
and then on the right hand side is the
 
04:42:55.190 --> 04:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
analysis and they'll hit several of the
 
04:42:56.448 --> 04:42:56.458 align:start position:0%
taxes and give you a kind of a little
 
04:42:58.070 --> 04:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
blurb as to what occurred in that month
 
04:43:00.170 --> 04:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
with these taxes
 
04:43:02.208 --> 04:43:02.218 align:start position:0%
you flip the page
 
04:43:04.070 --> 04:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to see a number of smaller
 
04:43:04.080 --> 04:43:06.708 align:start position:0%
you're going to see a number of smaller
boxes

04:43:06.708 --> 04:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:08.390 --> 04:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
the first one is the real estate
 
04:43:10.070 --> 04:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
transfer tax that just gives you a sense
 
04:43:11.930 --> 04:43:11.940 align:start position:0%
of how that's comparing to previous
 
04:43:14.570 --> 04:43:14.580 align:start position:0%
fiscal years and percentage changes
 
04:43:16.730 --> 04:43:16.740 align:start position:0%
the one below that is the meals and
 
04:43:19.670 --> 04:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
rooms analysis that's a fairly new box
 
04:43:21.910 --> 04:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
and that's coming in as a result of the
 
04:43:24.128 --> 04:43:24.138 align:start position:0%
Restriction of
 
04:43:26.628 --> 04:43:26.638 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms Revenue into the
 
04:43:29.150 --> 04:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
municipal Revenue fund so that's that 30
 
04:43:31.070 --> 04:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
percent of meals and rooms that goes
 
04:43:33.350 --> 04:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
back to the communities it used to not
 
04:43:35.090 --> 04:43:35.100 align:start position:0%
be in a restricted fund it just used to
 
04:43:37.250 --> 04:43:37.260 align:start position:0%
be an appropriation
 
04:43:40.730 --> 04:43:40.740 align:start position:0%
so this is just showing you basically
 
04:43:40.740 --> 04:43:41.270 align:start position:0%
so this is just showing you basically
um

04:43:41.270 --> 04:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:42.650 --> 04:43:42.660 align:start position:0%
what the collections were for the month
 
04:43:44.628 --> 04:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
how much went out to school building Aid
 
04:43:47.750 --> 04:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
Debt Service so back in 2009 10 and 11
 
04:43:51.410 --> 04:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
building Aid was bonded and this is the
 
04:43:53.510 --> 04:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
the law at that time said they needed to
 
04:43:56.448 --> 04:43:56.458 align:start position:0%
use meals and rooms Revenue to pay back
 
04:43:58.010 --> 04:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
those bonds and that just shows you the
 
04:43:59.570 --> 04:43:59.580 align:start position:0%
the amount for the month that went out
 
04:44:01.970 --> 04:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
for that purpose and then underneath
 
04:44:03.530 --> 04:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
that is the new Municipal Revenue
 
04:44:03.540 --> 04:44:05.208 align:start position:0%
that is the new Municipal Revenue
transfer

04:44:05.208 --> 04:44:05.218 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
04:44:08.330 --> 04:44:08.340 align:start position:0%
and then you get a netting effect of
 
04:44:09.830 --> 04:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
what when it's going to go into the
 
04:44:14.090 --> 04:44:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:16.788 --> 04:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
the next is the tax refunds the business
 
04:44:20.750 --> 04:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
tax refunds so refunds are uh I should
 
04:44:22.250 --> 04:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
have actually let me just back up for a
 
04:44:23.868 --> 04:44:23.878 align:start position:0%
second everything you're doing is on a
 
04:44:27.350 --> 04:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
cash basis so money in Money out
 
04:44:30.530 --> 04:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
when dra needs to pay a refund that's
 
04:44:33.170 --> 04:44:33.180 align:start position:0%
cash they're paying back out so if you
 
04:44:34.730 --> 04:44:34.740 align:start position:0%
don't collect enough it could show as a
 
04:44:36.350 --> 04:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
negative and when you're looking at some
 
04:44:37.730 --> 04:44:37.740 align:start position:0%
of the daily revenues there's on
 
04:44:39.050 --> 04:44:39.060 align:start position:0%
occasion you might see a negative
 
04:44:41.270 --> 04:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
because they had a refund and then the
 
04:44:42.948 --> 04:44:42.958 align:start position:0%
next day it's a positive it's because
 
04:44:45.470 --> 04:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
they booked more Revenue
 
04:44:47.930 --> 04:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
um and it made it into the system
 
04:44:49.850 --> 04:44:49.860 align:start position:0%
so it's just kind of it gives you a
 
04:44:54.590 --> 04:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:56.208 --> 04:44:56.218 align:start position:0%
um the end at the end of month reports
 
04:44:58.128 --> 04:44:58.138 align:start position:0%
they have a page that talks about their
 
04:45:00.350 --> 04:45:00.360 align:start position:0%
rev refunds and they also have to submit
 
04:45:02.750 --> 04:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
to fiscal committee on a quarterly basis
 
04:45:07.550 --> 04:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:10.368 --> 04:45:10.378 align:start position:0%
then the next on the bottom of page 41
 
04:45:12.288 --> 04:45:12.298 align:start position:0%
is just a comparison to the previous
 
04:45:12.298 --> 04:45:13.610 align:start position:0%
is just a comparison to the previous
year

04:45:13.610 --> 04:45:13.620 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:45:13.620 --> 04:45:15.350 align:start position:0%
year
right

04:45:15.350 --> 04:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:45:17.930 --> 04:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
it's okay I guess it's information but
 
04:45:20.570 --> 04:45:20.580 align:start position:0%
really I think page 42 is
 
04:45:20.580 --> 04:45:21.948 align:start position:0%
really I think page 42 is
um

04:45:21.948 --> 04:45:21.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:23.810 --> 04:45:23.820 align:start position:0%
the year-to-date comparison so that'll
 
04:45:24.948 --> 04:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
tell you right through the end of this
 
04:45:26.930 --> 04:45:26.940 align:start position:0%
through December this is how much you've
 
04:45:26.940 --> 04:45:28.070 align:start position:0%
through December this is how much you've
collected

04:45:28.070 --> 04:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
collected
 
04:45:30.948 --> 04:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
this is how much you had planned for
 
04:45:33.410 --> 04:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
and you and it tells you by um
 
04:45:35.510 --> 04:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
general fund and education trust fund so
 
04:45:37.850 --> 04:45:37.860 align:start position:0%
you can see the split on that so you can
 
04:45:40.368 --> 04:45:40.378 align:start position:0%
see through December
 
04:45:43.070 --> 04:45:43.080 align:start position:0%
you had a hundred and almost 155 million
 
04:45:45.708 --> 04:45:45.718 align:start position:0%
dollars of general fund
 
04:45:47.810 --> 04:45:47.820 align:start position:0%
ahead of the plan
 
04:45:50.690 --> 04:45:50.700 align:start position:0%
you have a 52 just over 52 million
 
04:45:52.970 --> 04:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
dollars of Education trust fund over
 
04:45:57.350 --> 04:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
plan collected so far this year
 
04:45:59.270 --> 04:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
when you get the
 
04:46:01.368 --> 04:46:01.378 align:start position:0%
um daily report from the Department of
 
04:46:02.990 --> 04:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
administrative Services if you do get
 
04:46:04.610 --> 04:46:04.620 align:start position:0%
that you're going to see a chart that
 
04:46:06.410 --> 04:46:06.420 align:start position:0%
looks just like this in the report and
 
04:46:09.230 --> 04:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
then there's one that's for the month to
 
04:46:09.240 --> 04:46:10.190 align:start position:0%
then there's one that's for the month to
date

04:46:10.190 --> 04:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
date
 
04:46:11.990 --> 04:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
What You Won't See is the split to the
 
04:46:13.730 --> 04:46:13.740 align:start position:0%
education trust fund you'll see negative
 
04:46:16.490 --> 04:46:16.500 align:start position:0%
numbers to start don't panic
 
04:46:18.708 --> 04:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
they don't do the splits until the close
 
04:46:20.810 --> 04:46:20.820 align:start position:0%
of the business month and the reason for
 
04:46:22.190 --> 04:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
that is that the revenue is coming in
 
04:46:24.830 --> 04:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
change and it adjusted almost every day
 
04:46:26.270 --> 04:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
so if they were trying to do the
 
04:46:28.610 --> 04:46:28.620 align:start position:0%
education trust fund splits they'd be
 
04:46:30.830 --> 04:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
correcting those every day so they just
 
04:46:31.910 --> 04:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
wait to the end of the month and say
 
04:46:34.610 --> 04:46:34.620 align:start position:0%
okay we're done collections now we'll do
 
04:46:37.070 --> 04:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
the split and put it in the right bucket
 
04:46:39.890 --> 04:46:39.900 align:start position:0%
I I do get a number of calls on that you
 
04:46:41.090 --> 04:46:41.100 align:start position:0%
know oh it shows like we don't have
 
04:46:42.530 --> 04:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
enough money in the education trust fund
 
04:46:44.330 --> 04:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
we're not collecting what we need in
 
04:46:45.830 --> 04:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
fact you are
 
04:46:48.530 --> 04:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
I think it's also important to note just
 
04:46:50.810 --> 04:46:50.820 align:start position:0%
with the education trust fund
 
04:46:53.868 --> 04:46:53.878 align:start position:0%
um that that is a non-lapsing fund so at
 
04:46:55.670 --> 04:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
the end of the biennium that money does
 
04:46:57.830 --> 04:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
not lapse back into the revenue
 
04:46:59.570 --> 04:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
stabilization fund it stays in the
 
04:47:02.270 --> 04:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
education trust fund unlike the general
 
04:47:04.690 --> 04:47:04.700 align:start position:0%
fund if you have any excess general fund
 
04:47:07.550 --> 04:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
it will be put into the rainy day fund
 
04:47:09.470 --> 04:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
up to a certain point and if you reach
 
04:47:11.390 --> 04:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
that threshold it's about 400 million
 
04:47:12.890 --> 04:47:12.900 align:start position:0%
right now if you reach that threshold
 
04:47:15.170 --> 04:47:15.180 align:start position:0%
then anything above that would just stay
 
04:47:16.850 --> 04:47:16.860 align:start position:0%
as a bounce forward
 
04:47:18.288 --> 04:47:18.298 align:start position:0%
representative Army did you have a
 
04:47:18.298 --> 04:47:20.090 align:start position:0%
representative Army did you have a
question

04:47:20.090 --> 04:47:20.100 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:47:20.100 --> 04:47:21.350 align:start position:0%
question
and

04:47:21.350 --> 04:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:47:23.990 --> 04:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
Phil Sutton told us that the split is
 
04:47:28.490 --> 04:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
more like 70 instead of 60 now
 
04:47:32.390 --> 04:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
business profits taxes BT
 
04:47:34.490 --> 04:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
so they all they all are putting it that
 
04:47:34.500 --> 04:47:36.830 align:start position:0%
so they all they all are putting it that
way

04:47:36.830 --> 04:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:39.470 --> 04:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
so they the department of administrative
 
04:47:43.310 --> 04:47:43.320 align:start position:0%
Services works with dra to do the splits
 
04:47:45.230 --> 04:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
so they they try to
 
04:47:47.448 --> 04:47:47.458 align:start position:0%
they try to get the split as close as
 
04:47:49.430 --> 04:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
they can and that's why sometimes you
 
04:47:50.868 --> 04:47:50.878 align:start position:0%
might see some numbers are running a
 
04:47:52.250 --> 04:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
little bit negative maybe it didn't get
 
04:47:54.590 --> 04:47:54.600 align:start position:0%
quite right again it's assumptions are
 
04:47:56.030 --> 04:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
being made on how the revenue is coming
 
04:47:59.330 --> 04:47:59.340 align:start position:0%
in but dra was running it was I think
 
04:48:02.750 --> 04:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
like mid 60 percent so that it was like
 
04:48:06.110 --> 04:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
35 65 was the split before we've always
 
04:48:08.628 --> 04:48:08.638 align:start position:0%
heard 60 40 and you may hear that again
 
04:48:09.948 --> 04:48:09.958 align:start position:0%
in this committee when they come through
 
04:48:13.250 --> 04:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
because it does change every year
 
04:48:13.260 --> 04:48:14.270 align:start position:0%
because it does change every year
um

04:48:14.270 --> 04:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:16.190 --> 04:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
but just know that at the end of the
 
04:48:18.410 --> 04:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
year money's poured into the right place
 
04:48:20.448 --> 04:48:20.458 align:start position:0%
that it needs to be so even though we
 
04:48:23.270 --> 04:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
talk about a 60 40 split that's not a
 
04:48:25.190 --> 04:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
binding split
 
04:48:27.288 --> 04:48:27.298 align:start position:0%
the law is what tells you how to split
 
04:48:28.788 --> 04:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
those funds
 
04:48:30.470 --> 04:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
so the law directs how much goes the
 
04:48:31.970 --> 04:48:31.980 align:start position:0%
education trust fund in terms of a
 
04:48:34.070 --> 04:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
percentage and how much should go to the
 
04:48:35.330 --> 04:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
04:48:40.010 --> 04:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
representative yeah follow up on so we
 
04:48:42.288 --> 04:48:42.298 align:start position:0%
don't really know how much went to bet
 
04:48:46.310 --> 04:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
versus BPT until look after comes out
 
04:48:49.670 --> 04:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
or for some of you in August well you'll
 
04:48:51.830 --> 04:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
see so when you look at December right
 
04:48:53.810 --> 04:48:53.820 align:start position:0%
now you can see
 
04:48:56.030 --> 04:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
you know this is the cash basis what
 
04:48:57.650 --> 04:48:57.660 align:start position:0%
they know now the official audit might
 
04:48:59.570 --> 04:48:59.580 align:start position:0%
make some adjustment but
 
04:49:02.030 --> 04:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
it hasn't been huge you might move a
 
04:49:04.850 --> 04:49:04.860 align:start position:0%
million or two one way or the other it's
 
04:49:06.288 --> 04:49:06.298 align:start position:0%
not like you're seeing you know 50
 
04:49:07.970 --> 04:49:07.980 align:start position:0%
million get bumped into one place when
 
04:49:10.610 --> 04:49:10.620 align:start position:0%
it should have been in the other
 
04:49:12.708 --> 04:49:12.718 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
04:49:15.590 --> 04:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
they do a pretty good job and so when
 
04:49:17.570 --> 04:49:17.580 align:start position:0%
you're looking at this you you can see
 
04:49:19.368 --> 04:49:19.378 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:49:21.170 --> 04:49:21.180 align:start position:0%
you know you're staying within your plan
 
04:49:24.350 --> 04:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
for the most part of your splits
 
04:49:27.170 --> 04:49:27.180 align:start position:0%
for under the education trust fund but
 
04:49:28.730 --> 04:49:28.740 align:start position:0%
under your business Enterprise fund you
 
04:49:30.890 --> 04:49:30.900 align:start position:0%
can see what we're running behind on
 
04:49:32.330 --> 04:49:32.340 align:start position:0%
some of that collection
 
04:49:34.310 --> 04:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
and again it's just the nature of that
 
04:49:37.310 --> 04:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
split more of it goes of the BET goes to
 
04:49:38.750 --> 04:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund than to the
 
04:49:43.128 --> 04:49:43.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:43.138 --> 04:49:43.850 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:49:43.850 --> 04:49:43.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:45.470 --> 04:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
one thing to also keep in mind is
 
04:49:47.868 --> 04:49:47.878 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax
 
04:49:47.878 --> 04:49:49.368 align:start position:0%
tobacco tax
um

04:49:49.368 --> 04:49:49.378 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:51.288 --> 04:49:51.298 align:start position:0%
so they tax cigarettes
 
04:49:54.410 --> 04:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
and um everything over a dollar goes to
 
04:49:55.910 --> 04:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund and everything
 
04:49:58.368 --> 04:49:58.378 align:start position:0%
be Beyond below that goes to the general
 
04:50:00.890 --> 04:50:00.900 align:start position:0%
fund except for the um
 
04:50:03.350 --> 04:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
other tobacco products so those just go
 
04:50:07.128 --> 04:50:07.138 align:start position:0%
to the general fund and two cycles ago
 
04:50:10.690 --> 04:50:10.700 align:start position:0%
we added The Vaping
 
04:50:13.128 --> 04:50:13.138 align:start position:0%
e-cigarette things and I may be using
 
04:50:15.050 --> 04:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
the wrong terms
 
04:50:17.570 --> 04:50:17.580 align:start position:0%
um and that's increased the revenue
 
04:50:19.190 --> 04:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
that's coming in but that Revenue all
 
04:50:22.010 --> 04:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
goes to the general fund so when I did
 
04:50:24.590 --> 04:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
the splits last time I didn't I didn't
 
04:50:27.410 --> 04:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
know and didn't even consider that
 
04:50:29.570 --> 04:50:29.580 align:start position:0%
it was only about one to two percent of
 
04:50:31.070 --> 04:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
the OTP that was going to the general
 
04:50:32.330 --> 04:50:32.340 align:start position:0%
fund so it didn't really impact the
 
04:50:33.890 --> 04:50:33.900 align:start position:0%
split now it's up for closer to ten
 
04:50:35.810 --> 04:50:35.820 align:start position:0%
percent so that's something to keep in
 
04:50:37.250 --> 04:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
mind when I do the splits to make sure I
 
04:50:39.410 --> 04:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
get it correct but that didn't keep the
 
04:50:40.670 --> 04:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services
 
04:50:45.890 --> 04:50:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:47.330 --> 04:50:47.340 align:start position:0%
and then the last page of the revenue
 
04:50:49.368 --> 04:50:49.378 align:start position:0%
focus is just some Highway fun fishing
 
04:50:51.590 --> 04:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
game fun information and a little bit on
 
04:50:55.128 --> 04:50:55.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:57.288 --> 04:50:57.298 align:start position:0%
um and the reason for the liquor box on
 
04:50:59.448 --> 04:50:59.458 align:start position:0%
the bottom it goes back to what they
 
04:51:01.250 --> 04:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
talked about the transfer to the
 
04:51:02.930 --> 04:51:02.940 align:start position:0%
governor's Commission on alcohol and
 
04:51:02.940 --> 04:51:03.948 align:start position:0%
governor's Commission on alcohol and
drug

04:51:03.948 --> 04:51:03.958 align:start position:0%
drug
 
04:51:06.650 --> 04:51:06.660 align:start position:0%
or substance use and then the transfer
 
04:51:08.868 --> 04:51:08.878 align:start position:0%
the granite advantage
 
04:51:11.510 --> 04:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
the transfer to granted Advantage is
 
04:51:13.610 --> 04:51:13.620 align:start position:0%
something that's new
 
04:51:15.650 --> 04:51:15.660 align:start position:0%
three sessions ago
 
04:51:17.750 --> 04:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
and basically the commissioner has to do
 
04:51:19.610 --> 04:51:19.620 align:start position:0%
an analysis every six months of that
 
04:51:23.090 --> 04:51:23.100 align:start position:0%
fund and put puts out information to the
 
04:51:25.368 --> 04:51:25.378 align:start position:0%
finance committee to
 
04:51:25.378 --> 04:51:26.090 align:start position:0%
finance committee to
um

04:51:26.090 --> 04:51:26.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:29.150 --> 04:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner dra I think you know
 
04:51:31.910 --> 04:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
there's a whole slew of places that get
 
04:51:34.250 --> 04:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
this letter that says we may need to
 
04:51:35.690 --> 04:51:35.700 align:start position:0%
transfer some money from Liquor
 
04:51:37.670 --> 04:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
Commission and we'll give a number and
 
04:51:38.868 --> 04:51:38.878 align:start position:0%
the reason that you're seeing these
 
04:51:40.910 --> 04:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
transfers is um
 
04:51:43.310 --> 04:51:43.320 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid roles have increased well
 
04:51:47.150 --> 04:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
during covid and right now you may have
 
04:51:49.070 --> 04:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
heard some discussion about people who
 
04:51:51.110 --> 04:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
are on Medicaid they don't have to get
 
04:51:51.120 --> 04:51:52.070 align:start position:0%
are on Medicaid they don't have to get
um

04:51:52.070 --> 04:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:54.170 --> 04:51:54.180 align:start position:0%
reauthorized every year you just stay on
 
04:51:55.610 --> 04:51:55.620 align:start position:0%
the roll because the concern that people
 
04:51:57.050 --> 04:51:57.060 align:start position:0%
would fall off because it's kind of a
 
04:51:59.570 --> 04:51:59.580 align:start position:0%
complex process to go through every year
 
04:52:01.128 --> 04:52:01.138 align:start position:0%
while we're in the public health
 
04:52:01.138 --> 04:52:02.448 align:start position:0%
while we're in the public health
emergency

04:52:02.448 --> 04:52:02.458 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
04:52:04.850 --> 04:52:04.860 align:start position:0%
once the public health emergency ends or
 
04:52:07.270 --> 04:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
I believe there's a some
 
04:52:09.350 --> 04:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
at the federal level there's some
 
04:52:11.690 --> 04:52:11.700 align:start position:0%
language I guess that that would
 
04:52:14.750 --> 04:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
have a hard end to this this uh Medicaid
 
04:52:16.670 --> 04:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
staying on the rules in the end of March
 
04:52:18.050 --> 04:52:18.060 align:start position:0%
I believe
 
04:52:20.330 --> 04:52:20.340 align:start position:0%
um but you may see this may see some of
 
04:52:22.250 --> 04:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
these people come off and you may see
 
04:52:23.868 --> 04:52:23.878 align:start position:0%
less money needing to be transferred as
 
04:52:24.890 --> 04:52:24.900 align:start position:0%
a result of that from The Liquor
 
04:52:26.270 --> 04:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
Commission but that's something we'll
 
04:52:28.250 --> 04:52:28.260 align:start position:0%
have to wait and see that is something
 
04:52:29.930 --> 04:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
that keep in the back of your minds when
 
04:52:31.910 --> 04:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services comes in on
 
04:52:34.070 --> 04:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
the seventh that you may want to ask
 
04:52:35.930 --> 04:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
some questions about
 
04:52:39.948 --> 04:52:39.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:44.690 --> 04:52:44.700 align:start position:0%
page 44 just kind of give you a a brief
 
04:52:46.490 --> 04:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
the tax you're seeing what does it
 
04:52:46.500 --> 04:52:47.990 align:start position:0%
the tax you're seeing what does it
represent

04:52:47.990 --> 04:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:52:49.970 --> 04:52:49.980 align:start position:0%
your meals and rooms taxed that you see
 
04:52:52.070 --> 04:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
collected this month reflects activity
 
04:52:53.330 --> 04:52:53.340 align:start position:0%
last month
 
04:52:54.948 --> 04:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
so it's not what's happening today it's
 
04:52:58.010 --> 04:52:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:00.050 --> 04:53:00.060 align:start position:0%
your insurance tax that's just the
 
04:53:01.368 --> 04:53:01.378 align:start position:0%
collection that they're doing today for
 
04:53:04.850 --> 04:53:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:07.070 --> 04:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
so it's really more just to let you know
 
04:53:09.650 --> 04:53:09.660 align:start position:0%
that there's some taxes that they're a
 
04:53:12.410 --> 04:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
month behind so you want to know that
 
04:53:13.730 --> 04:53:13.740 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at oh this is really
 
04:53:16.310 --> 04:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
good Revenue it's because we had a
 
04:53:18.170 --> 04:53:18.180 align:start position:0%
really good month it was warm people
 
04:53:20.570 --> 04:53:20.580 align:start position:0%
were traveling they were spending a lot
 
04:53:23.750 --> 04:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
of money in tourism in New Hampshire
 
04:53:25.788 --> 04:53:25.798 align:start position:0%
the next the month we're in is rainy and
 
04:53:28.190 --> 04:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
and it's um you know the colder maybe
 
04:53:29.750 --> 04:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
people aren't doing as much outdoors and
 
04:53:32.270 --> 04:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
travel you might see a slight dip in
 
04:53:34.128 --> 04:53:34.138 align:start position:0%
that but
 
04:53:37.190 --> 04:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
representative almond thank you but in
 
04:53:38.930 --> 04:53:38.940 align:start position:0%
fact business profits business
 
04:53:42.470 --> 04:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
Enterprise interests and dividends uh
 
04:53:44.930 --> 04:53:44.940 align:start position:0%
well a fair number of them actually do
 
04:53:47.690 --> 04:53:47.700 align:start position:0%
not reflect economic activity that
 
04:53:51.770 --> 04:53:51.780 align:start position:0%
happens now they reflect it from oh it's
 
04:53:53.930 --> 04:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
prior year two to three years ago that's
 
04:53:56.090 --> 04:53:56.100 align:start position:0%
just coming in through the tax return
 
04:54:00.128 --> 04:54:00.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:04.128 --> 04:54:04.138 align:start position:0%
this page was more to alert you to when
 
04:54:05.750 --> 04:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's confusion when you're
 
04:54:07.070 --> 04:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
looking at meals and rooms or you're
 
04:54:08.208 --> 04:54:08.218 align:start position:0%
looking at Lottery and you're like oh
 
04:54:10.550 --> 04:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
geez we got a big bump up in Lottery but
 
04:54:11.690 --> 04:54:11.700 align:start position:0%
you have to remember it was the previous
 
04:54:13.970 --> 04:54:13.980 align:start position:0%
month oh and there was a huge Powerball
 
04:54:15.470 --> 04:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
and so they collected a lot of Revenue
 
04:54:19.128 --> 04:54:19.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:21.170 --> 04:54:21.180 align:start position:0%
representative fellows so you're talking
 
04:54:22.550 --> 04:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
about when we look
 
04:54:25.368 --> 04:54:25.378 align:start position:0%
uh page 44.
 
04:54:29.690 --> 04:54:29.700 align:start position:0%
look at page 40 or are you saying that
 
04:54:33.530 --> 04:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
on on 44 does it say that this report
 
04:54:36.110 --> 04:54:36.120 align:start position:0%
that says December at the top is only
 
04:54:39.288 --> 04:54:39.298 align:start position:0%
Revenue through the end of November
 
04:54:42.230 --> 04:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
that's Revenue that was collected and
 
04:54:44.510 --> 04:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
put in the books in December but it may
 
04:54:46.730 --> 04:54:46.740 align:start position:0%
be the result of activity from the
 
04:54:49.730 --> 04:54:49.740 align:start position:0%
previous month so meals and rooms is
 
04:54:51.890 --> 04:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
based on what you collected in November
 
04:54:59.390 --> 04:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:01.970 --> 04:55:01.980 align:start position:0%
right right they don't have to they get
 
04:55:03.708 --> 04:55:03.718 align:start position:0%
they get to the 15th of the month to
 
04:55:07.850 --> 04:55:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:11.150 --> 04:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
and then the last group of pages uh 45
 
04:55:11.160 --> 04:55:12.590 align:start position:0%
and then the last group of pages uh 45
through

04:55:12.590 --> 04:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:55:15.110 --> 04:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
62 or just
 
04:55:17.330 --> 04:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
RSA references to the various Revenue
 
04:55:18.708 --> 04:55:18.718 align:start position:0%
sources that you're dealing with and
 
04:55:18.718 --> 04:55:19.550 align:start position:0%
sources that you're dealing with and
what

04:55:19.550 --> 04:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:55:21.170 --> 04:55:21.180 align:start position:0%
two things that I put in it's not the
 
04:55:23.030 --> 04:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
entire statute for any of these Revenue
 
04:55:26.510 --> 04:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
sources it's the piece of the tax that
 
04:55:28.070 --> 04:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
says here's the tax rate you're to
 
04:55:28.080 --> 04:55:29.150 align:start position:0%
says here's the tax rate you're to
charge

04:55:29.150 --> 04:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
charge
 
04:55:31.310 --> 04:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
and then here's where the revenues to go
 
04:55:35.208 --> 04:55:35.218 align:start position:0%
so you look on page 46 for example
 
04:55:39.410 --> 04:55:39.420 align:start position:0%
it's the business profits tax RSA 77 A2
 
04:55:41.030 --> 04:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
colon 2
 
04:55:43.310 --> 04:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
tells you the tax rate that's to be in
 
04:55:46.030 --> 04:55:46.040 align:start position:0%
effect and for what period
 
04:55:49.850 --> 04:55:49.860 align:start position:0%
77-a colon 20 Dash small a tells you
 
04:55:51.530 --> 04:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
where those funds are to go
 
04:55:53.868 --> 04:55:53.878 align:start position:0%
that 1.5 percent
 
04:55:56.030 --> 04:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
of whatever is collected
 
04:55:58.850 --> 04:55:58.860 align:start position:0%
will go to the education trust fund and
 
04:56:00.890 --> 04:56:00.900 align:start position:0%
the rest of it will go to the general
 
04:56:00.900 --> 04:56:02.448 align:start position:0%
the rest of it will go to the general
fund

04:56:02.448 --> 04:56:02.458 align:start position:0%
fund
 
04:56:04.250 --> 04:56:04.260 align:start position:0%
everything goes to the general fund
 
04:56:06.050 --> 04:56:06.060 align:start position:0%
unless it's there's a law that tells it
 
04:56:09.350 --> 04:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:11.628 --> 04:56:11.638 align:start position:0%
so that's all I had I'm not going to go
 
04:56:12.890 --> 04:56:12.900 align:start position:0%
through every page of that it's just
 
04:56:14.750 --> 04:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
more of a reference
 
04:56:14.760 --> 04:56:16.430 align:start position:0%
more of a reference
um

04:56:16.430 --> 04:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:18.110 --> 04:56:18.120 align:start position:0%
you may want you may find the shoes
 
04:56:19.730 --> 04:56:19.740 align:start position:0%
useful you may not find it useful it's
 
04:56:21.170 --> 04:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
more just to put the thoughts in your
 
04:56:21.180 --> 04:56:22.490 align:start position:0%
more just to put the thoughts in your
head

04:56:22.490 --> 04:56:22.500 align:start position:0%
head
 
04:56:24.410 --> 04:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
um but as you go through the process any
 
04:56:26.390 --> 04:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
questions again reach out to me you see
 
04:56:28.310 --> 04:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
me in the room ask me a question you
 
04:56:29.990 --> 04:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
need me to Chase something for you I can
 
04:56:30.970 --> 04:56:30.980 align:start position:0%
do that
 
04:56:33.770 --> 04:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
by no means am I the expert the agencies
 
04:56:35.330 --> 04:56:35.340 align:start position:0%
that come in that collect these revenues
 
04:56:37.490 --> 04:56:37.500 align:start position:0%
are the experts they're the ones that
 
04:56:39.170 --> 04:56:39.180 align:start position:0%
know some of the trends and stuff but I
 
04:56:41.570 --> 04:56:41.580 align:start position:0%
I will happily reach out to them and get
 
04:56:42.890 --> 04:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
information for the committee as it
 
04:56:45.350 --> 04:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:48.410 --> 04:56:48.420 align:start position:0%
represent Rochford I just had a question
 
04:56:50.270 --> 04:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
representative Almy got me thinking
 
04:56:51.708 --> 04:56:51.718 align:start position:0%
about something here with like the
 
04:56:54.110 --> 04:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
business profits tax
 
04:56:57.350 --> 04:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
so in my experience paying that in the
 
04:56:59.990 --> 04:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
bet I paid it quarterly yep you do an
 
04:57:03.288 --> 04:57:03.298 align:start position:0%
estimate so it and she brings up a good
 
04:57:07.128 --> 04:57:07.138 align:start position:0%
point in that I just paid my bet tax the
 
04:57:08.448 --> 04:57:08.458 align:start position:0%
other day
 
04:57:10.010 --> 04:57:10.020 align:start position:0%
for business that was a year ago
 
04:57:14.270 --> 04:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
estimating what's happening this year so
 
04:57:14.280 --> 04:57:14.810 align:start position:0%
estimating what's happening this year so
um

04:57:14.810 --> 04:57:14.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:18.350 --> 04:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
that being said it's a quarterly it's a
 
04:57:20.208 --> 04:57:20.218 align:start position:0%
quarterly payment
 
04:57:22.250 --> 04:57:22.260 align:start position:0%
but if we're estimate and I guess it
 
04:57:23.628 --> 04:57:23.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter if we're going to come up
 
04:57:25.550 --> 04:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
with just a big overall number that we
 
04:57:27.830 --> 04:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
give to the appropriation and tell them
 
04:57:30.110 --> 04:57:30.120 align:start position:0%
this is what your the number is but I
 
04:57:31.628 --> 04:57:31.638 align:start position:0%
mean looking at these
 
04:57:36.948 --> 04:57:36.958 align:start position:0%
how can we plan on a monthly Revenue if
 
04:57:38.690 --> 04:57:38.700 align:start position:0%
it's a something we generally collect
 
04:57:41.030 --> 04:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
quarterly and I understand at the end of
 
04:57:44.208 --> 04:57:44.218 align:start position:0%
the year it doesn't matter but
 
04:57:46.550 --> 04:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
I mean we really won't we won't have I
 
04:57:48.050 --> 04:57:48.060 align:start position:0%
mean November you probably don't have a
 
04:57:51.288 --> 04:57:51.298 align:start position:0%
lot of bet or BPT coming in but December
 
04:57:54.530 --> 04:57:54.540 align:start position:0%
you probably do so what the department
 
04:57:56.868 --> 04:57:56.878 align:start position:0%
does Department of Revenue will do is
 
04:57:58.490 --> 04:57:58.500 align:start position:0%
work with administrative services to set
 
04:58:00.410 --> 04:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
a plan and they have a sense of
 
04:58:00.420 --> 04:58:01.490 align:start position:0%
a plan and they have a sense of
um

04:58:01.490 --> 04:58:01.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:03.708 --> 04:58:03.718 align:start position:0%
how much revenue is coming in based on
 
04:58:03.718 --> 04:58:04.610 align:start position:0%
how much revenue is coming in based on
history

04:58:04.610 --> 04:58:04.620 align:start position:0%
history
 
04:58:06.470 --> 04:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
so they'll use percentages to kind of
 
04:58:07.850 --> 04:58:07.860 align:start position:0%
figure that out and they'll know that
 
04:58:09.708 --> 04:58:09.718 align:start position:0%
you know um you know the first half of
 
04:58:10.670 --> 04:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
the year and I'm just going to make up
 
04:58:13.190 --> 04:58:13.200 align:start position:0%
numbers you collect 35 percent of your
 
04:58:13.200 --> 04:58:14.690 align:start position:0%
numbers you collect 35 percent of your
BPT

04:58:14.690 --> 04:58:14.700 align:start position:0%
BPT
 
04:58:16.610 --> 04:58:16.620 align:start position:0%
you get 70 in the second half of the
 
04:58:18.890 --> 04:58:18.900 align:start position:0%
year with most of that being in April
 
04:58:22.250 --> 04:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
would so so they'll devise the plan to
 
04:58:25.430 --> 04:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
reflect some of that so you'll see
 
04:58:27.708 --> 04:58:27.718 align:start position:0%
no no you're you're just dealing with
 
04:58:28.910 --> 04:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
the higher numbers what you're going to
 
04:58:31.610 --> 04:58:31.620 align:start position:0%
do is debate you know based on what
 
04:58:33.170 --> 04:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
we're hearing and what my experiences
 
04:58:35.628 --> 04:58:35.638 align:start position:0%
are I think it should be at 900 million
 
04:58:37.010 --> 04:58:37.020 align:start position:0%
and somebody else is going to say it
 
04:58:39.110 --> 04:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
should be at 9.50 and then you'll have
 
04:58:41.570 --> 04:58:41.580 align:start position:0%
your anecdotal reasons for suggesting
 
04:58:44.390 --> 04:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
why you said 900 versus 950 and then
 
04:58:46.190 --> 04:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
this committee will come to some some
 
04:58:48.590 --> 04:58:48.600 align:start position:0%
sort of agreement
 
04:58:50.810 --> 04:58:50.820 align:start position:0%
um so a lot oh
 
04:58:53.030 --> 04:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative Ames yeah I just wanted
 
04:58:53.040 --> 04:58:54.410 align:start position:0%
representative Ames yeah I just wanted
to

04:58:54.410 --> 04:58:54.420 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:58:58.550 --> 04:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
add to this point that it's
 
04:59:00.830 --> 04:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
we really operate with
 
04:59:03.770 --> 04:59:03.780 align:start position:0%
scant information
 
04:59:07.128 --> 04:59:07.138 align:start position:0%
um and uh we're dealing with return
 
04:59:12.470 --> 04:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
information that dra has that reflects
 
04:59:16.070 --> 04:59:16.080 align:start position:0%
economic activity some time ago so the
 
04:59:19.310 --> 04:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
estimates may be really just based on it
 
04:59:21.890 --> 04:59:21.900 align:start position:0%
what was paid the previous year and not
 
04:59:24.770 --> 04:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
not even represent a judgment by the
 
04:59:26.208 --> 04:59:26.218 align:start position:0%
particular business that's making the
 
04:59:28.310 --> 04:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
estimate that things are going sour or
 
04:59:31.970 --> 04:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
going great so we're left puzzling
 
04:59:40.430 --> 04:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:43.368 --> 04:59:43.378 align:start position:0%
so so the last comment I'll make is
 
04:59:45.530 --> 04:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
um rip some Sanborn and I have been
 
04:59:47.270 --> 04:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
working on trying to schedule
 
04:59:49.910 --> 04:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
um the agencies so on February 7th the
 
04:59:51.350 --> 04:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
agencies that were due to see you on
 
04:59:54.770 --> 04:59:54.780 align:start position:0%
Monday will be coming in in addition to
 
04:59:58.788 --> 04:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
we'll start with um doj to talk about
 
05:00:01.490 --> 05:00:01.500 align:start position:0%
the tobacco settlement and then we'll go
 
05:00:03.230 --> 05:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
into dra they'll have about an hour and
 
05:00:04.368 --> 05:00:04.378 align:start position:0%
a half and they're going to talk to you
 
05:00:05.930 --> 05:00:05.940 align:start position:0%
just about the taxes they collect and
 
05:00:07.730 --> 05:00:07.740 align:start position:0%
how they would do estimates related to
 
05:00:09.110 --> 05:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
those you'll get some of that
 
05:00:10.788 --> 05:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
information about timing I believe as
 
05:00:10.798 --> 05:00:12.470 align:start position:0%
information about timing I believe as
well

05:00:12.470 --> 05:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:00:14.150 --> 05:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
um then in the afternoon we're going to
 
05:00:15.530 --> 05:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
have Department of administrative
 
05:00:18.110 --> 05:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
Services come in along with the treasury
 
05:00:19.850 --> 05:00:19.860 align:start position:0%
Department and they're going to talk
 
05:00:21.708 --> 05:00:21.718 align:start position:0%
about the revenue the act for the
 
05:00:25.610 --> 05:00:25.620 align:start position:0%
revenue plan and other Revenue so that's
 
05:00:27.708 --> 05:00:27.718 align:start position:0%
what there's about 200 sources of what's
 
05:00:29.868 --> 05:00:29.878 align:start position:0%
categorized as other Revenue
 
05:00:32.208 --> 05:00:32.218 align:start position:0%
with about 15 of them being major
 
05:00:34.610 --> 05:00:34.620 align:start position:0%
players in that category
 
05:00:36.770 --> 05:00:36.780 align:start position:0%
abandoned property is one of those which
 
05:00:38.270 --> 05:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
is dealt with by the treasury Department
 
05:00:39.770 --> 05:00:39.780 align:start position:0%
so that's why the treasurer is going to
 
05:00:42.530 --> 05:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
be here within that same hour and then
 
05:00:45.530 --> 05:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
when they finish the presentation on the
 
05:00:47.690 --> 05:00:47.700 align:start position:0%
other Revenue she'll spin into
 
05:00:50.270 --> 05:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
discussing some um
 
05:00:52.310 --> 05:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
some of the cash flow I mean I think she
 
05:00:54.708 --> 05:00:54.718 align:start position:0%
started this at the economic briefing
 
05:00:56.090 --> 05:00:56.100 align:start position:0%
um but she didn't get through everything
 
05:00:57.830 --> 05:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
so she's going to kind of get through
 
05:00:59.270 --> 05:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
what her department does and then just
 
05:01:00.708 --> 05:01:00.718 align:start position:0%
some of the cash flow and what they do
 
05:01:03.110 --> 05:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
with money sitting in treasury you know
 
05:01:05.270 --> 05:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
what what do they do with that and then
 
05:01:07.368 --> 05:01:07.378 align:start position:0%
after Treasury
 
05:01:09.288 --> 05:01:09.298 align:start position:0%
at two o'clock will be Health and Human
 
05:01:13.010 --> 05:01:13.020 align:start position:0%
Services and then at 2 30 fishing game
 
05:01:15.110 --> 05:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
that's going to be February 7th and I'll
 
05:01:16.910 --> 05:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
send a schedule out to the committee I'm
 
05:01:19.670 --> 05:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
using the group email on the Committee
 
05:01:21.470 --> 05:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
website and I'll and I'll send that to
 
05:01:23.990 --> 05:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
you and I won't send it right away
 
05:01:25.850 --> 05:01:25.860 align:start position:0%
um because I don't want it to get lost
 
05:01:28.430 --> 05:01:28.440 align:start position:0%
and then on the 22nd um I think will be
 
05:01:30.170 --> 05:01:30.180 align:start position:0%
the first day that you're going to
 
05:01:31.490 --> 05:01:31.500 align:start position:0%
really dive into trying to do some of
 
05:01:32.810 --> 05:01:32.820 align:start position:0%
your estimates
 
05:01:35.390 --> 05:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
so that we've asked the governor's
 
05:01:36.830 --> 05:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
budget director to come and talk to you
 
05:01:38.030 --> 05:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
about what they did and why they're
 
05:01:39.350 --> 05:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
coming up with their estimates I got
 
05:01:40.970 --> 05:01:40.980 align:start position:0%
confirmation from him that he can come
 
05:01:44.448 --> 05:01:44.458 align:start position:0%
that'll be at 10 o'clock at 10 30 dra
 
05:01:46.850 --> 05:01:46.860 align:start position:0%
will come in again to talk with you
 
05:01:49.490 --> 05:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
until about noonish with some of their
 
05:01:50.930 --> 05:01:50.940 align:start position:0%
revenue sources and at that point
 
05:01:52.788 --> 05:01:52.798 align:start position:0%
they'll be talking to you about their
 
05:01:54.350 --> 05:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
projections or their estimates and the
 
05:01:56.750 --> 05:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
ranges that they have
 
05:01:58.850 --> 05:01:58.860 align:start position:0%
um and then in the afternoon I've got a
 
05:02:00.650 --> 05:02:00.660 align:start position:0%
I suspect you probably want um Lottery
 
05:02:02.330 --> 05:02:02.340 align:start position:0%
to come back in the afternoon and then
 
05:02:04.730 --> 05:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
whoever else you guys may want
 
05:02:06.890 --> 05:02:06.900 align:start position:0%
so it's still open
 
05:02:06.900 --> 05:02:07.850 align:start position:0%
so it's still open
um

05:02:07.850 --> 05:02:07.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:09.590 --> 05:02:09.600 align:start position:0%
I think after you hear the presentations
 
05:02:11.868 --> 05:02:11.878 align:start position:0%
on the seventh
 
05:02:13.490 --> 05:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
I would suggest if there's certain
 
05:02:16.670 --> 05:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
agencies you think need to come back we
 
05:02:18.830 --> 05:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
can schedule them in on in the 22nd and
 
05:02:20.868 --> 05:02:20.878 align:start position:0%
I think let the chair or myself know and
 
05:02:23.570 --> 05:02:23.580 align:start position:0%
we can coordinate that
 
05:02:27.470 --> 05:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:29.750 --> 05:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
and anybody have any questions if not
 
05:02:30.948 --> 05:02:30.958 align:start position:0%
I'm all done
 
05:02:34.610 --> 05:02:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:36.230 --> 05:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
great job thank you for everything you
 
05:02:38.208 --> 05:02:38.218 align:start position:0%
do for us we cannot do this without him
 
05:02:47.948 --> 05:02:47.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:51.410 --> 05:02:51.420 align:start position:0%
but folks again don't get overwhelmed
 
05:02:52.970 --> 05:02:52.980 align:start position:0%
um we're keeping it at a high level we
 
05:02:54.410 --> 05:02:54.420 align:start position:0%
are not going to try to figure out which
 
05:02:56.628 --> 05:02:56.638 align:start position:0%
month and when no let's keep it high
 
05:02:58.490 --> 05:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
level do we think we're growing in this
 
05:03:01.368 --> 05:03:01.378 align:start position:0%
area or not and why how much are we
 
05:03:01.378 --> 05:03:03.470 align:start position:0%
area or not and why how much are we
growing

05:03:03.470 --> 05:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
growing
 
05:03:03.480 --> 05:03:06.020 align:start position:0%
growing
okay
