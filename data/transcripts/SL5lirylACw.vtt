1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Thank you.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Thank you.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.500
Okay, it being 11 o'clock, I will call the work session on House Bill 1235 to order.

5
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:23.500
I don't have a lot of people who are interested in speaking to this bill is pretty straightforward.

6
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.000
It in essence increases the claimant compensation from 40 to $50,000.

7
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It has an indeterminable estimated increase spending and it takes effect July 1, 2024.

8
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Well do we have a motion?

9
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Yes, Mr.

10
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Chairman.

11
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I can make a motion of ought to pass and I can speak to that briefly.

12
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Okay.

13
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Please.

14
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Thank you.

15
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:08.500
Well, I would be interested in knowing more about the bill, but certainly it seems like an increase that is reasonable for those.

16
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.000
Are you here for 1235?

17
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
No.

18
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Okay.

19
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:26.000
For those who are victims of certain crimes that are laid out in section 21 hyphen M colon 8 hyphen little h.

20
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:40.500
If there is anyone here that could answer just a couple of questions that would be great, but otherwise I don't see a problem with the bill moving forward.

21
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.500
What are your questions?

22
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.000
Just to be on the record with the questions.

23
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Okay.

24
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.500
For example, when was the last time there was an increase?

25
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.500
And then how often is this fund distributed?

26
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.500
Well, good questions.

27
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.500
Maybe we'll get an answer at some point.

28
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.500
Okay, so we have a motion to OTP.

29
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.000
Do we have a second?

30
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I'll second.

31
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Seconded by Representative Griffin.

32
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
By all means.

33
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Just the victims front, I think, is fine.

34
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I'm just not sure that I concur with the FRM victims in the second part of this bill.

35
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
They're included in the same place.

36
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.500
It kind of puts me in conflict.

37
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:45.000
I fully support the thought that victims of any crime somehow should be compensated but from there.

38
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:59.500
And I just don't know that I believe that the way that the state is being held liable has ever occurred before, nor do I believe that it's correct.

39
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.000
I really don't believe that.

40
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And spent a lot of time on this.

41
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
This bill was before us, each biennium for a while.

42
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And to a person that was a victim that testified, most of them, not to persons, but most of them indicated that the people that perpetrated this crime were just good people and things were sour, and that's not true.

43
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:42.500
I've been the victim of not this amount of this type, but being shazammed by illegal people, people that are doing political acts.

44
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:52.500
Within my business, there was fraud perpetrated on me, and I didn't hold the state viable or the government viable.

45
00:03:52.500 --> 00:04:04.500
During the collapse of the SNL loans, because of the type of business I had, I lost a boatload of money because of that.

46
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:13.000
But I couldn't hold the state or the federal government liable for the losses that I had.

47
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And actually that was a lack of oversight.

48
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.500
You've got to turn your mic on.

49
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:26.500
That was a lack of oversight by a plethora of governmental agencies.

50
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.000
And I would have liked to recover the thousands I lost.

51
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And in fact, I did, but I had to do other things to make that happen.

52
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.500
So I feel bad for the people, always have.

53
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:52.000
But I just don't agree that this is a liability that the state should undertake.

54
00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:20.500
And we're using taxpayer money, just think about this, we're using taxpayer money to compensate for people that were taken in by nothing less than a Ponzi scheme, and the thought that it was the liability of the states, and that goes against every principle that I've learned about, how government operates and what happens and liabilities.

55
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.500
I can't support this.

56
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.000
Well, I think that's already been done.

57
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.500
That was in HB 2.

58
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:37.500
What this does is it says if there's any unclaimed funds, it goes into the Victims Assistance Fund.

59
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.500
So the ship you're talking about has sailed.

60
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.500
What this does is it says...

61
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.500
I have to go on it.

62
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.500
Okay.

63
00:05:49.500 --> 00:06:07.500
What this says is if there are any funds left over they go into this victims fund that's all this does is direct any leftovers unclean okay all right certainly in any other comments tolerance, Mr.

64
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.500
Peter.

65
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.500
Certainly.

66
00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:13.500
Any other comments?

67
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.500
Okay, well, I guess would the clerk call the roll?

68
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.000
Okay, the motion is ought to pass.

69
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.500
If you're in favor, you'll vote in the affirmative.

70
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.500
The motion is ought to pass.

71
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:34.000
If you're in favor, you'll vote in the affirmative.

72
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.500
If not, you'll vote in the negative.

73
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.000
That being said, okay, Mr.

74
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Chairman.

75
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Yes.

76
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Vice Chairman Griffin.

77
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Yes.

78
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
The clerk votes yes.

79
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Representative Mooney.

80
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Yes.

81
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Richard Hatch is absent.

82
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Okay.

83
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.500
And Representative Wallace is absent.

84
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:05.000
So the vote is 4 to 1 in favor.

85
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Okay.

86
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
So we will report to finance.

87
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
The vote is 4 to 1.

88
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Ought to pass.

89
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And with that, we conclude the work session for 1235.

90
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Okay, got it.

91
00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Now we will be back at 1 o'clock.

92
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
35.

93
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Now we will be back at 1 o'clock and just for the committee's information Monday we have five bills and We're gonna they're all scheduled for 10 So that we're gonna just get into them and get them all done.

94
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
This Monday?

95
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Next Monday.

96
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Oh, my God.

97
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
No, we've got to wait until this afternoon.

98
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Yeah, one is at one and one is at two.

99
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.500
Yeah, this is where I learned not to schedule.

100
00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.000
I can read some copies.

101
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.500
When we get those copies from Janet.

102
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.500
Sure.

103
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.500
Yeah.

104
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.500
Well, that's good.

105
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.500
Yeah.

106
00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.500
I will go.

107
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.500
Okay.

108
00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.500
Thanks.

109
00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.500
One, two, three.

110
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.000
Is that Monday the 14th?

111
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Yes.

112
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Hi.

113
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Oh.

114
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Yes.

115
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Good luck.

116
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.500
Joel, I have to call you back.

117
00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.000
I'm in a committee meeting.

118
00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Starting off at 10?

119
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
10.

120
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Good.

121
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Someone took my parking space from what burned.

122
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Good.

123
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Someone took my apartment in this case from Mount Vernon.

124
00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Hello.

125
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.500
Who hears from Mount Vernon, I wonder?

126
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.500
I don't know.

127
00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.500
I have the deputy speaker taking my spot.

128
00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.500
You should know better.

129
00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.500
Are we still live?

130
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:22.500
We are still live.

131
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.500
Okay.

132
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.500
Oops.

133
00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.500
It's okay.

134
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.500
So we'll be back.

135
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.500
It's still on.

136
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:36.000
Well, we will reconvene at 1 o'clock.

137
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.500
The first one was an easy vote.

138
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.500
Okay.

139
00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:43.500
Okay.

140
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.000
The answer to your question is 1997.

141
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
That was the last time this section involved.

142
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Okay.

143
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Thank you.

144
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
The section is 1997.

145
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
That was the last time this section was all updated.

146
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Thank you.

147
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Thank you.

148
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Thank you.

149
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Thank you.

150
00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Thank you.

151
00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Thank you.

152
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Thank you.

153
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Thank you.

154
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Thank you.

155
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Thank you.

156
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Thank you.

157
00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Thank you.

158

Thank you.

159
00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000

Thank you.

171

Thank you.

172
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Thank you.

173
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Thank you.

174
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Thank you.

175

178
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Thank you.

179
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Thank you.

180
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000

Thank you.

205

Thank you.

206

Thank you.

232
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Thank you.

233
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Thank you.

234
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Thank you.

235
00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Thank you.

236
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Thank you.

237
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Thank you.

238
00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Thank you.

239
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000

240
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Thank you.

241
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Thank you.

242
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Thank you.

243
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Thank you.

244
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Thank you.

245
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Thank you.

246
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Thank you.

247
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Thank you.

248
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Thank you.

249
00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Thank you.

250
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Thank you.

251
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Thank you.

252
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Thank you.

253
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Thank you.

254
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Thank you.

255
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Thank you.

256
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Thank you.

257
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:51.500
What it does, it moves quite a bit of money from fiscal 2024 to 2023.

258
00:13:51.500 --> 00:14:05.500
So as a work session, if anybody has any comments they'd like to make about this bill, I'd invite them to come forward and give us their thoughts.

259
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:11.500
Please, if you'd state your name for the record, it'd be helpful.

260
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.500
Thank you, Mr.

261
00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.500
Chairman.

262
00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.500
13 years.

263
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:25.000
I'm here today in support of House Bill 1535, which was granted COVID to retirees.

264
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Excuse, please.

265
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:35.500
Could you turn on your mic and can I have the correct spelling of your last name?

266
00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.500
Sure.

267
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.500
It's B-E-A-U-D-R-Y.

268
00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:58.000
I did send a copy of this and I'm not sure because I did ask one of the reps and he didn't get it, but I did send a copy of my testimony to everybody through email.

269
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Well, if you wouldn't mind, if you could leave that one with the clerk.

270
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
I can do that.

271
00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Okay, thank you.

272
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:18.500
For those of you who may not know the history of the granting of COLAs, here's a little background.

273
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:37.500
Prior to the establishment of the special account in 1983, the fund to fund cost of living adjustments, the cost of living COLA was granted by the legislature and funded through the general fund from 1967 to 1983.

274
00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:47.000
From 1983 to 2012, annual COLAs were granted based on the availability to fund them through the special account.

275
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:57.000
The COLA amount ranged from 1% to 5% based on the CPIU and funds available in the members group account.

276
00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:15.000
In 2007, House Bill 653 changed the funding trigger as of June 30, 2007 for the special account and retained $204 million in the corpus of the fund that would have gone into the special account.

277
00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:23.500
2008 House Bill 1645 transferred $250 million from the special account to the corpus of the fund.

278
00:16:23.500 --> 00:17:07.000
2011 House Bill 2 transferred $167 million from the special account to the corpus of the fund 2011 house bill 2 transferred 167 million from the special account to the corpus of the fund 2012 house bill 1483 eliminated the language for the special account and retained 16 million dollars that was transferred from the special account to the corpus of the fund the elimination of the special of the special account and transfer of $637 million from the special account to the corpus of the fund.

279
00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:27.000
The elimination of the special account and transfer of $637 million from the special account to the corpus of the fund have precluded any further COLAs from being granted to New Hampshire retirement system retirees unless enabling legislation is enacted.

280
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Retirees have received one COLA since July 1 of 2010.

281
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:39.000
It was a 1.5% cost of living increase based upon the retirees' first $50,000.

282
00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:50.500
Over the last decade, family premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance coverage has jumped 47%, according to the report of the Kaiser Family Foundation.

283
00:17:50.500 --> 00:18:03.000
Over that same time period, the cost of living has gone up 23 percent while retirees received just a one and a half percent increase.

284
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:10.000
I want to remind you that the average retiree pension is $21,300 a year.

285
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:27.000
93 percent of the retirees make less than $50,000 a year and 64 percent of the retirees make less than $50,000 a year, and 64% of the retirees make less than $25,000 a year.

286
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:44.500
Very simple math will show you that in a matter of a few years without COLA adjustments, pensioners will be forced on some form of social services because our pensions will be devoured by inflation.

287
00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:51.000
I also want to remind you that Group 2 doesn't receive Social Security.

288
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.500
The pension is our main income once we retire.

289
00:18:55.500 --> 00:19:05.000
There's a report developed through NASRA on cost of living adjustments that shows how inflation impacts the purchase power.

290
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:18.500
A $25,000 pension falls to $16,690, 67% of its original value over a 20-year period with no cost of living adjustment based on a 2% inflation factor.

291
00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:24.000
The natural brief also shows that New Hampshire is an anomaly.

292
00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.500
Most states provide their retirees with a cost of living adjustment.

293
00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:43.000
The state of Maine, for example, who came to testify at the request of the decennial committee stated that they offer a 2.5% COLA to their retirees.

294
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Massachusetts offers a ad hoc COLA typically based on the CPIU up to 3% applied to the first $13,000 benefit.

295
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.500
Vermont offers an automatic cola based on the CPIU up to 5% compounded.

296
00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:33.000
Over the last several years the legislature has arbitrarily taken funds away from the retired workers that would have paid for colas and health care subsidies By changing dates and when excess earnings were reported and the elimination of the special account, some $637 million dedicated to retirees was confiscated for no justifiable reason other than to lower the employer's contribution on the backs of the retirees.

297
00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Granting a reasonable call-off for retirees will greatly reduce the impact inflation has incurred over the last decade.

298
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:49.500
I ask that you please support our retired workers and vote for House Bill 1535.

299
00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:53.500
Thank you, and I will answer any questions.

300
00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.500
Any questions?

301
00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.500
Representative Leshman.

302
00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.500
Thank you, Mr.

303
00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:03.000
Chairman, and thanks for taking my question.

304
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Is there any reason this legislation wasn't filed last year as far as the budget year, which would have made it probably easier to try to find the funds versus the second part of the session?

305
00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:39.000
The only reason I could say, I haven't talked to 400 legislators, but my understanding is the COLA that was granted in 2019, the way it was granted, it didn't really start until July of 2020.

306
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:49.500
And I didn't receive my cost of living until January of 2021 because it was based on the month you retired.

307
00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:59.000
So I retired in January, so I didn't get my one and a half percent until January of 2021.

308
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:07.500
So it was really 11 and a half years before I received a cost of living raise.

309
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:18.000
So I think that they didn't because they were still implementing the one that was that was put in in 2019.

310
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
They didn't want to go with another coal.

311
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000
And I think there was some concern about funding it.

312
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.500
But that's only my opinion.

313
00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.500
What I think.

314
00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.500
Further question?

315
00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:35.500
Thanks, Mr.

316
00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:37.500
Chairman.

317
00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:53.000
I guess the underlying financial concern that I have is on the fiscal note that the impact to all the political subdivisions, you know, towns and cities could be $135 million.

318
00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Do you have any indication that towns and cities are okay with this legislation?

319
00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:26.500
Well, as a retired school board member for 20 years in the city of Manchester, I can tell you with the downshifting that has occurred over the last decade, I would probably say no, but that shouldn't preclude retirees getting a cost of living to try to keep them par with other people.

320
00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:32.000
And like I said, I'll keep repeating myself on group two.

321
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000
That's our main income.

322
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:42.000
So if we don't get cost of living raises, most of us don't get Social Security.

323
00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:48.000
So at least Group 1 can fall back on their Social Security.

324
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:55.000
And they got 5.9 percent, I think it was this year, with Group 2.

325
00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:03.000
I mean, if we don't get our Kohler and our pension, we really don't get anything.

326
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Thanks.

327
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Thanks, Mr.

328
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Chairman.

329
00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
Certainly.

330
00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.500
Other questions from the committee?

331
00:24:13.500 --> 00:24:17.000
Okay, seeing none, thank you very much.

332
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
Thank you.

333
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
I'll hand this to the clerk, if you don't mind.

334
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Thank you very much.

335
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000
You're welcome.

336
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.000
Anyone else?

337
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Yes, sir.

338
00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000
Thank you.

339
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.000
Thank you.

340
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
Thank you, Mr.

341
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Chair.

342
00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:47.000
For the record, my name is Marty Carlin, representing the New Hampshire Retirement System.

343
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:56.500
NHRS doesn't have a position on the bill, but I came up to answer any questions you may have.

344
00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:10.500
The hand that I presented you is an updated version of what we did for House eDNA when this bill was introduced with that committee earlier this year.

345
00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:14.500
Excuse me, could you spell your last name?

346
00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:18.000
I don't see it on your handout.

347
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Oh, sorry.

348
00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.500
Yeah, K-A-R-L-O-N as in Nancy.

349
00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.500
Okay, thank you.

350
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.500
Thank you.

351
00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:32.000
So it's just some basic information on the history of coal.

352
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
It's a little bit less extensive than Mr.

353
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:54.500
Beaudry had provided and it also updates the financial considerations to the the new fiscal note which is a one-time permanent cola terminally funded ie paid up front which is 79 million a representative Leishman asked mr.

354
00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:59.000
Beaudry about the 135 million5 million for the communities.

355
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:14.000
The original bill, before it was amended, had a recurring Kohler every year, granted the discretion of the Board of Trustees, and that was much pricier long-term than this bill.

356
00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:35.500
This is a one-time permanent increase, and the amendment that came out of ED& would have the state front the money for this Kohler up front, so there wouldn't be any impact on municipal contributions under the bill as presented to the committee.

357
00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:41.500
The fiscal note that came with the bill that we should disregard.

358
00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.500
Which one?

359
00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.500
I'll turn to Mr.

360
00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:47.500
Hoffman.

361
00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:51.000
I saw the new one online today.

362
00:26:51.000 --> 00:27:01.500
We have the new one, but I'm just saying, the new one doesn't have municipalities and, it just has the state.

363
00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:04.000
Yeah, that's the correct one.

364
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Okay.

365
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
It's dated March 7th.

366
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.500
So just to clarify that.

367
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.500
So again, Mr.

368
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:16.500
Beaudry kind of covered the history of COLAs.

369
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:28.000
If there's any questions about the mechanics or how the cost estimate was developed by the actuary, I'd be glad to answer them.

370
00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
So this fiscal note has 79,100,000 in current fiscal year.

371
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
Yes.

372
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000
I'm just clarifying.

373
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Yeah, yeah.

374
00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.500
It's a lot of money.

375
00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.500
Yeah.

376
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.500
As Mr.

377
00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:49.000
Baudry mentioned, there was a funding mechanism.

378
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000
It was a flawed funding mechanism called the special account.

379
00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.500
And COLAs back in the 90s and 2000s were pre-funded in this way.

380
00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:04.000
It's called terminally funding in actuarial lingo.

381
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:36.000
But basically they calculate the, you know, look at the eligible population for COLAs, which in this case is about 30, a little bit under 30,000 benefit recipients currently receiving something from NHRS, and then project out their life expectancies and how long they get this COLA and then create a present value cost if we had this much money in the bank today.

382
00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:43.500
And there would be enough to pre-fund that benefit for the lifetime of the recipients.

383
00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:47.500
So that's where the $79 million came from.

384
00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:56.000
I think the last one in 2010 was about $50 million, but that was 11 years ago.

385
00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000
And the assumptions change and the populations change as well.

386
00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.500
But that's where that number came from.

387
00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:10.000
The 2019 COLA that took effect in Fiscal 20 wasn't pre-funded.

388
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.500
That one was funded through employer contribution.

389
00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:22.000
So there was an increase to both the state employer contribution rates as well as the municipalities.

390
00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.500
So this is a different approach to funding it.

391
00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:34.000
So if the 79 million is approved, then that will fund COLAs for how long?

392
00:29:34.000 --> 00:30:13.500
It would be a 1 and a half percent increase on the first thirty thousand for everyone who's retired you know before seven one of seventeen for as long as they'll live they'll get that increase you know will be in their monthly benefit for their lifetime okay well I sure didn't read that in here so so yeah the maximum it had one and a half percent on the first 30,000, the increase would be $450 a year.

393
00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:27.500
So if you know somebody is as a 30,000 or more pension and it'll go up by $450 a year, you know, for as long as they live.

394
00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:37.500
So that could be anywhere, you know, one to 50 years, but you know, that's, that's, that's how it works.

395
00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:42.500
It's a permanent addition to the base benefit, if approved.

396
00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.500
That's interesting.

397
00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:46.500
Representative Leishman.

398
00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:48.500
Thank you, Mr.

399
00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.500
Chairman.

400
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:53.000
Nice to see you, Marty.

401
00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:14.000
So if we were to provide just a one-year cost of living increase like we did in 2019, do you have like a off the envelope estimate what that would cost versus extending this out, as you said, one to 50 years?

402
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:16.500
There was a one-time payment.

403
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:22.000
I passed, I think, in 2018 and paid in fiscal 2019.

404
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
It was for a smaller pool of members.

405
00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
That was a general fund appropriation as well.

406
00:31:30.000 --> 00:32:14.000
If I recall, it was about $4 million, and it was one-time payment to about eight thousand eligible members I think they had to be retired like 20 years or something like that there was some parameters on that you know so it would depend on if you if you were going the one-time payment room you just have to like narrow down the universe of who was eligible and then we could tell you how many people that is, you know, and multiply that by the number.

407
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:23.500
It wouldn't be a recurring, you know, addition to the pension to bill one time, like an extra check.

408
00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.500
Okay.

409
00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.000
I kind of remember that.

410
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Thanks, Marty.

411
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
Thanks, Mr.

412
00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Chairman.

413
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
Well, that's interesting.

414
00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
Any other questions?

415
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:52.000
I would ask if you could, if you could figure out what that number is, and we can recess this and perhaps consider the one time on Monday.

416
00:32:52.000 --> 00:33:38.000
I'll be back on Monday anyway, know if it's the same pool is affected by this bill which is somewhere between 29 and 30,000 benefits you multiply that by how much you want to give them as a one-time and you know it's it's a that's not an actual real can reverse engineer this one then yeah that's you know we wouldn't need to send out for that because it's just a math problem, X times X, where the compounding of the coal or all the other factors would require more analysis.

417
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
But, yeah.

418
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
Okay, thank you.

419
00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
Thank you.

420
00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:54.500
I mean, does that, the $79 million is compounded out already, including all the factors and compounding interest, yadda, yadda, yadda.

421
00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:59.500
So we reverse engineer that to one time, one year.

422
00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:09.500
I'm not sure, maybe when I was a senior in high school, I was sophisticated enough to narrow that down.

423
00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:14.000
So it seems you have the expertise over there.

424
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:22.000
Could you just bring that figure with your money so our reverse engineering is completely accurate?

425
00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:27.500
I just want to make sure you understand what you're asking.

426
00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:29.500
Oh, the one-time.

427
00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:32.000
The one-time one time period.

428
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Example of how much would a one time cost for this pool.

429
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
Yes.

430
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
Okay, yeah.

431
00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000
Based on these factors.

432
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
Yes.

433
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.000
Thank you.

434
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Does that make sense?

435
00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:57.000
Yes, the issue is our general direction is to not open the budget up.

436
00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.500
This is something normally would be considered during the budget cycle.

437
00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:13.000
And so now that we have a fixed budget, what this is asking us to do is to revisit the budget.

438
00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.500
And the general forces that be say, don't revisit the budget.

439
00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:26.500
So if we're gonna revisit it, I don't think we're gonna revisit it at $79 million.

440
00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:38.500
Though, if you could help us with a smaller revisit, we might have a shot, but I think that's where we are right now.

441
00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:41.500
Is that acceptable to the committee?

442
00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.500
Very much so, yeah.

443
00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.500
Okay.

444
00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:47.500
I'm very sure.

445
00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:57.000
Yeah, so we will recess this work session until Monday morning at 10, along with all the other bills.

446
00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000
So we'll, and we're going to see you then anyway.

447
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.500
So thank you very much.

448
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:06.500
Thank you.

449
00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:09.500
Anybody else wish to speak today.

450
00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.500
Any other comments from the committee?

451
00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:18.500
Well then we will recess until Monday the 14th at 10 o'clock.

452
00:36:18.500 --> 00:36:25.000
And just so that everybody knows, the cameras are probably gonna stay on.

453
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:38.000
So I would highly recommend, if you're gonna have conversations, you better go out in the hall because the camera, the big eye is right there.

454
00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.500
And we will reconvene at 2 o'clock.

455
00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:43.500
And furthermore.

456
00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:45.500
Yeah.

457
00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:47.500
Yeah.

458
00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.500
.

459
00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:51.500
.

460
00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:53.500
.

461
00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:55.500
.

462
00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.500
.

463
00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.500
.

464
00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:01.500
.

465
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.500
Yeah, come here.

466
00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.500
Yeah.

467
00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:07.500
Yeah.

468
00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.500
Yeah.

469
00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:12.500
10 o'clock Monday is the end.

470
00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:14.500
1557 coming up too?

471
00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:16.500
Yeah.

472
00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.500
Yes.

473
00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.500
Yeah.

474
00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:23.000
Let me just make sure.

475
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.500
And this was 15, 1587.

476
00:37:25.500 --> 00:37:27.500
Yeah.

477
00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:29.500
Yeah.

478
00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:31.500
Yeah.

479
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:33.500
Yeah.

480
00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:42.500
And we don't know what time it's not at 10, but we don't know what time it's here.

481
00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:44.500
time.

482
00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:46.500
Thank you.
