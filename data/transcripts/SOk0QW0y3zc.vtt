00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
to this meeting which is to uh
 
00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 align:start position:0%
take a committee position on the four
 
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
bills that were sent back to us for
 
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
and we'll just take them up in the order
 
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
in which they appeared in the calendar
 
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
the first one is a house bill 1262
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
relative to the purchase of output of
 
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
limited electrical energy producers
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh do we have anybody that would like to
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
speak to this bill and i remind
 
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
everybody as we all know i guess that
 
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
the issue is simply whether there shall
 
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:39.110 align:start position:0%
the issue is simply whether there shall
be

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
a recommendation for further legislative
 
00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
action on this issue
 
00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:45.759 align:start position:0%
or not would anybody like to speak to
 
00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:55.270 align:start position:0%
or not would anybody like to speak to
this

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
would you like to entertain a motion at
 
00:07:59.189 --> 00:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
this time mr chairman
 
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
well we are gonna we're gonna we're
 
00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
gonna do that when we move to the
 
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.189 align:start position:0%
gonna do that when we move to the
executive

00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
executive
 
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
session and we're not quite there yet
 
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:06.869 align:start position:0%
session and we're not quite there yet
but

00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:06.879 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
that would be an order very soon it
 
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
looks like
 
00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
uh i see no hands raised unless i'm
 
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:13.909 align:start position:0%
uh i see no hands raised unless i'm
mistaken

00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:13.919 align:start position:0%
mistaken
 
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
for either our panelists or our
 
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.990 align:start position:0%
for either our panelists or our
attendees

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
attendees
 
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
so that uh that goes quickly
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
um the next one is house bill
 
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
1370. wrote to
 
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
relative to baseload renewable
 
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
generation credits for biomass
 
00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
energy facilities is there any
 
00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
discussion on this on the part of the
 
00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.149 align:start position:0%
discussion on this on the part of the
panelists

00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
panelists
 
00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
if so please raise mike can you hear me
 
00:08:41.279 --> 00:08:41.750 align:start position:0%
if so please raise mike can you hear me
bob

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
bob
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
mike i can hear you yes
 
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
that this is just another subsidy for
 
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
the biomass um obviously we're opposed
 
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
to going
 
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
any further with this so okay thank you
 
00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:57.519 align:start position:0%
you beat that into the ground okay
 
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
all right anybody else wish to discuss
 
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.590 align:start position:0%
all right anybody else wish to discuss
this

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
yeah i'd like to speak on it um since
 
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:05.750 align:start position:0%
yeah i'd like to speak on it um since
the

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
the you know the subsidies had gone away
 
00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:09.519 align:start position:0%
on some of them
 
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
we're down to just two plants now
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
running and one will be closing soon and
 
00:09:15.509 --> 00:09:15.519 align:start position:0%
the big problem we're having
 
00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:16.959 align:start position:0%
with our forest if we're not getting
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
temper management in the last four or
 
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
five months
 
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
it's dropped off incredibly um a 30-ton
 
00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
truck of chips went for a thousand
 
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
dollars for 30 ton
 
00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
now it's going for 125 dollars
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
so they've abandoned doing their
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
cleaning and the
 
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
work is being done i think we have to
 
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
look at some kind of future legislation
 
00:09:39.509 --> 00:09:39.519 align:start position:0%
i don't know if this feels right
 
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
i don't i know that we have to look at
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
it though
 
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
okay i'd like to agree with troy on that
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
i think that it's more complex than just
 
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
offer on
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
as far as being a manufacturing industry
 
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
in the state and how it affects the
 
00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:54.870 align:start position:0%
in the state and how it affects the
economy

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
economy
 
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
so i am i would propose that we do try
 
00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.070 align:start position:0%
so i am i would propose that we do try
and

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
figure out what is the right answer
 
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
because i'm i'm not sure that this um
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
pulling the plug the way that we have is
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
an appropriate response with the economy
 
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
having issues as it is so i i would be
 
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.389 align:start position:0%
having issues as it is so i i would be
for

00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
bringing it back and making a
 
00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:13.519 align:start position:0%
recommendation to take it forward
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
okay mr chairman could i
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
make a suggestion that um committee
 
00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
members that they can
 
00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
raise their virtual hands so and that
 
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
way that they're that you can keep it
 
00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
track of who raised their hands in what
 
00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:28.230 align:start position:0%
track of who raised their hands in what
order

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
order
 
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
so yes thank you joel i was going to
 
00:10:31.829 --> 00:10:31.839 align:start position:0%
mention that
 
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
if you go into the the the icon for
 
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.750 align:start position:0%
if you go into the the the icon for
panelists

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
panelists
 
00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
you will participants i should say you
 
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
will see the raise hand
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
icon there it's on my computer it's on
 
00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
the lower right side of that
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
panel so but do use that i'll be able to
 
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
see it and recognize you and that'll
 
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
make a
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps more orderly discussion is there
 
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
anybody who would
 
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
now would like to uh to speak further on
 
00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
it and raise a hand on it i'm
 
00:10:59.829 --> 00:10:59.839 align:start position:0%
currently not seeing anybody they have
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
visible hands of
 
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
jackie callie pitts and ken wells
 
00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:07.519 align:start position:0%
and yes and raised too okay
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
mr chairman one of these raised him but
 
00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
i'll go to you first uh representative
 
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:11.990 align:start position:0%
i'll go to you first uh representative
sampson

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
sampson
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
go right ahead yeah thank you remus mr
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
chairman uh
 
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
i'd like to agree with representative uh
 
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
murder and representative mcgee
 
00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:23.839 align:start position:0%
um i'm not i'm not uh saying that this
 
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
bill as is
 
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
is worth pursuing but something like
 
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
this is worth pursuing
 
00:11:32.069 --> 00:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
i know there are issues around the
 
00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
emissions from
 
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
biomass plants i think those can be
 
00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.550 align:start position:0%
biomass plants i think those can be
managed

00:11:36.550 --> 00:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
managed
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
on the other hand this is an in-state
 
00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
renewable energy resource
 
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
that we have it's not an out-of-state
 
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
dependency we have and we should not
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
give this up without a fight
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
um also it has as we know large economic
 
00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
impacts in our state
 
00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
and for jobs and uh the economy
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
again we shouldn't give that up so
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
easily we should find a way of making
 
00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:03.519 align:start position:0%
this work
 
00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh this provides us a little extra
 
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
energy independence
 
00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
and resilience it provides environmental
 
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
benefits for our forests it provides uh
 
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
environmental benefits for the tourism
 
00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:16.710 align:start position:0%
environmental benefits for the tourism
industry

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh i think it would be foolish for us to
 
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
give something like this up when we have
 
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
such a well-managed forest in new
 
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.670 align:start position:0%
such a well-managed forest in new
hampshire

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
possibly because we have a biomass
 
00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
industry so i would
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
support recommending legislation in the
 
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.590 align:start position:0%
support recommending legislation in the
future

00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:38.949 --> 00:12:38.959 align:start position:0%
okay mr chair i see
 
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
representative wells yes thank you i
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
agree with uh uh representative
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
samsich's uh
 
00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
assessment on this this is something
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
that we shouldn't uh give up easily i
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
understand that there are problems
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
uh that we need to address about the
 
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
pollution from biomass
 
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
but um economically there are 3.3
 
00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
million tons of wood
 
00:12:59.829 --> 00:12:59.839 align:start position:0%
harvested every year in new hampshire
 
00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:01.839 align:start position:0%
and only about 1 million tons
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
is a high-grade timber
 
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
the rest of it is is low-grade uh wood
 
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
which uh is
 
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
sold for a paper pulp or for energy
 
00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.310 align:start position:0%
sold for a paper pulp or for energy
biomass

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
biomass
 
00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:15.519 align:start position:0%
and um the forest product industry
 
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
employs about 6 200 individuals in the
 
00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.030 align:start position:0%
employs about 6 200 individuals in the
state

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
and produces an annual payroll of 242
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh so this is uh not only is it an
 
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
important renewable energy source that's
 
00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
produced in state
 
00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
but what it does for our economy is
 
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
important and so i think that that
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
we should bring this bill forward for
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
further consideration and
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
and see if we can work out some of the
 
00:13:39.509 --> 00:13:39.519 align:start position:0%
uh the difficulties um
 
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
surrounding the uh biomass pollution
 
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative wales but just
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
remember it won't be this bill it'll be
 
00:13:47.189 --> 00:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
a new bill
 
00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
right would be doing okay representative
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
platten you have your hand raised i had
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
my hand up whoa
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
uh well you don't i i'll get to you yeah
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
yeah okay i understand
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
all right yes this is another
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
government attempt to reach into the
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
pockets of ratepayers
 
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
to support a favorite technology totally
 
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
against all of these
 
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
well she may have stepped out for a
 
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
minute representative thomas
 
00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair um
 
00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
my only concern is the
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
management of our forest
 
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
the way this bill does it is
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
unacceptable to me
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
i would be interested in some action
 
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
that would cause our forest to be
 
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
properly managed but it should not be on
 
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
the backs of rate payers or anything
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
having to do with your electric bills
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
so perhaps in the future we can find
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
some way of supporting our cars
 
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
which to me is the most important issue
 
00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:58.389 align:start position:0%
which to me is the most important issue
okay

00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative callie pitts
 
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:05.120 align:start position:0%
this vote has no uh what we do our vote
 
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
has no
 
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
no bearing on anything i think i've been
 
00:15:10.629 --> 00:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
working for years
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
to keep the forest industry alive and we
 
00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:14.069 align:start position:0%
to keep the forest industry alive and we
thought

00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
thought
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
biomass was the next best thing for god
 
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
when we got rid of coal
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
so i think that we need to work on it
 
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
and whoever wants to can work on that
 
00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:26.959 align:start position:0%
and that goes for any committee or
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
anybody else
 
00:15:30.949 --> 00:15:30.959 align:start position:0%
and i i think we have to
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
if we don't have any time but i think we
 
00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
we should
 
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
informally discuss this between now
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
and the next filing period what we're
 
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
going to do and put a placeholder in
 
00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:43.749 align:start position:0%
going to do and put a placeholder in
there

00:15:43.749 --> 00:15:43.759 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
because we just can't let this industry
 
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
go belly up it's not just the industry
 
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
it's all the peripheral industries
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
around it
 
00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
and this is not the time to put a nail
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
in the coffin
 
00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:01.839 align:start position:0%
of an industry okay
 
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
um anybody else want to
 
00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
participate in this discussion i don't
 
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
see any hands raised
 
00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
let me look at the attendee list and
 
00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
make sure i haven't missed anybody there
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
no i guess not okay
 
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
and if not that's if there's no further
 
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
discussion on
 
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh house bill 1370 we can go on to
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
house bill 1402 established procedures
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
for municipal
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
host uh customer generators of
 
00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
electrical energy
 
00:16:39.829 --> 00:16:39.839 align:start position:0%
that may be people joining or on not
 
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
joining that may be what that means i
 
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
yeah bob is there any necessity to take
 
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
these in numerical order
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh we have thirteen seventy
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
we just finished that one yeah that was
 
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
what we just discussed
 
00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
sorry okay thank you
 
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh and even the any of the panelists
 
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
that is the members of the committee
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
have anything they wish to say to the to
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
the committee about this
 
00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
i'm looking to see if we have any raised
 
00:17:15.429 --> 00:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
or on the phone i guess uh i'm not
 
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:20.240 align:start position:0%
seeing anything on this
 
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative mcgee i believe has
 
00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:23.839 align:start position:0%
her hand up no she does i'm sorry
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um we just have to get used to
 
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
this little
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
panelist box using the
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's what he was saying before jackie
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
when he wasn't recognizing your hand is
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
to use the
 
00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:41.919 align:start position:0%
the hand raise in the box um
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
yeah i i think there were some good
 
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
pieces um
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
in this in the vehicle um
 
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
and so i would be in favor of working on
 
00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:53.190 align:start position:0%
and so i would be in favor of working on
this

00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
um maybe across the maybe you know
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
members from both sides on it to try and
 
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
figure out what we could do
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
um to try and make it more comprehensive
 
00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:07.039 align:start position:0%
than it initially was designed
 
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
um but also still targeted
 
00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
so i i actually think there's something
 
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
there so i think maybe
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
not this bill itself but a version of
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm just going to say i don't
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
have a hand anywhere
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
would you like that represent kelly
 
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
pitts i don't know
 
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
um i don't have sure it's do you have a
 
00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:40.310 align:start position:0%
um i don't have sure it's do you have a
the

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
the participants panel participants
 
00:18:42.799 --> 00:18:43.830 align:start position:0%
the participants panel participants
panel

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
panel
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
okay and if you go down to the the uh
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
very bottom
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
of that panel okay that's where it is
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
if you see it there yeah i see
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
it says raise hands there you go it
 
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
worked it worked okay
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
all right i just didn't know where to
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
find it because i didn't see any cans
 
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:01.750 align:start position:0%
find it because i didn't see any cans
hanging

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
hanging
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
on here okay good
 
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
we got you up to date here good to know
 
00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
uh looking at the participant list i'm
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
not seeing i don't think anybody
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
on the i mean the attendees list i don't
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
think i'm seeing anything there either
 
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
i believe representative mann just
 
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
raised his hand okay
 
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
i don't have much to say but i just
 
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
think this is an important subject and
 
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
we should
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
submit it for consideration
 
00:19:34.549 --> 00:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thank you all
 
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
any any further any further comments or
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
questions from anybody either on the
 
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
panel side of the attendee side
 
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
joel i'm not seeing any unless you see
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
something i'm gonna move on
 
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
okay i don't see anything and the next
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
one is house bill 1429
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
relative to integrated distribution
 
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
plans of electric utilities
 
00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
and again i am ready to uh uh recognize
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
anybody on the
 
00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
on the committee for a comment on this
 
00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
if there is one
 
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
let's see i see representative mcgee
 
00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
that's me um i actually sponsored this
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh with the office of the consumer
 
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:16.870 align:start position:0%
uh with the office of the consumer
advocate

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
advocate
 
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
and we had a discussion uh that if there
 
00:20:21.909 --> 00:20:21.919 align:start position:0%
is anything more that is going to be
 
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
done on this topic or others that it
 
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
will be a separate bill so we can just
 
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
recommend that this one go okay
 
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
yeah it wasn't needed yep all right
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
anything further from the members of the
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
committee or any attendee
 
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh this is mike harrington i just say i
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
agree with what representative mcgee
 
00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:42.799 align:start position:0%
just said
 
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative harrington uh
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
anything further
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
okay unless there is anything else
 
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
anybody wants to bring up uh for
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
purposes of this work session and this
 
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
would be of course
 
00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
i don't think pretty likely because we
 
00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
discussed the four bills into the
 
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
subject of this work session
 
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
but other than that i think i can now uh
 
00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
declare that the
 
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
work session portion of this committee
 
00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:09.679 align:start position:0%
meeting uh
 
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
to be uh to be concluded
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
and we can move into our executive
 
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.310 align:start position:0%
and we can move into our executive
session

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
so i'm now opening the executive session
 
00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
oh wait a minute do i see a hand raise
 
00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
from representative oxendian
 
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
a very late entry i'm i'm noting at the
 
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
bottom of my form for the subcommittee
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
work session that it's
 
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
asking me to fill out boxes on the
 
00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.270 align:start position:0%
asking me to fill out boxes on the
recommendation

00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not during the work
 
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:36.630 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not during the work
session

00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
we came up with a motion either to
 
00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.230 align:start position:0%
we came up with a motion either to
recommend

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:42.799 align:start position:0%
for future legislation or not recommend
 
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
for future legislation
 
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
is that necessary joe or can we simply
 
00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.310 align:start position:0%
is that necessary joe or can we simply
proceed

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
proceed
 
00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:50.559 align:start position:0%
you can just proceed it's not required
 
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
okay all right then we will proceed
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh let's see we have the first one is
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:03.039 align:start position:0%
1262 and i believe we are expecting a
 
00:22:03.909 --> 00:22:03.919 align:start position:0%
motion on that
 
00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
let's see who's going to be making the
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
motion on that
 
00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:11.320 align:start position:0%
that would be from me i moved in hb
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
1262 relative to the purchase of output
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
of limited electrical energy producers
 
00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:20.799 align:start position:0%
be recommended for future legislation
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
the bill promotes a number of positive
 
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
goals and the governor gave it his
 
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799 align:start position:0%
strong support several utility
 
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
representatives indicated that it needed
 
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
further refinement to make it viable
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
and this can be achieved by the sponsors
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
in a new bill
 
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
so the motion is recommended for future
 
00:22:39.909 --> 00:22:39.919 align:start position:0%
legislation is there a second from
 
00:22:39.919 --> 00:22:40.470 align:start position:0%
legislation is there a second from
anybody

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.840 align:start position:0%

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
made and seconded
 
00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh there can be discussion although of
 
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
course we've had the discussion i would
 
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
think uh pretty much in the uh
 
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
in the work session does anybody have
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%

like to present at this time
 
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.240 align:start position:0%

00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
chair mr
 
00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
just one thing that is um just a
 
00:32:32.789 --> 00:32:32.799 align:start position:0%
reminder that um the people who made the
 
00:32:32.799 --> 00:32:33.830 align:start position:0%
reminder that um the people who made the
motion

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:32:36.549 --> 00:32:36.559 align:start position:0%
for the whatever recommendation the
 
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
committee approved
 
00:32:40.389 --> 00:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
they need to make write up a statement
 
00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
and send it in to you
 
00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
so however i don't think there's a big
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
time urgency on that i guess it'll be in
 
00:32:50.389 --> 00:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
the calendar november is that right
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
right it may be good to do it sooner
 
00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:53.919 align:start position:0%
rather than later of course now it's
 
00:32:55.669 --> 00:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
usually good to do things sooner rather
 
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
than later
 
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
well they're fresh in your mind so by
 
00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919 align:start position:0%
all means i would hope our
 
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
four moving members would would get that
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
in to me and to
 
00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:07.110 align:start position:0%
in to me and to
joel

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200 align:start position:0%

00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%

00:33:10.799 --> 00:33:11.750 align:start position:0%

00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh there are no minority statements
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
attached to these so that that'll be it
 
00:33:19.430 --> 00:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh anything else before i again
 
00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
declare that the chair
 
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
point but
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
uh when the final vote count was read
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
