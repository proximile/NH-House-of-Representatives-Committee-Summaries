participate thank you very much for
 
00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 align:start position:0%
being here certainly and I can verify
 
00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 align:start position:0%
that the chair is in Senate election law
 
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
at the moment but it's probably going to
 
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
be coming back up um I for the record
 
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
I'm Donna Susi I represent Senate
 
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
District 18 which is comprised of town
 
00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 align:start position:0%
of Lichfield and Wards 5 through n in
 
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
the city of Manchester and I sponsored
 
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
this bill as at a request of the clerk
 
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
of Association but in particular my city
 
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 align:start position:0%
clerk Matt Norman who's the clerk in
 
00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 align:start position:0%
Manchester um the bill has changed a bit
 
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
since um I originally introduced it
 
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
there are a couple issues that I will
 
00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 align:start position:0%
point out to you um and I I think the
 
00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 align:start position:0%
clerks May Echo those concerns as well
 
00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 align:start position:0%
but essentially the issue is twofold it
 
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 align:start position:0%
attempts to um
 
00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 align:start position:0%
attempts to achieve two goals um number
 
00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 align:start position:0%
one is to allow for
 
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 align:start position:0%
pre-processing for the management of
 
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 align:start position:0%
workflow for City and town clerks as we
 
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
know particularly the presidential
 
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
elections there were a number of
 
00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots cast having a public
 
00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
process which to me is critical um
 
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
allowing for that
 
00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:31.159 align:start position:0%
preprocessing does two things as I first
 
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned it would alleviate some of the
 
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
time spent on Election Day trying to
 
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 align:start position:0%
Mark a checklist and processing those
 
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
ballots which does take significant
 
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
amount of time depending on how many are
 
00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 align:start position:0%
being processed um but the second issue
 
00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
is if the pre-processing is done in
 
00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:55.519 align:start position:0%
advance of election day to the extent
 
00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
the voter has provided contact
 
00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
information Beyond just their address
 
00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 align:start position:0%
phone number email which is optional but
 
00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 align:start position:0%
if they've provided it it does give an
 
00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity for voters who have made a
 
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
mistake either not signed the envelope
 
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
or um you know have left the ballot
 
00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919 align:start position:0%
outsa an opportunity to cure their
 
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 align:start position:0%
ballot so those were the two goals we
 
00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
were hoping to achieve with the
 
00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 align:start position:0%
legislation um there are a couple things
 
00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 align:start position:0%
as I said that I would note that are
 
00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
different different from the original
 
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
version that the clerks will probably um
 
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
speak to um but one is about the ballot
 
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
curing um the bill as amended now
 
00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 align:start position:0%
mandates that the clerk scheduled two
 
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 align:start position:0%
dates to open absentee ballots the
 
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
original legislation was just
 
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
one um
 
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
and to the extent they have to cure I
 
00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
think the clerks are looking for a
 
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 align:start position:0%
little more precise direction as to what
 
00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 align:start position:0%
that means um in many cases it's picking
 
00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 align:start position:0%
up the telephone or it's sending out an
 
00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 align:start position:0%
email um I think some of that could be
 
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
addressed in the election manual but I
 
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
think we want to make sure that there's
 
00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
uniformity in that process
 
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
um we also I think wanted to make this
 
00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 align:start position:0%
optional um in a place like Manchester
 
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
the volume is a little different than in
 
00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 align:start position:0%
some of our other towns it may be more
 
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:30.440 align:start position:0%
manageable um we want wanted to make it
 
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
optional so that it is a
 
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.510 align:start position:0%
optional so that it is a
tool

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
tool
 
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
um we have done the process before in
 
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester we did during the 2020
 
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
elections when the legislation was for
 
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
that specific election
 
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 align:start position:0%
cycle um the logistics were a bit tough
 
00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 align:start position:0%
but I think everything worked relatively
 
00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
well however there was a cost associated
 
00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
with doing it because wow um we have 12
 
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
Wards quite the weather uh 12 Wards and
 
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
it was done all in one place so it
 
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
required a rental and some other
 
00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
logistical concerns but um by and large
 
00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to talk to any to respond to
 
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
any questions about specific parameters
 
00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:20.759 align:start position:0%
of the bill but I do think I would ask
 
00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
that um you do consider making it
 
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
optional so that it is an important tool
 
00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
and that there be some language that if
 
00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 align:start position:0%
voters are if election officials are
 
00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160 align:start position:0%
directed to cure that that be included
 
00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639 align:start position:0%
in the election manual that is prepared
 
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:41.800 align:start position:0%
by the secretary of state with that I'd
 
00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:43.479 align:start position:0%
conclude my testimony and be happy to
 
00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
answer any questions oh thank you very
 
00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
much do we have questions from the
 
00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
wood thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm a little confused
 
00:06:57.869 --> 00:06:57.879 align:start position:0%
here we we're talking about mandating
 
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
two days and making an optional what are
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
you looking at making an option optional
 
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
so so as I thank you representative wood
 
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
as I said the bill originally was
 
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
proposed as optional when it got amended
 
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
um the amendment which was prepared by
 
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
Senator gray that I did go along with
 
00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:19.400 align:start position:0%
had a requirement that there be two
 
00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:21.800 align:start position:0%
dates what I was explaining is that that
 
00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:25.160 align:start position:0%
was not what I had been asked to do by
 
00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
the clerk's Association so to the extent
 
00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:31.720 align:start position:0%
you know they will provide more input
 
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
that's something that I think we might
 
00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:37.479 align:start position:0%
want to go back to but I do repres I
 
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:41.400 align:start position:0%
want to represent what I was directed to
 
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.990 align:start position:0%
want to represent what I was directed to
do

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:07:48.629 --> 00:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
um yeah certainly yeah thank you so uh
 
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
the it seems
 
00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:53.759 align:start position:0%
like it was brought across as a mandate
 
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
I I don't understand why we would
 
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
mandate all the towns to do something
 
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
like this so I I'm just stuck with what
 
00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:03.759 align:start position:0%
I'm reading right now I and and have a a
 
00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
problem with that completely so that's
 
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
why I'm bringing it up twice sorry and
 
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:09.400 align:start position:0%
you did a good job explaining where
 
00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
you're you're on it but why why was it
 
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
felt if you can help help me on this
 
00:08:17.149 --> 00:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to speak for Senator
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
gray as I said he did draft the
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
amendment um I think he his his ultimate
 
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
goal is to sure that as many people who
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
do cast absentee ballots can participate
 
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:39.320 align:start position:0%
in the process so by mandating a cure
 
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
section it means that many more ballots
 
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:45.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
counted to the extent a voter is able to
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
be do we have any other questions from
 
00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
oh I recognize uh representative Lane
 
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator Susi um there was a
 
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
mention about handwriting analysis that
 
00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:09.959 align:start position:0%
this bill might be flipping us back to
 
00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
handwriting analysis could you speak to
 
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
that sure um I think you're referring
 
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
there is language about signature right
 
00:09:24.269 --> 00:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
um that is on page five of the bill
 
00:09:26.829 --> 00:09:26.839 align:start position:0%
compare the signature on that's language
 
00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
that I I personally think should be
 
00:09:31.949 --> 00:09:31.959 align:start position:0%
removed existing language there is no
 
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:36.920 align:start position:0%
intent to uh the bill as drafted and as
 
00:09:40.069 --> 00:09:40.079 align:start position:0%
amended um does not revert back to
 
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
Signature comparison um I think there
 
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
was litigation right um we were directed
 
00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:50.120 align:start position:0%
to suspend that practice um because it
 
00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:51.959 align:start position:0%
was perceived to be disenfranchising
 
00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:54.200 align:start position:0%
voters I don't think this legislation is
 
00:09:57.389 --> 00:09:57.399 align:start position:0%
drafted in any way goes back to that but
 
00:09:59.470 --> 00:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
it doesn't delete the language that has
 
00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
the signature requirement from the past
 
00:10:07.069 --> 00:10:07.079 align:start position:0%
yeah follow yeah yes thank you um my
 
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
concern is if that we then again pass
 
00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
the bill that has that in it are we
 
00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:15.519 align:start position:0%
sending a message to the courts that
 
00:10:19.949 --> 00:10:19.959 align:start position:0%
were trying to override their decision I
 
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
I don't know I that that was just a
 
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
concern that I had I didn't know if you
 
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:25.240 align:start position:0%
shared it or not I I think that's a
 
00:10:27.389 --> 00:10:27.399 align:start position:0%
reasonable concern as I say I think my
 
00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
my personal preference would be to
 
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
elimin minate that provision but if you
 
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
look it starts on um page four it's
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
section s um you can see what the
 
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
amendments are which is to strike
 
00:10:41.829 --> 00:10:41.839 align:start position:0%
through open the envelope and instead
 
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:43.720 align:start position:0%
replace it with process absentee and
 
00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:45.959 align:start position:0%
then when you get to the next page the
 
00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:47.720 align:start position:0%
signature language was what was already
 
00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.509 align:start position:0%
signature language was what was already
there

00:10:50.509 --> 00:10:50.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
okay okay sorry about that just doing
 
00:10:55.069 --> 00:10:55.079 align:start position:0%
double duty actually it was at just at
 
00:10:57.629 --> 00:10:57.639 align:start position:0%
your committee um we were we were
 
00:10:58.990 --> 00:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
switching Mr chairman and I'm going
 
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
right back down in a minute so um any
 
00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
other further questions from the
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
committee um I have yes represent one
 
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
more I'm sorry I one more question um in
 
00:11:13.949 --> 00:11:13.959 align:start position:0%
here it's mandated for two days and um
 
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
in would it be better for cities or
 
00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
towns that don't have that many to have
 
00:11:24.269 --> 00:11:24.279 align:start position:0%
the option of up to two or I mean was
 
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
there a re specific reason to was
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
selected yeah that was the question that
 
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
representative would asked me so my bill
 
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
as originally drafted did have the
 
00:11:37.069 --> 00:11:37.079 align:start position:0%
option um of doing
 
00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
pre-processing um in order to get
 
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
a unanimous vote out of the Senate on
 
00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
the legislation um the amendment was
 
00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:49.079 align:start position:0%
drafted to require it the reasoning
 
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
behind requiring it for those that
 
00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:55.839 align:start position:0%
supported it was to ensure that as many
 
00:11:55.839 --> 00:11:57.190 align:start position:0%
supported it was to ensure that as many
deficient

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
deficient
 
00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
ballots that would not have enabled able
 
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:02.200 align:start position:0%
to be counted could be cured in advance
 
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
so yes thank you but there was no
 
00:12:13.949 --> 00:12:13.959 align:start position:0%
specific reason why two was picked I
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
mean because many could do it in one was
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
that a change I'm sorry if I'm if you've
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
already answered that I'm not following
 
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I didn't I didn't answer the
 
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
question as to two and honestly I can't
 
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
speak to it I can just tell you that it
 
00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
was the committee chair's preference it
 
00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:31.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
too are there further questions from the
 
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:39.160 align:start position:0%
committee oh yes representative HR thank
 
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
you um if an error is found when we open
 
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:47.000 align:start position:0%
up the ballots the affidavit is not
 
00:12:49.269 --> 00:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
signed or something how do we contact
 
00:12:49.279 --> 00:12:50.269 align:start position:0%
signed or something how do we contact
the

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
people so that's the question that I
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
think would need to be
 
00:12:58.189 --> 00:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
addressed in the election manual so that
 
00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
there is a uniform process right now we
 
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
request um but it is optional inform uh
 
00:13:07.629 --> 00:13:07.639 align:start position:0%
information including telephone number
 
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
and email
 
00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
address those would be the methods by
 
00:13:14.829 --> 00:13:14.839 align:start position:0%
which you could contact a voter um and
 
00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839 align:start position:0%
if you're pre-processing there's time to
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
do that I think the clerks can give you
 
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
more specificity as to the process they
 
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
used during covid when they did a lot
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
more of this but I think the concept
 
00:13:31.389 --> 00:13:31.399 align:start position:0%
would be to include Direction in the
 
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
election law manual provided by the
 
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
committee okay last call for questions
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
from the committee I seeing none thank
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
you very much senator for speaking with
 
00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
Mr okay
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
Bundy thank you for joining us today my
 
00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
pleasure um representative qua and other
 
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
members of house election law my name is
 
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:26.680 align:start position:0%
Linda Bundy I'm from antrum and I
 
00:14:30.430 --> 00:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
support SP 537 allowing the processing
 
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
of absentee ballots My Town Clerk and
 
00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
moderator are in favor of allowing
 
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
pre-processing of absentee ballots
 
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
during the 2020 elections they
 
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
encountered a number of ballots with
 
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
inner envelopes that had errors or
 
00:14:48.749 --> 00:14:48.759 align:start position:0%
omissions in each instance they were
 
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
able to contact the voter who then came
 
00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
and completed the envelope correctly the
 
00:14:56.389 --> 00:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
voters were pleased and grateful for
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
this opportunity that ensured their vote
 
00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
votes would be counted with larger towns
 
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
and cities in addition to providing
 
00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
voters a way to cure their ballots
 
00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
pre-processing can make counting the
 
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
ballots on Election Day more efficient
 
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
for election
 
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:15.240 align:start position:0%
workers the Senate house election and
 
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
Municipal Affairs committee unanimously
 
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
voted this bill OTP and the full Senate
 
00:15:24.509 --> 00:15:24.519 align:start position:0%
approved it by a Voice vote I ask that
 
00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:26.959 align:start position:0%
you do the same and vote ought to pass
 
00:15:29.309 --> 00:15:29.319 align:start position:0%
on S SP 537
 
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:32.560 align:start position:0%

committee uh seeing none thank you very

okay thank you very much for joining us
 
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
good morning committee uh my name is
 
00:16:07.309 --> 00:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
Tina Guilford I'm the town clerk in
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
Derry I was the moderator in Derry in
 
00:16:15.269 --> 00:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
2020 um we pre-processed ballots for the
 
00:16:19.389 --> 00:16:19.399 align:start position:0%
November election and it went great this
 
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
gave residents the opportunity to come
 
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
in and cure
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
defaults um many people forget to sign
 
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
the envelope it it is probably one of
 
00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
the number one reasons for an absentee
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
ballot being
 
00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079 align:start position:0%
rejected I supported this bill in the
 
00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:40.360 align:start position:0%
Senate I testified in support of it and
 
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
I still support it I do however have a
 
00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:44.079 align:start position:0%
couple of
 
00:16:47.069 --> 00:16:47.079 align:start position:0%
concerns when the bill uh was originally
 
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
introduced it addressed RSA 659 colon
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
49 there's two things in that part of
 
00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:55.910 align:start position:0%
49 there's two things in that part of
the

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:59.069 --> 00:16:59.079 align:start position:0%
statute um and that part of the statute
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
um specifically
 
00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:02.630 align:start position:0%
says that
 
00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:04.630 align:start position:0%
says that
[Music]

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
um that ballot processing shall begin at
 
00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:10.839 align:start position:0%
1 p.m unless at a different time that is
 
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
no earlier than two hours after the
 
00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
opening of the
 
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:18.839 align:start position:0%
polls however this part says that you
 
00:17:21.510 --> 00:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
may open absentee ballot outer envelopes
 
00:17:24.029 --> 00:17:24.039 align:start position:0%
on Election Day at any time after the
 
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
opening of the polls so I think we have
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
two statutes in conflict
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
also um the original Bill uh removed
 
00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
part two of RSA 659 colon 49 uh which
 
00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
upon the written challenges of 10 or
 
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
more voters who are present at the polls
 
00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
no later than 1 pm the might
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
pre-processed these ballots um so again
 
00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
I think there is a little bit of
 
00:17:53.150 --> 00:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
conflict here and I think that's
 
00:17:56.029 --> 00:17:56.039 align:start position:0%
something that you need to
 
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
address uh my other largest issue issue
 
00:18:02.029 --> 00:18:02.039 align:start position:0%
is that um there are a couple of
 
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
different spots in here that
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
state um for example um on page three
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
line 22 absentee ballots returned to the
 
00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
town or city clerks in person shall not
 
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
be required to be placed in such outer
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
envelopes which is great we can save
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
some trees my problem is is that has
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
anyone sometimes tried to decipher a
 
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
signature to see who that ballot belongs
 
00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.669 align:start position:0%
signature to see who that ballot belongs
to

00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
and my concern is is that we attach the
 
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
application to the
 
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:37.960 align:start position:0%
envelope I don't know how other towns do
 
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
it but we paperclip it because we don't
 
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
want to staple it we don't want to put
 
00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
any holes through the absentee ballot
 
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's inside that affidavit
 
00:18:51.549 --> 00:18:51.559 align:start position:0%
envelope well all you need is the box to
 
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
knock over and now all of a sudden
 
00:18:55.789 --> 00:18:55.799 align:start position:0%
everything separates and now you really
 
00:18:58.029 --> 00:18:58.039 align:start position:0%
don't know which one goes to which
 
00:18:59.950 --> 00:18:59.960 align:start position:0%
without sitting there and examining
 
00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
signatures it's a lot easier with the
 
00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
name and address on the outer
 
00:19:08.190 --> 00:19:08.200 align:start position:0%
envelope I I'm okay with not having the
 
00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
outer envelope what I would love is If
 
00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
On The Backs side of the affidavit
 
00:19:15.029 --> 00:19:15.039 align:start position:0%
envelope there were pre-printed lines
 
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
where people could put their name and
 
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
address so that that way it would be
 
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
easier to keep it all organized in case
 
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
for some reason they become separated
 
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:19:27.909 --> 00:19:27.919 align:start position:0%
application um I'm just thinking about a
 
00:19:30.149 --> 00:19:30.159 align:start position:0%
real world
 
00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
issue um there are some other um
 
00:19:36.669 --> 00:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
questions about um curing the defaults
 
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:38.440 align:start position:0%
and what have you um hopefully that
 
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
would all be addressed by the election
 
00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
procedure manual um as to whether we
 
00:19:46.029 --> 00:19:46.039 align:start position:0%
would need to issue a second absentee
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
ballot and and all of that uh but
 
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
hopefully that would be addressed in the
 
00:19:53.149 --> 00:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
election procedure manual and I am happy
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
to take any questions thank you do we
 
00:19:58.270 --> 00:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
have any questions from the committee
 
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
represent sentive warry thank you Mr
 
00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:02.240 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you for taking my
 
00:20:05.149 --> 00:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
question and approximately how many
 
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
ballots you know percentage wise or
 
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
quantity wise did were needed to be
 
00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:11.480 align:start position:0%
cured in that
 
00:20:13.950 --> 00:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
manner so I looked real quick at the
 
00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.029 align:start position:0%
manner so I looked real quick at the
presidential

00:20:16.029 --> 00:20:16.039 align:start position:0%
presidential
 
00:20:16.039 --> 00:20:17.950 align:start position:0%
presidential
primary

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
primary
 
00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.950 align:start position:0%
primary
um

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
we we had
 
00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
about um 10% that were
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
rejected and half of them were because
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
they were missing a
 
00:20:34.029 --> 00:20:34.039 align:start position:0%
signature and and were you how what
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
percentage of that half were you able to
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
oh so um you're talking about in
 
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
2020 um that's when we last
 
00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
pre-processed okay uh so going back to
 
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:54.799 align:start position:0%
preprocessing a good 60% of them were
 
00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
cured we pre-processed on the Thursday
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
and Friday
 
00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
prior to election day and our clerk um
 
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
had hours on Saturday and
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
Sunday um for absentee ballots and we
 
00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
had people come in um in fact we were on
 
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
TV during the pre-processing um I know
 
00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
there are new stations you can probably
 
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
Google it we actually had people because
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
we were actively calling them as we were
 
00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
getting the rejections and we had people
 
00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
come in in person while were
 
00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
pre-processing to fix their
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
ballots um so it was a lot of people
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
were able to cure their default um and
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
were able to vote and have their ballot
 
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
counted another another followup yes um
 
00:21:48.669 --> 00:21:48.679 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to just uh touch on the
 
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
suggestion you made with regard to the
 
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
backside of uh writing of the name and
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
address on the application envelope do
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
you have any concerns with voter privacy
 
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
or privacy of the vote if that's
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
done um that somehow the and people
 
00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
opening up the envelope that might see
 
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
and so normally when you're processing
 
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot you're opening the
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
outer envelope which has their name and
 
00:22:16.669 --> 00:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
address on it you announce their name
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
and then you pull it out and then you
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
open the second envelope I mean it's all
 
00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
done at the same time so the
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
information's already there okay and the
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
people who are processing them are doing
 
00:22:33.789 --> 00:22:33.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:37.029 --> 00:22:37.039 align:start position:0%
information further questions from the
 
00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
committee uh I I do have a question uh
 
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
and a followup uh thank you for taking
 
00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:46.799 align:start position:0%
my question uh when you say curing the
 
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
ballot I I presume you meant curing the
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
affidavit yes curing curing the default
 
00:22:54.669 --> 00:22:54.679 align:start position:0%
whatever that default may be and a
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
followup to that uh you mentioned that
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
you were able to to fix quite a a number
 
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
of those what percentage of the one of
 
00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.470 align:start position:0%
of those what percentage of the one of
the

00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
uh the affidavits you tried to get in
 
00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
contact with the voter what percentage
 
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
could you not get in contact with rough
 
00:23:12.149 --> 00:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
yeah roughly there were probably four or
 
00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
five that did not give us any contact
 
00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:18.200 align:start position:0%
information be it a phone number or an
 
00:23:20.909 --> 00:23:20.919 align:start position:0%
email cuz those things are optional on
 
00:23:23.789 --> 00:23:23.799 align:start position:0%
the application so I if they don't put
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
it on the application then we have no
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
way really of getting in contact with
 
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
them this was also only a few days
 
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
before the
 
00:23:37.029 --> 00:23:37.039 align:start position:0%
election um you know there there are you
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
know the clerk processing that they're
 
00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
talking about is you know you can do it
 
00:23:44.909 --> 00:23:44.919 align:start position:0%
as early as three weeks prior to the
 
00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
election so that would give a lot of
 
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
time I as a clerk I could mail the
 
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
resident a letter and they would
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully get it and still be able to
 
00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
come in and and a lot of the people who
 
00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:02.360 align:start position:0%
um voted absentee and and had an issue
 
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
um and it's the missing signature or
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
they don't send the affidavit envelope
 
00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
back at all um some of those people
 
00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
could not come in uh when we did the
 
00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799 align:start position:0%
pre-processing because they were
 
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
traveling they were not here anymore so
 
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
um and I had a few people be like well
 
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
it's not like I can come and fix it now
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
um um in wherever right I'm sorry I
 
00:24:29.669 --> 00:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
tried okay well thank you do we have any
 
00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
other questions from the
 
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
committee uh seeing none thank you very
 
00:24:35.549 --> 00:24:35.559 align:start position:0%

00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559 align:start position:0%
here in conard um it's really important
 
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
um that we listen to the election
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
workers who really like this idea of
 
00:25:08.909 --> 00:25:08.919 align:start position:0%
opening the outer envelopes and making
 
00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
sure we're correcting ballots that a uh
 
00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
a voter may have made a um mistake it's
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
not a common practice for them to
 
00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
understand what these affidavits mean
 
00:25:19.549 --> 00:25:19.559 align:start position:0%
did they sign the left side did they
 
00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
sign the right side um during in 20120
 
00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:25.240 align:start position:0%
when we had pre-processing um it did
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
save a lot of time on Election Day um 39
 
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
States permit some sort of
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
pre-processing or opening of the outer
 
00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:35.240 align:start position:0%
envelopes um and I think it's really
 
00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:38.360 align:start position:0%
important this is a nonpartisan measure
 
00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:40.120 align:start position:0%
um to lessen the strain of election
 
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
works and speed up the time of tallying
 
00:25:45.149 --> 00:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
um and making sure our ballots are
 
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
secure and accurate I also have um
 
00:25:51.789 --> 00:25:51.799 align:start position:0%
testimony from our um public policy uh
 
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
fellow who's a college student and
 
00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:56.200 align:start position:0%
oftentimes college students are uh
 
00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
voting um and I think it's also
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
important for um you know many of the
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
college students may not have read the
 
00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
400 pages of election law and understand
 
00:26:06.789 --> 00:26:06.799 align:start position:0%
it all and so they might need yeah I
 
00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
mean some of them might have read the
 
00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
400 pages of the manual but some of them
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
may have not and and um they don't know
 
00:26:15.389 --> 00:26:15.399 align:start position:0%
all of the ins and outs on how to how to
 
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
do them and so you know we could also
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
address this by U making sure the
 
00:26:22.269 --> 00:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
instructions are are as clear and I just
 
00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919 align:start position:0%
also wanted to point out um that
 
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
um uh this also talks about on page four
 
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
line 20 um for voters that are um are
 
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
blind and voting with a disability and I
 
00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
do think that
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
um uh voters with disabilities uh
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
especially print disabilities have
 
00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:44.679 align:start position:0%
trouble knowing where to sign on those
 
00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:47.240 align:start position:0%
applications so assistance is required
 
00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:49.640 align:start position:0%
for those voters and with that I'm happy
 
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
to take good in questions okay thank you
 
00:26:55.389 --> 00:26:55.399 align:start position:0%
do we have any questions from the
 
00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
committee uh I see none so thank you
 
00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:08.909 --> 00:27:08.919 align:start position:0%
testimony uh next Dan
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
today hi uh Dan Healey uh representing
 
00:27:19.149 --> 00:27:19.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire City and town clerks
 
00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:21.320 align:start position:0%
Association uh where I'm the current
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
president uh so our
 
00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
association um we don't want to be
 
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
mandated to have the pre-processing we
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
like some clerks like doing it some um
 
00:27:34.669 --> 00:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
we want the option so the original Bill
 
00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:37.720 align:start position:0%
had the had the option I think this bill
 
00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:40.120 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment changes that a little
 
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
bit um and the other concern that I've
 
00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
heard uh which Tina spoke on was the
 
00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
curing um so there needs to be a
 
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
specific process outlined for the curing
 
00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
of the absentee ballots um if a resident
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
sends they're in Florida they send their
 
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot to us and they don't
 
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
have the signature what is our process
 
00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
are we sending them the ballot back for
 
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
them to sign it are we sending them a
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
new ballot I think that needs to be uh
 
00:28:11.149 --> 00:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
spelled out so the election procedure
 
00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
manual is recommendations from the state
 
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
but I think that it should be uh
 
00:28:19.389 --> 00:28:19.399 align:start position:0%
outlined what the actual process is
 
00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
that's one of the concerns I've heard um
 
00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
from another clerk uh during this this
 
00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
process um my personal opinion on the
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
bill is that I um I spoke in favor of
 
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
the original bill in the Senate I
 
00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
believe the original Bill uh that was
 
00:28:43.149 --> 00:28:43.159 align:start position:0%
proposed by Senator Susi um accomplished
 
00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
everything that the clerk's Association
 
00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:48.440 align:start position:0%
wanted and I believe the original bill
 
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
without any of the Amendments um is
 
00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
superior to the current the current bill
 
00:28:56.669 --> 00:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
and I'd be open to any questions okay
 
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:03.919 align:start position:0%
committee thank you yes representative
 
00:29:07.149 --> 00:29:07.159 align:start position:0%
Brennan thank you is it your
 
00:29:11.669 --> 00:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
understanding that the um procedures
 
00:29:14.669 --> 00:29:14.679 align:start position:0%
that you would like to be um outlined
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
for you is it your understanding that
 
00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:19.559 align:start position:0%
that needs to be written into statute or
 
00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
is it sufficient to have it in the
 
00:29:24.149 --> 00:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
election procedural manual um issued by
 
00:29:27.509 --> 00:29:27.519 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office so I
 
00:29:30.029 --> 00:29:30.039 align:start position:0%
mean I would like a procedure
 
00:29:33.909 --> 00:29:33.919 align:start position:0%
written um the the election procedure
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
manual what it is if it's not in law
 
00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:39.320 align:start position:0%
it's guidance from the state so it's not
 
00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
required to then do it that way it's
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
more of a it's a guidance from Secretary
 
00:29:45.509 --> 00:29:45.519 align:start position:0%
of State's office so if it's in law
 
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:47.720 align:start position:0%
that's what we need to do so if you have
 
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
it as a procedure clerks could could
 
00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:53.320 align:start position:0%
have their own procedure for curing the
 
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
ballot I think something should be
 
00:29:59.070 --> 00:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
spelled out for the clerks to make it so
 
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
everyone's doing the same thing and
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
there's no issues with with the
 
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
process followup please yes thank you um
 
00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
does that run contrary to the clerk's
 
00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
position of not wanting a mandate for
 
00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:18.669 align:start position:0%
position of not wanting a mandate for
the

00:30:18.669 --> 00:30:18.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
pre-processing so as in um the position
 
00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
of the clerks Association was that this
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
amendment makes it mandated that
 
00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:28.600 align:start position:0%
pre-processing occurs
 
00:30:32.669 --> 00:30:32.679 align:start position:0%
but if there is um a procedure outlined
 
00:30:36.029 --> 00:30:36.039 align:start position:0%
in the statute does that not make it a
 
00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:38.559 align:start position:0%
mandatory procedure and are those two
 
00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
things in Conflict they wouldn't be in
 
00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
Conflict so if you chose if a clerk
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
chose to do the
 
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
preprocessing that's when they'd see
 
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:48.640 align:start position:0%
that inner envelope and they they'd
 
00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
realize if the um the voter didn't sign
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
it but if they're not doing the
 
00:30:55.269 --> 00:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
pre-processing they wouldn't then see
 
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
that envelope until election day you
 
00:30:59.870 --> 00:30:59.880 align:start position:0%
want to you want to be opening the
 
00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:01.559 align:start position:0%
outside envelope to then see the
 
00:31:04.029 --> 00:31:04.039 align:start position:0%
affidavit envelope until until election
 
00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
pre-processing yes representative
 
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:14.799 align:start position:0%
Lane uh thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
Mr Healey um for
 
00:31:17.279 --> 00:31:19.029 align:start position:0%
Mr Healey um for
testifying

00:31:19.029 --> 00:31:19.039 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
um did the original Bill have those cure
 
00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:25.480 align:start position:0%
Provisions in it and I have not read the
 
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
original bill I apologize I I don't
 
00:31:29.789 --> 00:31:29.799 align:start position:0%
believe it it did um that's something
 
00:31:31.269 --> 00:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
that's come up over the last few weeks
 
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
talking with some of the other clerks um
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
especially the larger communities that
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
they get a significant amount of
 
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots that if they were to
 
00:31:41.789 --> 00:31:41.799 align:start position:0%
pre-process they want to know what
 
00:31:43.950 --> 00:31:43.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to do with that ballot I
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
mean should they be mailing a completed
 
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
ballot back to someone just for a
 
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
signature or should we be mailing a a
 
00:31:51.549 --> 00:31:51.559 align:start position:0%
new ballot Alto together like what
 
00:31:53.789 --> 00:31:53.799 align:start position:0%
should we be doing some of the the
 
00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:55.799 align:start position:0%
residents I mean they're local they just
 
00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
can't be there on Election Day so they
 
00:31:59.190 --> 00:31:59.200 align:start position:0%
can come and they could sign it but if
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
we're mailing it if we have to mail back
 
00:32:03.389 --> 00:32:03.399 align:start position:0%
a completed ballot is that something
 
00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
that we should be doing say sending it
 
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
to Florida a belt that's already filled
 
00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:10.919 align:start position:0%
out back to the voter I have a follow
 
00:32:14.509 --> 00:32:14.519 align:start position:0%
have a follow yes certainly U thank you
 
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
um if we put say like skeletal cure
 
00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
stuff and then leave it to the Secretary
 
00:32:23.629 --> 00:32:23.639 align:start position:0%
of State to kind of elaborate on those
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
would that be something that I
 
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
mean they could provide the guidance
 
00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
that you wanted around the skeletal
 
00:32:33.389 --> 00:32:33.399 align:start position:0%
Provisions that we put in I I think that
 
00:32:36.509 --> 00:32:36.519 align:start position:0%
would be a good option um I think clerks
 
00:32:37.789 --> 00:32:37.799 align:start position:0%
are just looking for some type of
 
00:32:39.789 --> 00:32:39.799 align:start position:0%
guidance on what they would have to do
 
00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:54.909 --> 00:32:54.919 align:start position:0%
ballots yes representative Barry thank
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
you I'm sorry I'm I'm in and out our
 
00:32:58.269 --> 00:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
friends in this Senate got me my steps
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
in today um I I missed questions so have
 
00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
you addressed the mandatory part of this
 
00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
bill and the clerk's Association stance
 
00:33:10.509 --> 00:33:10.519 align:start position:0%
on it being a forced requirement I I
 
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
spoke on it briefly um Tina also uh der
 
00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:18.039 align:start position:0%
town clerk spoke on this um we're not in
 
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
favor of mandating it so we would like
 
00:33:23.789 --> 00:33:23.799 align:start position:0%
an option for for the clerks to decide
 
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
if that's what they want to do in their
 
00:33:26.669 --> 00:33:26.679 align:start position:0%
Community if it makes sense for them to
 
00:33:30.149 --> 00:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
pre-process or not to pre-process so
 
00:33:32.669 --> 00:33:32.679 align:start position:0%
we're not our association's not in favor
 
00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:36.200 align:start position:0%
of of a mandate we do like having the
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:41.720 align:start position:0%
pre-process any other questions from the
 
00:33:45.029 --> 00:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
committee yes representative
 
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919 align:start position:0%
wry thank you Mr chair and uh thank you
 
00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
Mr Healey for taking my question just
 
00:33:53.029 --> 00:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
just to clarify what
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
um what's the decision-making process
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
then that that the clerks are looking
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
for in in terms of whether to
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
pre-process or not is there I it's it's
 
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
almost a followup to representative
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
Brennan's question is trying to
 
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
understand the the
 
00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
rationale um
 
00:34:15.149 --> 00:34:15.159 align:start position:0%
for what the clerks are are when the
 
00:34:18.149 --> 00:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
clerks are just choosing to make a
 
00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:21.919 align:start position:0%
pre-processing event or not and how we
 
00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
and understanding how then if you want
 
00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
that sort of specificity and regulation
 
00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
what do we need to do to accomplish that
 
00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm just trying to if you'll bear
 
00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
up with my questioning um understand
 
00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
this a little better so that we can make
 
00:34:41.990 --> 00:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
sure we get the best possible bill here
 
00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
yes so I I think it depends on the
 
00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
volume so in 2020 uh when I was in Derry
 
00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
we had around 7,000 absentee ballots um
 
00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
so to be able to pre-process at that
 
00:34:58.069 --> 00:34:58.079 align:start position:0%
time was extremely helpful um when you
 
00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
have a town election and we're at a 100
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
ballots you know it's not really it's
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
not really going to save us much time on
 
00:35:09.589 --> 00:35:09.599 align:start position:0%
Election Day to pre-process those those
 
00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:12.040 align:start position:0%
hundreds so I think it it really depends
 
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
on the quantity um in the availability
 
00:35:18.109 --> 00:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
of people to come in and actually do the
 
00:35:20.349 --> 00:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
pre-processing and all that but I think
 
00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:23.960 align:start position:0%
it it it more ties with the quantity I
 
00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:25.960 align:start position:0%
looking at the records in nashaa they
 
00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
had around 15,000 absentee ballots in
 
00:35:32.349 --> 00:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
2020 so um I mean that was beneficial to
 
00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
them it's a few it would be a few
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
thousand per Ward which takes a
 
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
significant amount of time so to be able
 
00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
to get a start on processing them prior
 
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:45.400 align:start position:0%
to the election was was helpful but you
 
00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
know for our municipal election when we
 
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
only have a couple hundred absentee
 
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
ballots spread out across the whole city
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's not really a a time saer when it
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.550 align:start position:0%
 
further

00:35:59.550 --> 00:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
questions representative rafter yes
 
00:36:05.309 --> 00:36:05.319 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks for taking my question um
 
00:36:06.589 --> 00:36:06.599 align:start position:0%
I think we all understand why the
 
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
Mandate is a kind of a burden but if
 
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
it's optional don't we end up with some
 
00:36:14.910 --> 00:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
towns doing it some towns not so voters
 
00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
across the state are not treated equally
 
00:36:21.309 --> 00:36:21.319 align:start position:0%
they're they're being um processed based
 
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
on what town they live in shouldn't we
 
00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:26.680 align:start position:0%
have a consistent uh approach across the
 
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
state to treat all voters equally yeah
 
00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
that is a good point I believe in 2020
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
it wasn't um mandated across the state I
 
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
think it was an option for the
 
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
pre-processing in 2020 so some
 
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
communities took advantage of it and and
 
00:36:44.150 --> 00:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
some some didn't yes representative
 
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
Barry so we keep talking about 2020 what
 
00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:49.720 align:start position:0%
about 2022 what have the numbers done
 
00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
since 2020 because 2020 was in the
 
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
noraly so what have they what do they
 
00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
look like now I would say our best
 
00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
comparison is going to be this upcoming
 
00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
year um in the midterm years it's not um
 
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
it's not an even
 
00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.550 align:start position:0%
it's not an even
comparison

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
comparison
 
00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
um I want to say we
 
00:37:11.309 --> 00:37:11.319 align:start position:0%
had around 3,000 absentee ballots in
 
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
nsha for the the
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
midterm um and in 2020 we had 15,000 the
 
00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
big comparison is going to be coming up
 
00:37:22.190 --> 00:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
in in November to see how many we we
 
00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
have now that we're we're out of
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
that yes representative Barry may have a
 
00:37:30.829 --> 00:37:30.839 align:start position:0%
followup um yeah so I I little question
 
00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
there you say it's not comparable but
 
00:37:34.829 --> 00:37:34.839 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about we're talking
 
00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:37.240 align:start position:0%
about the percent of the votes cast
 
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:39.640 align:start position:0%
being absentee ballot not the total
 
00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
number so wouldn't directly comparable
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
be like 2016 I would also say that 2022
 
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
is directly comparable it was a
 
00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
Statewide general election with Federal
 
00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
elections on the ballot and while we can
 
00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
have a conversation about the gross
 
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
number uh the percentage is what matters
 
00:37:56.589 --> 00:37:56.599 align:start position:0%
so what was the percentage of absentee
 
00:37:59.150 --> 00:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
ballots cast in 2022 and how does that
 
00:38:02.309 --> 00:38:02.319 align:start position:0%
justify us bringing in this covid change
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
forever I I don't have that number off
 
00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:07.240 align:start position:0%
the top of my head I can tell you that
 
00:38:10.829 --> 00:38:10.839 align:start position:0%
um in 2016 in Derry there were about
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
1,200 absente ballots for uh
 
00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
presidential election and in 2020 there
 
00:38:20.829 --> 00:38:20.839 align:start position:0%
are about 7,000 so I that I guess would
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
be the best comparison on you know the
 
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
difference the
 
00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:28.280 align:start position:0%
increase um because of
 
00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
uh because of Co and all that um the the
 
00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:33.400 align:start position:0%
jump in absentee
 
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
ballots I don't I don't expect to get as
 
00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:39.800 align:start position:0%
many as we did in 2020 for absentee
 
00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:44.200 align:start position:0%
ballots that's my um my personal opinion
 
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
I think the absentee numbers are going
 
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
to go down a little bit I don't know
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
what that number is going to be um but I
 
00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
want to I want to say without having the
 
00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
numbers in front of me in
 
00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:57.640 align:start position:0%
2022 in Nashua I want to say we have had
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
around 3,000 when in 2020 we had about
 
00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
15,000 go ahead so couldn't we compare
 
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
like the first in the nation
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
presidential primary because neither of
 
00:39:13.069 --> 00:39:13.079 align:start position:0%
those have happened during covid so
 
00:39:14.829 --> 00:39:14.839 align:start position:0%
neither those had the real the real
 
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
change so couldn't we look at those
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
numbers so couldn't we look at 202 uh
 
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
2024 uh first the nation primary and
 
00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:25.720 align:start position:0%
compare it to say 2016 or even
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
2020 I I could um I could look at my
 
00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:31.720 align:start position:0%
numbers for the presidential primary
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
that again is not it's not um as high of
 
00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
a Turnal you have a lower percentage of
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
Voters turning out for that
 
00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:41.870 align:start position:0%
Voters turning out for that
election

00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
um in 20120 we're closer I think we were
 
00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:47.680 align:start position:0%
closer to like 90% in presidential
 
00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
primary it wasn't anywhere anywhere near
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
that so it's it's tough it's it's it's
 
00:39:56.309 --> 00:39:56.319 align:start position:0%
hard to compare different election types
 
00:39:58.430 --> 00:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
to each other for
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
it has to kind of be the same type of
 
00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
number representative Brennan thank you
 
00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
um is it appropriate to say that it
 
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
would be the clerk's association's
 
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
position that something like this would
 
00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
generally increase efficiency and is
 
00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:25.640 align:start position:0%
that not something that is very
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
important to the state of New Hampshire
 
00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:32.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
efficiently so for the the
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
pre-processing just to to verify
 
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
um there's there's positives and
 
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
negatives for it uh with with the clerks
 
00:40:46.230 --> 00:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
um I know that some clerks have reported
 
00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
significant costs for pre-processing as
 
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
well so to take on that burden um to for
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
a larger Community um that may need to
 
00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:57.640 align:start position:0%
rent a space it was tens of thousands of
 
00:41:00.069 --> 00:41:00.079 align:start position:0%
for the pre-processing for the staff the
 
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
time the space rental um so there
 
00:41:05.589 --> 00:41:05.599 align:start position:0%
there's positives and negatives to both
 
00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
and that's why we kind of believe that
 
00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
it should be a uh decision uh for the
 
00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.630 align:start position:0%
it should be a uh decision uh for the
municipality

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:13.640 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:27.309 --> 00:41:27.319 align:start position:0%
committee representative prud M Brien
 
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for take uh taking
 
00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:30.200 align:start position:0%
my question thank you for being here
 
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
it's always great to hear from you and
 
00:41:35.630 --> 00:41:35.640 align:start position:0%
um hear about the association as well do
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
you think it would make sense and it
 
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
would be prudent to wait and
 
00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
see we don't know how much people want
 
00:41:49.309 --> 00:41:49.319 align:start position:0%
to absentee vote in 2024 until after
 
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
2024 and then we'll understand if that
 
00:41:54.589 --> 00:41:54.599 align:start position:0%
trend has continued and people want to
 
00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
do it because I I agree 2020 was very
 
00:42:02.109 --> 00:42:02.119 align:start position:0%
unusual you think that would be
 
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
prudent um my my opinion on that is I I
 
00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
want to stick with the option I think
 
00:42:11.069 --> 00:42:11.079 align:start position:0%
having the option for clerks is probably
 
00:42:14.109 --> 00:42:14.119 align:start position:0%
still the best the depending on the
 
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
numbers that the clerk can decide to do
 
00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:19.240 align:start position:0%
it or or not to do it um based on what
 
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
they reive for
 
00:42:25.390 --> 00:42:25.400 align:start position:0%
absentees so I wouldn't hold off on on
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
the bill but um
 
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
our position kind of still as of the
 
00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:37.400 align:start position:0%
committee uh seeing none thank you very

the uh house election law committee uh
 
01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:32.799 align:start position:0%
we'll start with uh Senate Bill 534
 
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
relative to campaign Finance uh I will
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%

01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
you what's going to happen with this uh
 
01:02:41.710 --> 01:02:41.720 align:start position:0%
representative Lane is going to get a uh
 
01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
we we only have these are our last two
 
01:02:44.710 --> 01:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
bills we have um I'm not going to bring
 
01:02:46.829 --> 01:02:46.839 align:start position:0%
the committee back for one to exec one
 
01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:49.079 align:start position:0%
bill because that would be ridiculous um
 
01:02:50.789 --> 01:02:50.799 align:start position:0%
so what we what representative Lane is
 
01:02:52.109 --> 01:02:52.119 align:start position:0%
going to do is she's going to prepare an
 
01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
amendment she'll circulate it uh to me
 
01:02:56.549 --> 01:02:56.559 align:start position:0%
and I will uh send it to via the clerk
 
01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
and myself uh and we'll do a uh we'll do

during uh a post session we'll do an ex
 
01:03:04.829 --> 01:03:04.839 align:start position:0%
quick exec on the amendment um so that
 
01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:06.960 align:start position:0%

okay um
 
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
I I'm glad that uh representative Raptor
 
01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
brought up what he did about the um
 
01:04:06.349 --> 01:04:06.359 align:start position:0%
different treatment of different voters
 
01:04:07.630 --> 01:04:07.640 align:start position:0%
which is something that went through my
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
mind as I watched this process in 2020
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
which was a a a a good thing in 2020 but
 
01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:16.279 align:start position:0%
I was concerned about that when it was
 
01:04:16.279 --> 01:04:18.309 align:start position:0%
I was concerned about that when it was
happening

01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:04:20.829 --> 01:04:20.839 align:start position:0%
and I'm also not sure that we're going
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%
to have as much of a need in the future
 
01:04:26.349 --> 01:04:26.359 align:start position:0%
and I I will um revisit this in the
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
future if that's the case but for those
 
01:04:30.190 --> 01:04:30.200 align:start position:0%
reasons I'll be voting no so I just
 
01:04:32.029 --> 01:04:32.039 align:start position:0%

discussion on the motion of inex speed
 
01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:01.390 align:start position:0%
discussion on the motion of inex speed
to

01:06:01.390 --> 01:06:01.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:06:04.269 --> 01:06:04.279 align:start position:0%
legislate um very quickly um this bill
 
01:06:06.990 --> 01:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
is not necessary U it was necessary in
 
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
2020 um we've opposed bringing in the
 
01:06:11.349 --> 01:06:11.359 align:start position:0%
covid changes making them permanent uh
 
01:06:13.230 --> 01:06:13.240 align:start position:0%
even the testimony we heard today could
 
01:06:16.430 --> 01:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
not justify this bill today um the I
 
01:06:17.870 --> 01:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
made that point in my questioning the
 
01:06:20.029 --> 01:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
numbers have gone back to normal so
 
01:06:21.549 --> 01:06:21.559 align:start position:0%
there is no I was actually surprised I
 
01:06:22.829 --> 01:06:22.839 align:start position:0%
thought there would be what I was foring
 
01:06:24.990 --> 01:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
as a absentee ballot hangover um they
 
01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
usually average around anywhere between
 
01:06:28.829 --> 01:06:28.839 align:start position:0%
8 to 10% usually around 10% depending on
 
01:06:31.549 --> 01:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
the municipality um we've seen them go
 
01:06:34.109 --> 01:06:34.119 align:start position:0%
below 15% again so we're back to normal
 
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
um there's no reason to make this
 
01:06:38.269 --> 01:06:38.279 align:start position:0%
election law change um election day
 
01:06:40.269 --> 01:06:40.279 align:start position:0%
needs to happen on Election Day every
 
01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:42.920 align:start position:0%
time you handle those ballots you it's
 
01:06:45.230 --> 01:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
not even mischievous it's not malice it
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
just invites the opportunity for
 
01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:49.799 align:start position:0%
mistakes people make mistakes um so
 
01:06:52.109 --> 01:06:52.119 align:start position:0%
there's really no reason for this um
 
01:06:55.309 --> 01:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
making it mandatory is it attempts to
 
01:06:57.269 --> 01:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
fix the problem of two classifications
 
01:06:59.670 --> 01:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
of Voters I recognize that um my thing
 
01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
is is we could have one classification
 
01:07:03.309 --> 01:07:03.319 align:start position:0%
of Voters one that has their ballot
 
01:07:07.069 --> 01:07:07.079 align:start position:0%
processed on Election Day so um I did
 
01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
circulate a letter from my city clerk uh
 
01:07:11.549 --> 01:07:11.559 align:start position:0%
when he called me uh usually when my
 
01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:13.839 align:start position:0%
city clerk calls me uh very very great
 
01:07:15.150 --> 01:07:15.160 align:start position:0%
city clerk I think he runs one of the
 
01:07:17.109 --> 01:07:17.119 align:start position:0%
best operations in the state he is the
 
01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
is obviously the largest election
 
01:07:20.269 --> 01:07:20.279 align:start position:0%
operation in the state normally when he
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
calls me uh we're going to have a very
 
01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
gentlemanly disagreement um and I was
 
01:07:26.269 --> 01:07:26.279 align:start position:0%
stunned when he told me that this was a
 
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
must defeat bill um because he had
 
01:07:30.829 --> 01:07:30.839 align:start position:0%
spoken to me at length before about why
 
01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
he liked Parts about pre-processing so
 
01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
the reason that's the reason I
 
01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
circulated that letter um when people
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
who have historically asked me to pass
 
01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
something say hey Ross this isn't the
 
01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:43.480 align:start position:0%
one um then this is not the one this
 
01:07:47.309 --> 01:07:47.319 align:start position:0%
bill is this bill needs a lot of work um
 
01:07:49.309 --> 01:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
so it's not necessary it needs a lot of
 
01:07:52.269 --> 01:07:52.279 align:start position:0%
work and it is not universally loved by
 
01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
the clerks um so with that uh the clerk
 
01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
will call the RO on the motion of
 
01:07:58.349 --> 01:07:58.359 align:start position:0%
