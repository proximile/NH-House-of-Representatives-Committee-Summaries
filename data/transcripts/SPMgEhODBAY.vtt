00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
all well I don't know who sits in this
 
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:47.480 align:start position:0%

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
oh this
 
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
is here you're taller than me
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
exact I don't know how happened
 
00:12:57.839 --> 00:13:00.990 align:start position:0%
exact I don't know how happened
here

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
well first we got to address does anyone
 
00:13:07.069 --> 00:13:07.079 align:start position:0%
everyone get a chance to review the
 
00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
minutes any any
 
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
changes I have a question Mr chair on
 
00:13:14.829 --> 00:13:14.839 align:start position:0%
bullet number on page two bullet number
 
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
five and six it seems there's a
 
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
contradictory um statement here it
 
00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
number five says recreational Cannabis
 
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
is more affordable number six says
 
00:13:27.189 --> 00:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
therapeutic products are cheaper because
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
they are not taxed so I'm confused as to
 
00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:32.360 align:start position:0%
which is prod that I I understand the
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
minutes say that but that may have been
 
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:35.720 align:start position:0%
the fact that the testimony was
 
00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:38.120 align:start position:0%
inconsistent okay is the minutes wrong
 
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
or was the testimony wrong right I I
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
guess the I think the were corre the
 
00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
minutes were correct that's that that's
 
00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
consistent with my memory too oh okay
 
00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.790 align:start position:0%
consistent with my memory too oh okay
thank

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:55.389 --> 00:13:55.399 align:start position:0%
you represent who is there issue with
 
00:13:57.949 --> 00:13:57.959 align:start position:0%
the minutes yes yeah you know bullet
 
00:13:59.870 --> 00:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
point number two you know it's saying no
 
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
general fund dollars go into the program
 
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
but they get office spas and electrical
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
like you know that's General funds well
 
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
that was I understand factually you may
 
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
not agree with what the minutes say but
 
00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
was that the test the minutes is
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
basically summarizes the testimony
 
00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
whether you agree with the testimony or
 
00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.910 align:start position:0%
whether you agree with the testimony or
not

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
is we know they're getting general fund
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
dollars based on getting office space
 
00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
and but it doesn't change the testimony
 
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
that was given so the minutes need to
 
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:34.269 --> 00:14:34.279 align:start position:0%
that's but I think the the the minutes
 
00:14:36.069 --> 00:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
for this meeting will
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
reflect what we're talking about right
 
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
now actually speaking of
 
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
which our Clerk's not
 
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
here he um he just said he is in ja car
 
00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
then was is there is there a volunteer
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
to take
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
notes as
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:59.870 align:start position:0%
 
want

00:14:59.870 --> 00:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
want
 
00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.590 align:start position:0%
want
anyone

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
00:15:08.749 --> 00:15:08.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:10.839 align:start position:0%
you is there a motion to adopt the
 
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
minutes yes I
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
move all those in favor please say I I
 
00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.189 align:start position:0%
move all those in favor please say I I
all

00:15:20.189 --> 00:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
oppos so I think what we're going to do
 
00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:26.120 align:start position:0%
uh the purpose of today first I would
 
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
like to hear from the Attorney General's
 
00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
office um so we'll have those Witnesses
 
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
may may take the hot seat uh in respect
 
00:15:35.949 --> 00:15:35.959 align:start position:0%
to the and our reminded when it's a
 
00:15:38.829 --> 00:15:38.839 align:start position:0%
draft the working draft we'll call it
 
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
did everyone on the get a copy of
 
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:45.160 align:start position:0%
that who's who's here from the Attorney
 
00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:49.509 align:start position:0%
that who's who's here from the Attorney
General's

00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
office and just for the point of what
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
we're doing today if we can in the sake
 
00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
of efficiency we we all know that
 
00:15:59.629 --> 00:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
cannabis is against federal law
 
00:16:02.309 --> 00:16:02.319 align:start position:0%
therapeutic Canabis is against federal
 
00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:05.240 align:start position:0%
law the basically everything in the any
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
proposed draft is against federal law so
 
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
we don't need to really Hammer that out
 
00:16:10.269 --> 00:16:10.279 align:start position:0%
and emphasize that point any more than I
 
00:16:12.269 --> 00:16:12.279 align:start position:0%
just did so if we
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
can move on from that issue and I guess
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:21.560 align:start position:0%

00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
General at the Attorney General's office
 
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
and chief of the Criminal jce Justice
 
00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.829 align:start position:0%
and chief of the Criminal jce Justice
Bureau

00:16:30.829 --> 00:16:30.839 align:start position:0%
Bureau
 
00:16:35.069 --> 00:16:35.079 align:start position:0%
uh been asked uh today to to speak to
 
00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:37.639 align:start position:0%
some of the uh the liabilities uh the
 
00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
state liabilities uh both criminal and
 
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
civil uh for uh State involvement or
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
authorization of uh recreational
 
00:16:51.550 --> 00:16:51.560 align:start position:0%
Cannabis or marijuana um as part of that
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
um we had a comment from the chair
 
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
regarding uh it being federally legal
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
just wanted to lay out some of the
 
00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
Contours uh of that lands Cape uh
 
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
because it it does matter from a legal
 
00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
perspective where there may be
 
00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
liabilities what sorts of liabilities
 
00:17:08.309 --> 00:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
there may be um both from the criminal
 
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
liability side as well as from uh the
 
00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:14.799 align:start position:0%
Civil liability side um so would lay out
 
00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
some aspects of federal marijuana laws
 
00:17:20.189 --> 00:17:20.199 align:start position:0%
some of the prosecutions that are being
 
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
pursued uh by federal authorities uh and
 
00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:26.079 align:start position:0%
then speak to some uh civil litigation
 
00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
involving State authorizations or
 
00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
izations uh of
 
00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:33.880 align:start position:0%
marijuana um so as you all know
 
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
marijuana is currently scheduled as a
 
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
schedule one uh controlled substance
 
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
under the Controlled Substances Act um
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
and that like with other schedule one
 
00:17:45.789 --> 00:17:45.799 align:start position:0%
substances would prohibit the uh
 
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
manufacture distribution dispensation
 
00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
and possession of marijuana except in
 
00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:53.480 align:start position:0%
federally approved uh context such as
 
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
research studies um that prohibition
 
00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't just have criminal consequence
 
00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:00.200 align:start position:0%
quences that has other consequences
 
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
under federal law such as uh convictions
 
00:18:05.149 --> 00:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
or involvement uh rendering one unable
 
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
to participate in federal Housing
 
00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
Programs uh to procure certain visas uh
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
to have federal employment uh or to uh
 
00:18:17.789 --> 00:18:17.799 align:start position:0%
participate in in military service uh
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
there may also be complications for
 
00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
banking um I know that we have uh
 
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
there's some limitations on financial
 
00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
institutions and how they have to
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
interact and engage with uh marijuana
 
00:18:32.430 --> 00:18:32.440 align:start position:0%
related businesses uh there may also be
 
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
limitations in the access to federal
 
00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
grants or federal monies
 
00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
um as well the the posture of the
 
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:43.640 align:start position:0%
federal law sort of depends on two
 
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
sources there is the the doj policy
 
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
relating to the enforcement of the
 
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
Controlled Substances Act and then there
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
are also annual Appropriations writers
 
00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
passed by Congress that uh control what
 
00:19:00.029 --> 00:19:00.039 align:start position:0%
expenditures uh may be utilized or
 
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
limits expenditures for the enforcement
 
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
of certain marijuana related laws um so
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
the the the Controlled Substances Act um
 
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
and the Appropriations writers only
 
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
concern uh the enforcement of the
 
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
Controlled Substances Act against
 
00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.149 align:start position:0%
Controlled Substances Act against
medical

00:19:18.149 --> 00:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
medical
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
marijuana um regimes so there's
 
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
essentially a congressional prohibition
 
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
on expending federal resources for
 
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement against uh medically
 
00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:32.799 align:start position:0%
uh based State
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
programs the doj posture uh has us doj
 
00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:41.240 align:start position:0%
posture uh has gone through several
 
00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:43.799 align:start position:0%
iterations several different memoranda
 
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
relating to the enforcement of the
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
Controlled Substances Act um the
 
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice has repeatedly
 
00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
reaffirmed its position that the growing
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
manufactured distribution sale of
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
marijuana is federally illegal it is
 
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
enforceable uh and instead Federal
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
resources would be concentrated on
 
00:20:07.669 --> 00:20:07.679 align:start position:0%
certain types of violations of the
 
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
Controlled Substances Act notably those
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
relating to uh the illicit marijuana
 
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
trade so there have been at various
 
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
times different objectives put forward
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
that concentrate Federal resources on
 
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
the prosecutions that that do occur um
 
00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
and those have been articulated as
 
00:20:27.549 --> 00:20:27.559 align:start position:0%
preventing that the federal interests
 
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
have been preventing marijuana usage by
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
miners preventing revenue from marijuana
 
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
from going to criminal organizations
 
00:20:36.029 --> 00:20:36.039 align:start position:0%
preventing marijuana as a cover for
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
other drug dealing preventing violence
 
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
around marijuana cultivation and
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
distribution preventing drugged driving
 
00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
and then preventing marijuana use or
 
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:47.720 align:start position:0%
cultivation on federal
 
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
lands uh as I mentioned that the
 
00:20:51.230 --> 00:20:51.240 align:start position:0%
Congressional prohibition it's been an
 
00:20:54.669 --> 00:20:54.679 align:start position:0%
annual uh Appropriations writer so
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
provision um in Appropriations
 
00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919 align:start position:0%
legislation since since uh fiscal year
 
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
2015 uh that has uh essentially as it's
 
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
laid out uh is preventing is prohibiting
 
00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:11.080 align:start position:0%
doj from using appropriated funds uh to
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
prevent certain States territories or
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
the District of Columbia from
 
00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:15.720 align:start position:0%
implementing their own laws that
 
00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:17.720 align:start position:0%
authorize the use distribution
 
00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
possession or cultivation of medical
 
00:21:22.070 --> 00:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
marijuana so again that Appropriations
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
writer doesn't touch uh non-medical or
 
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
recreational uh uses there has been
 
00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
litigation relating to that writer uh
 
00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:33.320 align:start position:0%
essentially asserted as a defense in
 
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
some criminal
 
00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.350 align:start position:0%
some criminal
prosecutions

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
prosecutions
 
00:21:40.029 --> 00:21:40.039 align:start position:0%
um it has in some circumstances barred
 
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
some criminal prosecutions saying No
 
00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
this Falls within the the uh the
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
prohibition the US doj is prohibited
 
00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
from pursuing this enforcement action
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
because of that Appropriations riter in
 
00:21:53.269 --> 00:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
other circumstances um that writer has
 
00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:55.640 align:start position:0%
not prohibited prosecutions indeed there
 
00:21:58.269 --> 00:21:58.279 align:start position:0%
are approximately a thousand marij
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
related Federal uh cases prosecuted each
 
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
year that number has been declining uh
 
00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
but it still has
 
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
um still has resulted in from those
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
prosecutions an average prison sentence
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
of roughly 33 months so uh there are
 
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
still prosecutions related to the
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
Controlled Substances Act and us doj is
 
00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:24.200 align:start position:0%
pursuing those uh one of the interesting
 
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
aspects of of us doj prosecutions uh has
 
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
not just been on illicit drug trade what
 
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
we might think of as cartel activity
 
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
related to uh marijuana trafficking but
 
00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:39.640 align:start position:0%
also compliance with state regimes so
 
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
there have been circumstances where a
 
00:22:44.669 --> 00:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
failure of individuals to comply with a
 
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:47.240 align:start position:0%
well-regulated state regime has resulted
 
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
in in criminal prosecutions so it's
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
essentially operating outside of the the
 
00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
boundaries of that state system has
 
00:22:56.909 --> 00:22:56.919 align:start position:0%
resulted in criminal liability and the
 
00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
US doj has prosecuted that so as one of
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
the articulated state or or federal
 
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:05.480 align:start position:0%
interests uh compliance with a regime if
 
00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:08.360 align:start position:0%
a state is setting something up then the
 
00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
state is
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh there may not be criminal
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
prosecutions related to the uh the use
 
00:23:18.789 --> 00:23:18.799 align:start position:0%
of marijuana under that state regime but
 
00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:20.440 align:start position:0%
a failure to comply with that a failure
 
00:23:23.269 --> 00:23:23.279 align:start position:0%
to oversee that uh can subject
 
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
individuals who are not compliant with
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
that state regime with criminal
 
00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:30.110 align:start position:0%
that state regime with criminal
liability

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:32.909 --> 00:23:32.919 align:start position:0%
the I think it it's fair to say that
 
00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
it's uh the Federal Criminal
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement of the Controlled Substances
 
00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
Act is is somewhat on a sliding scale uh
 
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:43.720 align:start position:0%
it is controlled in one part by uh
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
Congressional language Appropriations
 
00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:48.559 align:start position:0%
writers it's controlled uh in another
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
way by the the mere policy position that
 
00:23:54.029 --> 00:23:54.039 align:start position:0%
us doj has taken even while the
 
00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
underlying statutory regime remains
 
00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
intact that marijuana is federally
 
00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:01.640 align:start position:0%
prohibited um in in all forms except in
 
00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
those narrow Federal research
 
00:24:07.630 --> 00:24:07.640 align:start position:0%
studies there are liabilities criminal
 
00:24:10.269 --> 00:24:10.279 align:start position:0%
liabilities related to that uncertainty
 
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
of that that policy landscape so um
 
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
legislatively I won't speak to that but
 
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
the the posture of us doj is operating
 
00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
merely between an Appropriations writer
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
and a change in policy and how they
 
00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
approach uh the enforcement of uh the
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
criminal prohibitions related to to
 
00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
marijuana and and that line has changed
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
depending on uh the the policy positions
 
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
that us doj has taken uh there are still
 
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
uh many prosecutions uh that are are
 
00:24:45.389 --> 00:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
being pursued and what types of
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
prosecutions uh are being pursued could
 
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
change again based on on the policy of
 
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
of us
 
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
doj moving to civil liability just want
 
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
to speak uh more narrowly of one example
 
00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:01.039 align:start position:0%
examp Le of what could arise with a a
 
00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
state authorized or state run marijuana
 
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
regime so in August uh a in federal
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
court was filed a complaint against the
 
00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
state of New York it's the Cannabis
 
00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:17.240 align:start position:0%
impact prevention Coalition um at all
 
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
versus uh a number of different state
 
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
institutions and state officials in New
 
00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
York um so that was filed in August in
 
00:25:29.029 --> 00:25:29.039 align:start position:0%
federal court um the the primary
 
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
defendants are the New York cannabis
 
00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
control board the New York office of
 
00:25:35.389 --> 00:25:35.399 align:start position:0%
cannabis management and then a number of
 
00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
different state officials including uh
 
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
the governor and other senior State
 
00:25:41.549 --> 00:25:41.559 align:start position:0%
officials the the main thrust of the
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
lawsuit is challenging the 20121
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
legalization of
 
00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:49.919 align:start position:0%
marijuana uh the the language of the the
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
lawsuit uh that the the plaintiffs are
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
alleging that the legalization and state
 
00:25:58.110 --> 00:25:58.120 align:start position:0%
regime uh amounts to uh one of the
 
00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
largest drug trafficking organizations
 
00:26:05.149 --> 00:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
uh in the country part of that is the
 
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:08.360 align:start position:0%
looking at the state created entities
 
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
that would be involved in the Cannabis
 
00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:13.640 align:start position:0%
regulation um so for example The
 
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
dormatory Authority of New York would be
 
00:26:17.389 --> 00:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
responsible for leasing or approving
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
Leasing and other locations for uh for
 
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
cannabis um entities or businesses um so
 
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
as the plaintiffs describe they would be
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
the chief leasing agent for marijuana
 
00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.190 align:start position:0%
the chief leasing agent for marijuana
trafficking

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
trafficking
 
00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.870 align:start position:0%
trafficking
locations

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
locations
 
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
um that the the the relief sought under
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
that lawsuit is uh is federal so it's
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
saying that there is a preemption
 
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
concern here the state regime is illegal
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
under federal law it's preempted and
 
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:49.720 align:start position:0%
unenforceable and so the the relief is
 
00:26:51.909 --> 00:26:51.919 align:start position:0%
declaratory relief stating that that the
 
00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
state law conflicts with federal laws to
 
00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
enjoin the state from spending any money
 
00:26:59.470 --> 00:26:59.480 align:start position:0%
on the operation of those different
 
00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
entities the Cannabis control board the
 
00:27:02.909 --> 00:27:02.919 align:start position:0%
office of cannabis
 
00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
management uh and to essentially uh
 
00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
bring that that regime uh to a stop uh
 
00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
so that that lawsuit was filed in in
 
00:27:14.029 --> 00:27:14.039 align:start position:0%
August it is pending I I bring it up as
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
the type of of civil liability uh that
 
00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:21.559 align:start position:0%
can uh that can come from uh any number
 
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
of of challenges to uh State authorized
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
regimes the speaking more more broadly
 
00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:36.440 align:start position:0%
the those liabilities whether they are
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
criminal from uh us doj enforcement
 
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:44.200 align:start position:0%
whether they are civil uh civil uh
 
00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
lawsuits uh that are that are
 
00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
brought the uniqueness of any particular
 
00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
regime or structure May
 
00:27:57.269 --> 00:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
attract some of those liabilities so uh
 
00:27:58.830 --> 00:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
the most
 
00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:00.509 align:start position:0%
the most
permissive

00:28:00.509 --> 00:28:00.519 align:start position:0%
permissive
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh marijuana regime uh under as a
 
00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:07.559 align:start position:0%
compares to federal law may be the first
 
00:28:10.269 --> 00:28:10.279 align:start position:0%
Target for federal prosecutions if there
 
00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
is a change in policy uh the most
 
00:28:16.389 --> 00:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
permissive or expansive regime May uh
 
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
make it a more likely Target that regime
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
for civil cases that are testing uh the
 
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
efficacy of some of these structures um
 
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
relative to the enforcement of federal
 
00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.070 align:start position:0%
relative to the enforcement of federal
law

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
um so in in summary would just say that
 
00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:32.039 align:start position:0%
adopting any state
 
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
controlled or state managed system
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
certainly creates liabilities there's
 
00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:38.559 align:start position:0%
there's no doubt about that both
 
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
criminal and civil uh the probability or
 
00:28:43.029 --> 00:28:43.039 align:start position:0%
extent of those liabilities is unknown
 
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
to the Attorney General's office we
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
can't predict what changes in policy on
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
the federal side may result in
 
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
consequences or liabilities uh for for
 
00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.269 align:start position:0%
consequences or liabilities uh for for
State

00:28:52.269 --> 00:28:52.279 align:start position:0%
State
 
00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
actors um but again as I mentioned if if
 
00:28:58.509 --> 00:28:58.519 align:start position:0%
a regime is unique then that May from a
 
00:29:00.669 --> 00:29:00.679 align:start position:0%
legal perspective create unique
 
00:29:03.509 --> 00:29:03.519 align:start position:0%
liabilities or increase whatever that
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
probability is increase that probability
 
00:29:11.950 --> 00:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
action just uh summarizing again uh
 
00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
criminal enforcement certainly depends
 
00:29:18.990 --> 00:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
on the combination of the the ongoing
 
00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:20.799 align:start position:0%
annual Appropriations writer and the
 
00:29:24.789 --> 00:29:24.799 align:start position:0%
policy positions of us doj relating to
 
00:29:27.630 --> 00:29:27.640 align:start position:0%
exercising prosecutorial restraint and
 
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
so today I can't speak to the
 
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
realization of any of those
 
00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:33.320 align:start position:0%
probabilities of those liabilities but
 
00:29:37.549 --> 00:29:37.559 align:start position:0%
would just uh Point them out related to
 
00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
this commission's consideration uh or
 
00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
recommendation of legislation with that
 
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
that con concludes my uh my testimony
 
00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
happy to take
 
00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
questions all right well that was great
 
00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:53.480 align:start position:0%
that was very informative um I have one
 
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:55.640 align:start position:0%
question it's always been bugging me
 
00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
where everyone says it's you know the
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
against the law federal you know federal
 
00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:01.720 align:start position:0%
law about the marijuana being grown
 
00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
outside a state and imported and in that
 
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
list of things you said they did funding
 
00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
did they have any money funding to
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
ensure that Mar that uh licensed
 
00:30:15.549 --> 00:30:15.559 align:start position:0%
controlled marijuana grown in one state
 
00:30:17.710 --> 00:30:17.720 align:start position:0%
can't cross the state line did they are
 
00:30:20.269 --> 00:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
they putting any money into it or is
 
00:30:20.279 --> 00:30:21.789 align:start position:0%
they putting any money into it or is
that

00:30:21.789 --> 00:30:21.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:23.669 --> 00:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
enforced I so I think I understand what
 
00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:25.720 align:start position:0%
you're getting at would be the the US
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
doj policy
 
00:30:30.269 --> 00:30:30.279 align:start position:0%
uh focuses for its enforcement actions
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
and what they're trying to articulate in
 
00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
pursuing any enforcement um I believe
 
00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:35.710 align:start position:0%
pursuing any enforcement um I believe
that

00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:35.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:39.149 --> 00:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
crossborder um crossb movements of
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
marijuana is one of those components
 
00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:43.480 align:start position:0%
that that the
 
00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
federal um authorities are looking at so
 
00:30:48.029 --> 00:30:48.039 align:start position:0%
I don't know what funding is
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
specifically allocated or what um
 
00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
portion of their enforcement activity is
 
00:30:58.029 --> 00:30:58.039 align:start position:0%
focused on that um
 
00:30:59.950 --> 00:30:59.960 align:start position:0%
it would probably combine with other
 
00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:01.559 align:start position:0%
aspects that they're pursuing so for
 
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
example the illicit uh marijuana trade
 
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
or trafficking
 
00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
so how that often realizes in criminal
 
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
prosecutions maybe what we'd think of as
 
00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:15.320 align:start position:0%
other drug cartels that are also moving
 
00:31:17.789 --> 00:31:17.799 align:start position:0%
marijuana as a product so I would look
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
at that as a number of different factors
 
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:22.120 align:start position:0%
that drive prosecutorial decisions or
 
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
allocation of resources I don't know
 
00:31:27.629 --> 00:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
specifically uh what federal FOC or
 
00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:32.360 align:start position:0%
resources there are uh for mere right
 
00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
well I guess I'm um to follow so two
 
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
things that my take- home here okay is
 
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
is that um the feds have decided which
 
00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:42.440 align:start position:0%
what things they're going to enforce
 
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
simply but whether they're going to put
 
00:31:46.629 --> 00:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
spend money on enforcement and then the
 
00:31:50.269 --> 00:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
other aspect that really got me today is
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
that you're saying is that having the
 
00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
state pass a
 
00:31:58.830 --> 00:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
statute gives the uh that almost card
 
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
blunch for the federal government says
 
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
okay now we won't get involved in your
 
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
state because you've created this
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
regulatory authority to allow for
 
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
marijuana and to me that opens up a huge
 
00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
can of worms because what that says is
 
00:32:14.509 --> 00:32:14.519 align:start position:0%
anything we the state think it's legal
 
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
then the federal government says okay
 
00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:20.039 align:start position:0%
then that can be legal so if we said we
 
00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
think it's okay someone to import
 
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
marijuana from another licensed
 
00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:25.720 align:start position:0%
manufacturer in a different state you
 
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
know like much like we do with liquor
 
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
you say then then theoretically the
 
00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
federal government could potentially say
 
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
okay that's fine we're not going to
 
00:32:38.029 --> 00:32:38.039 align:start position:0%
enforce the cross the state
 
00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
line so my response to that would be
 
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
that it's the uh the allocation of
 
00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
resources as a prosecutorial discretion
 
00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
so uh where there is a state regime uh
 
00:32:52.669 --> 00:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
the I believe that the way that us doj
 
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
um has phrased it um in essence is it
 
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
would be a poor allocation of of
 
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
prosecutorial resources uh where there
 
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
is a state regime in place for
 
00:33:07.789 --> 00:33:07.799 align:start position:0%
uh for many of the the Controlled
 
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
Substances Act violation crimes that
 
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
they could be prosecuting um that
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that uh as I understand the
 
00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
policy that that would eliminate any
 
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement activities in the state just
 
00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
may result in a reallocation or refocus
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
on what uh what prosecutions or
 
00:33:28.350 --> 00:33:28.360 align:start position:0%
investigations may happen so essentially
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
deprioritizing certain prosecutions if
 
00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:33.880 align:start position:0%
there is a regime in place again it
 
00:33:36.909 --> 00:33:36.919 align:start position:0%
could also as I mentioned uh create some
 
00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
additional liabilities if there's a lack
 
00:33:40.629 --> 00:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
of compliance with that state regime so
 
00:33:42.669 --> 00:33:42.679 align:start position:0%
there have been instances where um
 
00:33:45.149 --> 00:33:45.159 align:start position:0%
individuals are outside of the bounds
 
00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
essentially of a state regime and those
 
00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
individuals have been prosecuted by us
 
00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
doj because they're not in compliance
 
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
with that that regulatory Authority
 
00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
within the
 
00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.870 align:start position:0%
within the
state

00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:33:59.789 --> 00:33:59.799 align:start position:0%
just one moment could we are we
 
00:33:59.799 --> 00:34:00.750 align:start position:0%
just one moment could we are we
streaming

00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
streaming
 
00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.190 align:start position:0%
 
are

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:11.200 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
chief thank you Mr chair and uh thank
 
00:34:17.069 --> 00:34:17.079 align:start position:0%
you for your uh testimony today so uh a
 
00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:21.399 align:start position:0%
few clarifying questions here um today
 
00:34:21.399 --> 00:34:22.750 align:start position:0%
few clarifying questions here um today
so

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:27.869 --> 00:34:27.879 align:start position:0%
um from your testimony uh the only Cong
 
00:34:29.869 --> 00:34:29.879 align:start position:0%
prohibition with respect to the
 
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
prosecution and enforcement of federal
 
00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
uh statutes uh extends only to medical
 
00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:37.960 align:start position:0%
marijuana programs is that an accurate
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
representation of your testimony on for
 
00:34:43.069 --> 00:34:43.079 align:start position:0%
with respect to Congressional writers
 
00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding is that it's an
 
00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
annual Appropriations writer that limits
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
that uh expenditures to or prohibits
 
00:34:52.829 --> 00:34:52.839 align:start position:0%
enforcement related to medical marijuana
 
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and so is it fair to say
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
then that the various doj policies
 
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
United States Department of Justice
 
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
policies with with respect to how
 
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice which would be ATF
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
FBI DEA US Marshall Service uh
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
appropriates and spends its money uh is
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
and how the US attorneys um prioritize
 
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
Federal prosecutions is largely then
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
dependent uh on the various policies
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
promulgated by the Attorney General of
 
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:28.640 align:start position:0%
that Administration would that be fair
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
to say yes that's correct so then would
 
00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
it be fair to say then that those
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
policies could change based on the
 
00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
administration yes they can and they
 
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
have changed the articulation of the the
 
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:42.400 align:start position:0%
policy relating to the the enforcement
 
00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
of the control Substances Act as it
 
00:35:45.790 --> 00:35:45.800 align:start position:0%
relates to marijuana has changed it's
 
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
been modified numerous times over the
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
past decade thank you and if there were
 
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
to be a federal uh or state Tor claim uh
 
00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:57.640 align:start position:0%
such as one that was recently filed in
 
00:35:59.710 --> 00:35:59.720 align:start position:0%
New York on your testimony who would
 
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
represent uh the state if the state uh
 
00:36:06.349 --> 00:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
were to be um a defendant in a tort
 
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
claim action similar to the one that you
 
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
discussed in your testimony uh
 
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
ordinarily it would be the State
 
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office who would be
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh responsible for uh responding to and
 
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
litigating actions against State
 
00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:24.280 align:start position:0%
actors um the followup question
 
00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
um with respect to the Banking and
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
distribution in Interstate uh Commerce
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
uh if the state were to pass a
 
00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
legalization uh regime as you indicated
 
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and the state of
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh invested or placed or
 
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
comingled proceeds from the revenue
 
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
obtained from the sale of marijuana with
 
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
other state funds such as retirement
 
00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
funds alcohol uh um abuse uh funds would
 
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
those monies be subject to seizure or
 
00:37:06.109 --> 00:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
forfeiture uh if there were to be a
 
00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:09.160 align:start position:0%
challenge made by the federal
 
00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
government it's my understanding that
 
00:37:13.069 --> 00:37:13.079 align:start position:0%
they would be in the same way that
 
00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
there's isn't any prohibition uh against
 
00:37:19.109 --> 00:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
the enforcement other than policy of the
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
Controlled Substances Act criminal
 
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
violations so um I believe that it would
 
00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
be under the same posture relating to
 
00:37:30.349 --> 00:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
um any asset forfeiture of funds related
 
00:37:32.829 --> 00:37:32.839 align:start position:0%
to the as federal law would describe it
 
00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:36.280 align:start position:0%
the trafficking of of illegal Controlled
 
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
Substances would the state uh attorne
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
would your office the Attorney General's
 
00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:43.720 align:start position:0%
office have a um recommendation or a
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
position with respect to sequestering if
 
00:37:49.950 --> 00:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
the state were to pass a legalization
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
regime and obtain proceeds to
 
00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
sequestering that money and not
 
00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
comingling it with other funds uh to
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
protect those other funds from potential
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
litigation uh the Attorney General's
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
office doesn't have a specific
 
00:38:06.109 --> 00:38:06.119 align:start position:0%
recommendation on that today uh would
 
00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
note just in our discussion of legal
 
00:38:11.630 --> 00:38:11.640 align:start position:0%
liabilities uh that um managing those
 
00:38:13.349 --> 00:38:13.359 align:start position:0%
liabilities there are various mechanisms
 
00:38:16.309 --> 00:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
to do that uh one of those could be
 
00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
segregation um of funds in order to try
 
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
to isolate any liability from
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
impacting any non-marijuana
 
00:38:28.589 --> 00:38:28.599 align:start position:0%
related um policies or funding sources
 
00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Mr chair um just to
 
00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
follow up on the last I presume then
 
00:38:42.309 --> 00:38:42.319 align:start position:0%
that the uh commission would like to see
 
00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
some sort of a example from the uh
 
00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
Attorney General on how that segregation
 
00:38:48.309 --> 00:38:48.319 align:start position:0%
would would be
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
done uh is that
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
possible that would be very helpful I
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
leave it to the AG's office if they
 
00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:56.680 align:start position:0%
would be willing to help us with that
 
00:38:59.829 --> 00:38:59.839 align:start position:0%
but I I can note that uh request again
 
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
just in terms of of posture um the the
 
00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:06.040 align:start position:0%
structure of the Attorney General's
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
office there may be if there requests it
 
00:39:11.069 --> 00:39:11.079 align:start position:0%
may be a client counseling matter um or
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
a a question a request that uh goes to
 
00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:15.640 align:start position:0%
someone who may be better positioned to
 
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
speak to that than than I am today I
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
think when and correct me if I'm if I'm
 
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
wrong when when
 
00:39:25.069 --> 00:39:25.079 align:start position:0%
the you testified about the franchise
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
model I think it was a desire to keep
 
00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
the money the revenue in its
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
own section so it wouldn't becomeing
 
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
like the revenue from liquor
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
sales there's already at least a yeah I
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
would i' would like to see what uh what
 
00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
the uh AG's office has has broad
 
00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
guidelines not the exact uh uh
 
00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
terminology that's our job not uh not
 
00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
their job but the Brad the guidelines as
 
00:39:52.309 --> 00:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
to how and that could be set up that
 
00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
that's the follow question that I still
 
00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
Reserve questions yes
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
repres kale I'll just have a follow-up
 
00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
question on this this line of subject um
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
you know in the proposed legislation
 
00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
there's the talk of the 1% going to
 
00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
certain municipalities I mean I think
 
00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:08.680 align:start position:0%
those same towns would have to worry
 
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
about segregating the money possibly too
 
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
um just just an idea to look into that
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
on that but we could we could cut a I
 
00:40:19.109 --> 00:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
know with Alaska with some of their oil
 
00:40:21.309 --> 00:40:21.319 align:start position:0%
sales they send money back to the people
 
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
directly we could send it back to this
 
00:40:25.430 --> 00:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
the residents of the state then we all
 
00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:27.400 align:start position:0%
have to do it
 
00:40:30.069 --> 00:40:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
that but yeah I see what you're saying
 
00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
that could be a problem I I um and I but
 
00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
I do have one question um thank thank
 
00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:37.720 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony it was really
 
00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
really great testimony I think it was
 
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:41.720 align:start position:0%
helpful to to a lot of us here but I I I
 
00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
was interested in this New York case is
 
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
your office following this New York case
 
00:40:49.910 --> 00:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh yes now uh we are so I think that
 
00:40:52.589 --> 00:40:52.599 align:start position:0%
we'll it it's one example of other
 
00:40:56.829 --> 00:40:56.839 align:start position:0%
civilization in this area um I uh I'm
 
00:40:58.430 --> 00:40:58.440 align:start position:0%
not conversent with all of the the civil
 
00:41:00.589 --> 00:41:00.599 align:start position:0%
litigation related to this to to be
 
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
blunt but yes we'll be following this
 
00:41:04.309 --> 00:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
case you know obviously there would be a
 
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
cost to the taxpayers if if we got s
 
00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
sued in that way do you do you have an
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
idea of how much this litigation is
 
00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
going to cost the state of New York um I
 
00:41:16.589 --> 00:41:16.599 align:start position:0%
don't uh it probably would be public
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
should it proceed just because
 
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees are requested uh so that
 
00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
may be part if there is any if it's
 
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
successful in any way then then there
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
may be some indication there um I would
 
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
note just generally that litigation
 
00:41:32.309 --> 00:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
expenses would depend on um the scope of
 
00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:35.720 align:start position:0%
the litigation uh and you know
 
00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
individual factors such as what is being
 
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
challenged so uh that's hard to predict
 
00:41:41.589 --> 00:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
in terms of any kind of of costs
 
00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:44.240 align:start position:0%
relating to to
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
litigation repres
 
00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
Sol thanks for your testimony it was uh
 
00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
super helpful so I my understanding is
 
00:41:55.309 --> 00:41:55.319 align:start position:0%
that franchises or or franchises are
 
00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
generally regul ated by the federal
 
00:41:59.790 --> 00:41:59.800 align:start position:0%
franchising like they have a whole fed
 
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
Federal franchising rule how would that
 
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
impact the state of New Hampshire in
 
00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
terms of us regulating something here in
 
00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:12.280 align:start position:0%
a franchise model and then having it
 
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
having to be over reg or regulated on
 
00:42:16.309 --> 00:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
top of that by the the federal
 
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
government like do you guys have any
 
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
position or any idea how that might work
 
00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
and would it matter that all of our
 
00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
franchisees would be within the states
 
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
so maybe it would be a unique situation
 
00:42:28.109 --> 00:42:28.119 align:start position:0%
where it wouldn't matter whereas say
 
00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:29.800 align:start position:0%
McDonald's it's everywhere so that's why
 
00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
it's a federal regulatory
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
framework I don't know on that that
 
00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:35.800 align:start position:0%
specific example that's something I can
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
uh take a look at
 
00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
um going back to to one of the aspects
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
that is a challenge in this and it may
 
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
be similar in the the franchise um
 
00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:49.119 align:start position:0%
context would be banking so Financial
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
transactions uh certainly complicated um
 
00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
with a Divergence between state
 
00:42:59.190 --> 00:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
authorization and and federal law so um
 
00:43:00.829 --> 00:43:00.839 align:start position:0%
I different states have adopted
 
00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
different uh legal structures relating
 
00:43:06.109 --> 00:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
to uh what Financial transactions or
 
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
structures may be uh permitted uh but I
 
00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
believe it's fair to say that there
 
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
there is an uh compliance burden related
 
00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
to uh that disconnect between state and
 
00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
federal law relating to to banking um it
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
may be the same with a a franchise model
 
00:43:28.589 --> 00:43:28.599 align:start position:0%
or oversight I I don't know to answer
 
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
that specifically today yeah I know I I
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not a lawyer by any means and I
 
00:43:34.349 --> 00:43:34.359 align:start position:0%
don't know the details of it but I
 
00:43:37.030 --> 00:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
thought that was kind of a peculiar part
 
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
of this because if if its franchises are
 
00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:43.240 align:start position:0%
generally regulated at the federal level
 
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
then I could see that potentially being
 
00:43:47.109 --> 00:43:47.119 align:start position:0%
a conflict that maybe we haven't thought
 
00:43:48.190 --> 00:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
about in this committee and I think
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
that's something we should probably dig
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
into because yeah um so another question
 
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
would be and I don't know if you even
 
00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
know how to to think about this I don't
 
00:43:58.430 --> 00:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
know the details of this case aside from
 
00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
probably what every in this room knows
 
00:44:01.309 --> 00:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
but like I'm
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
thinking we all remember when that woman
 
00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:06.520 align:start position:0%
sued McDonald's because she burnt
 
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
herself with Co got you know spilled the
 
00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
coffee and got burnt right if something
 
00:44:13.829 --> 00:44:13.839 align:start position:0%
were to happen in a State
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
Franchise because we're calling it a
 
00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
franchise we're not calling it like a
 
00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
license or we're not calling it you know
 
00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
whatever um is the state liable for
 
00:44:24.030 --> 00:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
something that happens in that store I
 
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
mean I would imagine if in in the
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
alcohol commission if something happens
 
00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:29.800 align:start position:0%
in that store they can sue the alcohol
 
00:44:32.589 --> 00:44:32.599 align:start position:0%
commission which is part of the state
 
00:44:35.309 --> 00:44:35.319 align:start position:0%
would we would we have liability to
 
00:44:37.549 --> 00:44:37.559 align:start position:0%
somebody in a franchise messing up in
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
some way selling something that makes a
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
kid sick or die or something like that
 
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
and then the state is on the hook not
 
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
just that local franchisee I I mean
 
00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:47.720 align:start position:0%
maybe I don't know if it's a good
 
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
analogy but the McDonald's example with
 
00:44:51.790 --> 00:44:51.800 align:start position:0%
the coffee I think they tried to sue the
 
00:44:53.549 --> 00:44:53.559 align:start position:0%
the actual Corporation not just that
 
00:44:55.109 --> 00:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
franchise that sold the coffee I'm
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
curious how that might might expose the
 
00:44:59.109 --> 00:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
state to some sort of risks that we
 
00:45:01.549 --> 00:45:01.559 align:start position:0%
maybe haven't thought
 
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
of so what that makes me think of would
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
be um what liabilities would would flow
 
00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
to any individual actors or entity let's
 
00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:12.839 align:start position:0%
say in the location that you're speaking
 
00:45:16.349 --> 00:45:16.359 align:start position:0%
of so a a uh you know a franchised store
 
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh and whether there would be State
 
00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:20.309 align:start position:0%
uh and whether there would be State
liabilities

00:45:20.309 --> 00:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
liabilities
 
00:45:24.589 --> 00:45:24.599 align:start position:0%
um could depend on what uh rules uh have
 
00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
been issued what regulations what
 
00:45:28.829 --> 00:45:28.839 align:start position:0%
structure so someone could potentially
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
challenge uh the underlying
 
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
authorization of a particular way of
 
00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
handling a product or um uh of the the
 
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
State Management not just any error um
 
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
or liability created by an individual or
 
00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
an individual store so um that wouldn't
 
00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
be unique of trying to attach liability
 
00:45:53.549 --> 00:45:53.559 align:start position:0%
for um what a plaintiff would claim as a
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
flawed regime so there's a problem in in
 
00:45:58.270 --> 00:45:58.280 align:start position:0%
the rules or the statute and so the
 
00:46:01.349 --> 00:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
plaintiff could seek relief um for an
 
00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
injury that occurred under that
 
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:06.280 align:start position:0%
regulation or
 
00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:09.400 align:start position:0%
statute thank you so much and just a
 
00:46:10.870 --> 00:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
little just from information the
 
00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
McDonald's case what really spiked that
 
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
that um my torz law professor was
 
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
lectured us on this for a whole class
 
00:46:22.510 --> 00:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
and what happened was McDonald's was
 
00:46:24.349 --> 00:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
notified that the coffee they were
 
00:46:26.349 --> 00:46:26.359 align:start position:0%
serving was well
 
00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
was heated well beyond like the industry
 
00:46:30.109 --> 00:46:30.119 align:start position:0%
standard but also this was a long time
 
00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
ago they didn't have warning labels
 
00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
saying this may be Hut so when you would
 
00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
get coffee you expect it to be hot but
 
00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:37.880 align:start position:0%
around 130 they were serving it around
 
00:46:40.349 --> 00:46:40.359 align:start position:0%
170 so the expectation of the consumer
 
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
was different so there was a couple
 
00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
things that played into that so maybe if
 
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
a contaminated product was sold out of a
 
00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
franchise store that maybe the
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
franchisee is not the one that
 
00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:51.640 align:start position:0%
manufactured that or knew it was
 
00:46:53.309 --> 00:46:53.319 align:start position:0%
contaminated would they still be liable
 
00:46:54.549 --> 00:46:54.559 align:start position:0%
might be the and you don't have to
 
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
answer that today but if you can get us
 
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
set information obviously the
 
00:46:59.309 --> 00:46:59.319 align:start position:0%
manufacturer could face liability but
 
00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:00.680 align:start position:0%
think of like a supermarket if they had
 
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
a contaminated produce if they didn't
 
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
know was contaminated would they be
 
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
liable you'd still have to follow
 
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
standard Tor law as far as the
 
00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
investigation of the armm as to who
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
caused the harm so the state may or may
 
00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
not be depending upon what role State
 
00:47:20.829 --> 00:47:20.839 align:start position:0%
played if any yes and but the thing is
 
00:47:22.630 --> 00:47:22.640 align:start position:0%
with McDonald's they were notified by
 
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
several consumer there was other
 
00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
injuries prior to that where they were
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
notified of the problem and they I think
 
00:47:30.270 --> 00:47:30.280 align:start position:0%
the evidence was that they they ignored
 
00:47:32.109 --> 00:47:32.119 align:start position:0%
it which made it
 
00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
punitive that's spiked the
 
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
damages right but just to say if if
 
00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:39.800 align:start position:0%
McDonald's required it to be at a higher
 
00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:42.200 align:start position:0%
temperature then it would have been the
 
00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:44.920 align:start position:0%
rule was the problem and so therefore
 
00:47:46.829 --> 00:47:46.839 align:start position:0%
they would have had a legitimate case
 
00:47:49.390 --> 00:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
but because McDonald's didn't have any
 
00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:52.079 align:start position:0%
requirement or it was only industry
 
00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
standard that's why it may not have it
 
00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
but you're you're saying this lawsuit
 
00:47:58.510 --> 00:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
was pursued because they had been
 
00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:01.480 align:start position:0%
informed prior to that that there was a
 
00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
problem of hot water I think that that
 
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
cause punitive damage is to make the
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
Judgment multiplied several times over
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
because they were aware of the problem
 
00:48:10.549 --> 00:48:10.559 align:start position:0%
when you have knowledge of a problem
 
00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
right if someone if a franchise he sold
 
00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
a product they knew was contaminated and
 
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
that led to some type of injury I mean
 
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's game can't he couldn't use
 
00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
federal law on this it would be strictly
 
00:48:24.589 --> 00:48:24.599 align:start position:0%
under New Hampshire law so you'd have to
 
00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
meet the New Hampshire law requirements
 
00:48:30.309 --> 00:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
for communitive damages which are uh you
 
00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:31.720 align:start position:0%
got to be stupid
 
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
to gain them we don't have trip no we
 
00:48:37.549 --> 00:48:37.559 align:start position:0%
don't have Massachusetts but just to to
 
00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
on fortunately that's I've been involved
 
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
in several of those Massachusetts ones
 
00:48:46.829 --> 00:48:46.839 align:start position:0%
you can get a lot of money in that um
 
00:48:49.789 --> 00:48:49.799 align:start position:0%
the DJ uh uh
 
00:48:53.589 --> 00:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
is undertaking a a selective enforcement
 
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
type thing Pro prosec pural discretion
 
00:49:01.549 --> 00:49:01.559 align:start position:0%
which makes no sense but
 
00:49:05.349 --> 00:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
um what jurisdiction do they have on a
 
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
non-commerce clause about
 
00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:10.710 align:start position:0%
non-commerce clause about
inate

00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
inate
 
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
Commerce where we're limited this to
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
inside State of New Hampshire it's it
 
00:49:19.349 --> 00:49:19.359 align:start position:0%
analogous to what Minnesota was it
 
00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
Minnesota well one of the northern
 
00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
states maybe it was Dakota did with the
 
00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:26.079 align:start position:0%
gun Manufacturing exempting themselves
 
00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
from Guns by manufacturing it all within
 
00:49:33.910 --> 00:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
the state if we're maintaining are
 
00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:37.240 align:start position:0%
growing in sales only within New
 
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire how does the doj get involved
 
00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:42.990 align:start position:0%
Hampshire how does the doj get involved
at

00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
all so I'm not sure that I can answer
 
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
specifically that that question that the
 
00:49:54.309 --> 00:49:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:58.309 --> 00:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
um I I think that necessarily but
 
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
DEA can't have marijuana DEA would call
 
00:50:06.109 --> 00:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
and say want you but it it goes back to
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
the it goes It goes to the core of the
 
00:50:10.349 --> 00:50:10.359 align:start position:0%
issue what right does the federal
 
00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
government have to control what product
 
00:50:15.470 --> 00:50:15.480 align:start position:0%
is grown where they
 
00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
don't that's a tenth that's a 10 you
 
00:50:19.589 --> 00:50:19.599 align:start position:0%
can't have the product in your
 
00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
possession yeah but that they they only
 
00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:25.960 align:start position:0%
have the the federal government
 
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
under the Constitution only has
 
00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:32.200 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce you know that John
 
00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
and then and then you have many many
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
times then you have the 10th Amendment
 
00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:38.680 align:start position:0%
that comes into play where the hell does
 
00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:41.960 align:start position:0%
doj get off regulating what happens
 
00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:43.960 align:start position:0%
inside of a
 
00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:46.440 align:start position:0%
state so what I would say to that
 
00:50:49.589 --> 00:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
generally is that uh the um the extent
 
00:50:49.599 --> 00:50:50.549 align:start position:0%
generally is that uh the um the extent
of

00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:50:50.559 --> 00:50:52.710 align:start position:0%
of
prosecutions

00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
prosecutions
 
00:50:55.789 --> 00:50:55.799 align:start position:0%
um I don't I don't it doesn't seem as as
 
00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
as if there was a bar merely relying on
 
00:51:00.829 --> 00:51:00.839 align:start position:0%
that that distinction uh and there uh it
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
appears that there are are doj
 
00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
prosecutions that have proceeded for a
 
00:51:09.069 --> 00:51:09.079 align:start position:0%
number of years uh that that may depend
 
00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
entirely or be uh fact specific where
 
00:51:14.829 --> 00:51:14.839 align:start position:0%
cannabis may be grown within a state and
 
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
there may be other factors that have
 
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:23.240 align:start position:0%
prosecution it should be no surprise
 
00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
that the federal government's position
 
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
on marijuana regulations is very
 
00:51:29.710 --> 00:51:29.720 align:start position:0%
inconsistent I mean it's part of the
 
00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:31.720 align:start position:0%
mess that the states are facing now and
 
00:51:33.870 --> 00:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
what we're dealing with today is they
 
00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
pick and choose which ones they want to
 
00:51:38.109 --> 00:51:38.119 align:start position:0%
enforce which ones they don't and you
 
00:51:39.789 --> 00:51:39.799 align:start position:0%
can see that's that's problematic in
 
00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
other areas too so just to follow up on
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
that for half a second uh going back to
 
00:51:49.109 --> 00:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
the co-mingling of funds New Hampshire
 
00:51:52.270 --> 00:51:52.280 align:start position:0%
has a a rather interesting structure of
 
00:51:56.829 --> 00:51:56.839 align:start position:0%
um taxation for business businesses uh
 
00:51:59.950 --> 00:51:59.960 align:start position:0%
we have the BET and the BPT under the in
 
00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
the 70s
 
00:52:05.549 --> 00:52:05.559 align:start position:0%
um would that be co-mingling of funds if
 
00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:09.160 align:start position:0%
we charged the BET employee tax and a
 
00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
business profits tax on a franchise that
 
00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:15.640 align:start position:0%
was selling a quote illegal
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
product sir that's outside of my area of
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
expertise I don't have an answer for you
 
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:26.789 align:start position:0%
 
apologize

00:52:26.789 --> 00:52:26.799 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
no you're you're right no listen there's
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
a lot there's a several problems here I
 
00:52:30.839 --> 00:52:32.069 align:start position:0%
a lot there's a several problems here I
get

00:52:32.069 --> 00:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:52:34.349 --> 00:52:34.359 align:start position:0%
it thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question I have a question
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
regarding the the um Federal doj
 
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
discretionary um
 
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
prosecutorial um stance it it so if I'm
 
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
understanding this correctly um the um
 
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
non-compliance with State statue May
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
activate um Federal prose ution
 
00:52:59.910 --> 00:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
regarding a controlled substance act
 
00:53:04.109 --> 00:53:04.119 align:start position:0%
however um you know violation of federal
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
law uh is dependent on the discretion of
 
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
doj their funding discretion whether
 
00:53:13.870 --> 00:53:13.880 align:start position:0%
they would follow up on a controlled
 
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
substance act violation of the law I
 
00:53:18.990 --> 00:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
don't know that they have any
 
00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
independent uh sources there or there
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
would be a distinction so in terms of
 
00:53:28.349 --> 00:53:28.359 align:start position:0%
USD J's articulation of where it will
 
00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:30.200 align:start position:0%
concentrate resources it's my
 
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:31.720 align:start position:0%
understanding that non-compliance with a
 
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
state regime is a
 
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
factor along with other factors that
 
00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:38.680 align:start position:0%
they consider in pursuing a prosecution
 
00:53:40.349 --> 00:53:40.359 align:start position:0%
so I don't know that it has a unique
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
Authority for pursuing
 
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
non-compliance uh but there have been
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
several cases in in the the ninth
 
00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
circuit also in the the first circuit uh
 
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
where there have been prosecutions
 
00:53:55.390 --> 00:53:55.400 align:start position:0%
brought uh the defendants were
 
00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
essentially trying to defend the the
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
prosecution by uh stating that there was
 
00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
a uh a the Appropriations riter would
 
00:54:06.510 --> 00:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
prohibit utilization of funds for those
 
00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:08.839 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions and the courts have
 
00:54:11.789 --> 00:54:11.799 align:start position:0%
have uh said No it's it's limited uh the
 
00:54:13.789 --> 00:54:13.799 align:start position:0%
Appropriations riter does not prohibit
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
all prosecutions this would still be a
 
00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
violation of the Controlled Substances
 
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
Act and so therefore um us doj has the
 
00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
discretion to bring charges but the the
 
00:54:27.150 --> 00:54:27.160 align:start position:0%
non-compliance with the state regime in
 
00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:28.760 align:start position:0%
those sorts of cases I think would only
 
00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
be a factor uh impacting us doj's
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement action there's no
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
requirement or I don't think that it
 
00:54:40.750 --> 00:54:40.760 align:start position:0%
would be a um any unique Authority that
 
00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:42.280 align:start position:0%
non-compliance with the state regime
 
00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:45.880 align:start position:0%
would lead to an enforcement
 
00:54:50.309 --> 00:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
action I just said um um the doj of
 
00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:53.240 align:start position:0%
course would have no uh interaction or
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
involvement in civil liability
 
00:54:58.549 --> 00:54:58.559 align:start position:0%
correct are you speaking about the us
 
00:55:00.910 --> 00:55:00.920 align:start position:0%
doj or the Attorney General's off New
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Attorney General's office us
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
doj for example in the New York uh case
 
00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
that was uh discussed earlier um there
 
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
would be no involvement of the US doj or
 
00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:15.160 align:start position:0%
would there no I don't believe that
 
00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:18.280 align:start position:0%
they're uh a party to that lawsuit it's
 
00:55:21.029 --> 00:55:21.039 align:start position:0%
uh the lawsuit uh claim is dependent on
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
federal law but uh aren't named
 
00:55:26.029 --> 00:55:26.039 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs or defendant in that in that
 
00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
case okay and and the opposite is true
 
00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
right the New York the New York doj is
 
00:55:35.870 --> 00:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
defending State that's correct in
 
00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
respect to this case out of New
 
00:55:41.829 --> 00:55:41.839 align:start position:0%
York it's it's a private or nonprofit or
 
00:55:43.990 --> 00:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
entity that's bringing the lawsuit as
 
00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
the plaintiff and what essentially is
 
00:55:48.829 --> 00:55:48.839 align:start position:0%
the theory of that are they trying to
 
00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:51.640 align:start position:0%
get compel the state to comply with
 
00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
Federal I guess what's
 
00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
there so it would be a collection I'm uh
 
00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
I'm forgetting the total number of uh
 
00:56:01.069 --> 00:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
named plaintiffs it would be several
 
00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
different organizations as well as a
 
00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
number of different individuals in the
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
State uh so the
 
00:56:10.549 --> 00:56:10.559 align:start position:0%
the claims um or the petition for Relief
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
is really uh based on two things one
 
00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:16.799 align:start position:0%
would be to um have a declaratory
 
00:56:19.829 --> 00:56:19.839 align:start position:0%
judgment a statement saying New York law
 
00:56:22.589 --> 00:56:22.599 align:start position:0%
is inconsistent with federal law and it
 
00:56:22.599 --> 00:56:23.309 align:start position:0%
is inconsistent with federal law and it
is

00:56:23.309 --> 00:56:23.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:56:25.470 --> 00:56:25.480 align:start position:0%
unenforceable uh and then to prohibit
 
00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
any state action based on that uh that
 
00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
unenforceability to say this is uh
 
00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
federal law preempts New York law and
 
00:56:38.430 --> 00:56:38.440 align:start position:0%
therefore New York cannot spend any
 
00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
resources any Appropriations in order to
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
enforce or operate its own U marijuana
 
00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
related regulatory structure and not to
 
00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
put you in the spot but it put that in
 
00:56:50.789 --> 00:56:50.799 align:start position:0%
another context like immigration could
 
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
someone file same type of lawsuit
 
00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:55.640 align:start position:0%
against a state that had Sanctuary
 
00:56:58.710 --> 00:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
cities I mean it seems to me it's kind
 
00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:00.200 align:start position:0%
of the reverse the federal government
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
normally can't compel the states to
 
00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
comply with they law is what I always
 
00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:06.200 align:start position:0%
that's how the Supreme Court ruled on
 
00:57:08.549 --> 00:57:08.559 align:start position:0%
that issue so I'd say that there's
 
00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of civil litigation
 
00:57:14.670 --> 00:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
relating to uh uh State regimes and
 
00:57:18.589 --> 00:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
State Legal structures so um when a any
 
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
legislature patches legislation uh there
 
00:57:23.470 --> 00:57:23.480 align:start position:0%
may be groups individuals in a similar
 
00:57:25.710 --> 00:57:25.720 align:start position:0%
structure as with this new York uh
 
00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:27.640 align:start position:0%
lawsuit that will bring a lawsuit
 
00:57:29.029 --> 00:57:29.039 align:start position:0%
against the state or different state
 
00:57:32.190 --> 00:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
entities uh or actors uh to try to
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
enjoin them from uh enforcing or from
 
00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
pursuing or managing uh the statutory uh
 
00:57:41.029 --> 00:57:41.039 align:start position:0%
requirements so that's that is not
 
00:57:43.470 --> 00:57:43.480 align:start position:0%
unique that happens in many different uh
 
00:57:46.750 --> 00:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
issue areas and do you not again not to
 
00:57:48.549 --> 00:57:48.559 align:start position:0%
put you in the spot but I am has the
 
00:57:50.190 --> 00:57:50.200 align:start position:0%
courts ruled on any not related to
 
00:57:52.349 --> 00:57:52.359 align:start position:0%
Canabis what was their rulings in
 
00:57:55.470 --> 00:57:55.480 align:start position:0%
respect to that when a individual
 
00:57:57.150 --> 00:57:57.160 align:start position:0%
tries to compel a state to comply with
 
00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:58.789 align:start position:0%
tries to compel a state to comply with
federal

00:57:58.789 --> 00:57:58.799 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:57:58.799 --> 00:58:00.309 align:start position:0%
federal
law

00:58:00.309 --> 00:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:58:02.829 --> 00:58:02.839 align:start position:0%
um I don't have a great answer here I'd
 
00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
say that it's really fact specific and
 
00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
where there where there is a preemption
 
00:58:10.789 --> 00:58:10.799 align:start position:0%
uh issue or where they're able to show
 
00:58:13.789 --> 00:58:13.799 align:start position:0%
preemption uh then that would enjoin the
 
00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement or administration of state
 
00:58:18.069 --> 00:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
law uh that that does happen regularly
 
00:58:20.950 --> 00:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
in different spheres uh so for example
 
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh in campaign Finance law there may be
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
a state uh State Statute that is
 
00:58:30.069 --> 00:58:30.079 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with a or consistent with a
 
00:58:32.430 --> 00:58:32.440 align:start position:0%
federal statute and if the federal
 
00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:35.480 align:start position:0%
statute uh preempts explicitly or
 
00:58:37.710 --> 00:58:37.720 align:start position:0%
implicitly any state action in that
 
00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
field then a plaintiff could sue in
 
00:58:44.029 --> 00:58:44.039 align:start position:0%
order to to block or prohibit any state
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
action based on that state law so U it's
 
00:58:49.270 --> 00:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
certainly not unique to um to to the
 
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
topic of marijuana it happens routinely
 
00:58:55.589 --> 00:58:55.599 align:start position:0%
in other areas as well and in respect to
 
00:58:57.190 --> 00:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
I guess the Doomsday scenario would be
 
00:59:01.309 --> 00:59:01.319 align:start position:0%
we pass legislation it becomes law there
 
00:59:01.319 --> 00:59:02.670 align:start position:0%
we pass legislation it becomes law there
retail

00:59:02.670 --> 00:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
retail
 
00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
stores throughout the state and then the
 
00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
FED federal government comes in
 
00:59:11.470 --> 00:59:11.480 align:start position:0%
and shuts them down I guess right so
 
00:59:13.710 --> 00:59:13.720 align:start position:0%
that in order for that to come to to
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
happen would that require federal law
 
00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers with a DA FBI they
 
00:59:20.829 --> 00:59:20.839 align:start position:0%
would have to come in and actually
 
00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
enforce their federal marijuana
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
laws presumably any enforcement action
 
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
would would look similar to current
 
00:59:30.029 --> 00:59:30.039 align:start position:0%
enforcement actions uh by federal
 
00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:32.680 align:start position:0%
authorities so involvement of DEA other
 
00:59:35.549 --> 00:59:35.559 align:start position:0%
entities and us doj uh Prosecuting those
 
00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:38.440 align:start position:0%
cases bringing those cases forward and
 
00:59:42.190 --> 00:59:42.200 align:start position:0%
is there any I guess distinction between
 
00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
why that would happen in New Hampshire
 
00:59:45.309 --> 00:59:45.319 align:start position:0%
versus Maine
 
00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts any other state that has
 
00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:49.839 align:start position:0%
retail stores right now California I
 
00:59:51.549 --> 00:59:51.559 align:start position:0%
mean I guess I be curious why the feds
 
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
would come to New Hampshire shut down
 
00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
the retail stores and not the other
 
00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
states are doing
 
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
it so I just point to the the the the
 
01:00:04.750 --> 01:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
uniqueness aspect so uh whether it is a
 
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
civil liability whether it is a criminal
 
01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
liability um an action uh or regime or
 
01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
entity that stands out from any others
 
01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
there may be additional Le legal
 
01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
liability from that I can't predict
 
01:00:23.950 --> 01:00:23.960 align:start position:0%
whether any uniqueness uh would lead to
 
01:00:25.390 --> 01:00:25.400 align:start position:0%
a particular
 
01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh increase in a liability just saying
 
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
that ordinarily any uh conduct that is
 
01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:33.400 align:start position:0%
um more severe or more advanced than
 
01:00:37.270 --> 01:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
than others may cross that line for uh
 
01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
the prosecutorial discretion or or
 
01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
exercise of enforcement action or if it
 
01:00:45.349 --> 01:00:45.359 align:start position:0%
is a unique legal structure uh may make
 
01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:48.920 align:start position:0%
it more uh more prone to litigation on
 
01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
the Civil front as well so um I
 
01:00:53.109 --> 01:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
certainly don't have an answer on the
 
01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
likelihood of that happening
 
01:00:59.029 --> 01:00:59.039 align:start position:0%
uh just doing something new uh May
 
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
create new liabilities without knowing
 
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
whether those liabilities May ever be
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
realized it sounds like there's a
 
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
potential that the federal government
 
01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
would be more upset that the state being
 
01:01:14.109 --> 01:01:14.119 align:start position:0%
involved in selling an illegal drug then
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
but they're okay with private citizens
 
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
selling the illegal
 
01:01:20.069 --> 01:01:20.079 align:start position:0%
drug even though it's legal I would see
 
01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
it the other way is that we're actually
 
01:01:25.789 --> 01:01:25.799 align:start position:0%
going farther in controlling
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
it than the other states have and so
 
01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
therefore they we would be the poster
 
01:01:33.029 --> 01:01:33.039 align:start position:0%
trial what they would want other states
 
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
to do because they if they're in the end
 
01:01:37.870 --> 01:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
of the day I'll I'll go to the when the
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
repeal of the prohibition and when some
 
01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
states decide to be control States and
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
some do not it was the control State
 
01:01:46.029 --> 01:01:46.039 align:start position:0%
model the whole purpose was this is how
 
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to ensure that alcohol won't
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
be abused and so therefore I would say
 
01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
the same thing our model means that we
 
01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
actually a more control over the safety
 
01:01:59.269 --> 01:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
and distribution of the product than any
 
01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
other state and so therefore the federal
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
government would think we're the best of
 
01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:05.720 align:start position:0%
all the bunch and I agree with you and
 
01:02:07.589 --> 01:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
that's very good logic but you're
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
dealing with an illogical system with
 
01:02:14.589 --> 01:02:14.599 align:start position:0%
the problem but I makes makes U perfect
 
01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:19.079 align:start position:0%
sense to me Chief thank you Mr chair um
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
with respect to having the Attorney
 
01:02:23.710 --> 01:02:23.720 align:start position:0%
General's office in addition to looking
 
01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:27.400 align:start position:0%
at the exposure of Co mingling cannabis
 
01:02:29.789 --> 01:02:29.799 align:start position:0%
proceeds with other state funds your
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
point with respect to an analogy which I
 
01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
thought was uh excellent with respect to
 
01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:37.720 align:start position:0%
McDonald's in that the
 
01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
corporation um that was setting the
 
01:02:43.789 --> 01:02:43.799 align:start position:0%
limit for the temperature would be
 
01:02:47.269 --> 01:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
analogous perhaps to State legislation
 
01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:50.559 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire setting a THC limit
 
01:02:53.549 --> 01:02:53.559 align:start position:0%
that was extraordinarily high that led
 
01:02:56.549 --> 01:02:56.559 align:start position:0%
to addition cannabis use disorder which
 
01:02:59.470 --> 01:02:59.480 align:start position:0%
could expose the state to liability
 
01:03:02.309 --> 01:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
based on its regulation so perhaps the
 
01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office um in
 
01:03:07.309 --> 01:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
connection with our efforts may look
 
01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
further and deeper into how regulations
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
May expose the state to liability with
 
01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:17.640 align:start position:0%
respect to civil tort actions as a
 
01:03:19.789 --> 01:03:19.799 align:start position:0%
result of that
 
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
regulation just to follow up on that
 
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps I think a key would be what the
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
warning legal sense something when it's
 
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
the consumer is aware of the side
 
01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
effects you know you can't if this says
 
01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
this will cause this or may cause that
 
01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
and then they use the product and that
 
01:03:39.269 --> 01:03:39.279 align:start position:0%
side effect happens the disclosure I
 
01:03:41.309 --> 01:03:41.319 align:start position:0%
think would at least mitigate liability
 
01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps maybe a recommendation on a or
 
01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
on a warning label that would limit
 
01:03:50.589 --> 01:03:50.599 align:start position:0%
liability in that context I I can note
 
01:03:54.029 --> 01:03:54.039 align:start position:0%
that request well um Point well taken
 
01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
but um as as you know um as a barrister
 
01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
people can bring tort actions for for
 
01:04:05.589 --> 01:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
just about anything and uh and often do
 
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
right and so I think that the the the
 
01:04:12.069 --> 01:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
surgical point that I'm trying to get to
 
01:04:15.029 --> 01:04:15.039 align:start position:0%
is the effective regulation much like
 
01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
your McDonald's case that exposed that
 
01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
Corporation because it knew that it set
 
01:04:22.589 --> 01:04:22.599 align:start position:0%
the temperature and allowed that to
 
01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
happen and there was a risk uh resulted
 
01:04:28.269 --> 01:04:28.279 align:start position:0%
in that settlement of course civil
 
01:04:31.470 --> 01:04:31.480 align:start position:0%
juries have their own mind and will do
 
01:04:34.269 --> 01:04:34.279 align:start position:0%
what they do but I think that going
 
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
forward in this process it behooves the
 
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
state to have our attorneys by way of
 
01:04:42.829 --> 01:04:42.839 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office uh perhaps
 
01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
flush out uh the liability risk um um if
 
01:04:49.269 --> 01:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
they could along with the co-mingling uh
 
01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
issue that would be my my recommendation
 
01:04:54.150 --> 01:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
or request but remember the hc's have
 
01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
have no
 
01:04:59.510 --> 01:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
limits it they may have but that doesn't
 
01:05:02.549 --> 01:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
preclude that there could not be a u a
 
01:05:06.029 --> 01:05:06.039 align:start position:0%
Tor action that um that someone could
 
01:05:09.549 --> 01:05:09.559 align:start position:0%
claim so uh simply the absence of an
 
01:05:15.549 --> 01:05:15.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
occurring thank you Mr chair I'm just
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
trying to wrap my brain around this and
 
01:05:23.109 --> 01:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
um um can you check my understanding uh
 
01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:25.480 align:start position:0%
I've summarized this as anyone who
 
01:05:27.950 --> 01:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
participates in the growing possession
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
manufacturer distribution or sales of
 
01:05:33.309 --> 01:05:33.319 align:start position:0%
recreational Cannabis under state law or
 
01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:36.200 align:start position:0%
Aids and or facilitates or finances such
 
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
actions is at risk of federal
 
01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
prosecution or other a liability from
 
01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
harmed parties is that
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
correct what you just described appears
 
01:05:46.349 --> 01:05:46.359 align:start position:0%
to be a violation of the Controlled
 
01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
Substances Act and a violation of
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
federal law thank
 
01:05:53.589 --> 01:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair would it be
 
01:05:55.789 --> 01:05:55.799 align:start position:0%
possible for your office to put together
 
01:05:57.390 --> 01:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
some information on that New York case
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
so so that we had it for our packets and
 
01:06:03.390 --> 01:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
oh you sorry I I can send that uh that
 
01:06:05.789 --> 01:06:05.799 align:start position:0%
case uh around and follow up as as we're
 
01:06:10.829 --> 01:06:10.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you yeah so I guess
 
01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
more just directing you but hopefully
 
01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
the AG's office will look into the
 
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
franchise thing more more broadly
 
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
because it certainly seems possible
 
01:06:26.109 --> 01:06:26.119 align:start position:0%
that a court could rule and again I'm
 
01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
not a lawyer so I going pretend like I I
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
really understand the legal the legal
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
framework why this would happen but it
 
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
seems possible that a court could rule
 
01:06:38.029 --> 01:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
that the state is in a cons is working
 
01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
with a franchisees and conspiracy to
 
01:06:43.390 --> 01:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
commit a federal crime because the
 
01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
franchising the franchising framework is
 
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
governed at the federal level not the
 
01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:50.799 align:start position:0%
state level and so I think that that
 
01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
seems like a part that I mean I know you
 
01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
haven't looked at yeah but if if we
 
01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
could get some if you guys could maybe
 
01:06:58.750 --> 01:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
give us some sort of an opinion on that
 
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
I think that would be really helpful for
 
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
me because it seems to me like this is
 
01:07:05.309 --> 01:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
when he talks about the uniqueness of
 
01:07:08.269 --> 01:07:08.279 align:start position:0%
this model potentially opening us up to
 
01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
different types of enforcement this
 
01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
seems like the way that it could happen
 
01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
or the most obvious way and I think we
 
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
should understand that before we we jump
 
01:07:17.190 --> 01:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
into it without exploring that I I think
 
01:07:19.390 --> 01:07:19.400 align:start position:0%
you basically just to rephrase your
 
01:07:23.109 --> 01:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
question would the state actors whether
 
01:07:25.549 --> 01:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
it's the folks working in the Liquor
 
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
Commission whether it's liquor
 
01:07:29.309 --> 01:07:29.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement are they could they be
 
01:07:32.349 --> 01:07:32.359 align:start position:0%
charged with conspiracy with if the
 
01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
retail store is because they're helping
 
01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
facilitate that and because they're
 
01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
profiting off it and they Yeahs working
 
01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:41.720 align:start position:0%
together uh under like just basic
 
01:07:43.589 --> 01:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
conspiracy know
 
01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
101 I would lean into the yes but yeah I
 
01:07:50.829 --> 01:07:50.839 align:start position:0%
me just saying like how can how can a
 
01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
state employee fulfill their obligations
 
01:07:54.910 --> 01:07:54.920 align:start position:0%
under state law while simultaneously
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
violating the laws of the federal law I
 
01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
think I I'm not a lawyer so I can't I
 
01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:01.640 align:start position:0%
really come up with a good theory but it
 
01:08:05.069 --> 01:08:05.079 align:start position:0%
seems to me that the regulatory
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
framework around franchises
 
01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
specifically seems like this could be a
 
01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
problem for us that we should definitely
 
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
try to understand it so from and I can
 
01:08:17.349 --> 01:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
just speak on that with an understanding
 
01:08:21.749 --> 01:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
is you're you're correct a state
 
01:08:24.189 --> 01:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
employee a liquor enforcement officer
 
01:08:27.070 --> 01:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
would essentially there will be times if
 
01:08:29.910 --> 01:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with um cannabis could
 
01:08:32.590 --> 01:08:32.600 align:start position:0%
be violating the federal law U I think
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
that that's one of the concerns that's
 
01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
kind of come up throughout the
 
01:08:38.269 --> 01:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
process uh again that would require the
 
01:08:40.110 --> 01:08:40.120 align:start position:0%
federal government now to come here and
 
01:08:44.110 --> 01:08:44.120 align:start position:0%
arrest a state employee or you know one
 
01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
of our law enforcement officers and
 
01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
charge them with that you know charged
 
01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
with with violating law so again that
 
01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
would require the feds to come in and do
 
01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
it but I think you're correct I I would
 
01:08:57.149 --> 01:08:57.159 align:start position:0%
point out why I'm very when I look at
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
this is I use the term it's been a joke
 
01:09:03.669 --> 01:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
you can go on you know Fidelity and buy
 
01:09:05.829 --> 01:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
shares in a cannabis company on your
 
01:09:08.910 --> 01:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
cell phone all right and that that's
 
01:09:11.789 --> 01:09:11.799 align:start position:0%
International that's state lines that's
 
01:09:14.229 --> 01:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
Bank issues that's wiring you name it
 
01:09:17.309 --> 01:09:17.319 align:start position:0%
it's there so again where where's the
 
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
federal government with that I mean they
 
01:09:22.110 --> 01:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
they're the problem we face is we have
 
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
to guess what they'll do and what they
 
01:09:27.269 --> 01:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
want W do and I think for us for me if
 
01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
they're going to do something and Target
 
01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
just this state I I think that that's I
 
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
guess but I think I think my point is if
 
01:09:38.309 --> 01:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
there we are we are at some level
 
01:09:39.390 --> 01:09:39.400 align:start position:0%
creating a business that will be
 
01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
regulated by the feds whereas if we had
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
a truly private based model it wouldn't
 
01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
be regulated by the feds it would be
 
01:09:46.669 --> 01:09:46.679 align:start position:0%
regulated just by the state that's sort
 
01:09:49.149 --> 01:09:49.159 align:start position:0%
of my my
 
01:09:51.709 --> 01:09:51.719 align:start position:0%
question okay so
 
01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh Google right Cornell Law don't worry
 
01:09:57.990 --> 01:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
about it the we will be in compliance
 
01:09:59.790 --> 01:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
with the federal law the federal law is
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
all about
 
01:10:03.709 --> 01:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
disclosure that we must there are
 
01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
certain disclosures about fees and
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
regulations and how they might lose
 
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
their license and I can assure you that
 
01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
when we offer up a franchise agreement
 
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
we'll have no trouble being compliance
 
01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
with the federal
 
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
law that's good I mean I think the law
 
01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
is probably more than you were able to
 
01:10:23.669 --> 01:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
read really quickly on Google what
 
01:10:26.110 --> 01:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
spefically says the violation of it is
 
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
if you didn't disclose it might be good
 
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
to just get AG's opinion on is all I'm
 
01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
asking for I would welcome our federal
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
delegation to also chime in if they ever
 
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
want to offer some guidance on what's

been appointed to deliver this unified
 
01:21:58.030 --> 01:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
testimony we have been collaborating to
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%

support services offered by Granite Leaf
 
01:22:20.430 --> 01:22:20.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis uh since there were a number of
 
01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
questions about that at the last meeting
 
01:22:25.390 --> 01:22:25.400 align:start position:0%
and the third thing is a data report
 
01:22:28.149 --> 01:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
that was produced by Mr Smith behind us
 
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
at our request to be responsive the
 
01:22:32.350 --> 01:22:32.360 align:start position:0%
questions that have been raised
 
01:22:34.669 --> 01:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
throughout this process and by the study
 
01:22:36.750 --> 01:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
commission regarding the experience of
 
01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis programs and other
 
01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
states following the Advent of adult use
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
legalization so as the study commission
 
01:22:49.470 --> 01:22:49.480 align:start position:0%
considers policy options for integrating
 
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic canvas program with the
 
01:22:53.310 --> 01:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
proposed franchise model we appreciate
 
01:22:55.669 --> 01:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to provide testimony and
 
01:22:57.070 --> 01:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
comment on draft
 
01:22:59.270 --> 01:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
language uh the tcps have been
 
01:23:01.030 --> 01:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
operational for more than seven years
 
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
together we have combined over 20 years
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
experience producing and dispensing
 
01:23:07.629 --> 01:23:07.639 align:start position:0%
cannabis in a heavily regulated
 
01:23:09.550 --> 01:23:09.560 align:start position:0%
environment our teams have worked hard
 
01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
to Pioneer responsible cannabis industry
 
01:23:13.669 --> 01:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and we would like to
 
01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
contribute our experience to the
 
01:23:16.830 --> 01:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
important task of pioneering a
 
01:23:19.070 --> 01:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
responsible adult use cannabis industry
 
01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
as well uh we appreciate the concerns
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
that have been expressed
 
01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
regarding how this could potentially
 
01:23:28.709 --> 01:23:28.719 align:start position:0%
impact our program and the patients we
 
01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
serve so the good news uh after
 
01:23:33.229 --> 01:23:33.239 align:start position:0%
reviewing And discussing the most recent
 
01:23:36.510 --> 01:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
draft legislation the atc's all agree
 
01:23:39.189 --> 01:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
that this uh franchise model can work
 
01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire uh we are confident
 
01:23:43.950 --> 01:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
that the model can be successfully
 
01:23:45.910 --> 01:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
integrated with the
 
01:23:48.550 --> 01:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
TCP and uh successful integration
 
01:23:50.350 --> 01:23:50.360 align:start position:0%
between those two programs We Believe
 
01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
would help enable a timely and efficient
 
01:23:56.229 --> 01:23:56.239 align:start position:0%
roll out of the adult use Market while
 
01:23:57.830 --> 01:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
maintaining and potentially improving
 
01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
service to registered patients so uh
 
01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
we've got a few points I'll I'm not
 
01:24:04.629 --> 01:24:04.639 align:start position:0%
going to read them all I will roll roll
 
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
through them and um as efficiently as
 
01:24:11.590 --> 01:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
possible so the first point is the
 
01:24:13.950 --> 01:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
inclusion of the for-profit conversion
 
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
language that is in this draft and we
 
01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate it being there uh this is
 
01:24:22.990 --> 01:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
language that has passed the legislature
 
01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh the House and Senate uh twice before
 
01:24:27.550 --> 01:24:27.560 align:start position:0%
as a standalone bill it was included in
 
01:24:31.189 --> 01:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
HP 639 uh which passed the house this
 
01:24:33.870 --> 01:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
year and got 10 votes in the Senate was
 
01:24:36.149 --> 01:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
also in the proposed amendment to S sp98
 
01:24:37.550 --> 01:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
so it's been in all the models that have
 
01:24:40.350 --> 01:24:40.360 align:start position:0%
been presented so far I feel that we may
 
01:24:42.189 --> 01:24:42.199 align:start position:0%
not need to blavor this point unless
 
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
people have questions um but the
 
01:24:47.669 --> 01:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
nonprofit requirement has presented many
 
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
obstacles to developing a successful
 
01:24:53.669 --> 01:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
program and uh a lot of people don't
 
01:24:56.590 --> 01:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
realize this but the atc's are required
 
01:24:59.310 --> 01:24:59.320 align:start position:0%
to be nonprofits at the state level
 
01:25:00.750 --> 01:25:00.760 align:start position:0%
however we're not nonprofits at the
 
01:25:03.189 --> 01:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
federal level the IRS does not uh view
 
01:25:05.950 --> 01:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
us as nonprofits they view us as as
 
01:25:07.390 --> 01:25:07.400 align:start position:0%
you've already heard illicit drug
 
01:25:11.149 --> 01:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
dealers so there are no advantages to
 
01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:14.119 align:start position:0%
the nonprofit status tax-wise and in
 
01:25:16.709 --> 01:25:16.719 align:start position:0%
fact we we have to uh we're not able to
 
01:25:18.430 --> 01:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
take the normal business deductions that
 
01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:21.159 align:start position:0%
are available to pretty much any other
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
type of business
 
01:25:25.430 --> 01:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
so um we believe this is essential to us
 
01:25:27.030 --> 01:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
being able to expand and serve the adult
 
01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
use Market I think that's an issue that
 
01:25:30.149 --> 01:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
we should have our federal delegation
 
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
address as well that would be I would
 
01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:34.870 align:start position:0%
address as well that would be I would
certainly

01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:39.390 --> 01:25:39.400 align:start position:0%
agree so yeah second Point uh can the
 
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
atcs operate within two different
 
01:25:44.790 --> 01:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
regulatory structures can we serve two
 
01:25:47.310 --> 01:25:47.320 align:start position:0%
masters if you will yes I we believe we
 
01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
can uh and some other examples that came
 
01:25:52.629 --> 01:25:52.639 align:start position:0%
to mind were convenience stores which
 
01:25:54.229 --> 01:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
depending on what they sell have to
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
report to several different government
 
01:26:00.229 --> 01:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
entities um banks are regulated by the
 
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
banking department but they may offer
 
01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:03.149 align:start position:0%
banking department but they may offer
Financial

01:26:03.149 --> 01:26:03.159 align:start position:0%
Financial
 
01:26:06.629 --> 01:26:06.639 align:start position:0%
Services uh that cannot be collocated
 
01:26:07.950 --> 01:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
with the tellers but have to be in a
 
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
separate part of the bank and they're
 
01:26:11.669 --> 01:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
licensed by the insurance department
 
01:26:13.350 --> 01:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
Andor the Bureau of Securities
 
01:26:15.310 --> 01:26:15.320 align:start position:0%
regulation I'm no expert on any of that
 
01:26:18.790 --> 01:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
but I I seemed like somewhat similar to
 
01:26:20.070 --> 01:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about with
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
potentially dual use cannabis um it can
 
01:26:27.229 --> 01:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
be done
 
01:26:31.629 --> 01:26:31.639 align:start position:0%
um what's needed is clear rules and a
 
01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:34.199 align:start position:0%
clear understanding of what the respon
 
01:26:36.189 --> 01:26:36.199 align:start position:0%
regulatory responsibilities are and
 
01:26:38.350 --> 01:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
we're confident that can be figured out
 
01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
through this process and dialed in
 
01:26:42.750 --> 01:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
further during the rul making
 
01:26:45.189 --> 01:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
process uh what's essential is that
 
01:26:48.790 --> 01:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
atc's do are able to transition smoothly
 
01:26:50.310 --> 01:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
and serve both the adult use and
 
01:26:52.910 --> 01:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
therapeutic markets without phing facing
 
01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:56.639 align:start position:0%
unnecessary burdens uh and I don't know
 
01:26:58.470 --> 01:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
what an unnecessary burden is off the
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
top of my head but if that's the only
 
01:27:04.030 --> 01:27:04.040 align:start position:0%
faar with dual Regulators if you had two
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh Regulators trying to regulate the
 
01:27:07.070 --> 01:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
same plant and they disagree on how to
 
01:27:09.669 --> 01:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
do that so back to rules and making sure
 
01:27:12.550 --> 01:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
that there are not conflicts in the
 
01:27:15.229 --> 01:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
rules um so we appreciate that the draft
 
01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
Bill requires uh the nhslc to con
 
01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
consult with the HHS uh When developing
 
01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
rules it's on page 12 we think this is a
 
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
good start uh we believe it could be
 
01:27:29.629 --> 01:27:29.639 align:start position:0%
improved by adding more specific
 
01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
language to clarify the division of
 
01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
regulatory responsibilities if the
 
01:27:36.149 --> 01:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
commission chooses to recommend a dual
 
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
regulatory system and we would be more
 
01:27:40.470 --> 01:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
than happy to work with you uh to
 
01:27:43.629 --> 01:27:43.639 align:start position:0%
develop appropriate language on that if
 
01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
I if I could just ask when it comes to
 
01:27:47.709 --> 01:27:47.719 align:start position:0%
that um is there any thought among and
 
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
I'll welcome anyone to answer that
 
01:27:51.070 --> 01:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
respond to this if all the regulatory
 
01:27:54.070 --> 01:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
was U Under The Liquor
 
01:27:59.109 --> 01:27:59.119 align:start position:0%
Commission so in in that scenario uh we
 
01:28:03.070 --> 01:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
that is potentially workable um I think
 
01:28:05.350 --> 01:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
the concern that you will hear from some
 
01:28:07.950 --> 01:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying it's a con a reason not
 
01:28:09.629 --> 01:28:09.639 align:start position:0%
to do it that we're expressing here the
 
01:28:11.550 --> 01:28:11.560 align:start position:0%
concern you will hear from some is that
 
01:28:13.790 --> 01:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
the patient education and support
 
01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
services the medical aspects of the
 
01:28:19.229 --> 01:28:19.239 align:start position:0%
program uh could be compromised in that
 
01:28:21.189 --> 01:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
scenario I'm not saying they would be I
 
01:28:22.950 --> 01:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
think there would be a the details would
 
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
matter a lot on that but from our
 
01:28:27.910 --> 01:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
perspective it's possible and uh we
 
01:28:30.990 --> 01:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
would not preclude that that option if
 
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
if that's where uh the general court
 
01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
wants wants to go with this we're we're
 
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
happy to discuss those
 
01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:39.830 align:start position:0%
happy to discuss those
details

01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
details
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
um it's more like reassigning what's
 
01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
there what's right now that they're
 
01:28:46.510 --> 01:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
under DHHS but if it was all under just
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
liquor would that be something that
 
01:28:51.030 --> 01:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
could be worked with it is an option
 
01:28:57.189 --> 01:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:00.189 --> 01:29:00.199 align:start position:0%
believe so point three how should atcs
 
01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:02.280 align:start position:0%
be integrated with the adult use
 
01:29:05.709 --> 01:29:05.719 align:start position:0%
regulatory system so we've seen two two
 
01:29:07.109 --> 01:29:07.119 align:start position:0%
models presented for the study
 
01:29:07.119 --> 01:29:08.830 align:start position:0%
models presented for the study
commission

01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:29:12.270 --> 01:29:12.280 align:start position:0%
uh the draft bill that we have would
 
01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
allow atcs to operate dual use cannabis
 
01:29:18.109 --> 01:29:18.119 align:start position:0%
retail stores that would exist alongside
 
01:29:20.669 --> 01:29:20.679 align:start position:0%
the franchise model but the ATC
 
01:29:23.990 --> 01:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
themselves would not be franchise stores
 
01:29:25.870 --> 01:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
and we believe that could be a workable
 
01:29:28.390 --> 01:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
model uh the commission's also discussed
 
01:29:31.149 --> 01:29:31.159 align:start position:0%
the possibility of dual use stores being
 
01:29:33.790 --> 01:29:33.800 align:start position:0%
co-branded and included in the franchise
 
01:29:36.149 --> 01:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
model so for example a retail store
 
01:29:38.109 --> 01:29:38.119 align:start position:0%
having New Hampshire cannabis Outlet
 
01:29:40.910 --> 01:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
sign and a granite Leaf cannabis sign or
 
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
or whatever and people would recognize
 
01:29:45.669 --> 01:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
that that's both an adult use and a
 
01:29:49.070 --> 01:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
therapeutic facility uh I believe that's
 
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
consistent with uh the nhslc
 
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
presentation As I understood it U and we
 
01:29:58.910 --> 01:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
believe that could be a
 
01:30:03.070 --> 01:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
workable system uh regardless of of of
 
01:30:05.390 --> 01:30:05.400 align:start position:0%
which model whether we're defined as
 
01:30:07.590 --> 01:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
franchise stores or defined as
 
01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:08.830 align:start position:0%
franchise stores or defined as
independent

01:30:08.830 --> 01:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
independent
 
01:30:11.550 --> 01:30:11.560 align:start position:0%
retailers uh these options both would
 
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
allow us to serve patients and
 
01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
non-patients from the same facilities
 
01:30:18.910 --> 01:30:18.920 align:start position:0%
dual use dispensaries are very common
 
01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
and successfully operated in other
 
01:30:23.830 --> 01:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
states um and there are some best
 
01:30:25.629 --> 01:30:25.639 align:start position:0%
practices there and they're generally
 
01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
already included in this bill uh to
 
01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:30.719 align:start position:0%
ensure that the dispensaries continue to
 
01:30:32.590 --> 01:30:32.600 align:start position:0%
serve Patients First and that we
 
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
continue to prioritize their needs and I
 
01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
I see it says co-branding and I
 
01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
understand right now like today there's
 
01:30:42.149 --> 01:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
you have the brand for your I I know you
 
01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
guys is prime I know you Chang your name
 
01:30:45.070 --> 01:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
but but just Prime because it's no
 
01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
longer a brand right that's the sign
 
01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
would say Prime but if you coexisted in
 
01:30:54.109 --> 01:30:54.119 align:start position:0%
operated dual store it would have the
 
01:30:57.470 --> 01:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire franchise store and Prime
 
01:31:00.510 --> 01:31:00.520 align:start position:0%
so I guess I guess for my concern from a
 
01:31:02.750 --> 01:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
branding perspective for purposes of New
 
01:31:05.550 --> 01:31:05.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for the New Hampshire store it
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
would the ATC stores would have kind of
 
01:31:10.990 --> 01:31:11.000 align:start position:0%
a they would be different than the other
 
01:31:13.390 --> 01:31:13.400 align:start position:0%
franchises I guess who aren't in the ATC
 
01:31:15.790 --> 01:31:15.800 align:start position:0%
business so I think when it comes to
 
01:31:19.430 --> 01:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
branding is the long-term Vision perhaps
 
01:31:23.229 --> 01:31:23.239 align:start position:0%
the product that Prime is producing
 
01:31:24.510 --> 01:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
I mean that's the individual brand like
 
01:31:26.870 --> 01:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
here has a boted water it's brand they
 
01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
don't they don't open their own store
 
01:31:31.109 --> 01:31:31.119 align:start position:0%
they find a retailer to sell the water
 
01:31:33.270 --> 01:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
so I guess your the products can still
 
01:31:35.830 --> 01:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
be therapeutic grade or made by the
 
01:31:37.149 --> 01:31:37.159 align:start position:0%
company but do they have to have their
 
01:31:40.109 --> 01:31:40.119 align:start position:0%
own stand on store because I think you
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
know Jack Daniels is not they don't open
 
01:31:46.229 --> 01:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
up their own store they sell it same way
 
01:31:47.830 --> 01:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
right is that the long-term vision of
 
01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:49.280 align:start position:0%
how this could go because that might
 
01:31:51.790 --> 01:31:51.800 align:start position:0%
make the Dual license and the the Dual
 
01:31:54.109 --> 01:31:54.119 align:start position:0%
franchises and and all that you want to
 
01:31:55.470 --> 01:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
have confusion amongst the public now
 
01:31:58.870 --> 01:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
you can still Market of having a
 
01:32:01.109 --> 01:32:01.119 align:start position:0%
therapeutic employee that is knowledge
 
01:32:02.350 --> 01:32:02.360 align:start position:0%
on the product I'm not going to use the
 
01:32:03.870 --> 01:32:03.880 align:start position:0%
term expert until I'm convinced that
 
01:32:05.550 --> 01:32:05.560 align:start position:0%
they're an expert but you understand
 
01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
where I'm going with this right yeah I
 
01:32:09.709 --> 01:32:09.719 align:start position:0%
do that work yeah thank you for that
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
that question so uh is it part of of the
 
01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:16.040 align:start position:0%
long-term Vision it it has not been up
 
01:32:17.629 --> 01:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
up to this point part of the long-term
 
01:32:19.790 --> 01:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
Vision I we have three different
 
01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
companies that have retail operations
 
01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
which are branded retail operations uh
 
01:32:28.470 --> 01:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
two of them have been operating uh
 
01:32:31.109 --> 01:32:31.119 align:start position:0%
retail serving patients only but retail
 
01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
under that brand for seven years uh
 
01:32:36.270 --> 01:32:36.280 align:start position:0%
Granite Leaf we did just change her name
 
01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
but we we changed our name in part
 
01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
because we wanted to have a name that
 
01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
reflected our commitment to New
 
01:32:42.910 --> 01:32:42.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and that did a better job
 
01:32:46.109 --> 01:32:46.119 align:start position:0%
reflecting what we do so could we give
 
01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
up that branding of our stores and
 
01:32:50.750 --> 01:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
become New Hampshire cannabis Outlets
 
01:32:52.229 --> 01:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
only from
 
01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
from at least from the public view
 
01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
driving by I think that is an option
 
01:32:58.709 --> 01:32:58.719 align:start position:0%
that that we could we would be open to
 
01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
discussing but it's it's a big ask to to
 
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
say you have this retail brand and uh
 
01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
you're getting rid of it so we're we're
 
01:33:10.030 --> 01:33:10.040 align:start position:0%
open that to that to that
 
01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
possibility um but
 
01:33:15.109 --> 01:33:15.119 align:start position:0%
it's that's that's and I would further
 
01:33:17.229 --> 01:33:17.239 align:start position:0%
comment that's not what I when I read
 
01:33:19.310 --> 01:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
the drap bill that's not what I see
 
01:33:22.189 --> 01:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
because the atcs would not be franch
 
01:33:24.510 --> 01:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
stores in as I read this draft they
 
01:33:26.109 --> 01:33:26.119 align:start position:0%
would be separately defined as
 
01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:29.480 align:start position:0%
independent cannabis retail stores so
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
that would be different language and
 
01:33:32.590 --> 01:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
we'd be happy to review that language
 
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
and and and comment on it but I don't
 
01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
think we've seen a bill that would do
 
01:33:39.109 --> 01:33:39.119 align:start position:0%
that and what I was I'm just thinking in
 
01:33:42.070 --> 01:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
my head and and you it's up to I would
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
ask for everyone to tell me if this
 
01:33:46.669 --> 01:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
makes sense or not if you have your own
 
01:33:48.950 --> 01:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
branded product you know in theory it
 
01:33:51.109 --> 01:33:51.119 align:start position:0%
could be sold out of any retail store in
 
01:33:53.870 --> 01:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
the state now you may have a therapeutic
 
01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:55.070 align:start position:0%
the state now you may have a therapeutic
grade

01:33:55.070 --> 01:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
grade
 
01:33:57.669 --> 01:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
product and I and I would kind of think
 
01:33:59.830 --> 01:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
that that the entities that could
 
01:34:02.070 --> 01:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
manufactur those would be limited to the
 
01:34:05.109 --> 01:34:05.119 align:start position:0%
ones that exist today so there is what
 
01:34:06.350 --> 01:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about is having unfair
 
01:34:08.750 --> 01:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
Market advantages for if you had some
 
01:34:12.510 --> 01:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
retail stores that had the ATC inside it
 
01:34:15.189 --> 01:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
versus the ones who don't so you got to
 
01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:17.360 align:start position:0%
you got to balance that both ways now if
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
a store doesn't want to sell the
 
01:34:20.790 --> 01:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
therapeutic product and I would leave
 
01:34:23.709 --> 01:34:23.719 align:start position:0%
that to the manufacturers who are
 
01:34:26.430 --> 01:34:26.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturing that therapeutic grade
 
01:34:27.629 --> 01:34:27.639 align:start position:0%
they want to have requirements of the
 
01:34:29.310 --> 01:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
retail what they are comfortable with if
 
01:34:30.189 --> 01:34:30.199 align:start position:0%
they're going to sell it because it's
 
01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
going to have a higher dose perhaps
 
01:34:34.229 --> 01:34:34.239 align:start position:0%
that's the choice that they make those
 
01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
are all business business decisions
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
right but I think if you did it that way
 
01:34:41.229 --> 01:34:41.239 align:start position:0%
it would still allow an increased market
 
01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
share because now your the therapeutic
 
01:34:44.189 --> 01:34:44.199 align:start position:0%
product we sold
 
01:34:46.709 --> 01:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
everywhere right but the person to B
 
01:34:48.109 --> 01:34:48.119 align:start position:0%
purchase that would still need the
 
01:34:50.910 --> 01:34:50.920 align:start position:0%
therapeutic card it wouldn't be it
 
01:34:52.669 --> 01:34:52.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to be purchased for
 
01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
recreational purposes does that make
 
01:34:58.189 --> 01:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
sense that does make sense um when it
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
works or not it's another store well I I
 
01:35:03.950 --> 01:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
think it can work um we've I mean
 
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
patients would certainly appreciate more
 
01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
access points to therapeutic canas there
 
01:35:10.109 --> 01:35:10.119 align:start position:0%
are only seven dispensaries in the state
 
01:35:11.550 --> 01:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
so the reality of that is a lot of
 
01:35:13.910 --> 01:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
patients live closer to an adult use
 
01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
store in Maine or Massachusetts or
 
01:35:19.149 --> 01:35:19.159 align:start position:0%
Vermont than they do to an ATC I mean it
 
01:35:20.590 --> 01:35:20.600 align:start position:0%
it would it would be beneficial if we
 
01:35:23.189 --> 01:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
could get more access to more patients
 
01:35:27.149 --> 01:35:27.159 align:start position:0%
um I we addressed this issue in HB
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
639 uh in an attempt to create a fair
 
01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
transition that would not that would
 
01:35:37.030 --> 01:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
integrate the atc's in a fair way and
 
01:35:39.229 --> 01:35:39.239 align:start position:0%
allow plenty of room for new business uh
 
01:35:42.910 --> 01:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
the concept in HB 639 that we use which
 
01:35:44.350 --> 01:35:44.360 align:start position:0%
I'm just throwing out as a possible
 
01:35:47.229 --> 01:35:47.239 align:start position:0%
option to consider um it called a
 
01:35:50.350 --> 01:35:50.360 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis endorsement and any
 
01:35:53.550 --> 01:35:53.560 align:start position:0%
adult use retake ER that wanted
 
01:35:57.750 --> 01:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
to uh agree to go comply with the DHHS
 
01:36:00.229 --> 01:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
rules for dispensing patient education
 
01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
and support Etc they could apply for
 
01:36:04.870 --> 01:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
that therapeutic cannabis endorsement
 
01:36:07.109 --> 01:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
and be authorized to sell a registered
 
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
patients uh not otherwise now I think
 
01:36:12.070 --> 01:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
what what you're suggesting is is is a
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
model where any franchise store would be
 
01:36:16.629 --> 01:36:16.639 align:start position:0%
able to sell to patients and I think
 
01:36:18.629 --> 01:36:18.639 align:start position:0%
that would that would maximize access
 
01:36:21.830 --> 01:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
relative to the previous model I think
 
01:36:23.669 --> 01:36:23.679 align:start position:0%
the one concern you'll hear there and I
 
01:36:25.390 --> 01:36:25.400 align:start position:0%
think it's a concern that we can we
 
01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:28.159 align:start position:0%
could we could certainly address um is
 
01:36:30.390 --> 01:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
simply the education and support
 
01:36:33.590 --> 01:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
services um
 
01:36:36.109 --> 01:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
so ways that we could potentially do
 
01:36:38.270 --> 01:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
that our concern is that somebody who is
 
01:36:39.790 --> 01:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
battling a serious medical condition
 
01:36:42.669 --> 01:36:42.679 align:start position:0%
will walk into a franchise store and say
 
01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
I have cancer I need treatment for this
 
01:36:49.310 --> 01:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
and if they walk into the atcs and we'll
 
01:36:51.510 --> 01:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
get to this in our presentation and and
 
01:36:54.030 --> 01:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
Dr C can can tell you how we handle that
 
01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
when when people walk in and how we
 
01:36:59.350 --> 01:36:59.360 align:start position:0%
offer free we offer consultations we
 
01:37:02.109 --> 01:37:02.119 align:start position:0%
recommend that all patients do I I guess
 
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
I could just hit that very briefly uh at
 
01:37:07.070 --> 01:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
Gran Leaf we we we encourage all
 
01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
patients to do an initial
 
01:37:11.629 --> 01:37:11.639 align:start position:0%
consultation uh if the certifying
 
01:37:14.350 --> 01:37:14.360 align:start position:0%
medical provider provides guidance to
 
01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
the atc's regarding how to serve a
 
01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
specific patient we're actually required
 
01:37:22.430 --> 01:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
by rule to uh follow any instructions or
 
01:37:24.149 --> 01:37:24.159 align:start position:0%
recommendations provided by the
 
01:37:27.590 --> 01:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
qualifying patients certifying provider
 
01:37:29.390 --> 01:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
we're more than happy to cooperate with
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
them is the certified provider a doctor
 
01:37:36.430 --> 01:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
yes is a doctor an APRN or it could be a
 
01:37:38.189 --> 01:37:38.199 align:start position:0%
physician assistant operating under a
 
01:37:42.629 --> 01:37:42.639 align:start position:0%
doctor's supervision yes so in an Ideal
 
01:37:44.750 --> 01:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
World all medical professionals would be
 
01:37:46.510 --> 01:37:46.520 align:start position:0%
educated about cannabis and its
 
01:37:49.229 --> 01:37:49.239 align:start position:0%
potential therapeutic uses fortunately
 
01:37:51.790 --> 01:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
we don't live in that Ideal World uh the
 
01:37:53.950 --> 01:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
research has been incredibly limited
 
01:37:58.149 --> 01:37:58.159 align:start position:0%
since the 1930s until very recently and
 
01:38:01.910 --> 01:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
so the reality is most patients who come
 
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
to an ATC do not have specific
 
01:38:08.990 --> 01:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations from their provider so
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
the responsibility falls on the atcs to
 
01:38:13.629 --> 01:38:13.639 align:start position:0%
fill this void by providing education
 
01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
and support so we employ a grant leave
 
01:38:19.229 --> 01:38:19.239 align:start position:0%
two patient Educators one at each
 
01:38:21.750 --> 01:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
location uh one of our patient Educators
 
01:38:24.470 --> 01:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
is our education supervisor she's
 
01:38:26.709 --> 01:38:26.719 align:start position:0%
completed several educational courses
 
01:38:28.109 --> 01:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
including a course called medical
 
01:38:31.109 --> 01:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
cannabis education for medical providers
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
offered by the skag School of Pharmacy
 
01:38:35.350 --> 01:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
at University of Colorado and she's also
 
01:38:37.629 --> 01:38:37.639 align:start position:0%
a cancer survivor and very passionate
 
01:38:39.350 --> 01:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
about ensuring that our staff and the
 
01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
patients we serve are well in informed
 
01:38:44.709 --> 01:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
regarding the potential benefits and
 
01:38:47.470 --> 01:38:47.480 align:start position:0%
risks so some of our other staff have
 
01:38:49.430 --> 01:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
have completed educational courses as
 
01:38:52.470 --> 01:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
well our education super supervisor uh
 
01:38:54.589 --> 01:38:54.599 align:start position:0%
undertakes the task of ensuring that all
 
01:38:56.470 --> 01:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
of our staff are educated on at least
 
01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
some level and we really do have a
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
significant number of patients who want
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
many consultations they've never tried
 
01:39:09.950 --> 01:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
cannabis before they come in they they
 
01:39:13.070 --> 01:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
try it they try the first thing it it
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
works a little bit or may you know they
 
01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
come back again and they want to talk
 
01:39:18.629 --> 01:39:18.639 align:start position:0%
more and should I increase my dosage
 
01:39:21.189 --> 01:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
should I reduce it should should I try
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
different type of product we're willing
 
01:39:25.870 --> 01:39:25.880 align:start position:0%
to to talk to them as often as they want
 
01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
to talk to us we'll do that via phone
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
we'll do that via Zoom we'll do that via
 
01:39:32.910 --> 01:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
inperson meetings and it's an aspect of
 
01:39:35.830 --> 01:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
our mission that we take very seriously
 
01:39:38.669 --> 01:39:38.679 align:start position:0%
so we also offer classes for patients
 
01:39:40.189 --> 01:39:40.199 align:start position:0%
there have our fall education Series
 
01:39:42.750 --> 01:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
going on right now there's a class every
 
01:39:45.390 --> 01:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
other Thursday on Zoom uh we have a
 
01:39:47.669 --> 01:39:47.679 align:start position:0%
monthly support group and we maintain a
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
wide range of informational handouts uh
 
01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
both online and at the dispensaries so
 
01:39:57.149 --> 01:39:57.159 align:start position:0%
the question would be what happens when
 
01:40:00.270 --> 01:40:00.280 align:start position:0%
a patient uh who who comes in for the
 
01:40:02.310 --> 01:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
first time to a franchise store perhaps
 
01:40:04.229 --> 01:40:04.239 align:start position:0%
isn't registered and is asking medical
 
01:40:06.669 --> 01:40:06.679 align:start position:0%
type questions so one option could be
 
01:40:09.790 --> 01:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
that the atcs make themselves available
 
01:40:13.470 --> 01:40:13.480 align:start position:0%
and willing to uh yeah happy to take a
 
01:40:16.310 --> 01:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
question yeah thank you um as a
 
01:40:18.390 --> 01:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
certifying provider I I I know that
 
01:40:20.589 --> 01:40:20.599 align:start position:0%
patients uh give me feedback that the
 
01:40:22.870 --> 01:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
people the atcs are very knowledgeable
 
01:40:24.189 --> 01:40:24.199 align:start position:0%
um and have a lot of really helpful
 
01:40:25.990 --> 01:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
information so I I definitely can attest
 
01:40:28.950 --> 01:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
that patient's value that service um
 
01:40:30.870 --> 01:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
what I I think maybe what you were
 
01:40:32.629 --> 01:40:32.639 align:start position:0%
getting to and what I'm wondering is you
 
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
know if there is this collocation how
 
01:40:36.669 --> 01:40:36.679 align:start position:0%
would that work because I I agree I
 
01:40:38.270 --> 01:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
think that seems like an important
 
01:40:41.109 --> 01:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
component for patients who are uh
 
01:40:44.229 --> 01:40:44.239 align:start position:0%
certified uh for medical candidate how
 
01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
would you be able to continue to provide
 
01:40:48.750 --> 01:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
that service in this collocation with a
 
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
franchise I mean um if I mean both if it
 
01:40:54.629 --> 01:40:54.639 align:start position:0%
were a collocation and also sort of what
 
01:40:56.229 --> 01:40:56.239 align:start position:0%
the chairman was talking about if like
 
01:40:58.149 --> 01:40:58.159 align:start position:0%
it was more like providing your own
 
01:41:00.229 --> 01:41:00.239 align:start position:0%
product within a larger franchise system
 
01:41:02.589 --> 01:41:02.599 align:start position:0%
or selling your product without being a
 
01:41:04.589 --> 01:41:04.599 align:start position:0%
collocation okay so to clarify you're
 
01:41:06.870 --> 01:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
asking about our dispensary locations
 
01:41:09.109 --> 01:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
how would we be able to
 
01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
operate within I get within a FR
 
01:41:12.669 --> 01:41:12.679 align:start position:0%
franchise obviously I know how it
 
01:41:15.310 --> 01:41:15.320 align:start position:0%
happens now um but but how would that
 
01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
work both in the situation of a
 
01:41:19.870 --> 01:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
collocation as well as if the product
 
01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
was sold and sort of medically certified
 
01:41:24.510 --> 01:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
but without being a collocation of the
 
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
ATC how do you envision that would work
 
01:41:29.109 --> 01:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
yeah so I think in terms of of our
 
01:41:31.109 --> 01:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
dispensaries it would be pretty similar
 
01:41:34.750 --> 01:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
to how dual use uh Works in in lots of
 
01:41:36.629 --> 01:41:36.639 align:start position:0%
other states we would have separate
 
01:41:38.350 --> 01:41:38.360 align:start position:0%
counters or a separate section of the
 
01:41:40.750 --> 01:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
store that is for adult use and is
 
01:41:44.430 --> 01:41:44.440 align:start position:0%
branded that way uh we would have a a
 
01:41:47.030 --> 01:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
counter that's specifically for patients
 
01:41:49.189 --> 01:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
and we can and should adopt rules that
 
01:41:52.589 --> 01:41:52.599 align:start position:0%
require the atcs to prioritize patients
 
01:41:55.070 --> 01:41:55.080 align:start position:0%
if we have limited product we serve
 
01:41:58.350 --> 01:41:58.360 align:start position:0%
patients first if there's a line we make
 
01:42:01.270 --> 01:42:01.280 align:start position:0%
sure the patient line isn't long that
 
01:42:03.189 --> 01:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
people who are not patients can wait in
 
01:42:05.709 --> 01:42:05.719 align:start position:0%
line but patients should not be so I I
 
01:42:07.270 --> 01:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
think some of that language is already
 
01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
in the draft bill I think it was
 
01:42:11.629 --> 01:42:11.639 align:start position:0%
modified from HB 639 and previous bills
 
01:42:13.830 --> 01:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
and those are important principles to
 
01:42:16.350 --> 01:42:16.360 align:start position:0%
make sure we fully intend to continue
 
01:42:18.030 --> 01:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
serving patients to the best of our
 
01:42:20.189 --> 01:42:20.199 align:start position:0%
ability but we would like to see
 
01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
statutory language and rules that
 
01:42:25.510 --> 01:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
require us to do that in a reasonable
 
01:42:27.750 --> 01:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
manner as far as how would it work at
 
01:42:29.870 --> 01:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
other stores that's that's the question
 
01:42:31.790 --> 01:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
that I I think needs to be answered when
 
01:42:33.790 --> 01:42:33.800 align:start position:0%
somebody does need education and support
 
01:42:35.709 --> 01:42:35.719 align:start position:0%
and walks into a franchise store that is
 
01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
not an
 
01:42:39.870 --> 01:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
ATC who you going to call so one option
 
01:42:41.830 --> 01:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
would be to have the atc's participate
 
01:42:43.350 --> 01:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
in that we're happy to do these
 
01:42:45.669 --> 01:42:45.679 align:start position:0%
consultations again via phone and zoom
 
01:42:48.790 --> 01:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
so uh that's one option if some other
 
01:42:50.750 --> 01:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
entity could spring up and give gred
 
01:42:52.629 --> 01:42:52.639 align:start position:0%
advice to patients that would be
 
01:42:55.350 --> 01:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
wonderful um but we want to make sure
 
01:42:57.070 --> 01:42:57.080 align:start position:0%
that that does we don't create a void
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
there uh by sending patients with
 
01:43:01.870 --> 01:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
serious medical conditions to an adult
 
01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
use system without adequate support and
 
01:43:07.629 --> 01:43:07.639 align:start position:0%
and guidance does that make sense yeah
 
01:43:10.430 --> 01:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh the in terms of how this is
 
01:43:12.910 --> 01:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
functioned in other co-use locations in
 
01:43:15.750 --> 01:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
other states um I I sort of wonder about
 
01:43:17.189 --> 01:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
you know the different limitations that
 
01:43:19.470 --> 01:43:19.480 align:start position:0%
we place on adult use that I'm sure will
 
01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
happen and versus the ones that are much
 
01:43:24.390 --> 01:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh more generous for the medical use
 
01:43:26.669 --> 01:43:26.679 align:start position:0%
population like how has that worked in
 
01:43:29.149 --> 01:43:29.159 align:start position:0%
other states in terms of like having
 
01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
limited counter a be very different from
 
01:43:33.030 --> 01:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
limited counter B like that seems like
 
01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
that could be challenging I mean yeah I
 
01:43:37.070 --> 01:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
I mean it
 
01:43:40.629 --> 01:43:40.639 align:start position:0%
would let Brandon take this yeah I'll
 
01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
take this one um our team
 
01:43:46.910 --> 01:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
manages uh dispensaries in Massachusetts
 
01:43:48.589 --> 01:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
that have both medical and adult use
 
01:43:51.870 --> 01:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
operations in the same building um so
 
01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
essentially you have a couple of
 
01:43:56.109 --> 01:43:56.119 align:start position:0%
different ways to differentiate that
 
01:43:57.430 --> 01:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
first as Matt mentioned you have a
 
01:44:00.030 --> 01:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
separate separate line sometimes a
 
01:44:01.589 --> 01:44:01.599 align:start position:0%
separate entrance for patients so they
 
01:44:03.189 --> 01:44:03.199 align:start position:0%
go right up to a different sales counter
 
01:44:05.910 --> 01:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
where the staff there is trained uh to a
 
01:44:08.470 --> 01:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
higher level than your general retail
 
01:44:11.470 --> 01:44:11.480 align:start position:0%
staff um the main difference in products
 
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
are higher strength edible products um
 
01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
that are available to patients and those
 
01:44:18.870 --> 01:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
um are tracked in a separate electronic
 
01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:20.639 align:start position:0%
inventory control system and physically
 
01:44:22.589 --> 01:44:22.599 align:start position:0%
separated from the recreational
 
01:44:24.550 --> 01:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
inventory and then the other main
 
01:44:27.550 --> 01:44:27.560 align:start position:0%
difference is there's no no sales tax um
 
01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
on medical products but um you know
 
01:44:33.910 --> 01:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
essentially it's it's both physical and
 
01:44:36.589 --> 01:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
virtual separation of the inventory to
 
01:44:38.669 --> 01:44:38.679 align:start position:0%
to differentiate the products from the
 
01:44:41.310 --> 01:44:41.320 align:start position:0%
recreational side so I know there's been
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of concern that came up last or
 
01:44:46.189 --> 01:44:46.199 align:start position:0%
last session about you know how what the
 
01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
potential impact of adult use could be
 
01:44:50.550 --> 01:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
on the cost of medical cannabis product
 
01:44:53.870 --> 01:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
prods um would the sort of Maintenance
 
01:44:57.790 --> 01:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
of cost uh in this model be that you
 
01:44:59.910 --> 01:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
know if the atcs were involved in adult
 
01:45:01.950 --> 01:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
use franchising that that just helps
 
01:45:04.390 --> 01:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
keep the cost neutral and then the adult
 
01:45:07.109 --> 01:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
use products have likely a significant
 
01:45:09.149 --> 01:45:09.159 align:start position:0%
tax and then there's no ta like how are
 
01:45:10.589 --> 01:45:10.599 align:start position:0%
we because I know there was a lot of
 
01:45:12.070 --> 01:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
question Even in our minutes about
 
01:45:13.669 --> 01:45:13.679 align:start position:0%
saying like you know we're worried about
 
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
the cost but the cost is also lower so I
 
01:45:17.470 --> 01:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
mean can you guys address that yeah I
 
01:45:20.669 --> 01:45:20.679 align:start position:0%
mean Co cost will go down with adult use
 
01:45:23.830 --> 01:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
we can support um greater economies of
 
01:45:26.950 --> 01:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
scale on the manufacturing side um
 
01:45:28.270 --> 01:45:28.280 align:start position:0%
because we're making more products
 
01:45:29.510 --> 01:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
generally in those
 
01:45:32.390 --> 01:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
facilities so it you know we've seen
 
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
that in in all all the markets over time
 
01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
as pricing has gotten more competitive
 
01:45:39.550 --> 01:45:39.560 align:start position:0%
with more companies out there um and
 
01:45:42.270 --> 01:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
that flows through to therapeutic as
 
01:45:45.229 --> 01:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
well do you have any idea like based on
 
01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
what's in Massachusetts like what's that
 
01:45:48.270 --> 01:45:48.280 align:start position:0%
look like as it translates to the
 
01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:49.310 align:start position:0%
look like as it translates to the
patient

01:45:49.310 --> 01:45:49.320 align:start position:0%
patient
 
01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
cost uh we're we're down about
 
01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
50% uh at the counter than where we were
 
01:45:56.560 --> 01:45:57.510 align:start position:0%
50% uh at the counter than where we were
in

01:45:57.510 --> 01:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:46:00.589 --> 01:46:00.599 align:start position:0%
2018 when adult use sales
 
01:46:02.910 --> 01:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
started when you say down 50% you're
 
01:46:06.350 --> 01:46:06.360 align:start position:0%
talking about sales or amount of
 
01:46:09.030 --> 01:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
customers patients uh that was just the
 
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
the price that a customer would pay um
 
01:46:18.669 --> 01:46:18.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:21.510 --> 01:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
compression yeah patience
 
01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
yep Mr
 
01:46:27.629 --> 01:46:27.639 align:start position:0%
chairman kale thank you Mr chairman so H
 
01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
how many of these um experts that are
 
01:46:33.149 --> 01:46:33.159 align:start position:0%
doing the talking to people at at your
 
01:46:35.790 --> 01:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
locations are
 
01:46:38.350 --> 01:46:38.360 align:start position:0%
doctors well I'll introduce you to Dr
 
01:46:40.990 --> 01:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
Davids well is he at the location yeah
 
01:46:43.550 --> 01:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm actually you know on site seeing
 
01:46:45.870 --> 01:46:45.880 align:start position:0%
patients interviewing patients and um
 
01:46:47.470 --> 01:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
I've been doing that since the day we
 
01:46:49.310 --> 01:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
opened and well I'm talking about all
 
01:46:50.709 --> 01:46:50.719 align:start position:0%
these all these stores OB obviously you
 
01:46:52.750 --> 01:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
can't be at every school so how how how
 
01:46:54.430 --> 01:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
many of your employees that are actually
 
01:46:57.189 --> 01:46:57.199 align:start position:0%
giving information about medical
 
01:47:00.430 --> 01:47:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:03.189 --> 01:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
doctors I can answer that I guess so the
 
01:47:05.589 --> 01:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
answer is um the answer is none at our
 
01:47:09.070 --> 01:47:09.080 align:start position:0%
at our location um at a at our Peak
 
01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
Point um when we had one facility in
 
01:47:13.390 --> 01:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
marac um and we hadn't opened in Chai
 
01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
Chester yet we had three full-time
 
01:47:18.070 --> 01:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
individuals each performing consults
 
01:47:20.589 --> 01:47:20.599 align:start position:0%
about six seven a day one an hour
 
01:47:22.470 --> 01:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
essentially where we give give patients
 
01:47:25.709 --> 01:47:25.719 align:start position:0%
that time um that was almost 10% of our
 
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
entire staff devoted just for that it
 
01:47:30.550 --> 01:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
would be absolutely unaffordable in that
 
01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
scale and providing that quantity of
 
01:47:35.310 --> 01:47:35.320 align:start position:0%
service to pay a physician to do it that
 
01:47:36.830 --> 01:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
would drastically have increased our
 
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
costs if you know 10% of our staff were
 
01:47:40.870 --> 01:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
positions making that that kind of a
 
01:47:42.589 --> 01:47:42.599 align:start position:0%
salary you know I I understand that
 
01:47:44.510 --> 01:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
increaseing cost my question would be
 
01:47:46.149 --> 01:47:46.159 align:start position:0%
maybe to the AG's office is there a
 
01:47:48.510 --> 01:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
liability in the State Franchise model
 
01:47:50.030 --> 01:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
if if we have people giving medical
 
01:47:55.030 --> 01:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:57.270 --> 01:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
doctors can I can I ask for
 
01:48:01.310 --> 01:48:01.320 align:start position:0%
clarification and do younger did I say
 
01:48:03.990 --> 01:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
correctly you may chime in this too I so
 
01:48:08.189 --> 01:48:08.199 align:start position:0%
I heard if testimony correctly that if a
 
01:48:11.310 --> 01:48:11.320 align:start position:0%
doctor makes a recommendation to a
 
01:48:14.030 --> 01:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
patient and is is a patient I guess the
 
01:48:16.430 --> 01:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate term in for the
 
01:48:19.070 --> 01:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
therapeutic all right it so the doctor
 
01:48:21.589 --> 01:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
makes the recommendation the atc's are
 
01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
required to follow the recommendation of
 
01:48:26.830 --> 01:48:26.840 align:start position:0%
that doctor so correct how does number
 
01:48:29.870 --> 01:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
one how does the ATC know what the
 
01:48:32.629 --> 01:48:32.639 align:start position:0%
doctor's recommendation is when that
 
01:48:34.430 --> 01:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
patient comes inside the store then the
 
01:48:37.390 --> 01:48:37.400 align:start position:0%
other side of that is um I was under the
 
01:48:38.669 --> 01:48:38.679 align:start position:0%
impression that the
 
01:48:41.070 --> 01:48:41.080 align:start position:0%
doctors aren't necessarily able to make
 
01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
that recommendation under the because of
 
01:48:44.990 --> 01:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
the federal law which is another thing
 
01:48:47.669 --> 01:48:47.679 align:start position:0%
our federal delegation perhaps should uh
 
01:48:49.790 --> 01:48:49.800 align:start position:0%
address but yeah I mean I mean I think
 
01:48:51.830 --> 01:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
that when we're counseling patients at
 
01:48:53.189 --> 01:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
least when I'm counseling patients we
 
01:48:55.310 --> 01:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
definitely talk about you know the
 
01:48:56.990 --> 01:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
federal you know that it's federally
 
01:48:58.589 --> 01:48:58.599 align:start position:0%
illegal that there are certainly you
 
01:49:00.950 --> 01:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
know jobs in which you at least in the
 
01:49:03.189 --> 01:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
current state that you can be you know
 
01:49:04.870 --> 01:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
let go from if you're test positive for
 
01:49:07.510 --> 01:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis all the sort of legality of it
 
01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
all and I think we can give General
 
01:49:11.790 --> 01:49:11.800 align:start position:0%
recommendations but also you know it's a
 
01:49:12.990 --> 01:49:13.000 align:start position:0%
challenge like we were mentioning
 
01:49:15.589 --> 01:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
earlier that um I've never been to an
 
01:49:17.550 --> 01:49:17.560 align:start position:0%
ATC I can't go into an ATC so it it
 
01:49:18.750 --> 01:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
makes it you know I'd say these are the
 
01:49:20.830 --> 01:49:20.840 align:start position:0%
type of products that you know I other
 
01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
patients have found helpful you know the
 
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
literature supports you know this CBD
 
01:49:28.350 --> 01:49:28.360 align:start position:0%
versus THC ratio um but but I also don't
 
01:49:30.070 --> 01:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
know how that information would get to
 
01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:32.159 align:start position:0%
you except for I tell the patient the
 
01:49:35.109 --> 01:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
patient tells you um my my understanding
 
01:49:36.950 --> 01:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
is the patient's not taking their notes
 
01:49:39.030 --> 01:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh it's not in writing right it's not
 
01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
like it's not like written down write
 
01:49:43.109 --> 01:49:43.119 align:start position:0%
something down yeah it it doesn't help
 
01:49:44.790 --> 01:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
happen a lot but what the patient will
 
01:49:46.830 --> 01:49:46.840 align:start position:0%
come in with a a written form from their
 
01:49:50.950 --> 01:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
doctor stating you know please provide
 
01:49:54.030 --> 01:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
low THC High CBD products for this
 
01:49:56.910 --> 01:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
patient um sometimes you know they'll
 
01:49:59.910 --> 01:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
mention uh lowd dose Edibles versus high
 
01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
dose Edibles that you know they're just
 
01:50:03.149 --> 01:50:03.159 align:start position:0%
concerned of the patient having a bad
 
01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
reaction particularly if they're new to
 
01:50:06.870 --> 01:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis so but it doesn't happen a
 
01:50:09.790 --> 01:50:09.800 align:start position:0%
lot say low what is that's that's vague
 
01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
I mean it should say it's an amount and
 
01:50:14.270 --> 01:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
when someone says low a doctor said
 
01:50:16.189 --> 01:50:16.199 align:start position:0%
writes it down yeah the doctor on this
 
01:50:17.669 --> 01:50:17.679 align:start position:0%
commission but different doctor writes
 
01:50:19.750 --> 01:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
it down yeah but I mean you can't expect
 
01:50:21.470 --> 01:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
the position that's not really versed in
 
01:50:23.390 --> 01:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
the endocannabinoid system to understand
 
01:50:24.589 --> 01:50:24.599 align:start position:0%
like what's the difference between 5
 
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
milligrams of CBD and 10 milligrams of
 
01:50:27.510 --> 01:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
CBD well they're making the
 
01:50:29.310 --> 01:50:29.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation yeah but that's why they
 
01:50:31.229 --> 01:50:31.239 align:start position:0%
say low dose or high dose you know I and
 
01:50:32.830 --> 01:50:32.840 align:start position:0%
then that's up to the discretion of the
 
01:50:35.109 --> 01:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
dispensaries to you know kind of tease
 
01:50:37.350 --> 01:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
that out well if a doctor's recommending
 
01:50:39.310 --> 01:50:39.320 align:start position:0%
someone do something I assume that the
 
01:50:41.390 --> 01:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
doctor did their research I think that's
 
01:50:44.109 --> 01:50:44.119 align:start position:0%
a fair M it would be malpractice
 
01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise absolutely so a doctor's
 
01:50:47.430 --> 01:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
making a recommendation they have low
 
01:50:51.390 --> 01:50:51.400 align:start position:0%
THC I'm just asking if someone comes in
 
01:50:53.709 --> 01:50:53.719 align:start position:0%
with that written down what is the you
 
01:50:55.870 --> 01:50:55.880 align:start position:0%
what do you consider low THD to me I'd
 
01:50:57.750 --> 01:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
say anything under five milligrams you
 
01:50:59.910 --> 01:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
know we have we have even 1.5 milligram
 
01:51:01.750 --> 01:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
mint THC so we could start something off
 
01:51:04.270 --> 01:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
with that just say do one mint twice a
 
01:51:05.229 --> 01:51:05.239 align:start position:0%
day you're not going to get any
 
01:51:06.870 --> 01:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
psychoactivity from that amount but it
 
01:51:08.270 --> 01:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
might help with inflammation help with
 
01:51:10.229 --> 01:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
pain you know so we'll start from there
 
01:51:11.550 --> 01:51:11.560 align:start position:0%
and then like Matt said a lot of times
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
they'll come back and if it was if it
 
01:51:14.350 --> 01:51:14.360 align:start position:0%
was helpful they'll say hey that was
 
01:51:16.550 --> 01:51:16.560 align:start position:0%
really helpful if they need more pain
 
01:51:18.589 --> 01:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
control we can up it a little bit and
 
01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
tell them okay or or give them a Sal or
 
01:51:22.390 --> 01:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
a cream that's non- psychoactive but
 
01:51:24.350 --> 01:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
isn't that against what the doctor may
 
01:51:26.470 --> 01:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
have recommended well I think the
 
01:51:28.589 --> 01:51:28.599 align:start position:0%
doctor's initial recommendation you do
 
01:51:30.510 --> 01:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
start with that and then you build from
 
01:51:33.149 --> 01:51:33.159 align:start position:0%
there based upon medical knowledge and I
 
01:51:34.189 --> 01:51:34.199 align:start position:0%
thought you had to follow the doctor's
 
01:51:36.030 --> 01:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation so how would you bu you
 
01:51:38.069 --> 01:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
can't build on that and I I guess what
 
01:51:40.589 --> 01:51:40.599 align:start position:0%
do you do when it's not in R you just
 
01:51:42.669 --> 01:51:42.679 align:start position:0%
rely on what the patient says well also
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
we they do sign a waiver the patients do
 
01:51:46.629 --> 01:51:46.639 align:start position:0%
send a waiver letting us talk to their
 
01:51:48.830 --> 01:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
doctor so I've actually called the
 
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
doctor's office a few times times and
 
01:51:52.870 --> 01:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
said you know Mrs Jones we started her
 
01:51:54.950 --> 01:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
off with 5 milligram of THC and 10
 
01:51:58.069 --> 01:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
milligrams of CBD um she's getting some
 
01:52:00.870 --> 01:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
relief but is it okay if we up the THC a
 
01:52:02.310 --> 01:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
little bit because THC really is good
 
01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
for pain control CBD is good for anxiety
 
01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
a little bit an inflammatory for pain
 
01:52:09.950 --> 01:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
but um so we I we will call the doctor's
 
01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
office like I said it doesn't happen a
 
01:52:13.069 --> 01:52:13.079 align:start position:0%
lot it's just it's just the nature of
 
01:52:14.430 --> 01:52:14.440 align:start position:0%
the game like you said there a lot of
 
01:52:15.669 --> 01:52:15.679 align:start position:0%
the Physicians areen educated on
 
01:52:18.990 --> 01:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis and I guess so that
 
01:52:20.750 --> 01:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
conversation happens behind the scenes I
 
01:52:23.229 --> 01:52:23.239 align:start position:0%
understand it's Hipp it's private so
 
01:52:26.990 --> 01:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
it's not I suppose from a regulatory
 
01:52:29.069 --> 01:52:29.079 align:start position:0%
perspective how would our friends in
 
01:52:31.350 --> 01:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
liquor ever know a doctor may have
 
01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
recommended X and the atc's doing y I'm
 
01:52:36.030 --> 01:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
not saying you're doing that I'm just
 
01:52:39.350 --> 01:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
saying in theory if you want them to
 
01:52:41.270 --> 01:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
violate the law no none of you have not
 
01:52:43.629 --> 01:52:43.639 align:start position:0%
of course no one would do that but how
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
do they ever enforce
 
01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
that or how would they ever
 
01:52:53.149 --> 01:52:53.159 align:start position:0%
know that's a good point currently with
 
01:52:55.550 --> 01:52:55.560 align:start position:0%
only So currently with only three
 
01:52:57.550 --> 01:52:57.560 align:start position:0%
dispensaries we have a fax line we keep
 
01:52:59.589 --> 01:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
open and our contact info is available
 
01:53:02.310 --> 01:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
on the DHHS website we get calls from
 
01:53:04.669 --> 01:53:04.679 align:start position:0%
the Physicians or providers or we get
 
01:53:07.030 --> 01:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
emails or faxes in which case we reach
 
01:53:09.229 --> 01:53:09.239 align:start position:0%
out and have that conversation it's not
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
super common but we absolutely have it
 
01:53:16.030 --> 01:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
happen but I guess if you let's say the
 
01:53:19.310 --> 01:53:19.320 align:start position:0%
doctor recommended low THC but person
 
01:53:21.629 --> 01:53:21.639 align:start position:0%
working at the register decide to oh you
 
01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
want the higher th stuff
 
01:53:26.470 --> 01:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
sure how would how would that
 
01:53:28.910 --> 01:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
everle specific recommendation we're
 
01:53:30.629 --> 01:53:30.639 align:start position:0%
required to follow it some of the
 
01:53:32.550 --> 01:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations may not be specific
 
01:53:36.149 --> 01:53:36.159 align:start position:0%
enough but could could have a Pati
 
01:53:39.390 --> 01:53:39.400 align:start position:0%
Gateway where you loog Massachusetts you
 
01:53:40.910 --> 01:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
have to log in the gateway to make sure
 
01:53:43.589 --> 01:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
they're registered patients and you
 
01:53:45.750 --> 01:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
could have notes in there just like any
 
01:53:48.030 --> 01:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
other medical system where this is the
 
01:53:50.430 --> 01:53:50.440 align:start position:0%
provider's notes um
 
01:53:52.030 --> 01:53:52.040 align:start position:0%
do a doctor would a doctor be
 
01:53:53.870 --> 01:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
comfortable being entered into that
 
01:53:56.470 --> 01:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
database I mean it's it's going like my
 
01:53:58.270 --> 01:53:58.280 align:start position:0%
name's on every paper that I send when I
 
01:54:00.149 --> 01:54:00.159 align:start position:0%
certify someone anyway so it's already
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
there but I I would say you know talking
 
01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
about sort of the legality and medical
 
01:54:07.589 --> 01:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
malpractice I mean I think s most people
 
01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
who are at least even in my clinic I
 
01:54:11.589 --> 01:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
think are not making a recommendation
 
01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
they're saying you meet the state
 
01:54:15.790 --> 01:54:15.800 align:start position:0%
criteria for medical cannabis I don't
 
01:54:18.310 --> 01:54:18.320 align:start position:0%
see any contraindications so you're not
 
01:54:20.870 --> 01:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
you know having some sort of acute
 
01:54:22.950 --> 01:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
psychiatric episode you're not actively
 
01:54:25.109 --> 01:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
abusing other drugs um and that's all
 
01:54:26.310 --> 01:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
they're saying they're not making a
 
01:54:27.390 --> 01:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation at all because they're
 
01:54:28.830 --> 01:54:28.840 align:start position:0%
not recommending that therapy they're
 
01:54:31.350 --> 01:54:31.360 align:start position:0%
just saying you meet the criteria I'll
 
01:54:33.990 --> 01:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
sign this paper and so when we do
 
01:54:35.109 --> 01:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
recommendation the only thing I think
 
01:54:36.990 --> 01:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
that's a challenge with with what what's
 
01:54:38.310 --> 01:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
being said here is that that is
 
01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
requiring that the patient takes what I
 
01:54:43.910 --> 01:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
say and brings it to you uh which I you
 
01:54:46.270 --> 01:54:46.280 align:start position:0%
know is is a is a challenge right
 
01:54:47.709 --> 01:54:47.719 align:start position:0%
because I could be recommending things
 
01:54:49.069 --> 01:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
all day long and unless they print that
 
01:54:50.589 --> 01:54:50.599 align:start position:0%
note out or take whatever I've given
 
01:54:53.830 --> 01:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
them to you that never happens um and I
 
01:54:55.510 --> 01:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
don't really know workaround for that
 
01:54:57.470 --> 01:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
with HIPPA and some of these other
 
01:54:59.910 --> 01:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
challenges so if a patient just walks in
 
01:55:02.270 --> 01:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
off the street with no paper from any
 
01:55:04.990 --> 01:55:05.000 align:start position:0%
doctor but they have the therapeutic
 
01:55:07.550 --> 01:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
card what's the policy of each each of
 
01:55:09.350 --> 01:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
the atcs when it comes to selling a
 
01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:10.750 align:start position:0%
the atcs when it comes to selling a
therapeutic

01:55:10.750 --> 01:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
therapeutic
 
01:55:13.790 --> 01:55:13.800 align:start position:0%
product well we encourage them to sign
 
01:55:16.550 --> 01:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
up for a consultation and discuss
 
01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
options with them uh but they are
 
01:55:22.350 --> 01:55:22.360 align:start position:0%
legally authorized to purchase products
 
01:55:25.310 --> 01:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
so they may do so so even so that a
 
01:55:26.709 --> 01:55:26.719 align:start position:0%
patient that doesn't get any
 
01:55:28.589 --> 01:55:28.599 align:start position:0%
consultation there's no information from
 
01:55:30.990 --> 01:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
the doctor they still can purchase the
 
01:55:32.990 --> 01:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
product without the benefit
 
01:55:34.990 --> 01:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
of I mean you can do that in pharmacy
 
01:55:37.109 --> 01:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
now you can decline consultation too I
 
01:55:38.709 --> 01:55:38.719 align:start position:0%
think there's a reality to the fact that
 
01:55:40.270 --> 01:55:40.280 align:start position:0%
some patients have been using cannabis
 
01:55:42.310 --> 01:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
medically for longer than it has been
 
01:55:45.069 --> 01:55:45.079 align:start position:0%
legal and other patients have been
 
01:55:46.750 --> 01:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
participating in programs in other
 
01:55:48.350 --> 01:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
states and have moved to New Hampshire
 
01:55:49.709 --> 01:55:49.719 align:start position:0%
they already know what works for them
 
01:55:52.069 --> 01:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
them the concern is for people who are
 
01:55:54.910 --> 01:55:54.920 align:start position:0%
new to therapeutic cannabis uh and it's
 
01:55:56.470 --> 01:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
analogous to the concern of what about
 
01:55:58.790 --> 01:55:58.800 align:start position:0%
people who are new to cannabis generally
 
01:56:00.350 --> 01:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
and and I don't mean to I'm not giving
 
01:56:02.030 --> 01:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
anyone a hard time I just one thing that
 
01:56:04.510 --> 01:56:04.520 align:start position:0%
that's required me to support any policy
 
01:56:06.310 --> 01:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
is that whatever rules that are there
 
01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
are enforc it can reasonably be enforced
 
01:56:11.550 --> 01:56:11.560 align:start position:0%
so one of the concerns I have is the
 
01:56:14.270 --> 01:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement side of that especially if
 
01:56:17.149 --> 01:56:17.159 align:start position:0%
if it was moved under liquor so I'm not
 
01:56:18.990 --> 01:56:19.000 align:start position:0%
saying anyone's doing wrong it's just in
 
01:56:21.229 --> 01:56:21.239 align:start position:0%
theory as this industry
 
01:56:23.750 --> 01:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
grows it increases the probability of
 
01:56:25.709 --> 01:56:25.719 align:start position:0%
having a bad actor yeah well it seems to
 
01:56:28.709 --> 01:56:28.719 align:start position:0%
me that in any scenario of of the
 
01:56:30.870 --> 01:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
franchise store is selling to registered
 
01:56:32.310 --> 01:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
patients at minimum they're going to
 
01:56:34.030 --> 01:56:34.040 align:start position:0%
have to be able to verify that the
 
01:56:36.149 --> 01:56:36.159 align:start position:0%
individual is a registered patient so
 
01:56:37.069 --> 01:56:37.079 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to be able to
 
01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
access the registry the card alone is I
 
01:56:43.750 --> 01:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
mean we have to check and make sure
 
01:56:45.629 --> 01:56:45.639 align:start position:0%
they're actually in the system that card
 
01:56:48.430 --> 01:56:48.440 align:start position:0%
may have been revoked so I mentioned the
 
01:56:52.669 --> 01:56:52.679 align:start position:0%
idea of possibility of crime selling
 
01:56:55.270 --> 01:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
their product or allowing it to be sold
 
01:56:58.709 --> 01:56:58.719 align:start position:0%
at other stores that you know other
 
01:57:00.669 --> 01:57:00.679 align:start position:0%
retail stores basically still following
 
01:57:02.790 --> 01:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
all the regulations you know for
 
01:57:06.550 --> 01:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
therapeutic use in that case would you
 
01:57:08.149 --> 01:57:08.159 align:start position:0%
would it be appropriate maybe to have
 
01:57:10.149 --> 01:57:10.159 align:start position:0%
perhaps in that agreement what you would
 
01:57:13.790 --> 01:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
require any vendor or franchise to to
 
01:57:15.189 --> 01:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
follow to sell your product I mean is
 
01:57:16.589 --> 01:57:16.599 align:start position:0%
that something that could be done
 
01:57:18.950 --> 01:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
without the need I guess for laws or
 
01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:21.790 align:start position:0%
without the need I guess for laws or
regulation

01:57:21.790 --> 01:57:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:24.189 --> 01:57:24.199 align:start position:0%
I'll leave for anyone yeah to the you
 
01:57:25.510 --> 01:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
can have a
 
01:57:28.109 --> 01:57:28.119 align:start position:0%
contract that stipulates a certain level
 
01:57:31.990 --> 01:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
of education for staff at that store um
 
01:57:34.069 --> 01:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
you can provide them educational
 
01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
materials when you deliver the products
 
01:57:40.629 --> 01:57:40.639 align:start position:0%
um if you're not the regulator you can't
 
01:57:43.430 --> 01:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
actually audit them but certainly you
 
01:57:45.390 --> 01:57:45.400 align:start position:0%
can put some guard rails in place that
 
01:57:46.830 --> 01:57:46.840 align:start position:0%
you know good business people would
 
01:57:49.709 --> 01:57:49.719 align:start position:0%
follow and and on a cultivation question
 
01:57:52.229 --> 01:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
question uh I assume all all three of
 
01:57:54.709 --> 01:57:54.719 align:start position:0%
the ATC businesses I know there's more
 
01:57:57.510 --> 01:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
stores but each of each of those
 
01:57:59.950 --> 01:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
entities are cultivating correct yeah
 
01:58:03.350 --> 01:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
yeah now would would these entities each
 
01:58:04.790 --> 01:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
be able to increase the amount that
 
01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:06.310 align:start position:0%
be able to increase the amount that
they're

01:58:06.310 --> 01:58:06.320 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:58:08.950 --> 01:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
cultivating so yeah I I think we could
 
01:58:11.149 --> 01:58:11.159 align:start position:0%
certainly expand assuming there's a a
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
clear path for lure under adult use
 
01:58:17.189 --> 01:58:17.199 align:start position:0%
because it's a multi-year um process to
 
01:58:19.750 --> 01:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
design and construct more space so right
 
01:58:21.709 --> 01:58:21.719 align:start position:0%
now the cultivation for therapeutic but
 
01:58:24.109 --> 01:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
could you increase the amount of
 
01:58:26.470 --> 01:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
cultivation to have so Prime doesn't
 
01:58:28.950 --> 01:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
have any recreational brand yet but it
 
01:58:31.709 --> 01:58:31.719 align:start position:0%
could have it could perhaps make a
 
01:58:33.709 --> 01:58:33.719 align:start position:0%
recreational product as well and
 
01:58:34.910 --> 01:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
increase that and that could be
 
01:58:37.750 --> 01:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
distributed throughout any franchise
 
01:58:42.669 --> 01:58:42.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:42.679 --> 01:58:48.310 align:start position:0%
 
y

01:58:48.310 --> 01:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:52.109 --> 01:58:52.119 align:start position:0%
y thanks um another question that I have
 
01:58:54.910 --> 01:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
is as you know there's more access
 
01:58:57.350 --> 01:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
potentially for patients and with
 
01:59:01.149 --> 01:59:01.159 align:start position:0%
different limits and potency um you know
 
01:59:02.830 --> 01:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
I think right now geographically things
 
01:59:05.189 --> 01:59:05.199 align:start position:0%
are pretty separate and so it's less
 
01:59:08.109 --> 01:59:08.119 align:start position:0%
convenient let's say for X patient to go
 
01:59:10.950 --> 01:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
to this ATC and then to go to another
 
01:59:13.709 --> 01:59:13.719 align:start position:0%
ATC but as that changed obviously I
 
01:59:15.149 --> 01:59:15.159 align:start position:0%
don't want to think anybody is diverting
 
01:59:18.030 --> 01:59:18.040 align:start position:0%
their medication however um I think that
 
01:59:20.350 --> 01:59:20.360 align:start position:0%
there would likely be some Market uh for
 
01:59:24.870 --> 01:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
a higher potency um product um and so is
 
01:59:27.270 --> 01:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
there anything currently in place or
 
01:59:28.669 --> 01:59:28.679 align:start position:0%
what is the potential for something to
 
01:59:30.709 --> 01:59:30.719 align:start position:0%
be in place to say if you know this
 
01:59:32.750 --> 01:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
person goes to this place with their
 
01:59:35.950 --> 01:59:35.960 align:start position:0%
medical card and gets x amount of
 
01:59:38.390 --> 01:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis at this like higher potency to
 
01:59:41.229 --> 01:59:41.239 align:start position:0%
go you know now 15 or 20 minutes down
 
01:59:43.870 --> 01:59:43.880 align:start position:0%
the road to the next place and and get
 
01:59:45.910 --> 01:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
the same is there anything to right now
 
01:59:48.109 --> 01:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
to stop
 
01:59:50.950 --> 01:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
that yeah anyone take that so yes there
 
01:59:52.550 --> 01:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
currently is something in place to stop
 
01:59:55.430 --> 01:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
that um basically the patient records
 
01:59:57.510 --> 01:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
are securely shared with the Department
 
01:59:59.310 --> 01:59:59.320 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services who
 
02:00:01.350 --> 02:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
monitors and basically looks at what was
 
02:00:03.790 --> 02:00:03.800 align:start position:0%
dispensed and um essentially if a
 
02:00:05.990 --> 02:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
patient is being is purchasing more than
 
02:00:07.950 --> 02:00:07.960 align:start position:0%
two ounces in a 10day period which is
 
02:00:09.830 --> 02:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
the current limit um they are sent a
 
02:00:11.430 --> 02:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
warning letter if they do it again they
 
02:00:12.589 --> 02:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
lose their
 
02:00:15.069 --> 02:00:15.079 align:start position:0%
card so they basically lose the right to
 
02:00:17.109 --> 02:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
purchase and be a New Hampshire patient
 
02:00:19.669 --> 02:00:19.679 align:start position:0%
if they are exceeding that limit so but
 
02:00:21.350 --> 02:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
that's not monitored at the ATC level
 
02:00:23.350 --> 02:00:23.360 align:start position:0%
that's monitored at the HSS level so we
 
02:00:25.510 --> 02:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
monitor it separately but we cannot see
 
02:00:27.950 --> 02:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
what's dispensed by other atcs that is
 
02:00:29.990 --> 02:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
something that could be integrated into
 
02:00:32.669 --> 02:00:32.679 align:start position:0%
a larger system but is a bit
 
02:00:34.510 --> 02:00:34.520 align:start position:0%
exorbitantly expensive at the scale of
 
02:00:37.030 --> 02:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
only having three Stores um one thing
 
02:00:39.149 --> 02:00:39.159 align:start position:0%
I'll point out is that with legal states
 
02:00:41.629 --> 02:00:41.639 align:start position:0%
all around us any adult who wants to go
 
02:00:43.470 --> 02:00:43.480 align:start position:0%
buy cannabis in quantity can go from
 
02:00:45.149 --> 02:00:45.159 align:start position:0%
store to store and do so there's
 
02:00:46.550 --> 02:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing stopping them from
 
02:00:49.109 --> 02:00:49.119 align:start position:0%
doing that today right but the but the
 
02:00:50.510 --> 02:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
potency is very different right like
 
02:00:52.510 --> 02:00:52.520 align:start position:0%
what the legal the legal limit for what
 
02:00:55.350 --> 02:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
you're able to purchase for at an ATC
 
02:00:57.709 --> 02:00:57.719 align:start position:0%
Now versus what we proposed potentially
 
02:00:59.229 --> 02:00:59.239 align:start position:0%
would be available for adult use is not
 
02:01:01.189 --> 02:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
the same correct for edible products
 
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so normally it's for edible
 
02:01:05.910 --> 02:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
products um if I may in the sense that
 
02:01:07.870 --> 02:01:07.880 align:start position:0%
um with an edible products they're often
 
02:01:10.430 --> 02:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
limited to say five milligrams a dose
 
02:01:12.790 --> 02:01:12.800 align:start position:0%
but someone could eat multiple of those
 
02:01:15.470 --> 02:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
doses to get the same overall dosage is
 
02:01:17.950 --> 02:01:17.960 align:start position:0%
is kind of a normal thing for inhalable
 
02:01:20.350 --> 02:01:20.360 align:start position:0%
products like like flour or vape
 
02:01:21.750 --> 02:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
cartridges those are generally not
 
02:01:23.350 --> 02:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
limited in any of the states around us
 
02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:25.550 align:start position:0%
limited in any of the states around us
for

02:01:25.550 --> 02:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:01:28.990 --> 02:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
potency Chief thank you Mr chair uh
 
02:01:30.990 --> 02:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony a few
 
02:01:34.229 --> 02:01:34.239 align:start position:0%
questions uh is it uh fair to say that
 
02:01:36.390 --> 02:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
based on your testimony that in the
 
02:01:39.950 --> 02:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
states that have legalized uh the retail
 
02:01:44.149 --> 02:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
sale of cannabis products that the um
 
02:01:46.990 --> 02:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
revenue or is it the total number of
 
02:01:49.149 --> 02:01:49.159 align:start position:0%
patients has diminished I think you you
 
02:01:53.229 --> 02:01:53.239 align:start position:0%
cited in Massachusetts by 50% um is that
 
02:01:56.229 --> 02:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
accurate or can you provide some
 
02:01:59.510 --> 02:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
clarifying information about that so the
 
02:02:02.149 --> 02:02:02.159 align:start position:0%
50% that Mr poock referenced was a
 
02:02:05.629 --> 02:02:05.639 align:start position:0%
decrease in price uh not patients or
 
02:02:09.149 --> 02:02:09.159 align:start position:0%
sales so we actually have uh Dan Smith
 
02:02:11.310 --> 02:02:11.320 align:start position:0%
behind us and this may be an appropriate
 
02:02:14.030 --> 02:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
time for him to briefly present the data
 
02:02:16.390 --> 02:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
in his report which speaks directly to
 
02:02:18.550 --> 02:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
your question of the decline in patient
 
02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:19.830 align:start position:0%
your question of the decline in patient
registration

02:02:19.830 --> 02:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
registration
 
02:02:22.990 --> 02:02:23.000 align:start position:0%
the decline in medical program sales and
 
02:02:24.629 --> 02:02:24.639 align:start position:0%
how states have generally dealt with
 
02:02:27.350 --> 02:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
that so would that be acceptable well I
 
02:02:28.870 --> 02:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
I would appreciate I think we have that
 
02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
in written testimony perhaps in U in the
 
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
era of efficiency of time we can we can
 
02:02:37.870 --> 02:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
read that but generally is it fair to
 
02:02:40.830 --> 02:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
say that there's been a diminishment of
 
02:02:44.510 --> 02:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
registration and sales uh in some cases
 
02:02:46.430 --> 02:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
significant in states that have
 
02:02:48.510 --> 02:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
legalized retail sale of cannabis would
 
02:02:51.270 --> 02:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
that be fair to say that's correct okay
 
02:02:54.870 --> 02:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank you uh follow-up question now um
 
02:02:58.790 --> 02:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
in states where cannabis has been
 
02:03:01.350 --> 02:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
legalized uh
 
02:03:06.390 --> 02:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
some recent research suggests that the
 
02:03:11.830 --> 02:03:11.840 align:start position:0%
menu of products being sold by atc's in
 
02:03:16.870 --> 02:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
those States mimic um and duplicate the
 
02:03:20.149 --> 02:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
same products being sold in the retail
 
02:03:23.109 --> 02:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
outlets would that be fair to say some
 
02:03:26.629 --> 02:03:26.639 align:start position:0%
products are the same in medical and
 
02:03:28.750 --> 02:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
adult use systems other products are
 
02:03:31.109 --> 02:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
more unique to therapeutic
 
02:03:33.709 --> 02:03:33.719 align:start position:0%
systems but is it fair to say that uh in
 
02:03:35.669 --> 02:03:35.679 align:start position:0%
many cases the products are actually
 
02:03:37.550 --> 02:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
duplicate the same name same product
 
02:03:41.629 --> 02:03:41.639 align:start position:0%
numbers same contents sold in retail uh
 
02:03:45.830 --> 02:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the same product same menu
 
02:03:48.189 --> 02:03:48.199 align:start position:0%
um with the same name sold
 
02:03:49.629 --> 02:03:49.639 align:start position:0%
therapeutically would that be fair to
 
02:03:54.629 --> 02:03:54.639 align:start position:0%
say that's correct okay um can you offer
 
02:03:56.669 --> 02:03:56.679 align:start position:0%
uh an an and I think I may know the
 
02:03:59.629 --> 02:03:59.639 align:start position:0%
answer but I I'll ask you can you offer
 
02:04:03.229 --> 02:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
a an explanation as to why New Hampshire
 
02:04:05.870 --> 02:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
therapeutic products are significantly
 
02:04:08.310 --> 02:04:08.320 align:start position:0%
more expensive than those sold in Maine
 
02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:10.549 align:start position:0%
more expensive than those sold in Maine
or

02:04:10.549 --> 02:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:04:13.589 --> 02:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts yes so in Maine first of
 
02:04:16.669 --> 02:04:16.679 align:start position:0%
all uh there is much less regulation of
 
02:04:19.589 --> 02:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis in Maine they've had
 
02:04:20.910 --> 02:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
the law since
 
02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
1999 uh every caregiver was allowed to
 
02:04:28.069 --> 02:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
grow six plants for up to five patients
 
02:04:29.350 --> 02:04:29.360 align:start position:0%
and if you're patient yourself that
 
02:04:32.750 --> 02:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
meant that you could grow 36 plants uh
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
several years ago the caregivers got
 
02:04:36.750 --> 02:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
organized and fought for their right to
 
02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:37.870 align:start position:0%
organized and fought for their right to
open

02:04:37.870 --> 02:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
open
 
02:04:39.910 --> 02:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
storefronts very different than our New
 
02:04:41.790 --> 02:04:41.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire system it led to a
 
02:04:45.149 --> 02:04:45.159 align:start position:0%
proliferation of storefronts in Maine uh
 
02:04:47.149 --> 02:04:47.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of people do not realize that
 
02:04:49.229 --> 02:04:49.239 align:start position:0%
those storefronts sell cannabis that is
 
02:04:51.549 --> 02:04:51.559 align:start position:0%
not required to be independently lab
 
02:04:56.030 --> 02:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
tested so it is a risk I think that is
 
02:04:57.910 --> 02:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
not well known or understood and it's
 
02:05:00.310 --> 02:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
only recently being reported as the main
 
02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
office of cannabis policy attempts to
 
02:05:05.750 --> 02:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
get that regulation through the
 
02:05:08.189 --> 02:05:08.199 align:start position:0%
legislature and we hope they succeed
 
02:05:10.910 --> 02:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
because the health risks associated with
 
02:05:13.709 --> 02:05:13.719 align:start position:0%
mold pesticides heavy metals being
 
02:05:16.750 --> 02:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
present in cannabis are real risks it's
 
02:05:18.430 --> 02:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
an important reason to legalize in our
 
02:05:20.589 --> 02:05:20.599 align:start position:0%
opinion for adult use as well as medical
 
02:05:22.189 --> 02:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
use to make sure that all of these
 
02:05:25.109 --> 02:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
products do not contain contaminants
 
02:05:27.390 --> 02:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
that would be harmful to patients or to
 
02:05:31.470 --> 02:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
Consumers so uh the regulatory burdens
 
02:05:33.310 --> 02:05:33.320 align:start position:0%
complying with complex regulations in
 
02:05:35.030 --> 02:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for example I mean in New
 
02:05:37.589 --> 02:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we can't uh grow outdoors or
 
02:05:39.390 --> 02:05:39.400 align:start position:0%
even in green houses under our current
 
02:05:41.629 --> 02:05:41.639 align:start position:0%
rules all all the plants have to be
 
02:05:44.629 --> 02:05:44.639 align:start position:0%
grown indoors under the lights and that
 
02:05:46.910 --> 02:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
is the most expensive way to grow
 
02:05:49.270 --> 02:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis we could produce it somewhat
 
02:05:51.189 --> 02:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
more cheaply if we could grow outdoors
 
02:05:55.069 --> 02:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
or in green houses uh every every Rule
 
02:05:57.109 --> 02:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
and regulation adds a little bit of cost
 
02:05:59.310 --> 02:05:59.320 align:start position:0%
here and there so we're not claiming
 
02:06:01.310 --> 02:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
that they're unreasonable but relative
 
02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
to what Maine is dealing with um yeah
 
02:06:06.910 --> 02:06:06.920 align:start position:0%
very different and in Massachusetts
 
02:06:09.030 --> 02:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
they've you know very different but
 
02:06:13.470 --> 02:06:13.480 align:start position:0%
they've Chief uh I I've operated medical
 
02:06:16.069 --> 02:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
uh in Massachusetts since 2015 we are
 
02:06:19.790 --> 02:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
highly regulated in Massachusetts but um
 
02:06:22.910 --> 02:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
in large part due to expanding the
 
02:06:25.910 --> 02:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
business with recreational sales we are
 
02:06:28.990 --> 02:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
able to realize significant efficiencies
 
02:06:30.709 --> 02:06:30.719 align:start position:0%
and therefore decrease our cost
 
02:06:34.549 --> 02:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
structure and pass that cost along to uh
 
02:06:36.109 --> 02:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
the medical
 
02:06:39.109 --> 02:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
patients thank you so uh is it fair to
 
02:06:41.149 --> 02:06:41.159 align:start position:0%
say then based on your uh recent
 
02:06:44.109 --> 02:06:44.119 align:start position:0%
response that you were in favor of a
 
02:06:47.430 --> 02:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
more regulated program in which uh
 
02:06:51.589 --> 02:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
testing uh um of cannabis products uh is
 
02:06:53.510 --> 02:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
in place to ensure Public Health would
 
02:06:56.589 --> 02:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
that be fair to say absolutely okay so
 
02:06:58.549 --> 02:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
currently what is the testing protocols
 
02:07:01.390 --> 02:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
that you use uh and it may be very
 
02:07:04.149 --> 02:07:04.159 align:start position:0%
lengthy so I I in the interest of
 
02:07:06.350 --> 02:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
efficiency for the commission perhaps
 
02:07:09.310 --> 02:07:09.320 align:start position:0%
you can provide um the Commission in a
 
02:07:12.229 --> 02:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
printed form what the testing protocol
 
02:07:14.310 --> 02:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
is but do you have a testing protocol to
 
02:07:18.790 --> 02:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
test for uh a an established number of
 
02:07:22.390 --> 02:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
chemicals diluents um and pesticides and
 
02:07:25.109 --> 02:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
so forth yes those have been determined
 
02:07:26.870 --> 02:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
by rule by the Department of Health and
 
02:07:29.549 --> 02:07:29.559 align:start position:0%
Human Services all of our products every
 
02:07:33.990 --> 02:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
batch has to be tested uh we test for
 
02:07:36.709 --> 02:07:36.719 align:start position:0%
the cannabinoid content uh the tarpine
 
02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
content those are both displayed on on
 
02:07:41.910 --> 02:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
the labels and on the menus and we also
 
02:07:44.149 --> 02:07:44.159 align:start position:0%
test for all of the contaminants that
 
02:07:47.390 --> 02:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
are required to test for by rule and the
 
02:07:49.870 --> 02:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
limits are prescribed by Rule Do you
 
02:07:52.229 --> 02:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
happen to know which testing facility is
 
02:07:55.270 --> 02:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
used uh for this sampling yeah there's
 
02:07:57.270 --> 02:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
only one lab in New Hampshire currently
 
02:07:59.189 --> 02:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
providing that
 
02:08:02.750 --> 02:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
service thank you and um has there ever
 
02:08:06.510 --> 02:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
been to your knowledge uh any rejection
 
02:08:10.390 --> 02:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
of any batch or sample as a result of uh
 
02:08:13.549 --> 02:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
testing that produced a result positive
 
02:08:16.830 --> 02:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
for any of the listed contaminants or
 
02:08:20.270 --> 02:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
pesticides oh yes uh mold in particular
 
02:08:21.910 --> 02:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
uh when you're growing an Agricultural
 
02:08:24.990 --> 02:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
Product and curing it and processing it
 
02:08:28.510 --> 02:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
indoors mold is your enemy and there are
 
02:08:30.030 --> 02:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
of it's probably the most common
 
02:08:32.990 --> 02:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
contaminant you will find in unregulated
 
02:08:38.189 --> 02:08:38.199 align:start position:0%
cannabis uh so yes we mold mold a batch
 
02:08:41.549 --> 02:08:41.559 align:start position:0%
will get rejected for mold and that is
 
02:08:41.559 --> 02:08:42.830 align:start position:0%
will get rejected for mold and that is
part

02:08:42.830 --> 02:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
part
 
02:08:44.910 --> 02:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
of what
 
02:08:49.189 --> 02:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
happens are you aware of uh generally uh
 
02:08:51.870 --> 02:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
the number of batches or samples um
 
02:08:53.629 --> 02:08:53.639 align:start position:0%
perhaps in a year that have been
 
02:08:58.549 --> 02:08:58.559 align:start position:0%
rejected I have no idea okay 10%
 
02:09:03.830 --> 02:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
10% okay thank you um now one couple
 
02:09:08.510 --> 02:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
final uh questions um with respect to uh
 
02:09:09.990 --> 02:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
adherence to
 
02:09:14.229 --> 02:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
DHHS rules and regulations for patients
 
02:09:18.390 --> 02:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
and as it was previously mentioned uh op
 
02:09:21.270 --> 02:09:21.280 align:start position:0%
opportunities to circumvent as the chair
 
02:09:24.310 --> 02:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
indicated um those rules and regulations
 
02:09:28.189 --> 02:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
do you uh know how many times if any uh
 
02:09:30.270 --> 02:09:30.280 align:start position:0%
any of the your companies have
 
02:09:32.470 --> 02:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
self-reported any of these issues to
 
02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:38.830 --> 02:09:38.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the labs actually send a
 
02:09:41.510 --> 02:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
report the lab Nelson analytical sends
 
02:09:43.430 --> 02:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
the lab report directly to the state so
 
02:09:45.470 --> 02:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
they have a copy of that so there's no
 
02:09:47.629 --> 02:09:47.639 align:start position:0%
way we can somehow fudge results or
 
02:09:49.549 --> 02:09:49.559 align:start position:0%
alter results so the state gets their
 
02:09:52.950 --> 02:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
own separate copy um and then you know
 
02:09:55.109 --> 02:09:55.119 align:start position:0%
we we'll we'll we'll pull that that
 
02:09:57.229 --> 02:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
batch if necessary based upon like Matt
 
02:09:59.910 --> 02:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
said mold or if there's any chance of
 
02:10:01.189 --> 02:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
heavy metals or something like that
 
02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
which is rare but usually like Matt said
 
02:10:05.669 --> 02:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
it's usually mold and it's about 8 to
 
02:10:08.149 --> 02:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
10% yes thank you um I I've actually
 
02:10:10.830 --> 02:10:10.840 align:start position:0%
switched rails here a little bit I'm uh
 
02:10:13.750 --> 02:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
focusing on um patients and
 
02:10:17.109 --> 02:10:17.119 align:start position:0%
circumvention of DHS rules with respect
 
02:10:18.910 --> 02:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
to patients as I think there was
 
02:10:21.510 --> 02:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
previous testimony by you or a member of
 
02:10:24.750 --> 02:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
your group regarding the fact that your
 
02:10:27.910 --> 02:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
company's report to DHHS when you
 
02:10:29.990 --> 02:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
suspect that there is a patient that is
 
02:10:32.830 --> 02:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
trying to circumvent the rules
 
02:10:35.750 --> 02:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
correct do you happen to have a record
 
02:10:38.790 --> 02:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
of how many of those self-reports were
 
02:10:41.470 --> 02:10:41.480 align:start position:0%
made uh Chief we happy to follow up with
 
02:10:43.830 --> 02:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
the commission on that it does happen I
 
02:10:46.390 --> 02:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
was copied on one a couple weeks ago
 
02:10:48.030 --> 02:10:48.040 align:start position:0%
does happen thank you I think it would
 
02:10:50.189 --> 02:10:50.199 align:start position:0%
be important for the commission to to
 
02:10:53.709 --> 02:10:53.719 align:start position:0%
see generally um what that frequency may
 
02:10:55.950 --> 02:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
be thank you and one one final question
 
02:10:58.589 --> 02:10:58.599 align:start position:0%
are are you aware uh or any of you aware
 
02:11:01.950 --> 02:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
of a recent study of chronic pain uh and
 
02:11:03.950 --> 02:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
association with cannabis legislation
 
02:11:06.709 --> 02:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
that deals with uh patients in the US
 
02:11:09.270 --> 02:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
veterans and health administration that
 
02:11:11.750 --> 02:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
shows between 2005 and
 
02:11:14.549 --> 02:11:14.559 align:start position:0%
2019 that reflects a significant
 
02:11:17.950 --> 02:11:17.960 align:start position:0%
comorbidity with cannabis use disorder
 
02:11:19.830 --> 02:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
and and legalization are you aware of
 
02:11:22.030 --> 02:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
that recent
 
02:11:26.470 --> 02:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
study off hand I am not thank you I ask
 
02:11:29.669 --> 02:11:29.679 align:start position:0%
a question I I think I hope we're all in
 
02:11:31.790 --> 02:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
agreement with you support Recon not
 
02:11:33.669 --> 02:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
that we don't want the black market to
 
02:11:36.390 --> 02:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
grow right now I one thing I noticed in
 
02:11:38.669 --> 02:11:38.679 align:start position:0%
every single state that has gone down
 
02:11:41.109 --> 02:11:41.119 align:start position:0%
this path they the Black Market has
 
02:11:44.430 --> 02:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
grown now one of the reasons for that is
 
02:11:46.950 --> 02:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
well they tend to make the same mistake
 
02:11:49.549 --> 02:11:49.559 align:start position:0%
over and over again so I don't sure it's
 
02:11:52.629 --> 02:11:52.639 align:start position:0%
as surprising also allocating of
 
02:11:54.990 --> 02:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
resources I think one thing we'll have a
 
02:11:57.549 --> 02:11:57.559 align:start position:0%
benefit of is liquor enforcement well
 
02:11:59.149 --> 02:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
we'll have a law enforcement agency on
 
02:12:01.990 --> 02:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
day one that will have a directive to
 
02:12:05.149 --> 02:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
actually address Black Market issues but
 
02:12:07.430 --> 02:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
in this it's not a bill number this
 
02:12:09.510 --> 02:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
working model that I know I know you
 
02:12:12.270 --> 02:12:12.280 align:start position:0%
guys have a copy of it we're trying to
 
02:12:14.229 --> 02:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
reduce that or mitigate the black market
 
02:12:16.830 --> 02:12:16.840 align:start position:0%
problem as much as we can is there
 
02:12:19.270 --> 02:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
anything in here do you think
 
02:12:21.709 --> 02:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
uh that should be changed in respect to
 
02:12:23.109 --> 02:12:23.119 align:start position:0%
that I mean I think limiting the amount
 
02:12:24.270 --> 02:12:24.280 align:start position:0%
of stores
 
02:12:26.350 --> 02:12:26.360 align:start position:0%
obviously what helps the black market
 
02:12:27.229 --> 02:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
issue because you don't have an
 
02:12:29.310 --> 02:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
oversaturated Market keeping the price
 
02:12:30.990 --> 02:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
low is there anything that you would
 
02:12:33.149 --> 02:12:33.159 align:start position:0%
recommend that we could add to this
 
02:12:37.350 --> 02:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps to help mitigate a black
 
02:12:39.830 --> 02:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
market now I think we all agree with
 
02:12:41.350 --> 02:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
that goal I think that's the most
 
02:12:43.990 --> 02:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
important policy goal associated with
 
02:12:46.189 --> 02:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
adult use legalization is to displace
 
02:12:49.229 --> 02:12:49.239 align:start position:0%
the illicit market and transition to uh
 
02:12:53.030 --> 02:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
effectively regulated market so the the
 
02:12:55.750 --> 02:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
tax or fee burden whatever it is called
 
02:12:59.870 --> 02:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
is part of that uh a licensing process
 
02:13:03.189 --> 02:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
that that moves efficiently uh you know
 
02:13:05.149 --> 02:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
the ability the sooner businesses can
 
02:13:07.189 --> 02:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
get licensed and start growing and start
 
02:13:09.470 --> 02:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
selling cannabis the sooner we can start
 
02:13:11.350 --> 02:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
transitioning people away from the
 
02:13:13.189 --> 02:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
regulated market so I think some people
 
02:13:16.470 --> 02:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
will look at the 24mon timeline and and
 
02:13:19.109 --> 02:13:19.119 align:start position:0%
say that that that is
 
02:13:22.149 --> 02:13:22.159 align:start position:0%
you know not going to be a way to get um
 
02:13:24.189 --> 02:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
that might be counter to the idea of
 
02:13:26.109 --> 02:13:26.119 align:start position:0%
eliminating the unregulated market
 
02:13:27.470 --> 02:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
quickly of course that's a policy
 
02:13:31.109 --> 02:13:31.119 align:start position:0%
decision for for you all to make um I
 
02:13:33.549 --> 02:13:33.559 align:start position:0%
will comment briefly on the idea that
 
02:13:35.750 --> 02:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
the elicit Market has proliferated in in
 
02:13:38.109 --> 02:13:38.119 align:start position:0%
States uh that have legalized adult use
 
02:13:41.149 --> 02:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
cannabis so it's true in one sense and
 
02:13:44.310 --> 02:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
it's not true in another sense uh stands
 
02:13:46.270 --> 02:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
to reason that when Colorado became the
 
02:13:48.629 --> 02:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
first state to legalize cannabis
 
02:13:52.549 --> 02:13:52.559 align:start position:0%
that some individuals decided to buy oh
 
02:13:54.030 --> 02:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis is legal here that means I can
 
02:13:57.629 --> 02:13:57.639 align:start position:0%
buy a house and grow 500 plants in it
 
02:13:59.750 --> 02:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
and sell them uh ship them to New
 
02:14:02.589 --> 02:14:02.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and sell it uh the evidence
 
02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly suggests that consumers
 
02:14:07.109 --> 02:14:07.119 align:start position:0%
in states that legalize adult use
 
02:14:09.350 --> 02:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
cannabis if there is a dispensary near
 
02:14:11.709 --> 02:14:11.719 align:start position:0%
them they will buy from the dispensary
 
02:14:14.350 --> 02:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
uh and if there is a regulated market in
 
02:14:16.350 --> 02:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
their state that works the regulated
 
02:14:17.950 --> 02:14:17.960 align:start position:0%
market will get most of the business
 
02:14:20.310 --> 02:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
business hom grow is one factor in that
 
02:14:22.109 --> 02:14:22.119 align:start position:0%
some people just grow their own and
 
02:14:23.750 --> 02:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
don't go to a store or buy from the
 
02:14:26.229 --> 02:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
illicit Market uh
 
02:14:29.270 --> 02:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
but what primarily is happening when we
 
02:14:30.910 --> 02:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
hear the the the illicit markets
 
02:14:33.910 --> 02:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
expanding it's criminal actors are
 
02:14:35.310 --> 02:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
taking or using the cover of
 
02:14:37.430 --> 02:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
legalization to produce cannabis in a
 
02:14:39.430 --> 02:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
state and Export it to states where
 
02:14:42.189 --> 02:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
cannabis is not yet legal so with every
 
02:14:45.069 --> 02:14:45.079 align:start position:0%
state that brings online a a a regulated
 
02:14:47.470 --> 02:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
market I think that problem becomes less
 
02:14:49.430 --> 02:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
of a problem because the more states
 
02:14:52.030 --> 02:14:52.040 align:start position:0%
that have their own retail markets it is
 
02:14:55.270 --> 02:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
no longer lucrative to ship cannabis
 
02:14:57.189 --> 02:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
from Colorado to New Hampshire if New
 
02:15:00.149 --> 02:15:00.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has its its own stores but is
 
02:15:02.229 --> 02:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
there any recommendation that you have
 
02:15:04.870 --> 02:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
any of you have specifically on how to
 
02:15:07.629 --> 02:15:07.639 align:start position:0%
mitigate a black market from it's it's
 
02:15:09.910 --> 02:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
already here right but it's the
 
02:15:12.310 --> 02:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
expansion of it is really what is the
 
02:15:14.470 --> 02:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
biggest concern that I have yeah so I
 
02:15:16.709 --> 02:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
think you know the cost structures
 
02:15:18.790 --> 02:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
imposed on a business directly impact
 
02:15:20.709 --> 02:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
pricing to customers Black Market
 
02:15:24.830 --> 02:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't have uh fees or taxes um so I
 
02:15:26.709 --> 02:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
think the lower the cost burden on
 
02:15:28.270 --> 02:15:28.280 align:start position:0%
businesses the lower the price will be
 
02:15:30.350 --> 02:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
to customers and the less incentive a
 
02:15:32.149 --> 02:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
customer would have to go to the black
 
02:15:35.350 --> 02:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
market um I I would argue you know you
 
02:15:37.350 --> 02:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
look at a state like Vermont or
 
02:15:39.750 --> 02:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or Maine all that Revenue
 
02:15:42.030 --> 02:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
that's in the program that is revenue
 
02:15:43.589 --> 02:15:43.599 align:start position:0%
that would have been in the black market
 
02:15:46.229 --> 02:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
so you are taking out some of that
 
02:15:48.310 --> 02:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
Revenue um
 
02:15:52.069 --> 02:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
so I I don't see New Hampshire being a
 
02:15:54.350 --> 02:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
exporting cannabis State that's you know
 
02:15:58.069 --> 02:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma California right now um so I
 
02:16:01.109 --> 02:16:01.119 align:start position:0%
think PR price you know things that
 
02:16:02.870 --> 02:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
drive cost and then price are going to
 
02:16:06.189 --> 02:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
be the biggest factors the state can uh
 
02:16:09.430 --> 02:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
consider for reducing the lcit market
 
02:16:10.950 --> 02:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
let me clarify my my concern I'm
 
02:16:12.510 --> 02:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about the black market in New
 
02:16:14.669 --> 02:16:14.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire all right the other states
 
02:16:16.589 --> 02:16:16.599 align:start position:0%
that's up to their law enforcement to
 
02:16:18.790 --> 02:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
deal with that y because when you say
 
02:16:20.709 --> 02:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
you don't want us to be I don't know
 
02:16:23.870 --> 02:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
exporting is the right term but yeah a
 
02:16:25.589 --> 02:16:25.599 align:start position:0%
high percentage of our liquor sales are
 
02:16:27.870 --> 02:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
to outut ofate Residents I don't I think
 
02:16:30.390 --> 02:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
under the right model you can mimic that
 
02:16:33.910 --> 02:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
with cannabis yes so I wouldn't say
 
02:16:35.549 --> 02:16:35.559 align:start position:0%
because someone's a consumer is buying
 
02:16:38.750 --> 02:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
in bulk necessarily means you're
 
02:16:41.150 --> 02:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
supporting a black market correct yeah
 
02:16:42.870 --> 02:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
but I guess my my concern is I want to
 
02:16:45.349 --> 02:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
make sure that you don't have that
 
02:16:48.429 --> 02:16:48.439 align:start position:0%
problem grow so just lowering the
 
02:16:49.950 --> 02:16:49.960 align:start position:0%
the franchise fee I guess is the only
 
02:16:52.910 --> 02:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
thing I'm hearing which I I I get that
 
02:16:55.070 --> 02:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
but franchise fees and Licensing fees
 
02:16:58.349 --> 02:16:58.359 align:start position:0%
will directly impact the cost that a
 
02:17:00.230 --> 02:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
business has and thus the price that
 
02:17:04.910 --> 02:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
they charge and the the primary reason a
 
02:17:07.549 --> 02:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
person purchases not in a regulated
 
02:17:11.509 --> 02:17:11.519 align:start position:0%
system is because of price um
 
02:17:14.389 --> 02:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
that's yeah so my next question is
 
02:17:19.309 --> 02:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
probably not not a great question uh
 
02:17:20.950 --> 02:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
this is my this is my last question for
 
02:17:25.190 --> 02:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
a while promise so I I see on on the
 
02:17:28.150 --> 02:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
last page there was a suggestion that
 
02:17:30.509 --> 02:17:30.519 align:start position:0%
the the uh therapeutic products be
 
02:17:33.709 --> 02:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
exempt from the 15% franchise
 
02:17:36.990 --> 02:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
fee correct which I I understand right
 
02:17:38.589 --> 02:17:38.599 align:start position:0%
now it's not subject to that right but
 
02:17:40.709 --> 02:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
if let's say it was that the therapeutic
 
02:17:42.509 --> 02:17:42.519 align:start position:0%
product was subject to that franchise
 
02:17:42.519 --> 02:17:45.190 align:start position:0%
product was subject to that franchise
feed

02:17:45.190 --> 02:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
feed
 
02:17:47.389 --> 02:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
um what other type of Revenue do you
 
02:17:50.230 --> 02:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
think that the atcs would gain in this
 
02:17:51.709 --> 02:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
under the retail model because I think
 
02:17:53.709 --> 02:17:53.719 align:start position:0%
obviously the retail sales will help you
 
02:17:55.629 --> 02:17:55.639 align:start position:0%
the Freer Market you have the C
 
02:17:56.910 --> 02:17:56.920 align:start position:0%
increased cultivation and more
 
02:17:59.589 --> 02:17:59.599 align:start position:0%
distribution spots so would it be fair
 
02:18:01.230 --> 02:18:01.240 align:start position:0%
to still have that
 
02:18:05.190 --> 02:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
15% it's it's more our view is that for
 
02:18:07.349 --> 02:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
medical products generally there's not
 
02:18:09.669 --> 02:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
extra fees or taxes so these are sick
 
02:18:13.270 --> 02:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
people and it's very common in in
 
02:18:14.790 --> 02:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
cannabis to the extent that that is
 
02:18:16.190 --> 02:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
important for the commission to
 
02:18:18.429 --> 02:18:18.439 align:start position:0%
understand that medical
 
02:18:20.549 --> 02:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
products you know taxes are what are
 
02:18:23.509 --> 02:18:23.519 align:start position:0%
used in other states are not taxed um
 
02:18:26.230 --> 02:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
whether it's cannabis or pharmaceutical
 
02:18:28.309 --> 02:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
drugs at the pharmacy I guess my my
 
02:18:29.830 --> 02:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
point is there's a lot of benefits to
 
02:18:33.110 --> 02:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
the ATC industry in this working model
 
02:18:34.990 --> 02:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
right being now for-profit as opposed to
 
02:18:38.110 --> 02:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
a nonprofit more distribution points
 
02:18:41.589 --> 02:18:41.599 align:start position:0%
more cultivation Revenue uh this
 
02:18:44.389 --> 02:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
obviously retail sales why would the
 
02:18:47.509 --> 02:18:47.519 align:start position:0%
15% for therapeutic sales be a problem
 
02:18:49.549 --> 02:18:49.559 align:start position:0%
just asking right it it would not be a
 
02:18:50.830 --> 02:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
problem for our business this was a
 
02:18:52.830 --> 02:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
suggestion especially if therapeutic
 
02:18:54.509 --> 02:18:54.519 align:start position:0%
products are sold at all franchise
 
02:18:56.509 --> 02:18:56.519 align:start position:0%
stores that those products should be
 
02:19:00.669 --> 02:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:00.679 --> 02:19:02.469 align:start position:0%
 
fuse

02:19:02.469 --> 02:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
fuse
 
02:19:05.190 --> 02:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr chair thank you Vice
 
02:19:08.429 --> 02:19:08.439 align:start position:0%
chairman you know U the senator was just
 
02:19:09.950 --> 02:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
asking how you you thought you could
 
02:19:12.270 --> 02:19:12.280 align:start position:0%
bring down costs don't don't you think
 
02:19:14.589 --> 02:19:14.599 align:start position:0%
maybe lobbying for like um energy
 
02:19:16.110 --> 02:19:16.120 align:start position:0%
Independence would bring down costs
 
02:19:18.750 --> 02:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
isn't energy your production phase like
 
02:19:20.190 --> 02:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
one of your biggest costs that gets
 
02:19:23.429 --> 02:19:23.439 align:start position:0%
passed on to the tax or the the
 
02:19:26.150 --> 02:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
patients yes I mean I mean that that'd
 
02:19:27.870 --> 02:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
be one way you guys could suggest we
 
02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
lower cost like yeah as we mentioned we
 
02:19:32.190 --> 02:19:32.200 align:start position:0%
would like to be able to grow outdoors
 
02:19:34.429 --> 02:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
and in green houses and uh there is an
 
02:19:36.429 --> 02:19:36.439 align:start position:0%
LSR for a bill that that would allow
 
02:19:41.190 --> 02:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:44.469 --> 02:19:44.479 align:start position:0%
that represent okay I'll be quick all
 
02:19:47.790 --> 02:19:47.800 align:start position:0%
right great Pati okay so you know I like
 
02:19:51.790 --> 02:19:51.800 align:start position:0%
to tell stories and uh so one of our big
 
02:19:54.910 --> 02:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
issues here in New Hampshire is uh we
 
02:19:57.150 --> 02:19:57.160 align:start position:0%
would have on any given day someone will
 
02:19:59.550 --> 02:19:59.560 align:start position:0%
walk into our liquor store and say why
 
02:20:03.429 --> 02:20:03.439 align:start position:0%
don't you sell beer here where's the
 
02:20:06.190 --> 02:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
beer and we had made that decision to
 
02:20:07.990 --> 02:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
bifurcate that
 
02:20:10.469 --> 02:20:10.479 align:start position:0%
industry I believe they made it and I
 
02:20:14.510 --> 02:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't in the room back in 1933 but I
 
02:20:17.429 --> 02:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
think they made that decision uh because
 
02:20:19.750 --> 02:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
they knew that distill was a much higher
 
02:20:21.910 --> 02:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
alcohol content had a higher and needed
 
02:20:23.750 --> 02:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
to be well
 
02:20:26.590 --> 02:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
regulated and I say this in that you
 
02:20:29.590 --> 02:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
have absolutely convinced me
 
02:20:33.349 --> 02:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly that you provide a very
 
02:20:36.030 --> 02:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
important service to our
 
02:20:39.349 --> 02:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
constituents okay um that having uh
 
02:20:42.389 --> 02:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
someone to consult with and really
 
02:20:44.230 --> 02:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
understand what they should be buying
 
02:20:47.429 --> 02:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
makes absolutely perfect sense to me
 
02:20:50.429 --> 02:20:50.439 align:start position:0%
okay what doesn't make sense to me is to
 
02:20:54.630 --> 02:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
try to blend that into our liquor stores
 
02:20:58.510 --> 02:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
slm marijuana stores right that we would
 
02:21:01.389 --> 02:21:01.399 align:start position:0%
never we would always say no you got to
 
02:21:05.389 --> 02:21:05.399 align:start position:0%
go to a professional for that our
 
02:21:08.030 --> 02:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
marijuana stores our
 
02:21:11.670 --> 02:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
franchises would be barred from giving
 
02:21:15.030 --> 02:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
any medical advice they cannot mention
 
02:21:16.230 --> 02:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
anything about
 
02:21:20.830 --> 02:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
medicine so to have a handful or maybe
 
02:21:24.230 --> 02:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
all of them have a separate quarter
 
02:21:27.670 --> 02:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
separate window separate thing that um
 
02:21:29.910 --> 02:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
that now all of a sudden there are set
 
02:21:32.990 --> 02:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
different rules like it's not tax but
 
02:21:35.670 --> 02:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
it's maybe more regulated in other ways
 
02:21:38.830 --> 02:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know that would create conflict
 
02:21:41.469 --> 02:21:41.479 align:start position:0%
within the stores that would can create
 
02:21:44.230 --> 02:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
incredible confusion it would be what do
 
02:21:46.230 --> 02:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
you mean you don't sell Medical in this
 
02:21:46.240 --> 02:21:47.750 align:start position:0%
you mean you don't sell Medical in this
store

02:21:47.750 --> 02:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
store
 
02:21:51.230 --> 02:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
dead the other one I went to dead okay
 
02:21:54.429 --> 02:21:54.439 align:start position:0%
that's exactly why we do not sell beer
 
02:21:56.990 --> 02:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
in liquor stores we don't want to create
 
02:21:59.590 --> 02:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
anyone conv we want consistency
 
02:22:01.910 --> 02:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
consistency of the product consistency
 
02:22:03.190 --> 02:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:22:06.710 --> 02:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
advice okay so as far as I'm concerned
 
02:22:09.190 --> 02:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
right now you guys play a very important
 
02:22:10.830 --> 02:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
part in the marketplace because there
 
02:22:13.429 --> 02:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
are consumers who are not going to want
 
02:22:17.230 --> 02:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
to walk into an adult store retail store
 
02:22:19.230 --> 02:22:19.240 align:start position:0%
they want to walk into a place that is
 
02:22:22.910 --> 02:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
going to give them good medical
 
02:22:26.870 --> 02:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
advice and so therefore in my mind how
 
02:22:28.990 --> 02:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
do you merge those how do you how can
 
02:22:34.150 --> 02:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
you have some have it and some not when
 
02:22:37.230 --> 02:22:37.240 align:start position:0%
right now you what you have now in this
 
02:22:40.670 --> 02:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
current model you pay no
 
02:22:43.750 --> 02:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
tax and there's no way we're going to
 
02:22:47.309 --> 02:22:47.319 align:start position:0%
have inside a marijuana store oh a
 
02:22:49.030 --> 02:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
separate window this this is that's a
 
02:22:49.040 --> 02:22:50.230 align:start position:0%
separate window this this is that's a
tax-free

02:22:50.230 --> 02:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
tax-free
 
02:22:53.389 --> 02:22:53.399 align:start position:0%
window but you got to go do this no that
 
02:22:55.790 --> 02:22:55.800 align:start position:0%
is the last thing we want to do to our
 
02:22:58.429 --> 02:22:58.439 align:start position:0%
consumers is to create that confusion
 
02:23:04.670 --> 02:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:07.710 --> 02:23:07.720 align:start position:0%
believe so um I I think the feedback I'd
 
02:23:08.750 --> 02:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
provide to that because I understand
 
02:23:10.910 --> 02:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
where you're coming from um Senator Hunt
 
02:23:13.510 --> 02:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
is sorry representative is um
 
02:23:17.150 --> 02:23:17.160 align:start position:0%
basically um in that scenario in in a
 
02:23:18.429 --> 02:23:18.439 align:start position:0%
situation where we're selling to
 
02:23:20.750 --> 02:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
therapeutic patients if it's generally
 
02:23:22.790 --> 02:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
the same products being sold and we're
 
02:23:24.550 --> 02:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
spending extra money on the educational
 
02:23:27.630 --> 02:23:27.640 align:start position:0%
services that is a cost but if there is
 
02:23:29.309 --> 02:23:29.319 align:start position:0%
if they're sold for the same price
 
02:23:31.309 --> 02:23:31.319 align:start position:0%
because it costs the same to produce and
 
02:23:34.230 --> 02:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
there's the same tax on it why would
 
02:23:36.230 --> 02:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
sign up TA you have no tax right now
 
02:23:37.950 --> 02:23:37.960 align:start position:0%
well currently we pay for the program
 
02:23:40.429 --> 02:23:40.439 align:start position:0%
the general fund doesn't fund it so we
 
02:23:43.349 --> 02:23:43.359 align:start position:0%
pay any extra costs required to regulate
 
02:23:46.309 --> 02:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
to regulate us this is the licensing so
 
02:23:48.309 --> 02:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
as as far as any extra cost that the
 
02:23:51.590 --> 02:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program and would
 
02:23:54.110 --> 02:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
would actually take on we pay anything
 
02:23:56.110 --> 02:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
extra they requireed to run their office
 
02:23:58.230 --> 02:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
print the cards pay the fees all of that
 
02:24:01.469 --> 02:24:01.479 align:start position:0%
type of thing so if we regardless if the
 
02:24:04.910 --> 02:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
cost of therapeutic is the same as non-
 
02:24:06.990 --> 02:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
therapeutic there's no incentive for
 
02:24:09.630 --> 02:24:09.640 align:start position:0%
someone to go pay their physician to see
 
02:24:12.150 --> 02:24:12.160 align:start position:0%
them pay for a card go through all that
 
02:24:15.150 --> 02:24:15.160 align:start position:0%
rigar roll to access that that that
 
02:24:16.710 --> 02:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
medical guidance you'd be likely that
 
02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:17.550 align:start position:0%
medical guidance you'd be likely that
we'd

02:24:17.550 --> 02:24:17.560 align:start position:0%
we'd
 
02:24:19.790 --> 02:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
simply doing without that that would be
 
02:24:21.630 --> 02:24:21.640 align:start position:0%
my expectation so that's the reason that
 
02:24:23.910 --> 02:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
that would be of value so so if we were
 
02:24:27.750 --> 02:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
to remove the cap and that there was 50
 
02:24:29.910 --> 02:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
atc's rather than in
 
02:24:32.710 --> 02:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
four would that mean the fees would be
 
02:24:36.150 --> 02:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
actually less than 15% of the retail
 
02:24:39.349 --> 02:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
price come on how much can those those
 
02:24:41.469 --> 02:24:41.479 align:start position:0%
fees really be I I guess we'll have to
 
02:24:43.150 --> 02:24:43.160 align:start position:0%
look at the HHS budget to see what your
 
02:24:45.750 --> 02:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
fees are but I mean you're really saying
 
02:24:49.190 --> 02:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
that's going to represent the 15%
 
02:24:52.870 --> 02:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
tax I'm not sure I will tell you that
 
02:24:54.389 --> 02:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
there's been some misunderstanding about
 
02:24:55.910 --> 02:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
this the law that created the
 
02:24:57.950 --> 02:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program requires
 
02:24:59.670 --> 02:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
the program to be Revenue neutral the
 
02:25:01.429 --> 02:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
02:25:04.030 --> 02:25:04.040 align:start position:0%
required to set fees that cover the
 
02:25:07.870 --> 02:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
costs of Regulation and they do so so um
 
02:25:09.309 --> 02:25:09.319 align:start position:0%
I think the outcry that you will hear
 
02:25:13.670 --> 02:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
from this uh if if patients are uh
 
02:25:16.389 --> 02:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
subjected to a 15% fee you will hear an
 
02:25:18.550 --> 02:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
outcry from from them much more than you
 
02:25:22.389 --> 02:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
would from us uh it's an understanding
 
02:25:24.550 --> 02:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
and I mean there are a few states that
 
02:25:26.670 --> 02:25:26.680 align:start position:0%
apply a very small tax to medical
 
02:25:29.510 --> 02:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis but the vast majority of States
 
02:25:32.110 --> 02:25:32.120 align:start position:0%
out there do not ta tax medical cannabis
 
02:25:34.950 --> 02:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
at all and do tax cannabis sales to
 
02:25:36.870 --> 02:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
non-registered patients let's clarify
 
02:25:40.190 --> 02:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
this we're not that that's a that 15%
 
02:25:43.510 --> 02:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
fees on the gross sales under for the
 
02:25:45.830 --> 02:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
franchise right that's like a worldy
 
02:25:47.190 --> 02:25:47.200 align:start position:0%
basically you're paying for the
 
02:25:49.150 --> 02:25:49.160 align:start position:0%
franchise and there's also a benefit
 
02:25:51.950 --> 02:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
that each store would have because the
 
02:25:53.870 --> 02:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
the state the franchise or is going to
 
02:25:55.469 --> 02:25:55.479 align:start position:0%
do some of the marketing side of things
 
02:25:58.870 --> 02:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
with that with that being said though I
 
02:26:02.110 --> 02:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
understand that if the 15% fee applied
 
02:26:05.830 --> 02:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
to a therapeutic grade product there's
 
02:26:08.469 --> 02:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
other Revenue sources that your your
 
02:26:11.630 --> 02:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
businesses would all be gaining and for
 
02:26:15.349 --> 02:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
that reason if the if you want I suppose
 
02:26:17.790 --> 02:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
it's decision of each of your stores if
 
02:26:19.670 --> 02:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
you want to pass that cost onto the
 
02:26:21.110 --> 02:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
consumer and raise the price or your
 
02:26:22.950 --> 02:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
patients and want to raise the price
 
02:26:24.630 --> 02:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
that's a decision you can make but you
 
02:26:26.830 --> 02:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
have other Revenue sources that I
 
02:26:28.550 --> 02:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
believe representative hunt believes
 
02:26:32.630 --> 02:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
will be greater than perhaps that 15%
 
02:26:35.349 --> 02:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
fee and I think I'm I kind of agree that
 
02:26:37.429 --> 02:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
there's so many other opportunities for
 
02:26:39.510 --> 02:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
to generate Revenue that's being created
 
02:26:43.190 --> 02:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
for the atcs that that 15% fee shouldn't
 
02:26:46.070 --> 02:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
cause the patients to have to pay more
 
02:26:47.670 --> 02:26:47.680 align:start position:0%
than they're paying now
 
02:26:50.830 --> 02:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
I think in that scenario in that
 
02:26:52.870 --> 02:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
scenario we would do our best to keep
 
02:26:54.790 --> 02:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
prices low this was our recommendation
 
02:26:56.510 --> 02:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
based on what we've seen work in other
 
02:26:58.990 --> 02:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
markets that we directly participate in
 
02:27:00.870 --> 02:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
and a lot of these other markets I from
 
02:27:02.910 --> 02:27:02.920 align:start position:0%
what I understand in other states
 
02:27:04.510 --> 02:27:04.520 align:start position:0%
they've all run into similar problems
 
02:27:08.750 --> 02:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:11.389 --> 02:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
so so apologize for being late to the
 
02:27:13.469 --> 02:27:13.479 align:start position:0%
main but um I was a little I'm a little
 
02:27:15.309 --> 02:27:15.319 align:start position:0%
confused by the conversation because my
 
02:27:17.389 --> 02:27:17.399 align:start position:0%
understanding in the legislation the the
 
02:27:21.070 --> 02:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
draft we have there that medicinal
 
02:27:22.870 --> 02:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
dispensaries medical dispensaries will
 
02:27:25.550 --> 02:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
not be charged at 15% is that correct as
 
02:27:27.870 --> 02:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
it written yes okay and then my
 
02:27:29.230 --> 02:27:29.240 align:start position:0%
understanding was however we were
 
02:27:31.230 --> 02:27:31.240 align:start position:0%
providing a path for medicinal
 
02:27:33.389 --> 02:27:33.399 align:start position:0%
dispensaries to move from nonprofit to
 
02:27:36.710 --> 02:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
four profit entities but if they choose
 
02:27:39.510 --> 02:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
to be a franchise my my thought was that
 
02:27:40.910 --> 02:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
again my understanding was it would be a
 
02:27:42.870 --> 02:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
separate facility and that facility
 
02:27:45.990 --> 02:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
would be subject to the 15% tax is that
 
02:27:47.870 --> 02:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
we when we we weren't going to co-mingle
 
02:27:49.990 --> 02:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
funds or co-mingle buildings they were
 
02:27:51.830 --> 02:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
going to be separate distinct entities
 
02:27:53.630 --> 02:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
within could be under one corporate
 
02:27:56.070 --> 02:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
umbrella but two separate facilities one
 
02:27:57.590 --> 02:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
of which which sold medical which was
 
02:27:59.309 --> 02:27:59.319 align:start position:0%
not subject and the money was over there
 
02:28:02.309 --> 02:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
and one over here was the franchise
 
02:28:04.590 --> 02:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
which was subject to the 15 that was my
 
02:28:05.630 --> 02:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
understanding of what we were talking
 
02:28:08.150 --> 02:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
about in previous meetings is that now
 
02:28:10.870 --> 02:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
changed my understanding is if if Prime
 
02:28:12.710 --> 02:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
which doesn't exist anymore wanted to
 
02:28:15.710 --> 02:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
keep its prime store in theory they
 
02:28:18.070 --> 02:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
could but if they want to join the
 
02:28:18.080 --> 02:28:19.469 align:start position:0%
could but if they want to join the
retail

02:28:19.469 --> 02:28:19.479 align:start position:0%
retail
 
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
Market this is this is the conditions
 
02:28:23.469 --> 02:28:23.479 align:start position:0%
it's going to have to they're going to
 
02:28:24.750 --> 02:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
you're not going to have two registers
 
02:28:26.510 --> 02:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
one for retail one for they're going be
 
02:28:28.269 --> 02:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
physically separated they can be
 
02:28:30.230 --> 02:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
completely separate stores but they're
 
02:28:32.190 --> 02:28:32.200 align:start position:0%
not going to be the same buildings not
 
02:28:34.110 --> 02:28:34.120 align:start position:0%
going to be one building and is door a
 
02:28:35.950 --> 02:28:35.960 align:start position:0%
and door B again without getting into
 
02:28:37.750 --> 02:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
that detail I'm I just want to be clear
 
02:28:39.230 --> 02:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
again my understanding was it was a
 
02:28:41.950 --> 02:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
separate facility whether the details of
 
02:28:43.630 --> 02:28:43.640 align:start position:0%
whether it's one building with a with a
 
02:28:45.550 --> 02:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
wall down in the middle I don't know but
 
02:28:47.630 --> 02:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
again one of of those facilities the
 
02:28:50.110 --> 02:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
medical would not be subject to the 15%
 
02:28:51.429 --> 02:28:51.439 align:start position:0%
tax so therefore they could help keep
 
02:28:54.269 --> 02:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
their pricing low the second facility or
 
02:28:57.389 --> 02:28:57.399 align:start position:0%
premise would be uh premises would be a
 
02:29:00.550 --> 02:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
for-profit facility as a franchisee of
 
02:29:02.429 --> 02:29:02.439 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission subject to all the
 
02:29:03.910 --> 02:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations of the Liquor
 
02:29:05.389 --> 02:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
Commission and it would be subject to
 
02:29:07.630 --> 02:29:07.640 align:start position:0%
the 15% tax that's my understanding as
 
02:29:09.230 --> 02:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
well that's what this the working draft
 
02:29:11.030 --> 02:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
says I just want to make sure we're all
 
02:29:12.389 --> 02:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
on the same page that's what the draft
 
02:29:16.030 --> 02:29:16.040 align:start position:0%
says the hypothetical that I just ran by
 
02:29:19.349 --> 02:29:19.359 align:start position:0%
before you dve was if they weren't if
 
02:29:20.710 --> 02:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
they just had to become if they wanted
 
02:29:22.630 --> 02:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
to become a franchise store they would
 
02:29:24.830 --> 02:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
just be that but the really it's The
 
02:29:27.349 --> 02:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
Branding side of thing so Prime's
 
02:29:28.990 --> 02:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
product is really the brand long-term
 
02:29:31.269 --> 02:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
brand and if they were to if they were
 
02:29:33.990 --> 02:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
permitted to sell that product or to any
 
02:29:36.110 --> 02:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
franchisee throughout the state you
 
02:29:38.349 --> 02:29:38.359 align:start position:0%
would have a therapeutic I guess grade
 
02:29:40.990 --> 02:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
product that you still need a car to buy
 
02:29:43.190 --> 02:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
and that would increase their points of
 
02:29:45.230 --> 02:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
distribution rather than have this kind
 
02:29:48.349 --> 02:29:48.359 align:start position:0%
of store off to the side and all that
 
02:29:50.190 --> 02:29:50.200 align:start position:0%
they would technically any franchise you
 
02:29:52.790 --> 02:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
could sell it if they you want the
 
02:29:54.710 --> 02:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
franch I'm sorry I'm we're now
 
02:29:57.230 --> 02:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
comingling medical grade product with
 
02:29:59.150 --> 02:29:59.160 align:start position:0%
Cons with recreational product in the
 
02:30:02.190 --> 02:30:02.200 align:start position:0%
same building what it was just a
 
02:30:03.870 --> 02:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
suggestion rather than have a separate
 
02:30:05.750 --> 02:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
store because the the problem is is The
 
02:30:07.469 --> 02:30:07.479 align:start position:0%
Branding of what the store looks like
 
02:30:08.870 --> 02:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
when you're when you pull in the parking
 
02:30:10.950 --> 02:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
lot you going to have and that's exactly
 
02:30:12.070 --> 02:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
why I thought it was going to be two
 
02:30:13.550 --> 02:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
separate buildings for two separate
 
02:30:16.190 --> 02:30:16.200 align:start position:0%
marketing messages now Prime may be able
 
02:30:19.790 --> 02:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
to get and an ATC may be able to get
 
02:30:22.150 --> 02:30:22.160 align:start position:0%
their their manufacturing license and
 
02:30:23.910 --> 02:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
sell to both the retail side and the
 
02:30:25.469 --> 02:30:25.479 align:start position:0%
medical side if they choose to If the
 
02:30:28.030 --> 02:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
product on the on the meets all of our
 
02:30:29.790 --> 02:30:29.800 align:start position:0%
criteria um I don't think we should
 
02:30:32.510 --> 02:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
restrict that but one but if they sell
 
02:30:34.309 --> 02:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
product a over here and sell product a
 
02:30:36.910 --> 02:30:36.920 align:start position:0%
over here and Retail and medical versus
 
02:30:38.870 --> 02:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
retail the retail is going to be subject
 
02:30:41.030 --> 02:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
to the tax the one on this side is not
 
02:30:42.150 --> 02:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
even though it may be the same exact
 
02:30:43.590 --> 02:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
product sold in two different types of
 
02:30:47.429 --> 02:30:47.439 align:start position:0%
stores medical franchise
 
02:30:50.269 --> 02:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
well you can be done that way I was the
 
02:30:51.630 --> 02:30:51.640 align:start position:0%
hypothetical I'm posing and I'm just
 
02:30:53.429 --> 02:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
trying to use what I think is common
 
02:30:56.710 --> 02:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
sense if my doctor recommending I take a
 
02:30:59.790 --> 02:30:59.800 align:start position:0%
certain dose of something in theory I
 
02:31:02.790 --> 02:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
could get that dose satisfied at the
 
02:31:04.830 --> 02:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
recreational store I might have to eat
 
02:31:07.030 --> 02:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
more than one whatever or have more than
 
02:31:09.269 --> 02:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
one I I my point is I don't think that
 
02:31:11.070 --> 02:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
people are going to drive very far if
 
02:31:12.910 --> 02:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
they don't have to and they can just do
 
02:31:16.510 --> 02:31:16.520 align:start position:0%
the math so the idea is I know the ATC
 
02:31:18.750 --> 02:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
are worried about their long-term
 
02:31:23.349 --> 02:31:23.359 align:start position:0%
liability so I'm trying to offer you
 
02:31:25.030 --> 02:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
perhaps just some thoughts to think
 
02:31:27.950 --> 02:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
about if they I think that's going to
 
02:31:29.830 --> 02:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
happen I think the therap PE Market to
 
02:31:31.990 --> 02:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
be hit no matter what retail business
 
02:31:33.710 --> 02:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
you do but allowing if we're going to do
 
02:31:34.990 --> 02:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
the franchise model I think it's going
 
02:31:38.230 --> 02:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
to be complicated having separate stores
 
02:31:39.590 --> 02:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
well I think actually I think it's
 
02:31:41.790 --> 02:31:41.800 align:start position:0%
cleaning right again because you're not
 
02:31:43.950 --> 02:31:43.960 align:start position:0%
mixing books you're not mixing anything
 
02:31:45.469 --> 02:31:45.479 align:start position:0%
right you're not mixing employees we had
 
02:31:47.950 --> 02:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
this conversation about the medical
 
02:31:49.830 --> 02:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
conversation that occurs in a medical
 
02:31:52.110 --> 02:31:52.120 align:start position:0%
facility that doesn't occur in a retail
 
02:31:54.670 --> 02:31:54.680 align:start position:0%
facility you have a you have an employe
 
02:31:56.349 --> 02:31:56.359 align:start position:0%
who's on one day walking on this side
 
02:31:58.830 --> 02:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
and the second day going on this side
 
02:32:00.469 --> 02:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
I'm not I think that's just a nightmare
 
02:32:02.469 --> 02:32:02.479 align:start position:0%
but then why have a dual license let
 
02:32:03.950 --> 02:32:03.960 align:start position:0%
them have a separate facility that's a
 
02:32:05.630 --> 02:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
retail if they choose to do that they
 
02:32:07.389 --> 02:32:07.399 align:start position:0%
can have a separate retail facility they
 
02:32:09.309 --> 02:32:09.319 align:start position:0%
can work out the details behind their
 
02:32:11.630 --> 02:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
doors as far as their profit margins and
 
02:32:14.630 --> 02:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
stuff but again which on can pay 15% on
 
02:32:16.870 --> 02:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
the retail PS 15% sales out of the
 
02:32:19.309 --> 02:32:19.319 align:start position:0%
retail store franchise store pays 15%
 
02:32:21.190 --> 02:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
yeah they can certainly qualify to join
 
02:32:22.510 --> 02:32:22.520 align:start position:0%
up to be a franchise right that's what
 
02:32:24.429 --> 02:32:24.439 align:start position:0%
I'm saying but otherwise they but forget
 
02:32:26.710 --> 02:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
about the medical part because you can't
 
02:32:29.030 --> 02:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
that no employee can say that this is
 
02:32:30.830 --> 02:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
medical it's illegal for them to say
 
02:32:32.429 --> 02:32:32.439 align:start position:0%
again they said they give they give
 
02:32:35.990 --> 02:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
advice we of some sort we could under
 
02:32:39.269 --> 02:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
the franchise agreement perhaps
 
02:32:41.269 --> 02:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
specify the medical advice has to come
 
02:32:42.590 --> 02:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
from their treating
 
02:32:44.630 --> 02:32:44.640 align:start position:0%
position and and
 
02:32:48.030 --> 02:32:48.040 align:start position:0%
not can't so if I may just as a point of
 
02:32:49.950 --> 02:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
information we want but we don't want we
 
02:32:52.590 --> 02:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
don't want the retail store giving the
 
02:32:54.469 --> 02:32:54.479 align:start position:0%
medical advice if a doctor goes Rogan
 
02:32:56.389 --> 02:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
gives advice that's that's I mean I I
 
02:32:57.870 --> 02:32:57.880 align:start position:0%
agree we don't want the liability of
 
02:33:00.269 --> 02:33:00.279 align:start position:0%
them giving medical advice under this
 
02:33:02.190 --> 02:33:02.200 align:start position:0%
under again another even if you're a
 
02:33:04.230 --> 02:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
doctor and qualify to we still don't
 
02:33:07.309 --> 02:33:07.319 align:start position:0%
want that on the
 
02:33:09.950 --> 02:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
stage so if I may just as a point of
 
02:33:12.349 --> 02:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
information the current draft the
 
02:33:13.910 --> 02:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
current draft that we were asked to
 
02:33:17.469 --> 02:33:17.479 align:start position:0%
comment on does not envision atc's
 
02:33:19.710 --> 02:33:19.720 align:start position:0%
operating franchise stores it has a
 
02:33:21.950 --> 02:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
separate definition of cannabis retail
 
02:33:24.309 --> 02:33:24.319 align:start position:0%
store that means an alternative
 
02:33:26.110 --> 02:33:26.120 align:start position:0%
treatment center licensed to purchase
 
02:33:29.429 --> 02:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
cannabis and sell it to Consumers so the
 
02:33:30.910 --> 02:33:30.920 align:start position:0%
current draft just want to be clear
 
02:33:33.750 --> 02:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
about that the current draft does allows
 
02:33:36.110 --> 02:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
atc's to operate retail stores that are
 
02:33:38.990 --> 02:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
not franchise stores and we're open to
 
02:33:41.110 --> 02:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
being part of the way it's written or
 
02:33:43.510 --> 02:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about depending on
 
02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
details I that was the language I asked
 
02:33:49.230 --> 02:33:49.240 align:start position:0%
suggested to you to change though I mean
 
02:33:50.830 --> 02:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot of red pens to
 
02:33:56.469 --> 02:33:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:58.870 --> 02:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
draft you see the Chiefs I already I
 
02:34:00.150 --> 02:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
should have seen what he has going on
 
02:34:02.590 --> 02:34:02.600 align:start position:0%
it's the whole thing's almost
 
02:34:06.750 --> 02:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
right I gotta smile on you Mr chair just
 
02:34:09.070 --> 02:34:09.080 align:start position:0%
circling back on your uh questions with
 
02:34:13.590 --> 02:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
respect to uh the illicit market and uh
 
02:34:16.870 --> 02:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
what the uh folks testifying today would
 
02:34:22.510 --> 02:34:22.520 align:start position:0%
do um perhaps um an explanation as to a
 
02:34:25.750 --> 02:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
little bit generally uh in terms of the
 
02:34:29.550 --> 02:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
cost factor that goes into your products
 
02:34:32.670 --> 02:34:32.680 align:start position:0%
so is it fair to say that um licensing
 
02:34:36.030 --> 02:34:36.040 align:start position:0%
and testing represents a a portion I
 
02:34:37.550 --> 02:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
don't expect you to give us the
 
02:34:39.750 --> 02:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
percentage but a portion of the cost per
 
02:34:41.110 --> 02:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
products that you sell would that be
 
02:34:44.309 --> 02:34:44.319 align:start position:0%
accurate correct so licensing fees
 
02:34:46.590 --> 02:34:46.600 align:start position:0%
testing uh storefront
 
02:34:48.429 --> 02:34:48.439 align:start position:0%
um as well real
 
02:34:51.750 --> 02:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
estate yes right rental fees right uh
 
02:34:53.349 --> 02:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
and with respect to
 
02:34:57.510 --> 02:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
employees um Social Security withholding
 
02:35:00.910 --> 02:35:00.920 align:start position:0%
workers comp so forth and so on right
 
02:35:00.920 --> 02:35:01.950 align:start position:0%
workers comp so forth and so on right
and

02:35:01.950 --> 02:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:35:05.590 --> 02:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
so in terms of the illicit Market are
 
02:35:08.510 --> 02:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
you generally aware uh as to whether or
 
02:35:11.269 --> 02:35:11.279 align:start position:0%
not illicit Growers and Distributors of
 
02:35:14.710 --> 02:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
marijuana pay any of those fees I not
 
02:35:16.309 --> 02:35:16.319 align:start position:0%
that I'm aware of they are required to
 
02:35:18.870 --> 02:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
pay federal taxes under code 280e I
 
02:35:22.190 --> 02:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
doubt that very many of them do uh but I
 
02:35:24.230 --> 02:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
I would say they do impose they do take
 
02:35:26.830 --> 02:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
on another cost which is the risk of
 
02:35:29.870 --> 02:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
being prosecuted for a felony that's the
 
02:35:32.230 --> 02:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
primary mechanism that dri drives up the
 
02:35:34.910 --> 02:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
price on the illicit Market whereas the
 
02:35:36.510 --> 02:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
the conditions you mentioned drive up
 
02:35:38.910 --> 02:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
prices in a regulated market so would it
 
02:35:41.190 --> 02:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
be fair to say then that in in terms of
 
02:35:44.790 --> 02:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
a pure economic point of view the cost
 
02:35:47.110 --> 02:35:47.120 align:start position:0%
of their product uh is always going to
 
02:35:50.030 --> 02:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
be less than whatever uh is sold in a
 
02:35:53.030 --> 02:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
legalized or in an ATC model I disagree
 
02:35:55.030 --> 02:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
with that entirely and and we can look
 
02:35:59.070 --> 02:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
at illicit Market estimates uh over the
 
02:36:01.469 --> 02:36:01.479 align:start position:0%
last 20 years and we can look at prices
 
02:36:03.670 --> 02:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
within the regulated market as regulated
 
02:36:06.830 --> 02:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
markets mature there's always an initial
 
02:36:09.710 --> 02:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
period we always begin with high demand
 
02:36:12.469 --> 02:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
and low Supply and as the supply catches
 
02:36:15.429 --> 02:36:15.439 align:start position:0%
up with demand there is a a bit of a
 
02:36:17.510 --> 02:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
flipping that happens and there's an
 
02:36:20.349 --> 02:36:20.359 align:start position:0%
inevitable decrease in prices uh across
 
02:36:22.710 --> 02:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
the market as Mr poock mentioned there's
 
02:36:25.230 --> 02:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
been a substantial decrease in prices
 
02:36:27.550 --> 02:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
across the Massachusetts Market Maine
 
02:36:29.990 --> 02:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
has experienced similar Vermont has not
 
02:36:31.550 --> 02:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
yet because they've only had about a
 
02:36:34.269 --> 02:36:34.279 align:start position:0%
year of retail sales but it it has
 
02:36:36.870 --> 02:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
happened in every state the price begins
 
02:36:39.429 --> 02:36:39.439 align:start position:0%
relatively high and it comes down as
 
02:36:43.750 --> 02:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
Supply catches up with demand Chief with
 
02:36:47.910 --> 02:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
um with AIC efficiencies automated
 
02:36:52.389 --> 02:36:52.399 align:start position:0%
equipment scale you can uh sort of
 
02:36:54.110 --> 02:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
offset some of those additional costs
 
02:36:56.230 --> 02:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
that regulated businesses
 
02:36:59.510 --> 02:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
have understood but uh in General's uh
 
02:37:02.230 --> 02:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
sense and it's fair to say then that in
 
02:37:03.550 --> 02:37:03.560 align:start position:0%
in the various states that have
 
02:37:05.429 --> 02:37:05.439 align:start position:0%
legalized the illicit Market has
 
02:37:08.790 --> 02:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
actually expanded um to the extent that
 
02:37:11.389 --> 02:37:11.399 align:start position:0%
the legislature and Oregon uh in a
 
02:37:13.190 --> 02:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
previous session in
 
02:37:16.230 --> 02:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
21 um appropriated an additional $25
 
02:37:18.670 --> 02:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
million to address the illicit Market at
 
02:37:21.230 --> 02:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
inorg aren't you aware of that I am
 
02:37:23.309 --> 02:37:23.319 align:start position:0%
aware of that Chief and I would make the
 
02:37:26.030 --> 02:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
distinction that what Oregon was facing
 
02:37:28.550 --> 02:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
was an issue of growing more cannabis
 
02:37:30.830 --> 02:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
that can reasonably sold in the state
 
02:37:32.309 --> 02:37:32.319 align:start position:0%
the problem is I understood it was not
 
02:37:34.230 --> 02:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
that Oregon residents were buying from
 
02:37:37.230 --> 02:37:37.240 align:start position:0%
the illicit Market but that cannabis was
 
02:37:39.349 --> 02:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
being grown in Oregon under the guise of
 
02:37:42.150 --> 02:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
legalization and ship to States like New
 
02:37:43.870 --> 02:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire think that's an important
 
02:37:45.230 --> 02:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
distinction is there any further
 
02:37:47.190 --> 02:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
questions for
 
02:37:47.200 --> 02:37:49.710 align:start position:0%
questions for
the

02:37:49.710 --> 02:37:49.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:37:53.830 --> 02:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
visitors see on thanks guys thank you
 
02:37:57.750 --> 02:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
