e

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
all right it being 10 o'clock we're
 
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
going to open a work session for
 
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
division 3 um we we've got a tremendous
 
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 align:start position:0%
amount to do in two hours so uh we're
 
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 align:start position:0%
going to try to keep things uh pretty
 
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
minimal uh but um first I want to tie up
 
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
some loose ends from the prior work
 
00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
session we had a number of bills that we
 
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 align:start position:0%
said that
 
00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 align:start position:0%
uh we would accept with an amendment and
 
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
we described the amendment uh the
 
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
amendment was then subsequently uh
 
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
written by
 
00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759 align:start position:0%
OS uh we haven't formally looked at the
 
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
written Amendment so I want to make sure
 
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
that I we don't need to go revote the
 
00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
acceptance of the amendment I just want
 
00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we T we touch each
 
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment and if anyone objects to what
 
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
came out of our you know that something
 
00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 align:start position:0%
that came out is different than what
 
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 align:start position:0%
they anticipated that that you have an
 
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh say that so that we
 
00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 align:start position:0%
don't accidentally or mistakenly uh
 
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 align:start position:0%
trudge forward when we should not be
 
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
doing that so uh then after that we
 
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
have um a whole fresh discussion on
 
00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
596 um there's a um a a revisit on
 
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 align:start position:0%
499 uh representative tersi I believe
 
00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
put together an amendment and
 
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative walner is going to to
 
00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 align:start position:0%
teach us about it uh and then 417 is a
 
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
big issue uh and this is really going to
 
00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 align:start position:0%
be an opportunity for represent of ho to
 
00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
walk us through a a pretty big Amendment
 
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
so I I'm I'm going to ask you now when
 
00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 align:start position:0%
it when it happens let's let's keep it
 
00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
moving y okay all right um so with that
 
00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 align:start position:0%
going to uh with the um professional
 
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
assistance of our vice chair to make
 
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
sure I don't mess this up um there was
 
00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 align:start position:0%
an amendment for SB
 
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.190 align:start position:0%
an amendment for SB
352

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
352
 
00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:49.159 align:start position:0%
um has that Amendment been distributed
 
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 align:start position:0%
Ripple I've emailed uh to all the
 
00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 align:start position:0%
members 352 as well as the other
 
00:02:59.309 --> 00:02:59.319 align:start position:0%
amendments that were discussed yet not
 
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
formally drafted drafted uh I do have
 
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 align:start position:0%
hard copies if you'd like me to hand
 
00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
those out as well please do hand out the
 
00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
hard copies but um but you but the what
 
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
you emailed is identical to what you're
 
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
handing out now it's the same thing
 
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay what's the number
 
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
I'll start with 352 I think there were
 
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.710 align:start position:0%
I'll start with 352 I think there were
four

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
bills I think he means the amendment
 
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
number to
 
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
352 sorry the bill is 352 and the
 
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 align:start position:0%
okay so we're not going to revote these
 
00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 align:start position:0%
I I just want to give you enough time to
 
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
validate that it's what you're expecting
 
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
so that we can just lock it down and
 
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.949 align:start position:0%
so that we can just lock it down and
move

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 align:start position:0%
move
 
00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
on this was a major Bill obviously this
 
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
is was about the firefighters cancer
 
00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:22.230 align:start position:0%
is was about the firefighters cancer
screening

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
so so I'm going to assume everyone's had
 
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to read it and recall
 
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 align:start position:0%
their thoughts from last week is there
 
00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
any any objection to accepting uh uh 1
 
00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
1915 as the amendment that we voted
 
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
on on the 10th any
 
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 align:start position:0%
objections not not seeing any objections
 
00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to lock that baby down
 
00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 align:start position:0%
355 is there an amendment on 355 so I I
 
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
just mentioned 355 but they're actually
 
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
isn't one on that that amendment was
 
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
voted on and the committee had a copy of
 
00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 align:start position:0%
it on Friday so the next bill I believe
 
00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 align:start position:0%
404 do do we have a representative
 
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
wner go ahead you put your mic on though
 
00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 align:start position:0%
there an amendment on 355 to change the
 
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
date you will have an amendment for that
 
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
I don't have it yet my thought was that
 
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 align:start position:0%
that would be a full committee Amendment
 
00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
since this bill wasn't noticed for
 
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
today's work session oh okay even if
 
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.070 align:start position:0%
today's work session oh okay even if
okay

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
was that the cycl magalo virus is that
 
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
right yeah what we what we were informed
 
00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 align:start position:0%
was by the hospital Association is that
 
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
if we're going to do this we need to uh
 
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
push back the effective date so that
 
00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:45.319 align:start position:0%
they have time to actually uh be
 
00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
prepared to be accountable for it we
 
00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 align:start position:0%
can't make them respond to a law that
 
00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 align:start position:0%
they haven't had a chance to adapt yes
 
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
represent a whole thank you Mr chair is
 
00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
there any reason we can't just proceed
 
00:05:59.350 --> 00:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
with right without objection from this
 
00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
committee to address the date in full
 
00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
Finance uh I I don't see any reason we
 
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
can't do that you know I I I got the
 
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
feeling that we're pretty flexible in a
 
00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 align:start position:0%
work session I I just ass soon have less
 
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
stuff brought into the full finance
 
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
committee that we could U have our
 
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 align:start position:0%
position clear on am I am I going to
 
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 align:start position:0%
violate a clerk rule if if we go ahead
 
00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
and look at that Amendment and then no I
 
00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:26.199 align:start position:0%
don't think you're violating any rules I
 
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
think the I think the division has the
 
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
discretion to do that I don't actually
 
00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 align:start position:0%
have a hard copy of that Amendment with
 
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
me it's still with OS okay all right so
 
00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:36.639 align:start position:0%
we can't see it but because it's just
 
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
not available all right so is there any
 
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
objection to pushing out the effective
 
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
date through that amendment process so
 
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
that the hospital Association if this
 
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
becomes law has the opportunity to get
 
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
ready to U meet their
 
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
obligations I'm I'm not I'm not seeing
 
00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
any objections so we'll just bring that
 
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
up in full Finance later day uh Mr chair
 
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 align:start position:0%

00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
15 um we um are using median income
 
00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:41.000 align:start position:0%

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:44.680 align:start position:0%
at 500% but now it's median income which
 
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:51.560 align:start position:0%
is a lot less than 500% of poverty um we
 
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
changed a date the date to take effect
 
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
on January 1 so you have to go to the
 
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
back page page three line
 
00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:07.839 align:start position:0%
10 um it will take effect January 1 of
 
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
20125 so it will be basically a
 
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
six-month program until there's a new
 
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:15.320 align:start position:0%
budget to consider it in the new
 
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.630 align:start position:0%
budget to consider it in the new
budget

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:21.160 align:start position:0%
and I think the
 
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
other Kevin was the other piece that
 
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
they would be allowed to contract this
 
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
out I yes yes I think that was in your
 
00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
previous Amendment so I don't believe
 
00:10:33.949 --> 00:10:33.959 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
00:10:33.959 --> 00:10:37.590 align:start position:0%
that's a
change

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
um don't recall where and here that is
 
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
believe if I could it was to be lapsing
 
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
where does that appear now yeah um I
 
00:10:53.829 --> 00:10:53.839 align:start position:0%
don't think it appears but there was
 
00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
previously non-aps language that's been
 
00:10:58.990 --> 00:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
removed so it would lapse okay and also
 
00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:02.839 align:start position:0%
on page three lines seven and8 uh states
 
00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
that federal funds shall be used first
 
00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
and any remainder shall be General funds
 
00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
thank you y and also the reporting
 
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
requirement was fleshed out a bit that's
 
00:11:14.829 --> 00:11:14.839 align:start position:0%
on page two uh lines 26 through 30 you
 
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
can see the specific items that will be
 
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:25.629 --> 00:11:25.639 align:start position:0%
report any other line items that we
 
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to address and of course it was
 
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
changed to project from Pilots I no that
 
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
throughout yes that was the main thing
 
00:11:35.629 --> 00:11:35.639 align:start position:0%
that was the only thing
 
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh so so with that uh are you satisfied
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
that this amendment meets our agreement
 
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
yes okay so I'm going to um move off of
 
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:48.990 align:start position:0%
yes okay so I'm going to um move off of
uh

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.590 align:start position:0%
uh
404

00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
404 and are
 
00:11:58.629 --> 00:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
we what about 409 do we have any issues
 
00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
with 409 9 that was also an
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
otpa this
 
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
Stringham um do we did we see the
 
00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
amendment last week yes you had that one
 
00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:10.959 align:start position:0%
in hand okay so there was there was
 
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:14.440 align:start position:0%
nothing to reconsider this time
 
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:17.560 align:start position:0%
455 uh relative Medicaid reimbursement
 
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
rates uh this is one that Mr Litman has
 
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh come in and uh could you could you
 
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
tell us if if what what you you think
 
00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:29.959 align:start position:0%
you were doing Rel relative to the
 
00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
Litman email you and I have chatted on
 
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
so I think at this point um I've
 
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
received no direction to do anything uh
 
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
just to summarize what Mr Litman uh
 
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
shared with me yesterday he expressed
 
00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
some concern that by setting the
 
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rates for these devices
 
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
permanently at 90% of the Medicare rates
 
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
uh he's committing the state would be
 
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:53.560 align:start position:0%
committing itself to pay 90% of the
 
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
Medicare rate well into the future uh no
 
00:12:58.509 --> 00:12:58.519 align:start position:0%
matter how high that rate may go so as
 
00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:00.680 align:start position:0%
an alternative he had suggested setting
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
the rate at 90% of the Medicare rate in
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
effect as of a date certain at some
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
point in
 
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
2024 um so I mentioned to him that it
 
00:13:13.629 --> 00:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
might be too late to do that in the
 
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
house I'm not sure it's up to the
 
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:17.320 align:start position:0%
committee members um and that he could
 
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:18.680 align:start position:0%
consider talking to the Senate and
 
00:13:20.189 --> 00:13:20.199 align:start position:0%
requesting a committee of conference on
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
this bill if he's so inclined so so my
 
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
bias and this is for division three
 
00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
input and short discussion my bias is if
 
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:31.000 align:start position:0%
um if if we get some good opinion like
 
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
that and it is feasible for us to go
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
ahead and and get the paperwork right
 
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
that we should do that so that we do our
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
work before we send it over to the other
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
body u m m Mr chair Mr Ripple said
 
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
Medicare rates it's
 
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
Medicaid that that was another
 
00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
discussion that happened on Friday there
 
00:13:52.509 --> 00:13:52.519 align:start position:0%
was some language about changing
 
00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:54.680 align:start position:0%
Medicare to Medicaid as part of my
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
discussion with Mr Litman yesterday we
 
00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
concluded that Medicare as the as the
 
00:14:01.389 --> 00:14:01.399 align:start position:0%
bill came you was in fact correct so
 
00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
it's Medicare rather than Medicaid right
 
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
it would set the Medicaid rates for
 
00:14:07.749 --> 00:14:07.759 align:start position:0%
these devices at 90% of the Medicare
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
rate which is probably two or three
 
00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
times higher than Medicaid it could be
 
00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
significantly higher yes thank you but
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
all right I didn't catch that change but
 
00:14:19.749 --> 00:14:19.759 align:start position:0%
thank you okay so would it even be
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
feasible to get an amendment from
 
00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
OSS before this afternoon's full finance
 
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
committee hearing I think we probably
 
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
could I would want to get some exact
 
00:14:33.389 --> 00:14:33.399 align:start position:0%
language from the Department either Mr
 
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
Litman or someone else just to make sure
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
that we're getting in exactly what uh
 
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
what he wants in there are you are you
 
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
able to do that Mr Williams or Miss
 
00:14:44.189 --> 00:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
Morris I I don't know which one of you
 
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:52.040 align:start position:0%
ball okay so so my my preference is we
 
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
we go ahead and try to get the amendment
 
00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
right and get it through full finance
 
00:14:59.790 --> 00:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
and send it to the floor the way we want
 
00:15:02.189 --> 00:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
it to be instead of kicking the can over
 
00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
to the other body is there anyone with a
 
00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.269 align:start position:0%
to the other body is there anyone with a
different

00:15:06.269 --> 00:15:06.279 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
opinion not not seeing any um so
 
00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:12.920 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham well I also
 
00:15:16.069 --> 00:15:16.079 align:start position:0%
talked um uh with Mr lman yesterday and
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
also completed a table of the difference
 
00:15:21.069 --> 00:15:21.079 align:start position:0%
between current Medicaid rates and the
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
Medicare rates for every single service
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
that's eligible under there the typical
 
00:15:31.749 --> 00:15:31.759 align:start position:0%
difference is about 60% um um uh what
 
00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
I'd heard and and Mr Litman has CMS in
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
today and then has business in the
 
00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:38.519 align:start position:0%
Senate this afternoon so I'm not sure
 
00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:43.720 align:start position:0%
he'll be able to join us um um uh his
 
00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
his discussion with the contractor mman
 
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
was that that with the $620,000
 
00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
appropriation um they could fund the 90%
 
00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
of Medicare rate adjustment but he did
 
00:15:59.949 --> 00:15:59.959 align:start position:0%
want he did also say he wants to freeze
 
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
it the the amendment I'm looking at I
 
00:16:06.309 --> 00:16:06.319 align:start position:0%
don't think does that so it would still
 
00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:09.079 align:start position:0%
need to be Mr liman specified that we
 
00:16:11.629 --> 00:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
should state that uh we would reimburse
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
it 90% for the
 
00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:17.319 align:start position:0%
2024 Medicare fee schedule that was the
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
language I had but I'm not sure that
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
it's exact so I'm reluctant to go with
 
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
that without further input all right so
 
00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
so I will say the the Medicare fee
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
schedule does update every quarter not
 
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
once a year so oh uh so I my analysis
 
00:16:35.069 --> 00:16:35.079 align:start position:0%
was on the April 1st
 
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
2024 levels so so I didn't know that
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
they did a quarterly update but we
 
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
should probably if we're going to
 
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
specify a snapshot we should make sure
 
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:55.309 --> 00:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
snapshot okay so um so what we just I I
 
00:16:58.150 --> 00:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
I could take a motion to consider this
 
00:17:00.509 --> 00:17:00.519 align:start position:0%
amendment and we'll see if people
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
here I'm willing to make that motion
 
00:17:09.669 --> 00:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
you'll make it is there a second I'll
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
second it second I'll
 
00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.079 align:start position:0%
move uh Amendment
 
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
1942 with the understanding that there
 
00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
is going to be a date that is added to
 
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
it effective on right the fee schedule
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
as of and a particular calendar date so
 
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
that it is locked down
 
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
okay and I don't think I've handed that
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
out yet I I representative Stringham has
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
it because we talked right before the
 
00:17:35.909 --> 00:17:35.919 align:start position:0%
meeting started but I don't think that
 
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
would be great let's go ahead and hand
 
00:17:44.669 --> 00:17:44.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:44.679 --> 00:17:47.510 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:55.149 align:start position:0%
you
thanks

00:17:55.149 --> 00:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
here okay so I Mr clerk I I think the we
 
00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
have a motion before us to accept uh
 
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
1924 amendment to sp4
 
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
55 with uh the appropriate language
 
00:18:35.789 --> 00:18:35.799 align:start position:0%
inserted into
 
00:18:41.149 --> 00:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
1924 to reference 90% of the appropriate
 
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:45.640 align:start position:0%
quarter 2024 Medicare
 
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
schedule is that you got that Mr chair I
 
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
was going to say right after on line six
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
after the word Medicare we we put a date
 
00:18:58.830 --> 00:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
code of January 1st 2024 I think that
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
addresses the concern and it timestamps
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
this to a particular time that the cost
 
00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
can be figured out and whether it's
 
00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:09.159 align:start position:0%
January 1st or April 1st right I think
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
the the marginal change is going to be
 
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
minimal but timestamping it to a known
 
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
date would be effective I I think that
 
00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
could be a good thing for Mr Ripple to
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
consider doing did you hear the
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation I didn't I'm sorry okay I
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
I don't want to tie your hands on this
 
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
though because you're in the middle of
 
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
coordinating what the language ought to
 
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
be but representative whole suggests
 
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
that you put the the the timing the 2024
 
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
part on line six as part of line
 
00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
six and and if that works if that works
 
00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:42.520 align:start position:0%
for you then that's good
 
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
yep okay so since this is an amendment
 
00:19:47.789 --> 00:19:47.799 align:start position:0%
we'll do a show of hands how many
 
00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
support this amendment as we just
 
00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
verbally described okay any opposed not
 
00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:56.039 align:start position:0%
seeing any let's let's go ahead and do
 
00:19:56.039 --> 00:20:00.110 align:start position:0%
seeing any let's let's go ahead and do
that

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:06.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.950 align:start position:0%
 
455

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
455
 
00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:09.990 align:start position:0%
455
1924

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
1924
 
00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:12.799 align:start position:0%
plus okay so
 
00:20:17.149 --> 00:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
463 463 was courta appointed counsel I
 
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
think there's uh an amendment to what we
 
00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
voted on last week is
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
there representative walner U do we have
 
00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:29.230 align:start position:0%
there representative walner U do we have
that

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:29.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:31.000 align:start position:0%
we're on
 
00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:48.710 align:start position:0%
we're on
463

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
yeah the the second one I sent you right
 
00:21:09.789 --> 00:21:09.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:09.799 --> 00:21:35.390 align:start position:0%
 
m

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
no this isn't the second one this is the
 
00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
first one you're right wrong
 
00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
one oh excuse me Mr
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
Ripple I I believe this was the um this
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:00.909 --> 00:22:00.919 align:start position:0%
version it was emailed to
 
00:22:04.029 --> 00:22:04.039 align:start position:0%
us actually we have
 
00:22:04.039 --> 00:22:08.669 align:start position:0%
us actually we have
a

00:22:08.669 --> 00:22:08.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
um a different place gotcha okay oh it
 
00:22:16.029 --> 00:22:16.039 align:start position:0%
is okay yes it is does this still have
 
00:22:16.039 --> 00:22:18.830 align:start position:0%
is okay yes it is does this still have
the

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:23.240 align:start position:0%
14 no not so so this is not the
 
00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:26.200 align:start position:0%
amendment we agreed to yes yes this
 
00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
isn't the amendment we talked about last
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
week this is a new Amendment
 
00:22:34.149 --> 00:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
okay so the amendment we talked about
 
00:22:37.549 --> 00:22:37.559 align:start position:0%
last week what amend did we did we
 
00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:39.039 align:start position:0%
actually have a written amendment that
 
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:43.240 align:start position:0%
we voted on last week yes yes we voted
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
on uh the PRI Amendment 1890 correct and
 
00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
then we had further discussion what did
 
00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
we want to do what did
 
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
what what what does your Amendment do
 
00:23:01.269 --> 00:23:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
well it sort of it it's looks at the
 
00:23:09.549 --> 00:23:09.559 align:start position:0%
issue of um not having enough attorneys
 
00:23:11.789 --> 00:23:11.799 align:start position:0%
available it looks at it in a different
 
00:23:15.149 --> 00:23:15.159 align:start position:0%
way than the amendment we we uh passed
 
00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
last week and what it what it does is
 
00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
basically the issue is that on
 
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
July 1 of 2025
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
when children will become eligible for a
 
00:23:35.669 --> 00:23:35.679 align:start position:0%
courta appointed
 
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:39.640 align:start position:0%
lawyer there are will already be a large
 
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
number of children in residential
 
00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
placement that's around today I guess
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
it's around
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
125 124 125 children so it means on that
 
00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:53.480 align:start position:0%
date you'd have to come up with an
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
attorney for 124
 
00:23:58.110 --> 00:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
children when you stop and think about
 
00:24:02.269 --> 00:24:02.279 align:start position:0%
it it is a pretty big amount of
 
00:24:05.149 --> 00:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
attorneys to come up with that quickly
 
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
so what this does is it basically phases
 
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
in and you'll find that on the second
 
00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:15.640 align:start position:0%
page of the amendment it phases
 
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
in it phases in the
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
um the attorneys so that first during
 
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
the first phase on July one on July 31st
 
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
of 2025
 
00:24:32.149 --> 00:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
the first phase the older children will
 
00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
get a lawyer then the younger then 14y
 
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
olds to 15y olds on October so it phases
 
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
it in so that by the end of the year all
 
00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:46.120 align:start position:0%
children will have had a lawyer rather
 
00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:50.200 align:start position:0%
than get hit by that um demand early on
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
all right so so so my my reaction to
 
00:24:55.789 --> 00:24:55.799 align:start position:0%
this is that this is substantially
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
different than what we talked about on
 
00:24:59.789 --> 00:24:59.799 align:start position:0%
the on the other day and that we voted
 
00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
on the other day and uh while it's could
 
00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039 align:start position:0%
be a vast improvement over what we had I
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
don't think we have the time today to
 
00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:13.039 align:start position:0%
really get into it so so
 
00:25:13.039 --> 00:25:14.590 align:start position:0%
really get into it so so
I

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
I I I I'm I'm not really excited about
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
passing this right now representative
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
wer do you have a comment it's it still
 
00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
leaves in section four which is the 14
 
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
Child Protective Service workers which
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
we had testimony that that's far too
 
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
many they don't need all those extra
 
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
people I believe it uh uh this amendment
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
deletes well replaces that with the
 
00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
prospective repeal in section four so
 
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
the appropriation and the positions
 
00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:43.480 align:start position:0%
would not be in the result section four
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
okay it is they are go
 
00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:48.669 align:start position:0%
okay it is they are go
ahead

00:25:48.669 --> 00:25:48.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:10.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
all right um do you want to make a
 
00:26:14.389 --> 00:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
motion on your
 
00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment oh yes I move um that we pass
 
00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.990 align:start position:0%
Amendment oh yes I move um that we pass
Amendment

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:23.000 align:start position:0%

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
28h second
 
00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.870 align:start position:0%
28h second
further

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:32.120 align:start position:0%
discussion representative hle
 
00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham further
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
discussion this is uh this is this is
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
awfully quick I this is uh hitting my
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
discomfort level with moving this fast
 
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
on something that we
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:49.720 align:start position:0%
apart representative
 
00:26:53.389 --> 00:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
wer you're all right your representative
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
priest I think this uh provides us um
 
00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
with a process that can
 
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
adequately support uh providing counsel
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
to children in need and I think it kind
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
of phases it in it makes it realistic
 
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
and I think we can achieve the same
 
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
goals without any cost to the
 
00:27:24.269 --> 00:27:24.279 align:start position:0%
state for the next
 
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
year yeah so my the PO part of this that
 
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:32.200 align:start position:0%
disturbs me the most uh at a visceral
 
00:27:37.029 --> 00:27:37.039 align:start position:0%
level is my reaction to lines 22 to 34
 
00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
which page on on page two that that
 
00:27:43.269 --> 00:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
seems awfully prescriptive it it's sort
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
of like
 
00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:48.559 align:start position:0%
saying cars should be able to achieve 50
 
00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
miles a gallon by 2030 it it it it's
 
00:27:54.269 --> 00:27:54.279 align:start position:0%
it's kind of an aspirational thing where
 
00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0%
reality and technology and the like may
 
00:27:58.430 --> 00:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
not be able to meet that date and
 
00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919 align:start position:0%
putting it into law I think
 
00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:05.919 align:start position:0%
is is is inappropriate but but that that
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
that's my view on that I i' I'd probably
 
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
be what would happen to this amendment
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%
representative walner if we deleted
 
00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.389 align:start position:0%
representative walner if we deleted
lines

00:28:13.389 --> 00:28:13.399 align:start position:0%
lines
 
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:20.990 --> 00:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
34 well that's the that's the point of
 
00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
the amendment is the phas in allowing
 
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
for the phase in are you also looking at
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
the other new piece
 
00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.149 align:start position:0%
the other new piece
um

00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
is go ahead we need we need to look at
 
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
that also because if we
 
00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:44.200 align:start position:0%
cannot accomplish the phase in as
 
00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:48.200 align:start position:0%
outlined here it does give them
 
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
another way of doing it another way of
 
00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:53.240 align:start position:0%
going back represent Moy so on page two
 
00:28:55.549 --> 00:28:55.559 align:start position:0%
of the walner amendment starting on line
 
00:28:59.590 --> 00:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
eight through line 10 the new language
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
addresses the
 
00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
scenario that a person a child would not
 
00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
receive an attorney because of the
 
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
shortage of attorneys in New Hampshire
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
and it would allow the case to continue
 
00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
despite there not being an attorney
 
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
found after a diligent effort to locate
 
00:29:20.669 --> 00:29:20.679 align:start position:0%
one so that critical language which
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
satisfies that concern reads starting on
 
00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
line 8 not withstanding the above in any
 
00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:29.240 align:start position:0%
action in which despite diligent efforts
 
00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:32.120 align:start position:0%
to secure councel an attorney is not
 
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
available for appointment litigation May
 
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
proceed until an attorney becomes
 
00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
available so so so just to thumb wrestle
 
00:29:45.509 --> 00:29:45.519 align:start position:0%
words with you uh the the the phrase
 
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
that's there is not withstanding the
 
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
above the portion that bothers me is
 
00:29:54.029 --> 00:29:54.039 align:start position:0%
below though the setting out the
 
00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
schedule is is is below that disclaimer
 
00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
and I'm not enough of a lawyer and I
 
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
haven't looked at this long enough to to
 
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
to think if by setting this table in
 
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
place if we're setting the state up for
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
lawsuits if we don't meet them can we
 
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
allow somebody to speak Mr Ripple did
 
00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
you so in an earlier in the draft that
 
00:30:22.029 --> 00:30:22.039 align:start position:0%
was provided to OS that raised the
 
00:30:24.269 --> 00:30:24.279 align:start position:0%
begins on line 8 was actually below the
 
00:30:26.269 --> 00:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
schedule yes um but they moved it up to
 
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
this paragraph so it could be could be
 
00:30:30.909 --> 00:30:30.919 align:start position:0%
worded to apply
 
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
to the schedule in section
 
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
e i i that that would remove my my
 
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:41.640 align:start position:0%
biggest concern is to make it make sure
 
00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
that that that's sort of are are out if
 
00:30:47.909 --> 00:30:47.919 align:start position:0%
we need it and I don't want to use it
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
but I don't want to set us up for
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
failure either
 
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
yes representating walner in in the
 
00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
draft that we sent to OSS um those words
 
00:31:01.629 --> 00:31:01.639 align:start position:0%
not with uh notwithstanding the above
 
00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
were under the phase out okay I can show
 
00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:10.120 align:start position:0%
you in no no I believe you so so I think
 
00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
I think we have a a motion to vote I
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
think we have a clarification to the
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
motion though because we're talking
 
00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:19.960 align:start position:0%
about changing this amendment to make
 
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
that notwithstanding more
 
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
inclusive um and I I would be okay with
 
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
with that if the motion were something
 
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
like to adopt uh Amendment
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
1928 with under the condition that the
 
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding language on line 8
 
00:31:41.629 --> 00:31:41.639 align:start position:0%
becomes U comprehensive
 
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
for for the for the whole thing and I'm
 
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to Wordsmith it because I
 
00:31:50.190 --> 00:31:50.200 align:start position:0%
think Mr Ripple can do that okay is is
 
00:31:53.509 --> 00:31:53.519 align:start position:0%
is is that a go ahead represent H thank
 
00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:55.559 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um I think there's another
 
00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:00.200 align:start position:0%
drafting issue um online page one
 
00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:02.799 align:start position:0%
line um
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
2829 it references subparagraph 2E right
 
00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
in in in cases under this chapter
 
00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
subject to the phase in schedule
 
00:32:13.029 --> 00:32:13.039 align:start position:0%
established in sub paragraph
 
00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
2E on page three we repeal that on line
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
three later on in in life um and I don't
 
00:32:22.909 --> 00:32:22.919 align:start position:0%
think we want to right I don't think we
 
00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:29.519 align:start position:0%
leave that section b as drafted with a
 
00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:32.440 align:start position:0%
repeal of section right of of
 
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
subparagraph e later on so I think we do
 
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
need to fix how we do the repeal um in
 
00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
section four as well right I I'm okay
 
00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:43.240 align:start position:0%
repealing the perspective phase in but
 
00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
then you got to adjust the language in
 
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
28 and 29 that was one did did you
 
00:32:51.029 --> 00:32:51.039 align:start position:0%
follow that Mr Ripple does that does
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
that make sense to you what
 
00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:54.440 align:start position:0%
representative H just said it does make
 
00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:00.269 --> 00:33:00.279 align:start position:0%
I think it might a little while to get
 
00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
this drafted correctly so it might be it
 
00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
might be later on in the full committee
 
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
meeting before we get this back for vote
 
00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:09.200 align:start position:0%
but but yes that change makes sense okay
 
00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:11.240 align:start position:0%
and then to the point that you were just
 
00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
discussing Mr chairman right the
 
00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:15.440 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding language on lines eight
 
00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.269 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding language on lines eight
and

00:33:16.269 --> 00:33:16.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
following um I think it does actually
 
00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
want to be in parag in ref in paragraph
 
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
B that's the appropriate place to leave
 
00:33:28.269 --> 00:33:28.279 align:start position:0%
it um
 
00:33:30.269 --> 00:33:30.279 align:start position:0%
repeat it again I think you might need
 
00:33:34.629 --> 00:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
to repeat it again for paragraph e and
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
the reason I say that is we're we're
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
describing what the court should be
 
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
doing in paragraph B and that
 
00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding language technically
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
needs to be there as a best efforts
 
00:33:50.629 --> 00:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
paragraph I would propose that we copy
 
00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
that language 8 through 8 through 12 and
 
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
put it in section e as well to write for
 
00:33:59.310 --> 00:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
the phas in just for for clarity I I
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
understand what we're trying to do I I
 
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
think if if I can speak for
 
00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
representative walner um I think the
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
goal is to have that done that way and
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
that would be the easiest and cleanest
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
way because we're going to end up
 
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
repealing chapter or section e at some
 
00:34:16.589 --> 00:34:16.599 align:start position:0%
point for this amendment and we don't
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
want that notwithstanding language to be
 
00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
repealed in the future okay um could I
 
00:34:25.589 --> 00:34:25.599 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to work with the
 
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
people who actually worked on the draft
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
drafting of this and um come
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
back this afternoon with the cleaned up
 
00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment Mr chair yeah if I may this is
 
00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:41.919 align:start position:0%
actually a fair amount of redrafting is
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
it acceptable that we take the first
 
00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:47.800 align:start position:0%
five minutes of our 1:00 Finance to
 
00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
actually meet as division
 
00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
three that gives two hours to work out
 
00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:55.480 align:start position:0%
the amendment the language and have
 
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
something so and five or 5 minutes to
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
one so I I suggest you I think you're
 
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
suggesting we recess to uh
 
00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
1250 uh on on um this
 
00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
amendment any objections to that no all
 
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
recess um all
 
00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
right so that was 463
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
596 uh is something that we want to
 
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
discuss in full are there any other
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
Strays in here where we said that we
 
00:35:41.109 --> 00:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
verbally we accepted an amendment but we
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
haven't yet seen the amendment I think I
 
00:35:47.069 --> 00:35:47.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:50.589 --> 00:35:50.599 align:start position:0%
right I don't have any others all right
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
okay so with that uh I think we've
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
tightened up our Loose Ends from last
 
00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
week uh and now let's go back up to
 
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
um the Committee hearing or the work
 
00:36:06.309 --> 00:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
session on S SP
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
596 uh I I think I may have a an
 
00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
amendment to that and is there are there
 
00:36:13.309 --> 00:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
any other amendments that we should
 
00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
consider as part of 596 I think
 
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
representative wal's amendment was
 
00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:25.309 --> 00:36:25.319 align:start position:0%
Friday yes I see it it was uh
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:33.599 --> 00:36:35.550 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:40.589 align:start position:0%
yeah
yeah

00:36:40.589 --> 00:36:40.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
yeah lots of American History all
 
00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
right so does everyone have their copy
 
00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:55.950 --> 00:36:55.960 align:start position:0%
week oh if I can borrow one from
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
somebody yeah I have a couple
 
00:37:15.270 --> 00:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:18.190 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:18.200 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:04.309 --> 00:38:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
1933 so I would like
 
00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
to um bring up the amendment that just
 
00:38:22.309 --> 00:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
got to you uh
 
00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
1933 um and I guess I should have a
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:33.589 --> 00:38:33.599 align:start position:0%
motion sure I would move the adoption of
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
amendment 1933
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
H I'll second for the purpose of
 
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
discussion all right so uh so let me
 
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
explain uh what's going on uh with this
 
00:38:49.309 --> 00:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
amendment what this amendment takes into
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
consideration is that there are a lot of
 
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
moving Parts in terms of how 596 would
 
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
actually get implemented uh we um we
 
00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:03.560 align:start position:0%
push off from the the dock a bit in
 
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
terms in 596 saying that we uh aren't
 
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
going we we're going to change the
 
00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:14.720 align:start position:0%
definition of special needs or at risk
 
00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:19.839 align:start position:0%
kids um we we state that uh those that
 
00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
are considered to be at risk now or if
 
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
in the risk of in future risk
 
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
that uh they would basically um be
 
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:35.720 align:start position:0%
assessed or determined to be uh
 
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
qualified for this program based on a a
 
00:39:43.910 --> 00:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
child assessment the the criteria for
 
00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
selecting the assessment tool is not in
 
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
here at all so we don't really know what
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
we're doing in terms of expanding the
 
00:39:58.030 --> 00:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
eligibility for this uh this this grant
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
um the rules
 
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
around um who can do the assessment and
 
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
what kind of assessment they should
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
use is is not defined in
 
00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
596 um if we spend additional money
 
00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
because we have additional kids that are
 
00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:24.079 align:start position:0%
at risk there's nothing in 596 that says
 
00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
how that money would be spent there's
 
00:40:28.109 --> 00:40:28.119 align:start position:0%
nothing that says
 
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
that if we spend this money these are
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
our expectations of what will happen if
 
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
we spend the money if we give you money
 
00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.079 align:start position:0%
what will you do in return for the
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
additional money that's totally silent
 
00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:43.720 align:start position:0%
on that and so as I uh was relooking at
 
00:40:45.829 --> 00:40:45.839 align:start position:0%
this with uh in a conversation with the
 
00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
Department last night um I was reminded
 
00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:51.640 align:start position:0%
that the Senate initially had put this
 
00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:55.960 align:start position:0%
into interim study and then uh for some
 
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
reason went ahead and and passed it and
 
00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
sent us sent it to us as I look at it
 
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
it's still not cooked there are too many
 
00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
details should should we require uh a
 
00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
minimum of a bachelor's qualified
 
00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
individual to do conduct the assessment
 
00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:14.440 align:start position:0%
it's silent on the qualifications of who
 
00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
does the assessment really should it be
 
00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:18.680 align:start position:0%
a some people would say no it's got to
 
00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:21.800 align:start position:0%
be at least a master's trained person so
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
so I I I would like us to put this into
 
00:41:27.750 --> 00:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
a study committee this does the study
 
00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
committee the uh uh it would be composed
 
00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
of of
 
00:41:37.870 --> 00:41:37.880 align:start position:0%
um you know legislative representation
 
00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
to keep it a committee instead of a
 
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
commission um but that the committee is
 
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
being requested to invite the design of
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
the DHHS commissioner uh the design from
 
00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education uh get a
 
00:41:56.589 --> 00:41:56.599 align:start position:0%
child care provider in there um get the
 
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
mental health resource uh in there uh
 
00:42:02.829 --> 00:42:02.839 align:start position:0%
representative or early supports
 
00:42:04.349 --> 00:42:04.359 align:start position:0%
representative from the public school
 
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
presi grw program and a representative
 
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
from Head Start so it it feels a little
 
00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:12.280 align:start position:0%
bit like a commission without being one
 
00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:13.960 align:start position:0%
because I think we can get it up and get
 
00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
it going faster that way so um so that I
 
00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
I would I would like your support for
 
00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
this I I I'm I'm not opposed to the bill
 
00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
but the bill 596 as is right now is just
 
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
um got too many Loose Ends it's too wide
 
00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
open and we don't we don't know what the
 
00:42:36.349 --> 00:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
financial implication of it is really we
 
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
don't know how who the affected
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
population is we don't know who's going
 
00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
to conduct the assessments we don't know
 
00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
which assessments are going to be used
 
00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh we don't know what obligations will
 
00:42:48.309 --> 00:42:48.319 align:start position:0%
be incurred by the people that accept
 
00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
the money for the additional population
 
00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:53.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's just a whole lot of
 
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
uncertainty at this point representative
 
00:42:58.030 --> 00:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
walner would you like to comment
 
00:43:01.069 --> 00:43:01.079 align:start position:0%
well I'm I'm sort of disappointed that
 
00:43:03.309 --> 00:43:03.319 align:start position:0%
we're going
 
00:43:07.270 --> 00:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
from something that would really be
 
00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:08.589 align:start position:0%
from something that would really be
beneficial

00:43:08.589 --> 00:43:08.599 align:start position:0%
beneficial
 
00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:12.280 align:start position:0%
to some children in our state who um
 
00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:15.880 align:start position:0%
definitely need need some additional
 
00:43:19.230 --> 00:43:19.240 align:start position:0%
supports in order to be in a Child Care
 
00:43:22.349 --> 00:43:22.359 align:start position:0%
Program um I do want to remind you that
 
00:43:24.349 --> 00:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
this is not a new
 
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
program the department already has a
 
00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:31.240 align:start position:0%
program like this what it does is it
 
00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
basically allows
 
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
for children with disabil children with
 
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
that are have disabilities that are
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
identified through the through an
 
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
assessment tool um the department
 
00:43:49.829 --> 00:43:49.839 align:start position:0%
already has a verification of children
 
00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
with special needs that they a child
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
have that they have to receive from the
 
00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
provider um the very
 
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
ification has to include a
 
00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:05.319 align:start position:0%
description of um what kinds of things
 
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
the child will receive in order to meet
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
their special their special need um so
 
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
this is really just an an expansion of a
 
00:44:19.630 --> 00:44:19.640 align:start position:0%
program that already exists and allows a
 
00:44:22.829 --> 00:44:22.839 align:start position:0%
group of children who have the potential
 
00:44:25.549 --> 00:44:25.559 align:start position:0%
to have serious
 
00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
um serious
 
00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:30.920 align:start position:0%
disabilities and particularly I think
 
00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:32.270 align:start position:0%
disabilities and particularly I think
around

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:34.760 align:start position:0%
behavior and we're allow these children
 
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:37.960 align:start position:0%
to be in child care with some extra
 
00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
supports I think at this point a lot of
 
00:44:43.349 --> 00:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
children who have these kinds of um
 
00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:47.359 align:start position:0%
issues are excluded from child care and
 
00:44:49.549 --> 00:44:49.559 align:start position:0%
um this what this bill would have done
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
is allow a few of those children in this
 
00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
was not a large number of children and
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
the program itself the way it is now is
 
00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
number are there other comments
 
00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.309 align:start position:0%
number are there other comments
representative

00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
whole thank you Mr chair in reviewing
 
00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
the language as sent over by the Senate
 
00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
we're trying to use arpa funds to get
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
this in place with no um effectively no
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
generals funding used not to exceed
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
$1 my concern is we start this program
 
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:25.480 align:start position:0%
with arpa funds and the next thing that
 
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
happens is the arpa funds have run out
 
00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:29.720 align:start position:0%
and we're back here in this committee
 
00:45:31.109 --> 00:45:31.119 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how we're funding
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
this in the next bium so I think um the
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
study committee does some of this and we
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
can make sure that that funding issue is
 
00:45:43.309 --> 00:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
also part of what they look
 
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
into go ahead I just want I did want to
 
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
just um remind people that in the
 
00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
amendment that I brought in on Friday
 
00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
the um funding of this was for the
 
00:45:57.910 --> 00:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Services may
 
00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
use federal funds where
 
00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
available and the general funds can be
 
00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:08.680 align:start position:0%
used that are already in the existing um
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
budget of this of the uh Health and
 
00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
Human Services committee Health and
 
00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
Human Services Department so it would
 
00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
not require any additional appropriation
 
00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:22.760 align:start position:0%
at this point and like I said there is
 
00:46:26.549 --> 00:46:26.559 align:start position:0%
an existing program um I think the spin
 
00:46:26.559 --> 00:46:27.870 align:start position:0%
an existing program um I think the spin
down

00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:27.880 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
from what we appropriated in those lines
 
00:46:35.549 --> 00:46:35.559 align:start position:0%
I think the spin down has been um low in
 
00:46:35.559 --> 00:46:36.349 align:start position:0%
I think the spin down has been um low in
the

00:46:36.349 --> 00:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
last couple of years actually so there
 
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
may be some funds available in those
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
lines so so would you believe that I
 
00:46:48.309 --> 00:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
agree completely with your intent but
 
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
I'm completely convinced that
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
596 is not written well enough and
 
00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
comprehensive enough to be a good bill
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
so I I I just assume put this into a
 
00:47:02.549 --> 00:47:02.559 align:start position:0%
study committee so that we do it right
 
00:47:05.069 --> 00:47:05.079 align:start position:0%
and we take care of this population uh
 
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
professionally and
 
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
appropriately representa hold did you
 
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
have another comment because I I really
 
00:47:12.109 --> 00:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
want to vote we got to keep going do
 
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:15.640 align:start position:0%
what move on we can move on okay so we
 
00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:21.400 align:start position:0%
have uh a motion to adopt um 1933
 
00:47:24.589 --> 00:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
Amendment um to
 
00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
596 are are you ready for
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
vote oh yeah yeah yeah yeah so because
 
00:47:33.589 --> 00:47:33.599 align:start position:0%
it's an amendment we can do this by show
 
00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
hands if you're in favor of that
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment please raise your
 
00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:41.079 align:start position:0%
hand if you're
 
00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:49.960 align:start position:0%
um so that's 43 we're missing uh a
 
00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
republican today and we're missing a
 
00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
Democrat today so I I I think the
 
00:47:56.589 --> 00:47:56.599 align:start position:0%
outcome is the same as it would have
 
00:47:56.599 --> 00:47:57.390 align:start position:0%
outcome is the same as it would have
been

00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:48:01.349 --> 00:48:01.359 align:start position:0%
given the partisan nature of that vat so
 
00:48:04.589 --> 00:48:04.599 align:start position:0%
um uh is do
 
00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for taking my question um
 
00:48:13.309 --> 00:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
is it is it um in order to to consider
 
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
talk what were you thinking
 
00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:27.240 align:start position:0%
representative priest um would like to
 
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
make a motion to approve Amendment
 
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:32.270 align:start position:0%
make a motion to approve Amendment
2024

00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
2024
 
00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:34.030 align:start position:0%
2024
1864

00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
1864
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
H okay and we all have a copy of that
 
00:48:38.589 --> 00:48:38.599 align:start position:0%
that is the walner amendment it was
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
given to us last Friday okay is that
 
00:48:44.109 --> 00:48:44.119 align:start position:0%
motion seconded I'll entertain that
 
00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
motion I'll second for the okay second
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
by representative hle representative
 
00:48:49.710 --> 00:48:49.720 align:start position:0%
priest would you like to speak to your
 
00:48:51.549 --> 00:48:51.559 align:start position:0%
motion or representative walner either
 
00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
one or both representative priest
 
00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
starting with you yeah okay um again I
 
00:48:58.589 --> 00:48:58.599 align:start position:0%
think this kind of answers the question
 
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
that was raised that if the funding did
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
not exist in the current budget what
 
00:49:09.870 --> 00:49:09.880 align:start position:0%
would happen to this program so um I I
 
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
feel very strong that this would add to
 
00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:18.349 align:start position:0%
feel very strong that this would add to
SB

00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
596 represent thank you Mr chairman um
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
unfortunately Mr White isn't here um to
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
represent the department where they are
 
00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
financially otherwise I would pose my
 
00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:30.280 align:start position:0%
question to him but it is my
 
00:49:31.789 --> 00:49:31.799 align:start position:0%
understanding in various conversations
 
00:49:33.950 --> 00:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
I've had with him that they are looking
 
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
at having trouble meeting the requested
 
00:49:39.069 --> 00:49:39.079 align:start position:0%
is it Reserve or whatever money that
 
00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:41.240 align:start position:0%
comes back already and that there's just
 
00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
not necessarily money in DHHS or extra
 
00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
money that they can dispose at this
 
00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
point to get another
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
program that that's a good observation I
 
00:49:54.589 --> 00:49:54.599 align:start position:0%
I my observation is that this completely
 
00:49:57.630 --> 00:49:57.640 align:start position:0%
uh becomes moot if uh my Amendment holds
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
up if uh 13 1933 holds up then 1864
 
00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:07.480 align:start position:0%
becomes Moot and I would oppose uh an
 
00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:08.990 align:start position:0%
becomes Moot and I would oppose uh an
1864

00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
1864
 
00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
vote uh we can do a show of
 
00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
hands uh on uh Amendment 1864 to 596 if
 
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
you're in favor raise your
 
00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:23.480 align:start position:0%
hand uh if you're opposed raise your
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
hand the amendment fails
 
00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:31.640 align:start position:0%
uh so we need an otpa motion on 596 so
 
00:50:35.069 --> 00:50:35.079 align:start position:0%
moved uh with uh
 
00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:39.400 align:start position:0%

00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
those as well so we want to be open to
 
00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
the uh public for that um is it did you
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
say something YouTube oh is it YouTube
 
00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
yes it is YouTube I think they that uh
 
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:03.000 align:start position:0%
it's not Tik Tok but it's still okay um
 
00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:05.240 align:start position:0%
all right well welcome thank
 
00:53:08.670 --> 00:53:08.680 align:start position:0%
you all right um this is this is a this
 
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
is a work session this is a little
 
00:53:11.789 --> 00:53:11.799 align:start position:0%
different than many of the hearings that
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
you might go to most of the hearings are
 
00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
by policy committees that take a look at
 
00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:19.720 align:start position:0%
a new bill um and determine whether or
 
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
not they want to support the policy then
 
00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:24.280 align:start position:0%
it comes over to finance after the house
 
00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
passes it Finance figures out
 
00:53:29.829 --> 00:53:29.839 align:start position:0%
how how the finances would work we
 
00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:31.640 align:start position:0%
usually have a public session where we
 
00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:33.640 align:start position:0%
get smarter we invite people to talk to
 
00:53:36.270 --> 00:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
us and then we do a work session where
 
00:53:38.549 --> 00:53:38.559 align:start position:0%
we determine amongst the committee
 
00:53:40.789 --> 00:53:40.799 align:start position:0%
members what how we want to pursue a
 
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
bill so uh so that's what today is today
 
00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:46.280 align:start position:0%
we're not really looking for public
 
00:53:48.789 --> 00:53:48.799 align:start position:0%
input to this process but we're we're
 
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
conducting the meeting transparently so
 
00:53:53.789 --> 00:53:53.799 align:start position:0%
that folks know what we think is going
 
00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
on so with that I think I think
 
00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:00.190 align:start position:0%
on so with that I think I think
we're

00:54:00.190 --> 00:54:00.200 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
at Let's do let's do 499 next uh because
 
00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:09.160 align:start position:0%
1417 I'm not sure how long that'll last
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:18.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment and then I think there's I
 
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's a new wner yes
 
00:54:22.510 --> 00:54:22.520 align:start position:0%
there is is there a new a whole
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment are you going with what you
 
00:54:24.319 --> 00:54:26.710 align:start position:0%
Amendment are you going with what you
had

00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
oh excuse me I'm on 499 sorry on 417
 
00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
there is a minor tweak based on the
 
00:54:35.309 --> 00:54:35.319 align:start position:0%
feedback rev relative to Kin and
 
00:54:37.789 --> 00:54:37.799 align:start position:0%
effective kin I tweak the language there
 
00:54:39.589 --> 00:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
um so there yes there is a new Amendment
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
but IT addresses the concerns expressed
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
during Friday's exact session all
 
00:54:49.349 --> 00:54:49.359 align:start position:0%
right so so where did we leave it on 499
 
00:54:53.789 --> 00:54:53.799 align:start position:0%
499 uh the the the division voted it out
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
basically uh stripping most of the the
 
00:54:59.870 --> 00:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
provisions of 499 and keeping in place
 
00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
an amendment that instead just focused
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
on adding um uh changes to the senior
 
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
eligibility system so that they
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
could um have their uh authorization
 
00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:16.280 align:start position:0%
last three years instead of one and the
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
like uh with that was Amendment
 
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
1650 uh the torki amendment 1917
 
00:55:31.029 --> 00:55:31.039 align:start position:0%
does um more than that and since
 
00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:32.920 align:start position:0%
representative tki could not be here
 
00:55:35.069 --> 00:55:35.079 align:start position:0%
today I think representative walner is
 
00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:37.960 align:start position:0%
going to speak on her behalf one one of
 
00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:40.559 align:start position:0%
my first questions for you would be
 
00:55:44.430 --> 00:55:44.440 align:start position:0%
representative walner um is is this this
 
00:55:46.829 --> 00:55:46.839 align:start position:0%
is meant to replace completely the
 
00:55:49.270 --> 00:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
amendment 1650 or it's meant to
 
00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
supplement it to replace okay the uh
 
00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:55.960 align:start position:0%
part that we that was voted on by this
 
00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:57.069 align:start position:0%
part that we that was voted on by this
division

00:55:57.069 --> 00:55:57.079 align:start position:0%
division
 
00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
Vision last week I think it was is on p
 
00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
on the second page um line
 
00:56:07.549 --> 00:56:07.559 align:start position:0%
24 I I see it on I see it on the first
 
00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:09.160 align:start position:0%
page on lines
 
00:56:14.349 --> 00:56:14.359 align:start position:0%
15 through 18 the elderly s yes and then
 
00:56:20.309 --> 00:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
again on um on line 24 yeah okay so so
 
00:56:22.990 --> 00:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
this so This does everything we said we
 
00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
do and now you want to talk about what
 
00:56:27.950 --> 00:56:27.960 align:start position:0%
else it would do it would as everyone on
 
00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
the division I'm sure remembers this
 
00:56:34.589 --> 00:56:34.599 align:start position:0%
would add back in the additional funds
 
00:56:35.870 --> 00:56:35.880 align:start position:0%
that would come from the federal
 
00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:39.640 align:start position:0%
government to families through their EBT
 
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
um card it um they call it summer EBT
 
00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
it's for CH it's to help families um
 
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
have a little extra money and this is
 
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
not a lot of money but it's meaningful
 
00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
if you're a very low-income family
 
00:56:59.230 --> 00:56:59.240 align:start position:0%
so for the summer I believe it's
 
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
$120 for the summer so that's about $10
 
00:57:04.349 --> 00:57:04.359 align:start position:0%
a week per
 
00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:07.160 align:start position:0%
child um that would this would be
 
00:57:09.150 --> 00:57:09.160 align:start position:0%
available and I think you have to
 
00:57:11.029 --> 00:57:11.039 align:start position:0%
remember who we're talking about these
 
00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
are extremely low-income families who
 
00:57:17.109 --> 00:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
need additional
 
00:57:20.109 --> 00:57:20.119 align:start position:0%
funds to purchase food every month of
 
00:57:23.029 --> 00:57:23.039 align:start position:0%
the year not just the summer but this is
 
00:57:25.710 --> 00:57:25.720 align:start position:0%
what is available um New Hampshire is
 
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
not doing this at this time but has done
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
it during during the pandemic so um it
 
00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:35.720 align:start position:0%
would end up bringing in for these
 
00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:38.440 align:start position:0%
families about
 
00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
4.3 million million dollar in EBT
 
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
benefits significant amount of money in
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um to provide food for
 
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
families um because a uh little birdie
 
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
told me maybe the way we should look at
 
00:57:57.150 --> 00:57:57.160 align:start position:0%
this is to look at the
 
00:58:02.029 --> 00:58:02.039 align:start position:0%
appropriation by um categories so that's
 
00:58:03.589 --> 00:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
why you see the
 
00:58:06.150 --> 00:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
appropriation somewhat different than we
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
usually see Appropriations usually we're
 
00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:11.240 align:start position:0%
seeing Appropriations just one big lump
 
00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:13.880 align:start position:0%
sum of money and that's the way it came
 
00:58:17.230 --> 00:58:17.240 align:start position:0%
but this breaks the appropriation down
 
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
um and talks about how much is for
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
personnel how much is for the EBT cards
 
00:58:27.029 --> 00:58:27.039 align:start position:0%
um how much is for technology so the um
 
00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
cost of the program is broken out in
 
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
this amendment that's the major reason
 
00:58:36.109 --> 00:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
the amendment looks as long as it does
 
00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
but this just and but the amendment
 
00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
itself adds back in the summer EBT
 
00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
program uh thank thank you for that and
 
00:58:48.510 --> 00:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
the one of the reasons um for full
 
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
disclosure that that I was willing to
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
reopen today's work session to uh for
 
00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:56.589 align:start position:0%
reopen today's work session to uh for
$499

00:58:56.589 --> 00:58:56.599 align:start position:0%
$499
 
00:59:00.789 --> 00:59:00.799 align:start position:0%
was um because the I spent a good deal
 
00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
of time with the Department the
 
00:59:07.230 --> 00:59:07.240 align:start position:0%
department um uh supported to them from
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
their perspective how important this is
 
00:59:13.109 --> 00:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
the um they they pointed out that if if
 
00:59:17.190 --> 00:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
if we take on these one-time Investments
 
00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
that uh that that will set us up for
 
00:59:23.789 --> 00:59:23.799 align:start position:0%
about $4.6 eight million a year in
 
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
federal money um and and so the the
 
00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
money that's going to the food is
 
00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
actually federal funds that get
 
00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
transferred onto the EBT card but we
 
00:59:38.549 --> 00:59:38.559 align:start position:0%
have to get ourselves administratively
 
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
ready to handle it that that initial
 
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
amount of money is well over a million
 
00:59:48.309 --> 00:59:48.319 align:start position:0%
dollars but it would pay uh get paid
 
00:59:51.630 --> 00:59:51.640 align:start position:0%
down basically as an investment each
 
00:59:54.829 --> 00:59:54.839 align:start position:0%
month that we collect uh the sumary EBT
 
00:59:54.839 --> 00:59:57.390 align:start position:0%
month that we collect uh the sumary EBT
program

00:59:57.390 --> 00:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
um so I went from being um completely uh
 
01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
opposed to the rest of 499 to to
 
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
becoming um where I can see both sides
 
01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
of it and uh uh and and I I I have to
 
01:00:17.069 --> 01:00:17.079 align:start position:0%
say what bothers me about
 
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
499 is that in
 
01:00:23.789 --> 01:00:23.799 align:start position:0%
2024 we're going to be unable to get the
 
01:00:28.829 --> 01:00:28.839 align:start position:0%
money to the kids and until October and
 
01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:33.039 align:start position:0%
and I think just from a program
 
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
professionalism saying that we're going
 
01:00:37.630 --> 01:00:37.640 align:start position:0%
to take care of food insecurity and
 
01:00:42.309 --> 01:00:42.319 align:start position:0%
hunger in the summer but not deliver on
 
01:00:45.549 --> 01:00:45.559 align:start position:0%
the delivering the money until October
 
01:00:47.789 --> 01:00:47.799 align:start position:0%
is is we're over
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
representing the contribution we're
 
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
making and and you could shrug and say
 
01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
well it's better to get the money later
 
01:00:56.430 --> 01:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
than never
 
01:00:58.349 --> 01:00:58.359 align:start position:0%
uh that's sort of I think the the
 
01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:01.880 align:start position:0%
Judgment there um but uh but getting it
 
01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
right before a general election coming
 
01:01:06.109 --> 01:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
from the federal money that that sort of
 
01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
reeks a little bit like politics to me
 
01:01:12.549 --> 01:01:12.559 align:start position:0%
Federal politics but still the money is
 
01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
for the kids um so so I could shrug on
 
01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
that too um and and with this investment
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
uh it's there's going to be a little bit
 
01:01:24.950 --> 01:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
more money needed for the investment in
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
the next budget about 780,000 but once
 
01:01:31.309 --> 01:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
that investment is in place it should
 
01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
generate about 4.68 million a year so um
 
01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
so I don't know that's a fairly good um
 
01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:41.960 align:start position:0%
contribution like if you look at
 
01:01:45.069 --> 01:01:45.079 align:start position:0%
Medicaid what is it we we we do a 5050
 
01:01:48.029 --> 01:01:48.039 align:start position:0%
match sometimes we do a 6040 match in
 
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
this case it would be like a a
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
2575 match in effect so I I as far as m
 
01:02:00.029 --> 01:02:00.039 align:start position:0%
relative matches go I I I'm I'm it's
 
01:02:02.069 --> 01:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
probably as as good of terms as we can
 
01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
get representative Mooney do you have
 
01:02:07.029 --> 01:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
comments this is a very sensitive
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
subject it is very sensitive no one
 
01:02:13.069 --> 01:02:13.079 align:start position:0%
wants to see anyone be hungry go away
 
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
hungry I do have three specific
 
01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
questions if it's in order to perhaps
 
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
have someone maybe Miss milin come up
 
01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:25.960 align:start position:0%
and answer them if not I understand this
 
01:02:28.109 --> 01:02:28.119 align:start position:0%
is a work session not a public input
 
01:02:31.029 --> 01:02:31.039 align:start position:0%
session uh I would like to discuss those
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
so so who would you like to have come
 
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
forward I think Miss um
 
01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
Milligan are you would are you willing
 
01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:50.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:53.789 --> 01:02:53.799 align:start position:0%
invitation at this point just thank you
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
Miss milikin I really appreciate you
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
coming up here I'm sure this wasn't
 
01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
expected but I appreciate you uh doing
 
01:03:01.309 --> 01:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
this my questions are this now this is a
 
01:03:01.319 --> 01:03:03.510 align:start position:0%
this my questions are this now this is a
summer

01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
summer
 
01:03:07.470 --> 01:03:07.480 align:start position:0%
EBT hunger program summer different from
 
01:03:09.470 --> 01:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
school year different from after the
 
01:03:11.549 --> 01:03:11.559 align:start position:0%
Bell different from free and reduced
 
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
lunch so my questions are these number
 
01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
one what is the security in terms of
 
01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
being sure the child receives the food
 
01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:24.680 align:start position:0%
in schools naturally we are sure that
 
01:03:26.829 --> 01:03:26.839 align:start position:0%
child will be fed there's plenty of
 
01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
supervision in a school building that
 
01:03:30.670 --> 01:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
that child directly receives the food
 
01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:32.440 align:start position:0%
I'm curious how that works in the
 
01:03:35.789 --> 01:03:35.799 align:start position:0%
summer second question where does the
 
01:03:38.589 --> 01:03:38.599 align:start position:0%
child obtain this food during the summer
 
01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
once again in a school year we know
 
01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
exactly where it comes from and we know
 
01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
exactly where it goes I'm curious how
 
01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
that works now in the
 
01:03:51.069 --> 01:03:51.079 align:start position:0%
summer number three what is the
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
oversight to see if this is working
 
01:03:54.319 --> 01:03:56.029 align:start position:0%
oversight to see if this is working
specifically

01:03:56.029 --> 01:03:56.039 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
what percentage is wasted what
 
01:04:00.630 --> 01:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
percentage is nutritious what
 
01:04:04.349 --> 01:04:04.359 align:start position:0%
isn't are the portions
 
01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
sufficient who oversees that who
 
01:04:11.309 --> 01:04:11.319 align:start position:0%
monitors that to report back that this
 
01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
investment was wisely made and that
 
01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
there is a you know a report on it later
 
01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
on of the things I mentioned so those
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
are my three very directed questions
 
01:04:24.309 --> 01:04:24.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
much so because this is a work session
 
01:04:29.349 --> 01:04:29.359 align:start position:0%
focusing primarily on our own dialogues
 
01:04:32.670 --> 01:04:32.680 align:start position:0%
let let me take a hack at at about the
 
01:04:35.789 --> 01:04:35.799 align:start position:0%
first two questions and then get ready
 
01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
to correct me uh and then be prepared to
 
01:04:41.309 --> 01:04:41.319 align:start position:0%
answer three Prim number three p
 
01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
primarily um okay so so this summer EBT
 
01:04:50.109 --> 01:04:50.119 align:start position:0%
program as I understand it is an
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
enhancement of the uh SNAP program which
 
01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
provides EB cards to to families and
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
they get money um from that card at a at
 
01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
a at a fixed rate the burden on that
 
01:05:08.589 --> 01:05:08.599 align:start position:0%
snap fund is reduced in in effect during
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
the summer because the kids are getting
 
01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
supplemental food so so although the the
 
01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:17.240 align:start position:0%
the basic snap funding doesn't change
 
01:05:20.910 --> 01:05:20.920 align:start position:0%
year round the demand on the family
 
01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
snap budget goes up during the summer
 
01:05:27.109 --> 01:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
relative to the school year because the
 
01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
kid is not being fed at school so so
 
01:05:33.309 --> 01:05:33.319 align:start position:0%
what this program is intended to do is
 
01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
to take that snap card and enhance the
 
01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:39.279 align:start position:0%
amount that the federal government puts
 
01:05:42.349 --> 01:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
on that EBT card uh during the summer
 
01:05:42.359 --> 01:05:44.029 align:start position:0%
on that EBT card uh during the summer
months

01:05:44.029 --> 01:05:44.039 align:start position:0%
months
 
01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
to help address some of the incremental
 
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
change in the family's demands during
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
the summer because they don't have food
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
available through the schools so it's
 
01:05:57.549 --> 01:05:57.559 align:start position:0%
it's so the card is in the possession of
 
01:06:02.190 --> 01:06:02.200 align:start position:0%
a responsible adult uh in in theory and
 
01:06:04.589 --> 01:06:04.599 align:start position:0%
that the responsible adult is using the
 
01:06:08.829 --> 01:06:08.839 align:start position:0%
EBT card properly you know in theory to
 
01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:11.240 align:start position:0%
to buy food at grocery stores and the
 
01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
like and to prepare the food at home or
 
01:06:18.269 --> 01:06:18.279 align:start position:0%
wherever um so um so the snap program
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
basically is is the summer EBT program
 
01:06:25.069 --> 01:06:25.079 align:start position:0%
with kind of a bump up of $40 per kid
 
01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
per month during the summer uh that's
 
01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
the way I understand the summer EBT
 
01:06:34.029 --> 01:06:34.039 align:start position:0%
program have I mated any of that so
 
01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:36.200 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely so I'm Laura milikin
 
01:06:37.829 --> 01:06:37.839 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire hunger Solutions
 
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um you have stated it
 
01:06:42.670 --> 01:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely correctly for families that
 
01:06:44.190 --> 01:06:44.200 align:start position:0%
are already on
 
01:06:47.549 --> 01:06:47.559 align:start position:0%
snap um the summer EBT program is
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
available to any uh child who is
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
eligible for the free and reduced lunch
 
01:06:55.829 --> 01:06:55.839 align:start position:0%
program during the school year and some
 
01:06:59.029 --> 01:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
of those kids are not on Snap so
 
01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799 align:start position:0%
families who are not on snap um can
 
01:07:05.029 --> 01:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
apply through the department to receive
 
01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
vote funds they would get an EBT card
 
01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
which works just like Snap but it's not
 
01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
in fact a snap uh EBT card but it works
 
01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
just the same it's only um able to be
 
01:07:18.109 --> 01:07:18.119 align:start position:0%
used on
 
01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
food um so and those dollars you know of
 
01:07:24.990 --> 01:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
course are spent um at local grocery
 
01:07:27.029 --> 01:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
stores and New
 
01:07:30.269 --> 01:07:30.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire do you have comments on on
 
01:07:32.269 --> 01:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
either response to the first two
 
01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
questions and then the third question
 
01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
could could you read what you think the
 
01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
third question is and address it so I
 
01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
believe it was about oversight and
 
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
whether the program is working is that
 
01:07:44.670 --> 01:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
the is that the
 
01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
question uh to clarify yes oversight in
 
01:07:49.549 --> 01:07:49.559 align:start position:0%
terms of right is the program working
 
01:07:54.430 --> 01:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
with regards to um minimal waste the
 
01:07:58.349 --> 01:07:58.359 align:start position:0%
portions being efficient the food being
 
01:08:01.349 --> 01:08:01.359 align:start position:0%
of a nutritious
 
01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
value right so um the nice part about uh
 
01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
an EBT card uh in the snap program or in
 
01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
the summer EBT program is that families
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
can make the choices that fit their own
 
01:08:16.829 --> 01:08:16.839 align:start position:0%
food needs um including their cultural
 
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
needs including their uh Health dietary
 
01:08:24.349 --> 01:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
needs um and so they families make that
 
01:08:28.110 --> 01:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
choice at the grow grocery store um so
 
01:08:29.309 --> 01:08:29.319 align:start position:0%
it's you
 
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
know there are programs where you get
 
01:08:39.030 --> 01:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
whatever uh is on offer um at the pickup
 
01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
and this is able to be um tailored by by
 
01:08:46.709 --> 01:08:46.719 align:start position:0%
the family to meet the child's actual
 
01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
needs thank you again for well I just
 
01:08:52.030 --> 01:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
want to thank Miss Milligan again for uh
 
01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
coming forward and being so informative
 
01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
throughout this process thank you thank
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
you representative thank you Mr chair I
 
01:08:59.149 --> 01:08:59.159 align:start position:0%
have two questions
 
01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
for Miss milin I do if she would be
 
01:09:04.590 --> 01:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
willing to take these so one is relative
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
to the restrictions on EBT card use for
 
01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
instance if it's in if it's under the
 
01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
control of the parent could they buy a
 
01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
case of cocacola or a bag of chips
 
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
versus buying something in the dairy
 
01:09:20.709 --> 01:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
aisle is there any restrictions on how
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
these cards are used when it falls under
 
01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
food food is broadly defined
 
01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
so I think um there are not restrictions
 
01:09:34.110 --> 01:09:34.120 align:start position:0%
on uh the kind of food bought as long as
 
01:09:36.269 --> 01:09:36.279 align:start position:0%
it is food it cannot be alcohol it
 
01:09:39.229 --> 01:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
cannot be cannot be diapers um it must
 
01:09:43.749 --> 01:09:43.759 align:start position:0%
be food okay um and you know to uh
 
01:09:46.590 --> 01:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
to uh representative Mooney's question
 
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
these are a tiny number of benefits so
 
01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
families are making the choices that
 
01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
meet their needs from both a health
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
perspective but also a Financial
 
01:09:58.350 --> 01:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
perspective if I only have a couple of
 
01:10:00.790 --> 01:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
dollars a month that I might choose a
 
01:10:02.910 --> 01:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
big bag of chips instead of something
 
01:10:06.350 --> 01:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
healthier because it will go further
 
01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
okay um second question right this is as
 
01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
the chairman had said earlier this is a
 
01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
program where the funds won't be
 
01:10:17.070 --> 01:10:17.080 align:start position:0%
available until the October time frame
 
01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
based on the current
 
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
implementation what is the is there
 
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
anything that would restrict us from
 
01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
trying to implement this during next
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
budget cycle since next summer would be
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
impacted directly
 
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
there uh and and you you you'll have a
 
01:10:40.830 --> 01:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
chance to respond I I just wanted to uh
 
01:10:43.470 --> 01:10:43.480 align:start position:0%
point out to representative H that his
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
thinking and my thinking on this have a
 
01:10:47.709 --> 01:10:47.719 align:start position:0%
lot of similarities and I went down the
 
01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
same track and I I'd been probing the
 
01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
department on uh how much would we
 
01:10:57.229 --> 01:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
reduce from this investment if we only
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
focused on
 
01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
2025 if we if we went ahead and said
 
01:11:04.110 --> 01:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
look we just can't do a professional
 
01:11:06.669 --> 01:11:06.679 align:start position:0%
program in 24 that delivers on any
 
01:11:09.470 --> 01:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
promises that are going to get
 
01:11:11.669 --> 01:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
made kids are going to be hungry in the
 
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
summer expecting to get money in October
 
01:11:17.550 --> 01:11:17.560 align:start position:0%
it it just is not a good way to do
 
01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
business so I tried to carve off the 24
 
01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
piece but it had a relatively
 
01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:25.550 align:start position:0%
piece but it had a relatively
inconsequential

01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
inconsequential
 
01:11:28.950 --> 01:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
impact on the money needed to invest to
 
01:11:30.910 --> 01:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
get ready for
 
01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
25 that I rationalized we may as well
 
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
keep 24 in there as well because we're
 
01:11:40.709 --> 01:11:40.719 align:start position:0%
we're spending the infrastructure to get
 
01:11:45.709 --> 01:11:45.719 align:start position:0%
ready in any case um I just um so to me
 
01:11:48.229 --> 01:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
it was a tradeoff it's not good it's not
 
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
attractive it's not anything to be proud
 
01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
of in terms of of great implementation
 
01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
but I think it does deliver a little bit
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
more money to families that could use
 
01:12:02.669 --> 01:12:02.679 align:start position:0%
some food assistance that that my that's
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
my position or what I'm thinking I could
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
I could argue the other side of it on
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
depending on how grouchy I am but so
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative or Excuse Me Miss milikin
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
do you want want to comment I agree with
 
01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
what you said
 
01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
um the bulk of the costs are one-time
 
01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
yeah this is over a million in setup
 
01:12:33.149 --> 01:12:33.159 align:start position:0%
costs and this population should already
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
be qualified for other programs so this
 
01:12:38.910 --> 01:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
is a an addition to programs they're
 
01:12:41.229 --> 01:12:41.239 align:start position:0%
already qualified for to ensure they get
 
01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
fed so it's it seems like we're spending
 
01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
a million dollars setting up a program
 
01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
for people that already have provisions
 
01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
and and like my town we have the town
 
01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:53.560 align:start position:0%
sets up a program for anybody that's
 
01:12:55.870 --> 01:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
hungry and especially in the summertime
 
01:12:58.430 --> 01:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of fresh produce available
 
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
that gets distributed through the food
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
pantry so I'm I'm not in favor this I
 
01:13:05.629 --> 01:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
think it's an extra program that does
 
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
very little because it spends a million
 
01:13:10.350 --> 01:13:10.360 align:start position:0%
dollars to put people in who are already
 
01:13:13.390 --> 01:13:13.400 align:start position:0%
already eligible to be fed and gets
 
01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
spends more money thank you all right um
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
so we're still talking about uh
 
01:13:20.159 --> 01:13:21.550 align:start position:0%
so we're still talking about uh
Amendment

01:13:21.550 --> 01:13:21.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:13:25.229 --> 01:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
1917 if there's no further discussion I
 
01:13:29.149 --> 01:13:29.159 align:start position:0%
would like to uh go ahead and recess
 
01:13:32.229 --> 01:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
s499 so that uh we we each have an
 
01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to caucus and come back when
 
01:13:38.669 --> 01:13:38.679 align:start position:0%
when we when we recess and come back
 
01:13:41.110 --> 01:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
we've already talked about uh picking up
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
the walner amendment to
 
01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:46.120 align:start position:0%
463 I'd like to have us ready to just
 
01:13:48.030 --> 01:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
vote it should take three minutes to
 
01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
vote on the amendment when we come back
 
01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm going to go ahead and recess
 
01:13:57.550 --> 01:13:57.560 align:start position:0%
499 um with a a a vote on this amendment
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
um prior to the 1:00 Finance meeting
 
01:14:05.189 --> 01:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:10.669 --> 01:14:10.679 align:start position:0%
PRI yes are we going to go back to SP
 
01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
417 yeah no we're about to just start it
 
01:14:15.229 --> 01:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
right now thank you for the
 
01:14:18.830 --> 01:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
clarification all right so excellent
 
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
segue give give them what they want and
 
01:14:23.790 --> 01:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
so we're going to go ahead
 
01:14:26.030 --> 01:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
representative we we have at least what
 
01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
two amendments on 417 we have uh two
 
01:14:35.629 --> 01:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
whole amendments plus one other or I'm
 
01:14:38.030 --> 01:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
only aware of the two there was 1889
 
01:14:39.629 --> 01:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
that was discussed on Friday and there's
 
01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
a replacement for that
 
01:14:44.910 --> 01:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
1923 so it it's my understanding you
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
want to withdraw uh 1889 from
 
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
consideration correct and that your new
 
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
amendment is is very similar and
 
01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
captures some of the comments made made
 
01:14:57.470 --> 01:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
in Committee hearing last week that is
 
01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
also correct all right so as Mr Ripple
 
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
hands it out um representative Lon did a
 
01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
great job summarizing the changes caught
 
01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
90% of them but not necessarily all of
 
01:15:13.149 --> 01:15:13.159 align:start position:0%
them um some place it was a merge of
 
01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
just at a high level of the Senate bill
 
01:15:18.030 --> 01:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
that came over thank you for
 
01:15:21.430 --> 01:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
coming and representative wier's
 
01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment merged together with minor
 
01:15:24.239 --> 01:15:25.750 align:start position:0%
Amendment merged together with minor
changes

01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:25.760 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:15:28.470 --> 01:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
um and I will quickly run through these
 
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
right um line page one line six it went
 
01:15:33.350 --> 01:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
from less restrictive to leas
 
01:15:36.189 --> 01:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
restrictive you guys discussed that um
 
01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
this leaves it where it is in current
 
01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
law it does add here that and there's a
 
01:15:43.390 --> 01:15:43.400 align:start position:0%
minor change on lines 13 14 from what
 
01:15:45.550 --> 01:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
you saw on Friday because we flipped
 
01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:47.679 align:start position:0%
judicial oversight and written approval
 
01:15:51.070 --> 01:15:51.080 align:start position:0%
The Way It Was Written was the you
 
01:15:53.070 --> 01:15:53.080 align:start position:0%
needed written approval of the judicial
 
01:15:57.070 --> 01:15:57.080 align:start position:0%
branch as well as approval of DCF this
 
01:15:59.870 --> 01:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
is just right o increased oversight by
 
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch written approval by
 
01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
DCF um this was discussed on Friday no
 
01:16:11.189 --> 01:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
changes here in lines 24 through 31
 
01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
right it changes the default that this
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
person hasn't been charged with any
 
01:16:17.669 --> 01:16:17.679 align:start position:0%
abuse or neglect they are deemed to be a
 
01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
fit parent the presumption is they are
 
01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
innocent um however the department can
 
01:16:24.430 --> 01:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
challenge that if they believe they have
 
01:16:27.149 --> 01:16:27.159 align:start position:0%
sufficient evidence um minor change from
 
01:16:29.070 --> 01:16:29.080 align:start position:0%
district and family to just Circuit
 
01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
Court to be consistent with our statutes
 
01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
it does change the definition sorry the
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
standard of evidence to being clear and
 
01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence from the
 
01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
preponderance um otherwise there's no
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
changes there I apologize I'm running
 
01:16:46.270 --> 01:16:46.280 align:start position:0%
through this really quickly page
 
01:16:50.110 --> 01:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
two you know just I I I I do think you
 
01:16:52.590 --> 01:16:52.600 align:start position:0%
have some time so so don't let's let's
 
01:16:54.189 --> 01:16:54.199 align:start position:0%
go cover page one were there any
 
01:16:55.790 --> 01:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
questions on page page one before I jump
 
01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
to page
 
01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
two it sounds to me like you captured
 
01:17:04.149 --> 01:17:04.159 align:start position:0%
the feedback from the other day so
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
represent Mooney thank you
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
representative pole the whole uh
 
01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the
 
01:17:12.270 --> 01:17:12.280 align:start position:0%
evidence where does that appear in your
 
01:17:15.870 --> 01:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment that's lines 28 and
 
01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
29 of page one page one
 
01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
okay may may I make a observation on
 
01:17:25.790 --> 01:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
these l
 
01:17:28.510 --> 01:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
this was discussed last week uh we were
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
told that the standard is a
 
01:17:33.149 --> 01:17:33.159 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence as opposed
 
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
to clear and convincing evidence clear
 
01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
and convincing evidence is tends to be
 
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
more of a of standard Ed in criminal law
 
01:17:43.030 --> 01:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
and this is this is not that this is a
 
01:17:47.790 --> 01:17:47.800 align:start position:0%
form of civil procedure um I I I I was
 
01:17:50.590 --> 01:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
um affected by that comment a little bit
 
01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
and and as I got to understand uh other
 
01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
uses in New hampsh law of the term clear
 
01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
and convincing uh there are other areas
 
01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
where we do clear and convincing like if
 
01:18:05.189 --> 01:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
there's a judicial review for uh
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
issuance of a marriage license between
 
01:18:11.149 --> 01:18:11.159 align:start position:0%
somebody uh 16 and 18 they must provide
 
01:18:13.950 --> 01:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence that there
 
01:18:16.229 --> 01:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
is is is nothing wrong in that
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
relationship so I I I think we've
 
01:18:20.350 --> 01:18:20.360 align:start position:0%
already established a precedent for
 
01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing and and my concern
 
01:18:25.950 --> 01:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
about changing preponderance has changed
 
01:18:30.510 --> 01:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
I I I I support your language okay
 
01:18:34.229 --> 01:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
um the case law is the evidence is
 
01:18:35.870 --> 01:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
highly and substantially more likely to
 
01:18:39.270 --> 01:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
be true than untrue and I think if we're
 
01:18:42.310 --> 01:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
trying to take and prevent children from
 
01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
going out of state and we need an option
 
01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
in state and we need a parent or a kin
 
01:18:50.110 --> 01:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
or like kin or all the other
 
01:18:52.510 --> 01:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
combinations um there really needs to be
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
strong evidence that this family that we
 
01:18:56.149 --> 01:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
would want to put the children with is
 
01:18:59.910 --> 01:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
not suitable and clear and convincing is
 
01:19:02.110 --> 01:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
is a standard that I think is
 
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate um it gives us a a it makes
 
01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
it more than more likely than not we'll
 
01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
find an easier way to keep the children
 
01:19:12.910 --> 01:19:12.920 align:start position:0%
in state in their in their Network um
 
01:19:14.910 --> 01:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
potentially in the same location or
 
01:19:18.550 --> 01:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
relatively close and and we were trying
 
01:19:20.709 --> 01:19:20.719 align:start position:0%
with this bill not to ship as many kids
 
01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
out of state that was one of the goals
 
01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:25.110 align:start position:0%
out of state that was one of the goals
so

01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
um any other questions on page one or
 
01:19:27.870 --> 01:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
I'll jump to page
 
01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:29.870 align:start position:0%
I'll jump to page
[Applause]

01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
two seeing none page two the changes are
 
01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
on line five and lines 13 through 18
 
01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
rela this is I adopted representative
 
01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
wier's Amendment but I made changes on
 
01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
line five instead of the unique needs of
 
01:19:48.870 --> 01:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
the child I specified physical mental
 
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
emotional and medical needs which was
 
01:19:52.189 --> 01:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
part of the discussion when we had met
 
01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
the prior time and then I
 
01:19:57.030 --> 01:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
um representative Lon covered this well
 
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
in G the change was relative to the
 
01:20:02.270 --> 01:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
parents cooperation with the
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
Department's assessment instead of being
 
01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
a punishment toward the parent be an
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
encouragement for them to cooperate with
 
01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
the Department in terms of sharing
 
01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
information that um a parent who's
 
01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
cooperating with the Department um that
 
01:20:16.110 --> 01:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
will be seen as a factor in favor of
 
01:20:19.590 --> 01:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
Fitness of that parent um and then a
 
01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
small clarification on the fact that a
 
01:20:23.709 --> 01:20:23.719 align:start position:0%
parent owns a firearm shall not be made
 
01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
make a home unsafe normally weigh
 
01:20:28.669 --> 01:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
against the parent I did discuss this
 
01:20:39.189 --> 01:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
if for those for those who are listening
 
01:20:45.149 --> 01:20:45.159 align:start position:0%
online I'm handing out a copy of um RSA
 
01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
650-e negligent storage of firearms
 
01:20:50.709 --> 01:20:50.719 align:start position:0%
right concerns were ra raised relative
 
01:20:52.189 --> 01:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
to what happens with a parent who may
 
01:20:54.990 --> 01:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
not be taking care of their firearms
 
01:20:57.550 --> 01:20:57.560 align:start position:0%
um and we do have under our criminal
 
01:20:59.950 --> 01:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
code negligent storage of firearms law
 
01:21:02.590 --> 01:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
laws and I think that adequately covers
 
01:21:04.270 --> 01:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
any of the issues that were raised to me
 
01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
privately behind the scenes relative to
 
01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
the language here so I do believe that a
 
01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
parent who owns a firearm right that
 
01:21:12.030 --> 01:21:12.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't make the home unsafe right that
 
01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be used against them
 
01:21:16.910 --> 01:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
carelessness is already a criminal act
 
01:21:19.070 --> 01:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
that's a different story that would
 
01:21:20.430 --> 01:21:20.440 align:start position:0%
probably meet the burdens that we're
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
talking about separately so I don't
 
01:21:26.350 --> 01:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
think that language is is um over the
 
01:21:28.229 --> 01:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
top in any
 
01:21:33.790 --> 01:21:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:35.950 align:start position:0%
 
online

01:21:35.950 --> 01:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
online
 
01:21:39.310 --> 01:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
29 right this was the kin effective kin
 
01:21:43.149 --> 01:21:43.159 align:start position:0%
whatever it now has been replaced with
 
01:21:46.149 --> 01:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
with a related adult or kin and kin is
 
01:21:48.950 --> 01:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
using the definition of
 
01:21:52.470 --> 01:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
170-25 um Roman numeral 8 and that was
 
01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
replaced twice in this bill to address
 
01:21:59.229 --> 01:21:59.239 align:start position:0%
that the judge has some discretion
 
01:22:02.510 --> 01:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
here what is the best option with the
 
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
available list of adults or families
 
01:22:08.110 --> 01:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
that would be to help take care of the
 
01:22:11.110 --> 01:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
child so it might be a related adult it
 
01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
could be a biologically related adult as
 
01:22:17.310 --> 01:22:17.320 align:start position:0%
well it could be kin it could be a great
 
01:22:20.830 --> 01:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
uncle or it could be um the neighbor who
 
01:22:22.550 --> 01:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
happens to spend a lot of time with
 
01:22:24.990 --> 01:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
these kids all the time and that is a
 
01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
related adult and if the judge makes the
 
01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
determination that staying in that in
 
01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
that same neighborhood with the neighbor
 
01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:35.560 align:start position:0%
who he's always over that kid's house is
 
01:22:37.030 --> 01:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the child type
 
01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
thing it it's there um on behalf of some
 
01:22:42.629 --> 01:22:42.639 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I think we're
 
01:22:44.830 --> 01:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
done with the concept of fictive Ken
 
01:22:49.110 --> 01:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and then I I lines 27 and
 
01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
28 this was covered on Friday there's no
 
01:22:52.910 --> 01:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
changes here right contrary to the
 
01:22:54.990 --> 01:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
welfare of the child that's more of a
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
federal standard relative to various
 
01:23:00.430 --> 01:23:00.440 align:start position:0%
benefits and we're in keeping with
 
01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:04.280 align:start position:0%
consistent with federal law there
 
01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
um again we referenced the 170 e25
 
01:23:10.750 --> 01:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
language um
 
01:23:13.810 --> 01:23:13.820 align:start position:0%
right later on and
 
01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:15.470 align:start position:0%
right later on and
[Music]

01:23:15.470 --> 01:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:17.229 align:start position:0%
[Music]
then

01:23:17.229 --> 01:23:17.239 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:19.880 align:start position:0%
um this is basically the rest of the
 
01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
amendment is the same Mr Ripple did I
 
01:23:23.149 --> 01:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
miss something in terms of the
 
01:23:25.470 --> 01:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
modifications I would just point out not
 
01:23:27.709 --> 01:23:27.719 align:start position:0%
to revisit the kin versus fictive kin
 
01:23:29.709 --> 01:23:29.719 align:start position:0%
issue but all references to fictive Kin
 
01:23:30.990 --> 01:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
have actually been removed from this
 
01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:32.719 align:start position:0%
version not just the two that reference
 
01:23:38.149 --> 01:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.430 --> 01:23:41.440 align:start position:0%
yep so that was it um it was a minor
 
01:23:43.229 --> 01:23:43.239 align:start position:0%
list of changes from
 
01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
priday um so okay so did if folks had an
 
01:23:49.629 --> 01:23:49.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity to read representative
 
01:23:51.510 --> 01:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
Hall's initial Amendment and we just
 
01:23:53.830 --> 01:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
went over the variations from that
 
01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
amendment to this amendment um are there
 
01:23:59.910 --> 01:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
questions about either these variations
 
01:24:02.590 --> 01:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
or his initial amendment that he he
 
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
offered last week representative Mooney
 
01:24:06.350 --> 01:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
representative hle uh the amendment uh
 
01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
to me looks good however on line 2829 of
 
01:24:15.790 --> 01:24:15.800 align:start position:0%
page one that
 
01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
changing from prance of the evidence to
 
01:24:21.229 --> 01:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing I don't know if
 
01:24:22.510 --> 01:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
there's anyone who could maybe make a
 
01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
comment on that I mean that is a huge
 
01:24:27.669 --> 01:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
shift it might look uh very simple on
 
01:24:33.390 --> 01:24:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:36.189 --> 01:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
big thank you for the question I'm not
 
01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
sure if there's anybody who can speak to
 
01:24:39.870 --> 01:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
it we have an attorney in the house we
 
01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
have at least one what are the odds that
 
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
we would have an attorney here we have
 
01:24:46.189 --> 01:24:46.199 align:start position:0%
two actually
 
01:24:52.470 --> 01:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:54.990 --> 01:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
I from a state's persp perspective what
 
01:24:57.189 --> 01:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
do you what do you think the impact of
 
01:24:59.910 --> 01:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
the shifting of the evidentiary standard
 
01:25:02.709 --> 01:25:02.719 align:start position:0%
would be hi introduce yourself good
 
01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
morning eron crean general counsel for
 
01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch uh both preponderant
 
01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
of the evidence and clear and convincing
 
01:25:10.830 --> 01:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
are commonly used evidentiary standards
 
01:25:11.910 --> 01:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
that you're going to encounter
 
01:25:14.350 --> 01:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
throughout the RSA uh clear and
 
01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
convincing is the standard that we use
 
01:25:17.310 --> 01:25:17.320 align:start position:0%
for many of our bail determinations for
 
01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
example if the clear and convincing uh
 
01:25:21.669 --> 01:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
evidence does not exist the person will
 
01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
be released uh so this is a this is a
 
01:25:26.109 --> 01:25:26.119 align:start position:0%
common standard but it is certainly
 
01:25:28.149 --> 01:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
higher uh many of the other
 
01:25:30.189 --> 01:25:30.199 align:start position:0%
determinations that are made with regard
 
01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
to child's welfare are made by
 
01:25:34.030 --> 01:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence uh so this
 
01:25:35.950 --> 01:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
will be a change to a higher standard
 
01:25:38.430 --> 01:25:38.440 align:start position:0%
but it is a standard that the courts
 
01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
understand and Implement in other
 
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances as well because it's a
 
01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:43.990 align:start position:0%
circumstances as well because it's a
higher

01:25:43.990 --> 01:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
higher
 
01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
standard do do you think it would be
 
01:25:48.910 --> 01:25:48.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable for the legislation
 
01:25:52.109 --> 01:25:52.119 align:start position:0%
legislature to assume that this might
 
01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
result in in fewer REM removals of
 
01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
children from families you should
 
01:25:58.149 --> 01:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely expect a difference as a
 
01:26:00.590 --> 01:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
result of a change in this standard all
 
01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:04.400 align:start position:0%
right do you think by changing the
 
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
number of removals uh reducing the
 
01:26:09.070 --> 01:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
number of removals do you think we would
 
01:26:12.430 --> 01:26:12.440 align:start position:0%
be incurring signif it's hard for you to
 
01:26:14.830 --> 01:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
forecast this but would but but the
 
01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
trade-off there is would we be assuming
 
01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh increased risk to this uh population
 
01:26:24.030 --> 01:26:24.040 align:start position:0%
as a result of having fewer removals and
 
01:26:26.709 --> 01:26:26.719 align:start position:0%
how would we describe that risk it's
 
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
difficult for me to say how many cases
 
01:26:30.430 --> 01:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
would be changed by the move of the
 
01:26:33.270 --> 01:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
standard um this is a balancing act that
 
01:26:34.910 --> 01:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
the legislature does in many areas for
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
example by bailing more people under
 
01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing rather than
 
01:26:39.790 --> 01:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
preponderance there is potentially a
 
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
risk that they reoffend um but the
 
01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
legislature has struck a balance that
 
01:26:46.229 --> 01:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
they want there to be a high standard
 
01:26:48.510 --> 01:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
for for bail determinations a higher
 
01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
standard than preponderance so so this
 
01:26:52.390 --> 01:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
is a fascinating thing you're pointing
 
01:26:56.669 --> 01:26:56.679 align:start position:0%
out the analogy here so uh bail now is
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
written that um you can
 
01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:03.280 align:start position:0%
only require bail if there's clear and
 
01:27:06.390 --> 01:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence that the the person
 
01:27:08.310 --> 01:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
in custody is a threat to themselves or
 
01:27:09.910 --> 01:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
to the others is that is that how that's
 
01:27:11.310 --> 01:27:11.320 align:start position:0%
used there's a slight difference
 
01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
depending on what the the factors are
 
01:27:15.149 --> 01:27:15.159 align:start position:0%
whether you're risk of flight versus a
 
01:27:16.870 --> 01:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
danger to reoffend but for most
 
01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
determinations it is clear and
 
01:27:20.470 --> 01:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
convincing that due to some bail reform
 
01:27:22.750 --> 01:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
from a few years ago so so clear and
 
01:27:25.550 --> 01:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
convincing is an appropriate standard
 
01:27:27.709 --> 01:27:27.719 align:start position:0%
when we're adjudicating whether or not
 
01:27:29.669 --> 01:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
somebody should be getting bail or
 
01:27:31.950 --> 01:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
released it it is the standard that is
 
01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
typically used for so Society has
 
01:27:35.709 --> 01:27:35.719 align:start position:0%
accepted the risk associated with that
 
01:27:38.109 --> 01:27:38.119 align:start position:0%
higher standard you here you're you're
 
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
balancing um the risk of potential
 
01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
offense by the parent and also the the
 
01:27:47.070 --> 01:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
interest in keeping the parent and the
 
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
child together that's a very difficult
 
01:27:50.709 --> 01:27:50.719 align:start position:0%
balance it's currently struck a
 
01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence the
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
legislature could certainly balance that
 
01:27:55.629 --> 01:27:55.639 align:start position:0%
differently and say that it needs to be
 
01:27:56.990 --> 01:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing all right
 
01:27:59.470 --> 01:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
representative H give it back to you
 
01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr Gan for for those
 
01:28:04.950 --> 01:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
answers I think part of this is the
 
01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
motivation to make sure we're trying to
 
01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
keep the children in state at be as best
 
01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
possible and the standard for
 
01:28:13.510 --> 01:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
effectively termination of parental
 
01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:15.400 align:start position:0%
rights could be things as clear and
 
01:28:18.629 --> 01:28:18.639 align:start position:0%
convincing and
 
01:28:20.990 --> 01:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
um preponderance of evidence is the
 
01:28:24.310 --> 01:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
least is the least likely right it is is
 
01:28:27.189 --> 01:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
more likely than true meaning 51% clear
 
01:28:29.109 --> 01:28:29.119 align:start position:0%
and convincing is a step above that the
 
01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
highest standard is reasonable doubt
 
01:28:31.990 --> 01:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about Beyond A
 
01:28:34.350 --> 01:28:34.360 align:start position:0%
Reasonable Doubt level language um all
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
three of these are used in both civil
 
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
and criminal level statutes I do think
 
01:28:41.430 --> 01:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
moving the bar up a little bit is
 
01:28:44.270 --> 01:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
beneficial in our society and that's why
 
01:28:50.270 --> 01:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:53.189 --> 01:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
recommendation I I feel uncomfortable
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
going to clearing convincing I think
 
01:28:56.910 --> 01:28:56.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking I mean this is very
 
01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
different than talking about bail I
 
01:29:03.229 --> 01:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
think this is um in some cases very
 
01:29:05.229 --> 01:29:05.239 align:start position:0%
young children that we might be leaving
 
01:29:08.270 --> 01:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
at risk and I certainly would not I
 
01:29:10.830 --> 01:29:10.840 align:start position:0%
would not um support clear and
 
01:29:14.830 --> 01:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:17.320 align:start position:0%
you how are you feeling about the
 
01:29:20.669 --> 01:29:20.679 align:start position:0%
amendment overall if it remain
 
01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
preponderance would you support the
 
01:29:25.870 --> 01:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
amendment other than that aspect of the
 
01:29:28.270 --> 01:29:28.280 align:start position:0%
amendment or is that just one of several
 
01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
things are we going to look at uh
 
01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative wiers or is
 
01:29:36.149 --> 01:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
that so the two have worked together and
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
I think representative Wilder's
 
01:29:39.629 --> 01:29:39.639 align:start position:0%
amendment is in
 
01:29:41.910 --> 01:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
here not going to look at it separately
 
01:29:44.109 --> 01:29:44.119 align:start position:0%
if representative wer wants us to we can
 
01:29:47.109 --> 01:29:47.119 align:start position:0%
I I don't see a need but no I appreciate
 
01:29:49.229 --> 01:29:49.239 align:start position:0%
him incorporating it was just a couple
 
01:29:52.350 --> 01:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
of places it talks about the uh idea
 
01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
that having a gun does not make make you
 
01:29:59.470 --> 01:29:59.480 align:start position:0%
an unfit parent and also it was
 
01:30:02.149 --> 01:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
um trying to remember the other place
 
01:30:05.070 --> 01:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
was it it was line it was line five
 
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
right you shouldn't have to go to a
 
01:30:08.590 --> 01:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
hearing if there's nothing against you
 
01:30:09.550 --> 01:30:09.560 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't have to go through a
 
01:30:13.550 --> 01:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
hearing to to uh to find out you're
 
01:30:16.750 --> 01:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
innocent I I I'm just saying I'm just
 
01:30:19.229 --> 01:30:19.239 align:start position:0%
thinking now that in these last two
 
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
bills there's been a a presumption of of
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
whether whether or not parents are
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
trustworthy uh in the EBT question uh we
 
01:30:32.109 --> 01:30:32.119 align:start position:0%
we believe parents are trustworthy when
 
01:30:34.149 --> 01:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
they get the EBT to spend the money
 
01:30:36.629 --> 01:30:36.639 align:start position:0%
wisely to allow the the food that they
 
01:30:39.149 --> 01:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
can purchase to be dedicated and and
 
01:30:42.390 --> 01:30:42.400 align:start position:0%
help their children more than themselves
 
01:30:44.750 --> 01:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
which is a selfish potential for an EBT
 
01:30:46.669 --> 01:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
card feed yourself and not worry about
 
01:30:49.030 --> 01:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
your kids it doesn't fix the neglect
 
01:30:51.109 --> 01:30:51.119 align:start position:0%
issue but we're still giving them more
 
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
trust by giving them more money and in
 
01:30:57.149 --> 01:30:57.159 align:start position:0%
this case we're we're saying that you
 
01:30:58.830 --> 01:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
know if we go with the clear and
 
01:31:01.510 --> 01:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
convincing we're saying that we've
 
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
decided we want to trust parents uh if
 
01:31:06.629 --> 01:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
we want to trust parents then we should
 
01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that the state has a high
 
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
standard for interfering with a family
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
in a way that can destroy it so I I I
 
01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
I'm I have become very comfortable with
 
01:31:22.790 --> 01:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing but if I may right
 
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:56.590 --> 01:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
in charge of them because of an abuse or
 
01:32:00.270 --> 01:32:00.280 align:start position:0%
neglect case and we want to find an
 
01:32:01.950 --> 01:32:01.960 align:start position:0%
alternate parent as soon as
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
possible we should make the roadblocks
 
01:32:06.510 --> 01:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
to that alternate parent as little as
 
01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
possible doesn't mean the department
 
01:32:09.870 --> 01:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
can't continue to keep an eye on them
 
01:32:11.109 --> 01:32:11.119 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of other things that could
 
01:32:13.070 --> 01:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
go on but I'm trying not to make sure
 
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to make sure these children
 
01:32:16.149 --> 01:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
aren't shipped to an out ofate
 
01:32:19.550 --> 01:32:19.560 align:start position:0%
facility representative Stringham yeah I
 
01:32:23.189 --> 01:32:23.199 align:start position:0%
guess I guess I I fall down um in in
 
01:32:25.950 --> 01:32:25.960 align:start position:0%
line with the propond preponderance of
 
01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
the evidence as being uh appropriate in
 
01:32:33.310 --> 01:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
this case um I think it's very difficult
 
01:32:37.390 --> 01:32:37.400 align:start position:0%
for um uh people who are charged with
 
01:32:39.270 --> 01:32:39.280 align:start position:0%
you know coming into an extremely
 
01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
difficult situation like this to put
 
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
together a legal case a CR essentially
 
01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
criminal level of evidence uh that abuse
 
01:32:51.109 --> 01:32:51.119 align:start position:0%
is occurring a lot of emotional abuse uh
 
01:32:53.470 --> 01:32:53.480 align:start position:0%
abuse with very young children is is
 
01:32:55.270 --> 01:32:55.280 align:start position:0%
difficult to to make clear and
 
01:32:59.270 --> 01:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
convincing uh but uh they still um May
 
01:33:01.350 --> 01:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
reach the conclusion that in the best
 
01:33:04.350 --> 01:33:04.360 align:start position:0%
interest of the child um having the
 
01:33:07.149 --> 01:33:07.159 align:start position:0%
child uh leave the uh leave the
 
01:33:08.669 --> 01:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
household that they're in is in the
 
01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
child's best interest and uh I feel with
 
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
with the evidence level of preponderance
 
01:33:18.390 --> 01:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
um more likely to reach uh the correct
 
01:33:21.750 --> 01:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
conclusion there um you know part of the
 
01:33:24.270 --> 01:33:24.280 align:start position:0%
rest of the the amendment I'm not
 
01:33:26.550 --> 01:33:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not really in favor of the the
 
01:33:29.590 --> 01:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
firearm provision uh there's a lot of
 
01:33:31.990 --> 01:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
things the fact that a person owns a
 
01:33:34.510 --> 01:33:34.520 align:start position:0%
swimming pool that is not covered uh
 
01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
shall not make a a home unsafe the fact
 
01:33:40.229 --> 01:33:40.239 align:start position:0%
that uh they have a balcony uh with
 
01:33:43.189 --> 01:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
steep stairs should not be uh weighted
 
01:33:44.990 --> 01:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
against the parent I mean you could put
 
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
a thousand things in there I don't think
 
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
we need to uh include include uh this
 
01:33:54.990 --> 01:33:55.000 align:start position:0%
this one thing uh you know that uh
 
01:33:56.750 --> 01:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh that obviously a lot of people have
 
01:34:00.669 --> 01:34:00.679 align:start position:0%
concerns about um the um and they don't
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
need to have a a criminal violation of a
 
01:34:05.870 --> 01:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
gun law um you know shouldn't be
 
01:34:08.870 --> 01:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
required to be considered if guns laying
 
01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
around the house and uh uh loaded uh
 
01:34:14.990 --> 01:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
when they happen to visit that would I'm
 
01:34:17.310 --> 01:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
sure that would be a consideration as
 
01:34:21.430 --> 01:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
would uh a large number of other unsafe
 
01:34:25.470 --> 01:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
uh circumstances in the house so um I I
 
01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
just I just think that that one sentence
 
01:34:31.870 --> 01:34:31.880 align:start position:0%
is gratuitous in this bill
 
01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
so uh the decision is going to be made
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
very arbitrarily or
 
01:34:42.990 --> 01:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
subjectively by some State worker they
 
01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
don't they don't even know the
 
01:34:45.990 --> 01:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
difference between clear and convincing
 
01:34:48.390 --> 01:34:48.400 align:start position:0%
and and a preponderance they're just
 
01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
making their own decision on whether
 
01:34:53.870 --> 01:34:53.880 align:start position:0%
you're a fit parent or not and you you
 
01:34:55.350 --> 01:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
would have to take them to court to say
 
01:34:56.990 --> 01:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
how did you make that decision you won't
 
01:34:59.270 --> 01:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
know it just somebody that's working and
 
01:35:01.790 --> 01:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
that division of Children and Youth is
 
01:35:03.109 --> 01:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
has made the decision whether this
 
01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
parent is unfit and I don't think they
 
01:35:08.189 --> 01:35:08.199 align:start position:0%
even care whether these two uh whether
 
01:35:10.750 --> 01:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
it's preponderance or clear they're just
 
01:35:13.709 --> 01:35:13.719 align:start position:0%
going to make their own decision so so
 
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
what is your position in or out on the
 
01:35:18.830 --> 01:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
changing the change you don't you don't
 
01:35:21.270 --> 01:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
care no I think clear and convincing is
 
01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
is adequate all right
 
01:35:30.030 --> 01:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:34.830 --> 01:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
uh okay I I yeah representative priest
 
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
yes I also have a concern about the
 
01:35:41.390 --> 01:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
change from preponderance to clear and
 
01:35:44.510 --> 01:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
convincing and I think by raising that
 
01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
bar up we are and we will be risking the
 
01:35:54.510 --> 01:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:56.310 --> 01:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
how many children what
 
01:35:58.830 --> 01:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
percentage sir I don't know I don't have
 
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
the statistics in front of me so this is
 
01:36:04.430 --> 01:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
a a concern this is a concern okay this
 
01:36:06.669 --> 01:36:06.679 align:start position:0%
is a concern all right but we I don't
 
01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
want any more cases in the paper where a
 
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
child has been left with their parents
 
01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
and abused and probably killed so should
 
01:36:17.310 --> 01:36:17.320 align:start position:0%
we take all par kids from their parents
 
01:36:19.629 --> 01:36:19.639 align:start position:0%
should we presume all parents this this
 
01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
is not what we're talking about sir I'm
 
01:36:23.830 --> 01:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
talking about the change that's been
 
01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
made in this
 
01:36:29.550 --> 01:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
amendment you are but you're you're
 
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
creating I weigh to the lives of the
 
01:36:37.510 --> 01:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
children that's involved and protecting
 
01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
them as much as we can and you think the
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
state is in a better position to do that
 
01:36:45.030 --> 01:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
than parents yes the state never makes
 
01:36:48.669 --> 01:36:48.679 align:start position:0%
mistakes the everybody makes look at the
 
01:36:51.550 --> 01:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
YDC law everyone makes mistakes and and
 
01:36:54.070 --> 01:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
and the state is not perfect nobody's
 
01:36:57.149 --> 01:36:57.159 align:start position:0%
perfect sir so so shouldn't we default
 
01:36:59.270 --> 01:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
but I think the state have
 
01:37:01.470 --> 01:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
have represent priest we're just having
 
01:37:04.030 --> 01:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
a conversation we are too just just the
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
tone just a little just calm the tone a
 
01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:15.189 --> 01:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
conversation Mr chair if I may yeah
 
01:37:17.189 --> 01:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
maybe this will help I'm looking at a
 
01:37:18.590 --> 01:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
court document I can get this printed
 
01:37:21.109 --> 01:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
out for everybody if they want um
 
01:37:22.669 --> 01:37:22.679 align:start position:0%
guardianship of a minor general
 
01:37:22.679 --> 01:37:24.709 align:start position:0%
guardianship of a minor general
information

01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:37:27.310 --> 01:37:27.320 align:start position:0%
in there this is relative to
 
01:37:30.629 --> 01:37:30.639 align:start position:0%
guardianship of the person Rel okay and
 
01:37:32.109 --> 01:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
I'm going to quote the entire paragraph
 
01:37:33.629 --> 01:37:33.639 align:start position:0%
at the hearing it will be the burden of
 
01:37:35.390 --> 01:37:35.400 align:start position:0%
the person seeking the guardianship over
 
01:37:37.629 --> 01:37:37.639 align:start position:0%
the person of the minor to prove by a
 
01:37:39.070 --> 01:37:39.080 align:start position:0%
preponderance of the evidence that the
 
01:37:40.669 --> 01:37:40.679 align:start position:0%
guardianship is in the best interest of
 
01:37:43.589 --> 01:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
the minor if however the person seeking
 
01:37:45.510 --> 01:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
guardianship is not apparent which is
 
01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:46.679 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here we're
 
01:37:49.149 --> 01:37:49.159 align:start position:0%
talking about others okay the person
 
01:37:50.830 --> 01:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
must prove by clear and convincing
 
01:37:52.350 --> 01:37:52.360 align:start position:0%
evidence that it is in the best interest
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
of the minor we're already using this
 
01:37:56.350 --> 01:37:56.360 align:start position:0%
language in these stat that we're
 
01:37:59.229 --> 01:37:59.239 align:start position:0%
talking about in our current court
 
01:38:02.030 --> 01:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
procedures I would argue we're talking
 
01:38:05.750 --> 01:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
about parents that okay we're trying our
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
best to make sure the child is not
 
01:38:09.070 --> 01:38:09.080 align:start position:0%
shipped out of the state we need an
 
01:38:11.149 --> 01:38:11.159 align:start position:0%
alternate location because we know that
 
01:38:13.070 --> 01:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
there's abuse or neglect well we presume
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
that there's abuse or neglect going on
 
01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
because the child has been pulled from
 
01:38:18.430 --> 01:38:18.440 align:start position:0%
the parent okay the court now has to
 
01:38:19.629 --> 01:38:19.639 align:start position:0%
figure out where they're going to put
 
01:38:21.390 --> 01:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
the child that is this that is the
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
section in this flowchart we're dealing
 
01:38:26.709 --> 01:38:26.719 align:start position:0%
with and we want to limit as the speed
 
01:38:28.550 --> 01:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
bumps or minimize the number of speed
 
01:38:31.229 --> 01:38:31.239 align:start position:0%
bumps to get that child out of this
 
01:38:33.870 --> 01:38:33.880 align:start position:0%
family that was abusive to some other
 
01:38:38.030 --> 01:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
rest location and not Warehouse them in
 
01:38:41.070 --> 01:38:41.080 align:start position:0%
a hotel or in a group home we've seen
 
01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
the horrors that happen when these kids
 
01:38:45.550 --> 01:38:45.560 align:start position:0%
are not in families and we want to move
 
01:38:47.470 --> 01:38:47.480 align:start position:0%
them there as quickly as possible the
 
01:38:49.109 --> 01:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
state better have really good evidence
 
01:38:50.790 --> 01:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
that they can't move them there before
 
01:38:52.990 --> 01:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
they say no this is not acceptable
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
that's why the standard was put in place
 
01:38:57.109 --> 01:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
I I I think this is actually a better
 
01:38:59.629 --> 01:38:59.639 align:start position:0%
option than the for bonance of evidence
 
01:39:02.070 --> 01:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
and I think with the goal to get the
 
01:39:04.990 --> 01:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
children to a new location this is the
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
best thing we can do sorry a little bit
 
01:39:09.070 --> 01:39:09.080 align:start position:0%
emotional I'm looking for further
 
01:39:13.229 --> 01:39:13.239 align:start position:0%
discussion if not I think um was there a
 
01:39:15.990 --> 01:39:16.000 align:start position:0%

02:45:29.389 --> 02:45:29.399 align:start position:0%
all right it being 12:45 I'm going to
 
02:45:32.150 --> 02:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
call division 3 out of uh
 
02:45:35.550 --> 02:45:35.560 align:start position:0%
recess um we recessed because we wanted
 
02:45:39.830 --> 02:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
to uh have um an opportunity to to uh
 
02:45:42.830 --> 02:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
maybe get some amendments written by OS
 
02:45:46.429 --> 02:45:46.439 align:start position:0%
in record time and also to give the uh
 
02:45:49.349 --> 02:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
commit division three time to caucus and
 
02:45:52.269 --> 02:45:52.279 align:start position:0%
so we've done that and uh I'm going to
 
02:45:56.670 --> 02:45:56.680 align:start position:0%
I'm going to bring back uh SB
 
02:46:00.429 --> 02:46:00.439 align:start position:0%
499 uh first uh there has been an
 
02:46:03.790 --> 02:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
amendment that uh passed out of um uh
 
02:46:03.800 --> 02:46:05.550 align:start position:0%
amendment that uh passed out of um uh
division

02:46:05.550 --> 02:46:05.560 align:start position:0%
division
 
02:46:08.550 --> 02:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
3650 that um that Amendment basically
 
02:46:12.950 --> 02:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
said that um we wanted to take the part
 
02:46:15.910 --> 02:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
of 499 dealing with senior eligibility
 
02:46:18.469 --> 02:46:18.479 align:start position:0%
in their enrollment process funded at
 
02:46:18.479 --> 02:46:19.469 align:start position:0%
in their enrollment process funded at
about

02:46:19.469 --> 02:46:19.479 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:46:22.030 --> 02:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
37,500 that's that's a recommendation
 
02:46:24.429 --> 02:46:24.439 align:start position:0%
you would see to that there's been a lot
 
02:46:27.469 --> 02:46:27.479 align:start position:0%
of discussion uh around 499 on what to
 
02:46:31.710 --> 02:46:31.720 align:start position:0%
do with the summer EBT program and um
 
02:46:33.510 --> 02:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
and we didn't take a vote in division
 
02:46:35.670 --> 02:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
three I don't think we're ready to take
 
02:46:38.469 --> 02:46:38.479 align:start position:0%
a vote now because representative hle
 
02:46:43.030 --> 02:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
has yet another amendment to offer on
 
02:46:46.389 --> 02:46:46.399 align:start position:0%
499 and um since since we can't vote on
 
02:46:48.950 --> 02:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
it in division three we're going to uh
 
02:46:52.630 --> 02:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chair just just ask to arm wrestle it
 
02:46:54.750 --> 02:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
during the um full
 
02:46:59.349 --> 02:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
committee um hold on a second so um so
 
02:47:03.349 --> 02:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
there's not going to be a vote on on 417
 
02:47:06.830 --> 02:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
out of division three the discuss 499
 
02:47:08.870 --> 02:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you so much we're going to we're
 
02:47:10.910 --> 02:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
going to defer that and talk about it in
 
02:47:13.550 --> 02:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
full Finance um after uh he gets a
 
02:47:15.630 --> 02:47:15.640 align:start position:0%
chance to describe what his Amendment
 
02:47:17.990 --> 02:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
does yes represent respectfully Mr
 
02:47:19.309 --> 02:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
chairman no you don't have to be
 
02:47:21.309 --> 02:47:21.319 align:start position:0%
respectful just tell well you asked for
 
02:47:21.319 --> 02:47:23.070 align:start position:0%
respectful just tell well you asked for
it

02:47:23.070 --> 02:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:47:26.190 --> 02:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I wanted to thank you for bringing
 
02:47:28.990 --> 02:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
499 back up for discussion today and I
 
02:47:31.269 --> 02:47:31.279 align:start position:0%
apologize I was unable to attend this
 
02:47:34.030 --> 02:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
morning I was able to listen in two
 
02:47:35.590 --> 02:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
parts of it and I want to thank the
 
02:47:38.230 --> 02:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
committee for um taking a look at my
 
02:47:40.670 --> 02:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
amendment I am however looking at the
 
02:47:42.870 --> 02:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
clock a little concerned that we're now
 
02:47:45.349 --> 02:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
going to be thrown another amendment to
 
02:47:48.230 --> 02:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
full committee without for without a
 
02:47:49.750 --> 02:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
proper disc discussion and a real look
 
02:47:51.309 --> 02:47:51.319 align:start position:0%
at it I mean there is a timeline to
 
02:47:54.190 --> 02:47:54.200 align:start position:0%
these things and I'm I'm concerned that
 
02:47:55.790 --> 02:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
we're already back here right now so
 
02:47:57.389 --> 02:47:57.399 align:start position:0%
since we have no time can we seed your
 
02:47:59.150 --> 02:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
time to representative hle so he can
 
02:48:00.910 --> 02:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
describe what his Amendment will be it's
 
02:48:02.950 --> 02:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
so simple I think you can we'll be able
 
02:48:05.550 --> 02:48:05.560 align:start position:0%
to wrap our head around it uh and and
 
02:48:07.429 --> 02:48:07.439 align:start position:0%
wait until the full Finance discussion
 
02:48:10.349 --> 02:48:10.359 align:start position:0%
for the full debate are you are you can
 
02:48:12.349 --> 02:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
can he take the time
 
02:48:15.670 --> 02:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
now sure representative H what what what
 
02:48:17.429 --> 02:48:17.439 align:start position:0%
amendment are you bringing forward so
 
02:48:19.830 --> 02:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
the amendment um I I saw and we we
 
02:48:22.269 --> 02:48:22.279 align:start position:0%
discussed um 197h which was
 
02:48:24.309 --> 02:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
representative Tori's Amendment it
 
02:48:27.309 --> 02:48:27.319 align:start position:0%
leaves in lines 31 and 32
 
02:48:30.309 --> 02:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
$667,000 for some implementation costs I
 
02:48:32.950 --> 02:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
think those numbers are excessive um
 
02:48:34.389 --> 02:48:34.399 align:start position:0%
based on what I understand about
 
02:48:34.399 --> 02:48:35.510 align:start position:0%
based on what I understand about
software

02:48:35.510 --> 02:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
software
 
02:48:37.870 --> 02:48:37.880 align:start position:0%
development so the amendment would leave
 
02:48:42.469 --> 02:48:42.479 align:start position:0%
the 375 in place and then would put um
 
02:48:45.870 --> 02:48:45.880 align:start position:0%
$50,000 to DHHS to write the appropriate
 
02:48:49.349 --> 02:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
rfqs to get quotes in to get bid in to
 
02:48:51.190 --> 02:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
figure out a full project plan to
 
02:48:52.950 --> 02:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
implement this and to have that
 
02:48:55.590 --> 02:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
information for us by the end of by
 
02:48:58.150 --> 02:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
October 1st so that prior to the
 
02:49:00.309 --> 02:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
deadlines for filing legislation next
 
02:49:02.910 --> 02:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
year they can in fact have a plan in
 
02:49:05.110 --> 02:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
place to implement
 
02:49:08.070 --> 02:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
this and we we already know that this
 
02:49:10.349 --> 02:49:10.359 align:start position:0%
money would not benefit children this
 
02:49:10.359 --> 02:49:12.710 align:start position:0%
money would not benefit children this
year

02:49:12.710 --> 02:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:49:15.790 --> 02:49:15.800 align:start position:0%
but hold on it is not available until
 
02:49:17.349 --> 02:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
October the truth is in the middle it's
 
02:49:18.710 --> 02:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
in the middle the money would be aail
 
02:49:20.710 --> 02:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
aailable in the October time frame for
 
02:49:22.550 --> 02:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
the families not available over the
 
02:49:26.429 --> 02:49:26.439 align:start position:0%
summer even if this was passed as is so
 
02:49:28.550 --> 02:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
this kind of is one way to look at
 
02:49:30.870 --> 02:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
trying to get this done for summer of 25
 
02:49:35.429 --> 02:49:35.439 align:start position:0%
but not try and do it in an off budget
 
02:49:38.670 --> 02:49:38.680 align:start position:0%
year so further discussion I think
 
02:49:41.510 --> 02:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
should wait until we actually see his
 
02:49:41.520 --> 02:49:43.269 align:start position:0%
should wait until we actually see his
Amendment

02:49:43.269 --> 02:49:43.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
02:49:45.830 --> 02:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to just clarify one thing
 
02:49:48.469 --> 02:49:48.479 align:start position:0%
that was said yes it is not true that
 
02:49:51.070 --> 02:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
they will not see that money this year
 
02:49:53.190 --> 02:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
obviously if this goes into effect I
 
02:49:54.870 --> 02:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
believe the date is like July upon
 
02:49:58.349 --> 02:49:58.359 align:start position:0%
signing July 1 there needs to be those
 
02:50:03.070 --> 02:50:03.080 align:start position:0%
technical updates to be done the monies
 
02:50:04.990 --> 02:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
that the families would receive for
 
02:50:07.950 --> 02:50:07.960 align:start position:0%
those children will be delayed that is
 
02:50:09.990 --> 02:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
true however to say that they won't
 
02:50:12.190 --> 02:50:12.200 align:start position:0%
receive these funds this year is
 
02:50:16.030 --> 02:50:16.040 align:start position:0%
incorrect and it would be leaving $4
 
02:50:19.269 --> 02:50:19.279 align:start position:0%
million on the table
 
02:50:21.630 --> 02:50:21.640 align:start position:0%
so I can tell you that I would not be
 
02:50:24.229 --> 02:50:24.239 align:start position:0%
supporting that Amendment so what
 
02:50:26.870 --> 02:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative whole wasn't completely
 
02:50:31.389 --> 02:50:31.399 align:start position:0%
without uh truth because um we would be
 
02:50:34.030 --> 02:50:34.040 align:start position:0%
telling New Hampshire that we're making
 
02:50:38.429 --> 02:50:38.439 align:start position:0%
this money available to them because of
 
02:50:41.269 --> 02:50:41.279 align:start position:0%
hunger issues in the summer but to hang
 
02:50:43.150 --> 02:50:43.160 align:start position:0%
on because we can't get you the money
 
02:50:46.110 --> 02:50:46.120 align:start position:0%
until October at the earliest so it so
 
02:50:49.750 --> 02:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
it it it it is true to his major point
 
02:50:53.349 --> 02:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
that uh the program is slow on
 
02:50:56.229 --> 02:50:56.239 align:start position:0%
delivering the money I think he misspoke
 
02:50:58.990 --> 02:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
when he said it wouldn't help this year
 
02:51:01.630 --> 02:51:01.640 align:start position:0%
it certainly wouldn't help this summer
 
02:51:05.429 --> 02:51:05.439 align:start position:0%
as the point of it so okay so I think we
 
02:51:07.590 --> 02:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
should uh wrap up that because that's
 
02:51:10.229 --> 02:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
going to be an exciting full Finance
 
02:51:12.710 --> 02:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
conversation um and then which one am I
 
02:51:12.720 --> 02:51:15.830 align:start position:0%
conversation um and then which one am I
doing

02:51:15.830 --> 02:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:20.030 --> 02:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
now we we we we recessed around 463
 
02:51:23.830 --> 02:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
right yes and 4 uh 4
 
02:51:29.309 --> 02:51:29.319 align:start position:0%
463 um we have um an amendment that uh
 
02:51:33.070 --> 02:51:33.080 align:start position:0%
is still TBD and a walner Amendment on
 
02:51:37.030 --> 02:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
463 is is is that has that been
 
02:51:40.950 --> 02:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
done so I just received one back um that
 
02:51:44.229 --> 02:51:44.239 align:start position:0%
I asked OS to put in your name
 
02:51:48.190 --> 02:51:48.200 align:start position:0%
oh that I believe reflects for the most
 
02:51:49.590 --> 02:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
part the committee's discussion from
 
02:51:51.110 --> 02:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
earlier although I'm looking at it now
 
02:51:52.550 --> 02:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
and there may be one piece that's left
 
02:51:55.110 --> 02:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
out but so the key thing to that was to
 
02:51:57.229 --> 02:51:57.239 align:start position:0%
make sure that the not withstanding the
 
02:52:00.150 --> 02:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
above language was copy replicated
 
02:52:02.870 --> 02:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
appropriately and said
 
02:52:04.790 --> 02:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
differently said
 
02:52:07.550 --> 02:52:07.560 align:start position:0%
differently but in any case what are you
 
02:52:10.670 --> 02:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
you're seeing an error still well so so
 
02:52:12.990 --> 02:52:13.000 align:start position:0%
let me ask you about that part my
 
02:52:14.229 --> 02:52:14.239 align:start position:0%
understanding of the
 
02:52:16.710 --> 02:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
committee's desire earlier was to take
 
02:52:18.670 --> 02:52:18.680 align:start position:0%
that language the notwithstanding keep
 
02:52:21.349 --> 02:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
it where it is but also move it down
 
02:52:23.630 --> 02:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
below the phas in schedule that is what
 
02:52:26.910 --> 02:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
this amendment would do um it doesn't
 
02:52:29.150 --> 02:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
address the
 
02:52:32.030 --> 02:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
part so as representative H mentioned uh
 
02:52:36.510 --> 02:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
subp paragraph 2E is repealed at a later
 
02:52:37.870 --> 02:52:37.880 align:start position:0%
date but there's a reference to it that
 
02:52:39.630 --> 02:52:39.640 align:start position:0%
would remain permanently in statute this
 
02:52:42.110 --> 02:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
amendment doesn't change that I'm not
 
02:52:44.910 --> 02:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
sure if that's a huge deal um it's
 
02:52:46.950 --> 02:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
really up to the committee members is
 
02:52:48.950 --> 02:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
that from your experience something that
 
02:52:50.870 --> 02:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
could be addressed in an enroll bills
 
02:52:54.110 --> 02:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment later on type thing um does it
 
02:52:55.269 --> 02:52:55.279 align:start position:0%
fall in
 
02:52:57.710 --> 02:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
that I I don't want to commit to saying
 
02:52:59.630 --> 02:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
yes but it seems technical enough that
 
02:53:04.269 --> 02:53:04.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:06.750 --> 02:53:06.760 align:start position:0%
okay you want to vote on it do you want
 
02:53:09.590 --> 02:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
to make a motion I'll move that we adopt
 
02:53:12.990 --> 02:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment that um that Mr Ripple
 
02:53:14.630 --> 02:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
just discussed
 
02:53:14.640 --> 02:53:15.990 align:start position:0%
just discussed
[Music]

02:53:15.990 --> 02:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:53:19.469 --> 02:53:19.479 align:start position:0%
and um understand that there might be a
 
02:53:21.349 --> 02:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
a small clerical correction relative to
 
02:53:24.630 --> 02:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
that one repeal implementation date and
 
02:53:26.110 --> 02:53:26.120 align:start position:0%
the fact that it leaves it in statute
 
02:53:31.550 --> 02:53:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:34.150 --> 02:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
second so we're we're walking closer
 
02:53:35.510 --> 02:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
we're getting closer do we have an
 
02:53:38.309 --> 02:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
amendment number for that please it's
 
02:53:42.229 --> 02:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:46.429 --> 02:53:46.439 align:start position:0%
1948 is is 194 we're not voting on 1948
 
02:53:49.309 --> 02:53:49.319 align:start position:0%
right now are we
 
02:53:52.750 --> 02:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah was that your motion to vote
 
02:53:56.429 --> 02:53:56.439 align:start position:0%
on on yes okay because I I didn't recall
 
02:53:56.439 --> 02:53:57.750 align:start position:0%
on on yes okay because I I didn't recall
a

02:53:57.750 --> 02:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:54:00.550 --> 02:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
number have one more K if we have an
 
02:54:03.510 --> 02:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
amendment in front of us we do let let's
 
02:54:06.229 --> 02:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
go ahead and point out in the that this
 
02:54:08.269 --> 02:54:08.279 align:start position:0%
amendment complies with what we agreed
 
02:54:10.389 --> 02:54:10.399 align:start position:0%
to in division three or it differs from
 
02:54:12.750 --> 02:54:12.760 align:start position:0%
what we said
 
02:54:15.670 --> 02:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
earlier Mr chair um I'm speaking to
 
02:54:18.429 --> 02:54:18.439 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1948 and for the purpose of
 
02:54:21.349 --> 02:54:21.359 align:start position:0%

verbatim with that one adoption of the
 
02:55:53.030 --> 02:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding language and both of
 
02:55:54.950 --> 02:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
them still need the clerical correction
 
02:55:56.870 --> 02:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
which I think could be fixed later on
 
02:55:58.950 --> 02:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
without it's a minor issue relative to
 
02:56:00.389 --> 02:56:00.399 align:start position:0%
the repeal
 
02:56:02.710 --> 02:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
language and just to reiterate the
 
02:56:04.630 --> 02:56:04.640 align:start position:0%
positions are removed in the ENT
 
02:56:06.710 --> 02:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment we just adopted they are
 
02:56:10.269 --> 02:56:10.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:15.670 --> 02:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
you okay I'm I want to bring forward
 
02:56:18.910 --> 02:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
um we haven't voted yet on
 
02:56:22.950 --> 02:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
455 uh and there is an wait we did we
 
02:56:25.469 --> 02:56:25.479 align:start position:0%
had a new Amendment on this it was based
 
02:56:27.070 --> 02:56:27.080 align:start position:0%
off of
 
02:56:31.910 --> 02:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
1924 and uh it it changed the Baseline
 
02:56:35.269 --> 02:56:35.279 align:start position:0%
for the Medicaid reimbursement rates is
 
02:56:37.349 --> 02:56:37.359 align:start position:0%
is that Amendment available I don't have
 
02:56:39.469 --> 02:56:39.479 align:start position:0%
it yet I expect to have it shortly okay
 
02:56:40.950 --> 02:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
but that one I think is fairly clear
 
02:56:42.590 --> 02:56:42.600 align:start position:0%
it's the amendment that you saw earlier
 
02:56:45.630 --> 02:56:45.640 align:start position:0%
with that one minor change yeah so so I
 
02:56:46.990 --> 02:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
don't think that's going to be
 
02:56:50.670 --> 02:56:50.680 align:start position:0%
controversial in full fin Finance um and
 
02:56:54.910 --> 02:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
with that I I think we're our recess is
 
02:56:57.190 --> 02:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
we've had enough
 
02:57:02.110 --> 02:57:02.120 align:start position:0%
fun okay so sorry for the screwing um
 
02:57:04.190 --> 02:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
but these we got a lot of bills and
 
02:57:07.590 --> 02:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of complexity and um we
 
02:57:09.830 --> 02:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
only had a certain amount of time so
