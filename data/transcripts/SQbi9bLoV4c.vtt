good morning
um

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
we have a number of bills and proposed
 
00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:18.899 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendments on for hearing
 
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh today
 
00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.910 align:start position:0%
uh today
um

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
I see a number
 
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
of cards uh for the first for the first
 
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
bill cacr-2
 
00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.970 align:start position:0%
bill cacr-2
um

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:31.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
as you know we've scheduled this hearing
 
00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:36.839 align:start position:0%
for an hour and a half and I'm going I'm
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
going to sort of start out with the
 
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:41.220 align:start position:0%
presumption that everybody will be
 
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
relative that well everybody will sort
 
00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
of say what they have to say and be
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
relatively brief so I'd rather not try
 
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
to impose time limits but if it starts
 
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
to look like we're going to run way over
 
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:54.300 align:start position:0%
because people are you know just
 
00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
going on longer than being brief I may
 
00:10:59.090 --> 00:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
have to impose a time limit so that we
 
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
retain some kind of uh some kind of
 
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:04.380 align:start position:0%
adherence to uh the schedule we have
 
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
today I'm not you know I'm not looking
 
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
to be right on the money but if it looks
 
00:11:11.329 --> 00:11:11.339 align:start position:0%
like we would go way over I then they
 
00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:13.620 align:start position:0%
um impose some time limits the other
 
00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
thing I would like to say is uh we are
 
00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
all very aware that these um
 
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
that the issues that we're hearing today
 
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
raise uh can be very you know very
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
strongly held views on both sides of
 
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
these issues and that's fine that's
 
00:11:32.329 --> 00:11:32.339 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what what you'd expect in
 
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:33.660 align:start position:0%
a democracy
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
we on this committee despite the the
 
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
strong disagreements we may have had on
 
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
many many bills have always conducted a
 
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:54.120 align:start position:0%

Amendment and soon it's going to
 
00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
actually be Amanda Elizabeth Soto
 
00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:55.019 align:start position:0%
because I just got engaged on Saturday
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
night so
 
00:12:58.730 --> 00:12:58.740 align:start position:0%
um to my partner Alberto so very excited
 
00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:00.420 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
um I had an abortion when I was a
 
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
teenager and approximately 11 weeks ago
 
00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:11.220 align:start position:0%
I gave birth to my second child Jordan
 
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.200 align:start position:0%
who's here too
 
00:13:15.889 --> 00:13:15.899 align:start position:0%
um and it hasn't been easy I got a
 
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:18.180 align:start position:0%
terrible case of pups while pregnant
 
00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:21.500 align:start position:0%
needed iron transfusions and the sleep
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
deprivation has been especially hard
 
00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
my son is such a blessing and I'm
 
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
grateful to care for him with the most
 
00:13:32.990 --> 00:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
wonderful loving partner by my side
 
00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
but parenting is likely one of the
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
hardest things one can do and it
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be forced upon people
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
because I was able to have children when
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
I was ready and not before that I've
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
been able to become a state
 
00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:48.600 align:start position:0%

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:50.760 align:start position:0%

I'm tremendously grateful for being able
 
00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:56.220 align:start position:0%
to obtain the abortion care I needed
 
00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
when I was younger
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
sharing my own abortion story for years
 
00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:03.660 align:start position:0%
and hearing the stories of others I know
 
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:05.720 align:start position:0%
one thing for sure
 
00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:08.700 align:start position:0%
abortion care is an intersectional issue
 
00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:12.540 align:start position:0%
people of all economic classes races and
 
00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:15.660 align:start position:0%
religions access abortion care legal
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
barriers to abortion will not stop
 
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
abortions they will only keep
 
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised folks from accessing the
 
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.240 align:start position:0%

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.610 align:start position:0%
care they need sometimes with deadly
results

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:25.620 align:start position:0%
results
 
00:14:27.889 --> 00:14:27.899 align:start position:0%
with all the attacks on Reproductive
 
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
Rights it's critical to lay the
 
00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:32.700 align:start position:0%
foundation for proactive legislation to
 
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:33.980 align:start position:0%
protect them
 
00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:35.820 align:start position:0%
constitutional protections for
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
Reproductive Rights are imperative for
 
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:00.660 align:start position:0%
Federal so I'm so sorry I'm just going
 
00:15:02.509 --> 00:15:02.519 align:start position:0%
to I
 
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
um grab my phone because I help out all
 
00:15:09.949 --> 00:15:09.959 align:start position:0%
my paper workloads here but um I'm not
 
00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
seeing it
 
00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:13.910 align:start position:0%
seeing it
um

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so much
 
00:15:50.269 --> 00:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:07.370 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
so constitutional protections are the
 
00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
gold standard as they give the highest
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
level of legal protection in addition to
 
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
the purposely bold and Progressive
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
content of the New Hampshire
 
00:16:22.009 --> 00:16:22.019 align:start position:0%
reproductive Liberty Amendment the fact
 
00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
that it is a constitutional amendment
 
00:16:26.269 --> 00:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
means it's not subject to the governor's
 
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
veto and it's a lot harder to undo and
 
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
would mean that we do not need to fight
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
tooth and nail for Reproductive Freedom
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
each time it goes before the state
 
00:16:38.329 --> 00:16:38.339 align:start position:0%

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
be able to play political ping pong with

bill it isn't just about abortion rights
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
but also about the right to have

children when you want to have them free
 
00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:55.199 align:start position:0%

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
violence like force sterilizations
 
00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:36.900 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens should be able to
 
00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
directly weigh in on the Reproductive
 
00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:41.460 align:start position:0%
Rights and affirm their values relating
 
00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:44.039 align:start position:0%
to reproductive autonomy by giving these
 
00:17:46.909 --> 00:17:46.919 align:start position:0%
rights the highest legal protections New
 
00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:49.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents are overwhelmingly
 
00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
pro-reproductive freedom indeed during
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
the last Judiciary Committee hearing on
 
00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire reproductive Liberty
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment last year
 
00:18:03.049 --> 00:18:03.059 align:start position:0%
1413 constituents signed in in favor and
 
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
only 134 posed putting this issue on the
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
ballot as a constitutional amendment
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
will allow residents to directly show
 
00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:14.220 align:start position:0%
support for Reproductive Rights as an
 
00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
issue of personal Liberty that is very
 
00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:18.620 align:start position:0%
important to Granite Staters
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
this past November three states opted to
 
00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
take this path Michigan California and
 
00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
Vermont affirmed abortion rights and
 
00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
state ballot proposals voters in all
 
00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:32.700 align:start position:0%
three states amended their constitutions
 
00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:35.700 align:start position:0%
to support Reproductive Rights this bill
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
which utilizes the same language as our
 
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
neighbor Vermont just passed lays the
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
groundwork for doing the same thing here
 
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I hope that you will
 
00:18:48.049 --> 00:18:48.059 align:start position:0%
vote in favor of cacr2 and allow New
 
00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire constituents to weigh in on
 
00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:53.340 align:start position:0%

what reproductive decisions do the
 
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:17.220 align:start position:0%

what reproductive decisions do the
 
00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:28.260 align:start position:0%
biological fathers of pre-born babies
 
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
have the right to make thank you so much
 
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:33.480 align:start position:0%

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
amendment is to affirm everyone's
 
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:39.780 align:start position:0%
personal for themselves their
 
00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
reproductive autonomy and so
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
um it is about your own reproductive
 
00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
autonomy and New Hampshire constituents
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%

00:19:54.409 --> 00:19:54.419 align:start position:0%
directly thank you

other questions and please advise given

physically set up please raise your hand
 
00:20:03.049 --> 00:20:03.059 align:start position:0%
so I may not see if you don't any other
 
00:20:03.059 --> 00:20:04.130 align:start position:0%
so I may not see if you don't any other
question

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:04.140 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:07.799 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
you can I just say one
 
00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
so the goal of the reproductive Liberty
 
00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:18.900 align:start position:0%
amendment is to enshrine into our state
 
00:20:21.289 --> 00:20:21.299 align:start position:0%
constitution what medical practices were
 
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
happening in New Hampshire prior to
 
00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
recently past abortion ban and for
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
nearly 50 years the state of New
 
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:28.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire trusted doctors and patients
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
to make these decisions around abortion
 
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
care including later in pregnancy
 
00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:35.820 align:start position:0%
these are complicated and often
 
00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
heartbreaking decisions and there was
 
00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
bipartisan agreement for decade after
 
00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
decade that said New Hampshire supports
 
00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
privacy particularly when it comes to
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
these personal medical decisions and so
 
00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
again I think allowing the voters to
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
weigh in on this because we know it's
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
popular across the board
 
00:21:00.770 --> 00:21:00.780 align:start position:0%
um is really the right thing to do and I
 
00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
urge you to pass cacrt cacr2 New
 
00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's reproductive Liberty
 
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment thank you for hearing my
 
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
testimony today right thank you
 
00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
um I'm next going to call on
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
representative Joe Shapiro and I'm uh
 
00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:16.740 align:start position:0%
the the next witch I'm going to just
 
00:21:18.169 --> 00:21:18.179 align:start position:0%
sort of announce the next witness after
 
00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
him so people can get ready and what I
 
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
would say is the next witness after Mr
 
00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
Shapiro will be Sean Philly I hope I'm
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
pronouncing that correctly the only
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
thing I would say is if there are other
 
00:21:33.470 --> 00:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
reps or members of the legislature
 
00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
Senators who are here and you're here
 
00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:37.980 align:start position:0%
you're you're here because you have
 
00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
other business I recognize that there's
 
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of other hearings going on so I
 
00:21:45.169 --> 00:21:45.179 align:start position:0%
will take those reps or Senators out of
 
00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
order after representative Shapiro
 
00:21:49.549 --> 00:21:49.559 align:start position:0%
because of their of the fact that they
 
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
have other business
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
um so I see representative daughter so
 
00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:54.780 align:start position:0%
I'll ask representative not to testify
 
00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
after representative Shapiro
 
00:21:57.649 --> 00:21:57.659 align:start position:0%
representative Shapiro thank you for
 
00:21:59.870 --> 00:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
being here thank you chairman Lynn and
 
00:22:01.549 --> 00:22:01.559 align:start position:0%
thank you committee members
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
um I want to just take a moment to thank
 
00:22:06.529 --> 00:22:06.539 align:start position:0%
you for your Mr chairman for your
 
00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
introduction about how we want to
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
conduct business here and in the
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
legislature I appreciate it for the
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
record I am representative Joe Shapiro
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
representing Cheshire 16 which consists
 
00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
of keen Ward 2 and 9 small surrounding
 
00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.930 align:start position:0%
of keen Ward 2 and 9 small surrounding
towns

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:23.940 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
in anticipation of today's hearing I
 
00:22:28.669 --> 00:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
wrestled with what to say as a man I was
 
00:22:30.529 --> 00:22:30.539 align:start position:0%
unsure that I had something to offer to
 
00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:32.900 align:start position:0%
a discussion about reproductive autonomy
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
eventually I decided that speaking on
 
00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
behalf of this bill which will enshrine
 
00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:38.460 align:start position:0%
the new in the New Hampshire
 
00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:40.980 align:start position:0%
Constitution a woman's right to make
 
00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
decisions about her body her health care
 
00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:46.980 align:start position:0%
and her well-being was an opportunity to
 
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
honor the two most important women in my
 
00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.570 align:start position:0%
honor the two most important women in my
life

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
life
 
00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
when I was a very young adult my
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
girlfriend became pregnant we were not
 
00:22:59.090 --> 00:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
ready we were scared and I must admit I
 
00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
was clueless about how to navigate a
 
00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
situation like this
 
00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:04.980 align:start position:0%
emotionally and practically
 
00:23:06.649 --> 00:23:06.659 align:start position:0%
when my girlfriend chose to have an
 
00:23:09.169 --> 00:23:09.179 align:start position:0%
abortion it was my mother who came to
 
00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
her side taking her to the clinic coming
 
00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:13.799 align:start position:0%
to our apartment to offer healing and
 
00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:17.460 align:start position:0%
support and most importantly lending her
 
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
strength communicating by the force of
 
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
her very nature that there was no reason
 
00:23:24.649 --> 00:23:24.659 align:start position:0%
to feel shame
 
00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:28.100 align:start position:0%
fast forward more than 10 years another
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
unplanned pregnancy my wife and I knew
 
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
we wanted children but we were once
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
again less than prepared I was a student
 
00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:38.700 align:start position:0%
we were poor we were betwixten between
 
00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:41.700 align:start position:0%
several life transitions we wrestled
 
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
with what to do
 
00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:44.940 align:start position:0%
we worried about what could go wrong
 
00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:47.460 align:start position:0%
could we provide the stability a child
 
00:23:49.909 --> 00:23:49.919 align:start position:0%
needed would we have the resources to
 
00:23:51.529 --> 00:23:51.539 align:start position:0%
give our child the life that they
 
00:23:51.539 --> 00:23:52.789 align:start position:0%
give our child the life that they
deserved

00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
deserved
 
00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
the discussions were long hard and
 
00:23:59.330 --> 00:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
honestly pretty excruciating at times
 
00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:01.799 align:start position:0%
but I can't think of anyone who I would
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
rather have had them with than my wife
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
Nikki she was a beacon of strength
 
00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
competence and Hope
 
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
our daughter is 37 now
 
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
we are thankful every day for her and
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
her sister and for our two grandchildren
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
we know that our daughters will have to
 
00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
wrestle with difficult life altering
 
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
situations in fact they already have
 
00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
we have full confidence in them
 
00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
my mom and my wife taught me and more
 
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
importantly taught our daughters that
 
00:24:33.529 --> 00:24:33.539 align:start position:0%
women are fully capable of making the
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
right decisions for themselves about
 
00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
their bodies their health care and their
 
00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:38.990 align:start position:0%
their bodies their health care and their
well-being

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
well-being
 
00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:41.700 align:start position:0%
they do not need the state to decide for
 
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
them I urge you to vote ought to pass on
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
cacr2 let the people of New Hampshire
 
00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.070 align:start position:0%
cacr2 let the people of New Hampshire
decide

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
decide
 
00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:50.820 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
yes representative greeson
 
00:24:57.230 --> 00:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
representative uh according to the the
 
00:25:03.049 --> 00:25:03.059 align:start position:0%
text of the bill it says all persons
 
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:04.140 align:start position:0%
have the right to make their own
 
00:25:06.529 --> 00:25:06.539 align:start position:0%
reproductive decisions does this mean
 
00:25:07.789 --> 00:25:07.799 align:start position:0%
that someone who may have an affinity
 
00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:09.900 align:start position:0%
for animals or a brother and sister who
 
00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:11.580 align:start position:0%
would like to keep it in the family or
 
00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:13.620 align:start position:0%
perhaps maybe a minor attracted person
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
has the right to make their reproductive
 
00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
I did not catch that
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
I did not catch that question
 
00:25:26.159 --> 00:25:29.269 align:start position:0%
I did not catch that question
okay

00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
yeah the the I think the problem is that
 
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
the Acoustics are not great in here so
 
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative Gleason I wonder if
 
00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:38.700 align:start position:0%
you could maybe closer to the microphone
 
00:25:41.149 --> 00:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
I will speak a lot louder then how's
 
00:25:44.029 --> 00:25:44.039 align:start position:0%
this thank you okay
 
00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
the text of the bill says all persons
 
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
have the right to make their own
 
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
reproductive decisions
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
does that mean that someone who has an
 
00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:53.700 align:start position:0%
affinity for animals or a brother and
 
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
sister would like to keep it in the
 
00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:58.500 align:start position:0%
family or a minor attracted person may
 
00:26:00.169 --> 00:26:00.179 align:start position:0%
have that they have the right to make
 
00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:02.820 align:start position:0%
their own reproductive decisions
 
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%
I find that question offensive and I'm
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
not going to answer it
 
00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.730 align:start position:0%
not going to answer it
right

00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:07.740 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
any other questions for this Witness
 
00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:13.799 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much our next
 
00:26:15.529 --> 00:26:15.539 align:start position:0%
call on representative Gene knotter
 
00:26:15.539 --> 00:26:19.130 align:start position:0%
call on representative Gene knotter
please

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the record I'm Janine you
 
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
need not I'm sorry I'm Hillsborough 12.
 
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
I didn't know what I was going to say
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
today when I came here so I'm going to
 
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
tell you why I'm pro-life
 
00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
when I was 10 years old I saw pictures
 
00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:34.860 align:start position:0%
of little arms and legs in a pool of
 
00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:35.630 align:start position:0%
of little arms and legs in a pool of
blood

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
blood
 
00:26:38.029 --> 00:26:38.039 align:start position:0%
and I knew I was looking at pictures of
 
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
dead babies
 
00:26:42.049 --> 00:26:42.059 align:start position:0%
and I've always kept that image in my my
 
00:26:42.059 --> 00:26:44.570 align:start position:0%
and I've always kept that image in my my
mind

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
and uh in 1995 I lost a child
 
00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
I didn't lose a blob of of tissue it was
 
00:26:52.669 --> 00:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
a baby it was my baby
 
00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
and then I had a dream a very very Vivid
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
dream that the child was standing right
 
00:26:58.730 --> 00:26:58.740 align:start position:0%
next to my bed it was like I woke up and
 
00:27:00.529 --> 00:27:00.539 align:start position:0%
there's this child there looked like my
 
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
other kids but half the face was
 
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.529 align:start position:0%
other kids but half the face was
deformed

00:27:03.529 --> 00:27:03.539 align:start position:0%
deformed
 
00:27:06.049 --> 00:27:06.059 align:start position:0%
and I kind of put in my head on that's
 
00:27:07.850 --> 00:27:07.860 align:start position:0%
why the baby didn't make it but it was
 
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
my child and I loved him and I said oh
 
00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:11.820 align:start position:0%
no no I love you and I reached for him
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
and he backed away like in fear which in
 
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
my mind I thought well okay we can't
 
00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:17.580 align:start position:0%
touch what's on the other side and he
 
00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
was gone
 
00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
and I first became a mother when I was
 
00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
still a teenager
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
and that baby was a baby the day before
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
he was born
 
00:27:30.409 --> 00:27:30.419 align:start position:0%
three months before he was born
 
00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
and he was a miracle of life in the
 
00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
moment of conception
 
00:27:36.649 --> 00:27:36.659 align:start position:0%
even though I put the cart before the
 
00:27:36.659 --> 00:27:38.570 align:start position:0%
even though I put the cart before the
horse

00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
horse
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
I remember the words of a former drill
 
00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
sergeant who later became a priest and
 
00:27:45.049 --> 00:27:45.059 align:start position:0%
he had this deep voice that I cannot
 
00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:46.919 align:start position:0%
mimic but he said if you are in a
 
00:27:46.919 --> 00:27:48.049 align:start position:0%
mimic but he said if you are in a
position

00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:48.059 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
if you know that something is wrong and
 
00:27:51.649 --> 00:27:51.659 align:start position:0%
you are in a position to do something
 
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
about it and you do not
 
00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:56.220 align:start position:0%
then you are at fault
 
00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
so because I have this great fear of God
 
00:28:00.409 --> 00:28:00.419 align:start position:0%
and I remember his words and I'm
 
00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
pro-life I have to be here today
 
00:28:04.669 --> 00:28:04.679 align:start position:0%
to say that I think it is wrong to put
 
00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
this into law
 
00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
and if you're asking from trouble from
 
00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.549 align:start position:0%
and if you're asking from trouble from
above

00:28:10.549 --> 00:28:10.559 align:start position:0%
above
 
00:28:12.289 --> 00:28:12.299 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:28:13.789 --> 00:28:13.799 align:start position:0%
thank you representative questions
 
00:28:13.799 --> 00:28:17.630 align:start position:0%
thank you representative questions
representative

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:21.649 --> 00:28:21.659 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you um uh Sean uh Phil
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
00:28:33.409 --> 00:28:33.419 align:start position:0%
representative Sean filio and I have a
 
00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
privilege of representing Cheshire
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
district 7 which covers Keane's award
 
00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.390 align:start position:0%
district 7 which covers Keane's award
too

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:40.799 align:start position:0%
I'm here to talk to you today about some
 
00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
of the legal aspects of cacr2
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendments would apply
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
strict scrutiny to reproductive
 
00:28:49.919 --> 00:28:51.230 align:start position:0%
strict scrutiny to reproductive
decisions

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
as you may know strict scrutiny would
 
00:28:57.130 --> 00:28:57.140 align:start position:0%
require that in order for the government
 
00:29:00.649 --> 00:29:00.659 align:start position:0%
to apply limitations upon reproductive
 
00:29:00.659 --> 00:29:01.850 align:start position:0%
to apply limitations upon reproductive
decisions

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:04.500 align:start position:0%
the government would need to have a
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
compelling interest
 
00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:08.820 align:start position:0%
and that if the government had a
 
00:29:10.669 --> 00:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
compelling interest in applying
 
00:29:13.909 --> 00:29:13.919 align:start position:0%
limitations on reproductive decisions
 
00:29:16.669 --> 00:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
that any such limitations would need to
 
00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
be narrowly tailored this is a standard
 
00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
that has been applied by the U.S Supreme
 
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
Court and New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:26.360 align:start position:0%
for decades
 
00:29:30.289 --> 00:29:30.299 align:start position:0%
thus cscr 2 would not make it such that
 
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
there could be no limitations on
 
00:29:36.409 --> 00:29:36.419 align:start position:0%
reproductive decisions but rather that
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
such limitations would need to be
 
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
narrowly tailored to a compelling
 
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
governmental interest
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
let's take an example
 
00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
as one representative recently placed
 
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
could there be no limitation on
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
bestiality or pedophilia or incest the
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
answer is an unequivocal no of course
 
00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
there could be limitations because the
 
00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:04.860 align:start position:0%
government has a compelling governmental
 
00:30:09.889 --> 00:30:09.899 align:start position:0%
interest in prohibiting incest in
 
00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
bestiality so of course there could be
 
00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:15.980 align:start position:0%
limitations because there's a compelling
 
00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:19.740 align:start position:0%
governmental interest but any such
 
00:30:21.409 --> 00:30:21.419 align:start position:0%
limitations would just need to be
 
00:30:24.049 --> 00:30:24.059 align:start position:0%
narrowly tailored so that the law would
 
00:30:26.409 --> 00:30:26.419 align:start position:0%
go no further than what we need to do
 
00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
this is the standard that has always
 
00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
been applied to fundamental rights this
 
00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment just seeks to apply a
 
00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
governmental standard that has always
 
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
been in place
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
to reproductive decisions the key word
 
00:30:48.529 --> 00:30:48.539 align:start position:0%
here is reproductive decisions what does
 
00:30:52.730 --> 00:30:52.740 align:start position:0%
reproductive apply or mean it means what
 
00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:55.140 align:start position:0%
it means it means the dictionary meaning
 
00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
if we need to figure out what that means
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
that's the work that courts have always
 
00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
done we trust our judges and we trust
 
00:31:07.029 --> 00:31:07.039 align:start position:0%
our courts to determine what that means
 
00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:10.260 align:start position:0%
we simply ask that we now apply an
 
00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
existing standard to a new right I
 
00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
welcome your questions
 
00:31:18.649 --> 00:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
00:31:21.649 --> 00:31:21.659 align:start position:0%
representative greeson
 
00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
representative you've used the term
 
00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:27.500 align:start position:0%
compelling State interest
 
00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:30.899 align:start position:0%
uh multiple Supreme Court rulings have
 
00:31:33.169 --> 00:31:33.179 align:start position:0%
declared that the state
 
00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:35.700 align:start position:0%
this is U.S Supreme Court rulings that
 
00:31:39.529 --> 00:31:39.539 align:start position:0%
the state being the government has a a
 
00:31:42.049 --> 00:31:42.059 align:start position:0%
state interest in protecting the life of
 
00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
the baby
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
so how do you
 
00:31:48.769 --> 00:31:48.779 align:start position:0%
if if this U.S Supreme Court has already
 
00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
ruled that the state has a compelling
 
00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
interest in protecting the life of the
 
00:31:56.570 --> 00:31:56.580 align:start position:0%
baby at one point as the same time of
 
00:31:59.210 --> 00:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
protecting the rights of the woman then
 
00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:02.460 align:start position:0%
how does this bill not then contradict
 
00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
with the U.S Supreme Court has already
 
00:32:06.409 --> 00:32:06.419 align:start position:0%
ruled is a compelling State interest in
 
00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
protecting the life of the baby
 
00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:10.140 align:start position:0%
I think you're representative for the
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
question indeed the U.S Supreme Court
 
00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:13.980 align:start position:0%
has said that there is a compelling
 
00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
governmental interest in protecting the
 
00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
life of a an unborn child as well as the
 
00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
right of the the health of the mother
 
00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
that was said in Roe versus Wade so
 
00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:28.740 align:start position:0%
we're seeking to reinstate the standard
 
00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:32.820 align:start position:0%
of Roe versus Wade it's always the work
 
00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:35.820 align:start position:0%
of governments to balance
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
government is tough work
 
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
but that's what our constituents asked
 
00:32:45.649 --> 00:32:45.659 align:start position:0%
us to do is tough work it's always a
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
balance but I think we're up to the task
 
00:32:52.610 --> 00:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:54.649 --> 00:32:54.659 align:start position:0%
yes representative Manos
 
00:33:00.169 --> 00:33:00.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire state constitution
 
00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative could you
 
00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
please us pull your mic a little bit
 
00:33:09.889 --> 00:33:09.899 align:start position:0%
closer thank you sorry
 
00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
this is a proposed concept
 
00:33:13.009 --> 00:33:13.019 align:start position:0%
constitutional to the New Hampshire
 
00:33:13.019 --> 00:33:14.149 align:start position:0%
constitutional to the New Hampshire
state

00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:33:16.909 --> 00:33:16.919 align:start position:0%
Constitution is that correct yes
 
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
representative this is a proposed
 
00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
amendment to the New Hampshire state
 
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
constitution and as such it would be
 
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:23.940 align:start position:0%
submitted to the voters of New Hampshire
 
00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:25.980 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
yes representative this would be
 
00:33:29.269 --> 00:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
submitted to the voters of New Hampshire
 
00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
to decide whether they believe this is
 
00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
an appropriate right for them to have
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
under their state constitution this is
 
00:33:39.649 --> 00:33:39.659 align:start position:0%
asking whether we believe that as
 
00:33:42.049 --> 00:33:42.059 align:start position:0%
citizens of our state whether we want
 
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
this right just as citizens of other
 
00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
states have been asked a similar
 
00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
question and citizens of other states
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
have made that determination for
 
00:33:54.009 --> 00:33:54.019 align:start position:0%
themselves it should be a basic right of
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
citizens of this state to determine for
 
00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
themselves whether they want this right
 
00:34:00.889 --> 00:34:00.899 align:start position:0%
just as citizens of other states have
 
00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
had that privilege to decide if they
 
00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:04.820 align:start position:0%
want that right for themselves
 
00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:08.220 align:start position:0%
and isn't that the most democratic of
 
00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:10.679 align:start position:0%
processes to let the voters of New
 
00:34:13.369 --> 00:34:13.379 align:start position:0%
Hampshire decide for themselves whether
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
this amendment should be made to the
 
00:34:16.609 --> 00:34:16.619 align:start position:0%
state constitution
 
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative that would be seem to be
 
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
the fundamental definition of democracy
 
00:34:24.649 --> 00:34:24.659 align:start position:0%
to let the people decide for themselves
 
00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:30.770 --> 00:34:30.780 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative Morgan
 
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
um thank you thank you very much uh Mr
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
chair thank you very much to the
 
00:34:39.770 --> 00:34:39.780 align:start position:0%
representative from from uh from from
 
00:34:41.930 --> 00:34:41.940 align:start position:0%
from Keen
 
00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
um basically
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
men cannot get pregnant although we did
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
hear a anecdote in the hearing about
 
00:34:51.169 --> 00:34:51.179 align:start position:0%
transgender rights about a
 
00:34:54.649 --> 00:34:54.659 align:start position:0%
a you know a trans man who hadn't had
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
bottom surgery who got uh pregnant
 
00:35:00.109 --> 00:35:00.119 align:start position:0%
anyway but um so men can't get pregnant
 
00:35:01.849 --> 00:35:01.859 align:start position:0%
but do you think if we
 
00:35:04.609 --> 00:35:04.619 align:start position:0%
did get pregnant do you think this uh
 
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
ongoing debate of which this amendment's
 
00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:14.569 --> 00:35:14.579 align:start position:0%
uh well thank you representative uh as
 
00:35:14.579 --> 00:35:15.770 align:start position:0%
uh well thank you representative uh as
noted

00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
noted
 
00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
Transit trans men do get pregnant but I
 
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
think we also need to consider the fact
 
00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
that this bit of this amendment is about
 
00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
Reproductive Rights it deliberately does
 
00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:28.260 align:start position:0%
not use the word pregnancy men make
 
00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
reproductive decisions then decide
 
00:35:32.990 --> 00:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not to use a condom during
 
00:35:36.109 --> 00:35:36.119 align:start position:0%
sex men decide whether or not to get a
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
vasectomy this equally applies to those
 
00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
reproductive decisions if the government
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
wants to decide whether or not a man can
 
00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
get a vasectomy the government needs to
 
00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
have a pretty good reason to get
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
involved in that decision if the
 
00:35:53.569 --> 00:35:53.579 align:start position:0%
government wants to place restrictions
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
upon contraception such as condoms the
 
00:35:58.849 --> 00:35:58.859 align:start position:0%
government needs now to meet the strict
 
00:36:01.849 --> 00:36:01.859 align:start position:0%
scrutiny standard we need to recognize
 
00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
that this is reproductive
 
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
so yes it also applies to men and some
 
00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
of the reproductive decisions that men
 
00:36:13.609 --> 00:36:13.619 align:start position:0%
make because men make reproductive
 
00:36:13.619 --> 00:36:15.950 align:start position:0%
make because men make reproductive
decisions

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Stapleton
 
00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:23.220 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:26.220 align:start position:0%
I'm having trouble with the audio in
 
00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:28.380 align:start position:0%
here because of hearing aids so if I
 
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
miss something I apologize I first
 
00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:35.220 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask if you are an attorney and
 
00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
have a legal background
 
00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I I am an
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
attorney I I hold the bar here in New
 
00:36:42.829 --> 00:36:42.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and have also passed the the
 
00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:44.700 align:start position:0%
New York Bar I've had the privilege of
 
00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:46.740 align:start position:0%
serving with the attorneys general of
 
00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Vermont and Massachusetts
 
00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
and was a Federal Judicial law clerk
 
00:36:53.329 --> 00:36:53.339 align:start position:0%

out of Manhattan clearly I work remotely

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
if I caught this correctly before and
 
00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:11.339 align:start position:0%
part of your testimony
 
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
you seem to imply there should be a
 
00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:14.510 align:start position:0%
you seem to imply there should be a
balance

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
balance
 
00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:15.190 align:start position:0%
balance
um

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
between the mother and the child
 
00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
in the womb
 
00:37:24.349 --> 00:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
and a balance between
 
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
the the mother and the state compelling
 
00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.329 align:start position:0%
the the mother and the state compelling
interests

00:37:29.329 --> 00:37:29.339 align:start position:0%
interests
 
00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:31.380 align:start position:0%
now the question is
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
in Planned Parenthood versus Casey
 
00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:37.940 align:start position:0%
the viability standard
 
00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
came into the Forefront
 
00:37:43.609 --> 00:37:43.619 align:start position:0%
and I happen to think that that's a
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
decent standard but
 
00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
the viability If the child has the
 
00:37:51.890 --> 00:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
capability of surviving outside of the
 
00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:52.849 align:start position:0%
capability of surviving outside of the
womb

00:37:52.849 --> 00:37:52.859 align:start position:0%
womb
 
00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
does this come into play
 
00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
with your balancing and the state
 
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
compelling interest because in Casey
 
00:38:04.609 --> 00:38:04.619 align:start position:0%
that was stated that with viability that
 
00:38:06.609 --> 00:38:06.619 align:start position:0%
the state did have a compelling interest
 
00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:12.060 align:start position:0%
in the life of the pre-born child
 
00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:13.700 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:17.700 align:start position:0%
viability may have a role here if that's
 
00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
how the legislature decides to Define
 
00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:24.180 align:start position:0%
the balance between the rights of the
 
00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:26.460 align:start position:0%
mother and the rights of The Unborn and
 
00:38:28.849 --> 00:38:28.859 align:start position:0%
it may also be how these New Hampshire
 
00:38:30.770 --> 00:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decides to apply this
 
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
given the fact that
 
00:38:35.870 --> 00:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
the presented uh described has now
 
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
fallen under Dobbs it would be for the
 
00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court to decide
 
00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:42.300 align:start position:0%
how they would apply the standard but
 
00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:43.980 align:start position:0%
they would certainly look to the prior
 
00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
standards that had existed as being
 
00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:49.140 align:start position:0%
compelling and convincing but it's
 
00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
unclear if they would be binding given
 
00:38:54.310 --> 00:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
the fact that they've now fallen
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:59.510 align:start position:0%
other questions
yes

00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
um I have not had a chance to read the
 
00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:04.980 align:start position:0%
complete Dobbs decision but
 
00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:06.900 align:start position:0%
um the question would be
 
00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
how much of Roe Doe
 
00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
and Casey
 
00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
um was obliterated by the Dobb's
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
decision or are there pieces of those
 
00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
things that still survive in the
 
00:39:25.329 --> 00:39:25.339 align:start position:0%
decision of the of the doc's decision
 
00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:28.079 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I think that is
 
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
the question that we're also working out
 
00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
and will be the question that we figure
 
00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:35.220 align:start position:0%
out over the next few decades if I knew
 
00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:36.540 align:start position:0%
the answer for that I think I would be
 
00:39:37.849 --> 00:39:37.859 align:start position:0%
sitting at a different chair than I am
 
00:39:37.859 --> 00:39:39.230 align:start position:0%
sitting at a different chair than I am
now

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:39:43.609 --> 00:39:43.619 align:start position:0%
other other questions for this week
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much sir
 
00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
thank you my call on former
 
00:39:49.609 --> 00:39:49.619 align:start position:0%
representative Kurt Wolpert
 
00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
and the next person after that will be
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative sellers just so you'll
 
00:39:58.849 --> 00:39:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:58.859 --> 00:40:00.109 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:40:00.109 --> 00:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:02.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:05.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:08.349 --> 00:40:08.359 align:start position:0%
like this
 
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
okay so for the record my name is uh
 
00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:15.300 align:start position:0%
Kurt Wilbur I reside in Stratford New
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm vice president of New
 
00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:19.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rights life I put down two
 
00:40:22.490 --> 00:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
minutes I'm going to say within it
 
00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:24.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire right to life is in total
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
opposition to this
 
00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:28.069 align:start position:0%
opposition to this
because

00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:30.300 align:start position:0%
there can be no concept you know what I
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
think we're really having trouble
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
hearing you uh representative Wilbur I'm
 
00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:38.329 --> 00:40:38.339 align:start position:0%
oh yeah
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
there you go good idea yeah thank you
 
00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:40:46.849 --> 00:40:46.859 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire right tonight is uh
 
00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:51.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it there all right start over
 
00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:09.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire right to life has posted
 
00:41:12.650 --> 00:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
this because it can be no constitutional
 
00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
right along these lines
 
00:41:18.349 --> 00:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
that can be known for two reasons and
 
00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
has to do with a
 
00:41:22.370 --> 00:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
with the fact that
 
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
this is the right to abortion abortion
 
00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:27.660 align:start position:0%
is an intentional killing of an innocent
 
00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:29.060 align:start position:0%
human being
 
00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
that cannot be constitutional
 
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
that is opposed by every part
 
00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:38.220 align:start position:0%
of our body of law
 
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
the second is they want to put it in the
 
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
right to privacy
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
there are at least two individuals human
 
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:45.540 align:start position:0%
beings involved
 
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
when the decision about abortion is made
 
00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:52.140 align:start position:0%
mother and the child
 
00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:53.450 align:start position:0%
mother and the child
and

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:53.460 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
there could be many others
 
00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
uh very closely related
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
would be seriously impacted as well
 
00:42:06.829 --> 00:42:06.839 align:start position:0%
to allow one person to so severely
 
00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
impact the other people is not a matter
 
00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:11.700 align:start position:0%
of privacy
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of community
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
and so if you were to adopt this at all
 
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't go into the Privacy part
 
00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
of the Constitution you'll have to find
 
00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:27.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:29.540 align:start position:0%
the idea that
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
the established in Roe versus Wade
 
00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court recognize that it did
 
00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
not know
 
00:42:40.849 --> 00:42:40.859 align:start position:0%
what was in the womb
 
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
today we know but they said if we did
 
00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
know what it was
 
00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
and it was human being
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
and that human being would already be
 
00:42:53.089 --> 00:42:53.099 align:start position:0%
protected this is 1973.
 
00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:55.740 align:start position:0%
would already be protected by the United
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
States Constitution Article 14.
 
00:43:01.609 --> 00:43:01.619 align:start position:0%
which means essentially what I just said
 
00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:05.220 align:start position:0%
that can be no right no constitutional
 
00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:06.170 align:start position:0%
that can be no right no constitutional
right

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:06.180 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
to to abortion
 
00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:11.460 align:start position:0%
and the last thing I'd like to say is
 
00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:12.530 align:start position:0%
and the last thing I'd like to say is
that

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:14.569 --> 00:43:14.579 align:start position:0%
when they talk about reproductive
 
00:43:14.579 --> 00:43:16.490 align:start position:0%
when they talk about reproductive
anything

00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
they're really talking about abortion
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
because nothing else is really a matter
 
00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:21.470 align:start position:0%
because nothing else is really a matter
of

00:43:21.470 --> 00:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
dispute in our society and I think if we
 
00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
want to put this in into anything
 
00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:29.700 align:start position:0%
it should talk about what it's talking
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
about and not hide behind the euphemism
 
00:43:35.569 --> 00:43:35.579 align:start position:0%
of reproduction and with that I will
 
00:43:35.579 --> 00:43:37.069 align:start position:0%
of reproduction and with that I will
conclude

00:43:37.069 --> 00:43:37.079 align:start position:0%
conclude
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:43.809 --> 00:43:43.819 align:start position:0%

going to list the towns just to give you
 
00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
an idea if you haven't heard before
 
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear them at least once
 
00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:11.700 align:start position:0%
I represent Alexandria Bristol
 
00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:14.700 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater Heber and Groton Dorchester
 
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
orange Grafton itself Canaan and Enfield
 
00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
those towns I like to say we would all
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
be on the same page and we'll 100
 
00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
agreement in this bill but of course
 
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
we're not and as we all know we're
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
pretty divided what's going on here and
 
00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.569 align:start position:0%
pretty divided what's going on here and
uh

00:44:32.569 --> 00:44:32.579 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
but I did want to bring up a few items
 
00:44:38.510 --> 00:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
it is I I honestly believe that
 
00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:45.900 align:start position:0%
our state and any government does not
 
00:44:48.109 --> 00:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
have any rights
 
00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
or any say over any reproduction of a
 
00:44:54.109 --> 00:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
male or a female
 
00:44:54.119 --> 00:44:55.609 align:start position:0%
male or a female
zero

00:44:55.609 --> 00:44:55.619 align:start position:0%
zero
 
00:44:59.450 --> 00:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
however because of the predicament and
 
00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
the times we're in
 
00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
we're trying to solve problems by
 
00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:07.260 align:start position:0%
putting in amendments and also other
 
00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:08.569 align:start position:0%
putting in amendments and also other
bills

00:45:08.569 --> 00:45:08.579 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:45:11.450 --> 00:45:11.460 align:start position:0%
because of the times we're in and
 
00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
which I disagree with but they're here
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
and since they're here we need to
 
00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
address them
 
00:45:20.809 --> 00:45:20.819 align:start position:0%
so one thing I have here is uh maybe two
 
00:45:20.819 --> 00:45:22.069 align:start position:0%
so one thing I have here is uh maybe two
things

00:45:22.069 --> 00:45:22.079 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:45:24.349 --> 00:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
it says I just want to make sure this
 
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
bill and that's unfortunate maybe even
 
00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:27.660 align:start position:0%
when you guys deliberate and stuff at
 
00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
that point it says uh an individual's
 
00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
right to personal reproduction I take
 
00:45:36.589 --> 00:45:36.599 align:start position:0%
that as male and female I'm not looking
 
00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:38.460 align:start position:0%
at this as just a female issue it's a
 
00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:40.020 align:start position:0%
male issue as well
 
00:45:42.829 --> 00:45:42.839 align:start position:0%
that's one the second part it says I'm
 
00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
going to read on line five
 
00:45:46.849 --> 00:45:46.859 align:start position:0%
says infringed
 
00:45:50.569 --> 00:45:50.579 align:start position:0%
unless justified by a compelling State
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
interest and so on
 
00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
man if I was a lawyer and I'm not a
 
00:45:57.890 --> 00:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
lawyer but I think I could come up with
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
about 50 different ways of saying
 
00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:03.780 align:start position:0%
the state could be justified so I I look
 
00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:06.300 align:start position:0%
at this and I say this bill is going to
 
00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:09.060 align:start position:0%
be very vague and open to interpretation
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
and would be a real problem if it's put
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
forward thank you
 
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%

Rodriguez Murray and I'm very proud to
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
be a co-sponsor of this legislation
 
00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
last July the unthinkable happened and
 
00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court Court overturned Roe e
 
00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:53.690 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court Court overturned Roe e
Wade

00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:53.700 align:start position:0%
Wade
 
00:46:55.849 --> 00:46:55.859 align:start position:0%
since then we've seen thousands of women
 
00:46:57.890 --> 00:46:57.900 align:start position:0%
young girls and other pregnant people
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
struggle to get often the life-saving
 
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
care that they need
 
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
while New Hampshire laws have remained
 
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
stable during this time we have seen an
 
00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
increase of patients from out of state
 
00:47:11.210 --> 00:47:11.220 align:start position:0%
coming to access abortion care in New
 
00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire these patients are receiving
 
00:47:15.370 --> 00:47:15.380 align:start position:0%
delayed care that is more stressful
 
00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:17.700 align:start position:0%
expensive and feels out of their control
 
00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:20.220 align:start position:0%
we must protect New Hampshire citizens
 
00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:21.960 align:start position:0%
from the same fate
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
the fall row confirmed what Granite
 
00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
theaters have always known we cannot
 
00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
depend on the federal government to
 
00:47:30.130 --> 00:47:30.140 align:start position:0%
protect our rights
 
00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
cacr2 is exactly the kind of legislation
 
00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
we needed at this moment a democratic
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
way for our constituents and fellow
 
00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire to determine
 
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
the future of abortion in New Hampshire
 
00:47:42.589 --> 00:47:42.599 align:start position:0%
and for themselves the people of New
 
00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire deserve to know that their
 
00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:46.500 align:start position:0%
Reproductive Rights are protected in the
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
state that they live in and that the
 
00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
laws will constantly change back and
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
forth every two years let New Hampshire
 
00:47:54.589 --> 00:47:54.599 align:start position:0%

there's no freedom for the baby in the
 
00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:43.220 align:start position:0%
womb when it comes to reproduction
 
00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
reproductive freedom and reproductive
 
00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:49.020 align:start position:0%
freedom is just a means
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
just means a woman can kill a living
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
human being with no repercussions from
 
00:48:56.329 --> 00:48:56.339 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
if you vote Yes on cacr2 your coursening
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's Culture by adding this
 
00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:05.460 align:start position:0%
resolution to our constitution
 
00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
our world is coursing coarsening more
 
00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:12.140 align:start position:0%
and more each day with violence drugs
 
00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:16.140 align:start position:0%
suicides sex trafficking social media
 
00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
attacks canceling people and the
 
00:49:20.809 --> 00:49:20.819 align:start position:0%
bullying of children who are fortunate
 
00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
enough to be born
 
00:49:25.790 --> 00:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
then there's the lies told to women that
 
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
they can abort the baby in their womb
 
00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
and feel good about it
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
I still don't believe after hearing the
 
00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
um sponsor of this bill that a woman can
 
00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
abort her baby and feel good about it
 
00:49:42.470 --> 00:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
also the hard hearts that tell the
 
00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
mother it's okay to kill your baby
 
00:49:49.690 --> 00:49:49.700 align:start position:0%
instead of giving them real loving help
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
with support to keep the baby or
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
suggesting adoption
 
00:49:57.230 --> 00:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
all of you on this committee have the
 
00:49:59.809 --> 00:49:59.819 align:start position:0%
power of life and death in your vote
 
00:50:02.569 --> 00:50:02.579 align:start position:0%
please choose life and help our culture
 
00:50:05.329 --> 00:50:05.339 align:start position:0%
soften its attitude toward life
 
00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
and I just like to share one thing
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
that happened to me I was protesting in
 
00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:14.220 align:start position:0%
front of a Planned Parenthood and a car
 
00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:16.740 align:start position:0%
stopped in front of me and it was a
 
00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:18.300 align:start position:0%
woman in the car and she started
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
screaming at me and hollering at me
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
because my sign said and abortion
 
00:50:25.370 --> 00:50:25.380 align:start position:0%
and she had two children in the back of
 
00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
that car
 
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
and her language wasn't good either
 
00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:32.210 align:start position:0%
and her language wasn't good either
so

00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:32.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:34.740 align:start position:0%
after she started stopped screaming at
 
00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:37.079 align:start position:0%
me she turned around to the children who
 
00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
I think one was probably about 10 and
 
00:50:41.809 --> 00:50:41.819 align:start position:0%
the other was younger
 
00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:44.220 align:start position:0%
she said to the kids what did we say to
 
00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:45.530 align:start position:0%
she said to the kids what did we say to
her

00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
her
 
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
and they dropped the F-bomb the two
 
00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:51.300 align:start position:0%
children in the back knew what this
 
00:50:53.809 --> 00:50:53.819 align:start position:0%
person was telling them to do so you
 
00:50:56.329 --> 00:50:56.339 align:start position:0%
know with these children are adults now
 
00:50:59.150 --> 00:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
because this was about 15 years ago so
 
00:51:02.329 --> 00:51:02.339 align:start position:0%
the coarsening of our
 
00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
um culture
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
was happening then
 
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
and now we have people like that woman
 
00:51:11.569 --> 00:51:11.579 align:start position:0%
telling these children
 
00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:15.180 align:start position:0%
you know to say that to me and
 
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
I I still can't get over it to tell you
 
00:51:19.069 --> 00:51:19.079 align:start position:0%
the truth
 
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
um so thank you and I'm also asking you
 
00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:25.880 align:start position:0%

00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:32.760 align:start position:0%

00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:35.400 align:start position:0%

00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
00:51:59.630 --> 00:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
committee I'm Bob Dunn the director of
 
00:52:02.329 --> 00:52:02.339 align:start position:0%
public policy for the Roman Catholic
 
00:52:04.849 --> 00:52:04.859 align:start position:0%
Diocese of Manchester and I'm here today
 
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
on behalf of Bishop Peter labashi to uh
 
00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:10.210 align:start position:0%
on behalf of Bishop Peter labashi to uh
oppose

00:52:10.210 --> 00:52:10.220 align:start position:0%
oppose
 
00:52:13.609 --> 00:52:13.619 align:start position:0%
cacr2 is that okay can you hear me all
 
00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
right yes thank you I have written
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
testimony so I just want to make a
 
00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:20.460 align:start position:0%
couple of quick comments if I might
 
00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
um first of all
 
00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:23.940 align:start position:0%
if there's one thing that I suspect
 
00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:27.300 align:start position:0%
everybody in this room agrees on it's
 
00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:31.260 align:start position:0%
that in certain ways human dignity and
 
00:52:34.370 --> 00:52:34.380 align:start position:0%
solidarity are things that are beset by
 
00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
many challenges in today's world
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
and so I asked the committee to think
 
00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
about this question as you deliberate on
 
00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
this cacr
 
00:52:49.849 --> 00:52:49.859 align:start position:0%
will the work of building up human
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
dignity and solidarity be Advanced or
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
hindered by the adoption of a
 
00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment that
 
00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
effectively declares a certain category
 
00:53:07.690 --> 00:53:07.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
proposals like this inevitably have
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
repercussions in other areas
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
if we want Society to recognize the
 
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
human dignity of the young human being
 
00:53:23.650 --> 00:53:23.660 align:start position:0%
at the border or the young human being
 
00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
who is homeless
 
00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
or the young human being who is in need
 
00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
of health care then we need to recognize
 
00:53:35.210 --> 00:53:35.220 align:start position:0%
the human dignity of the young human
 
00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:38.940 align:start position:0%
being in the womb as well
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
if we begin to ask Society to treat
 
00:53:45.890 --> 00:53:45.900 align:start position:0%
certain ones of us as expendable
 
00:53:49.849 --> 00:53:49.859 align:start position:0%
then we can't be surprised if Society
 
00:53:52.849 --> 00:53:52.859 align:start position:0%
begins to treat certain ones of us as
 
00:53:52.859 --> 00:53:55.130 align:start position:0%
begins to treat certain ones of us as
expendable

00:53:55.130 --> 00:53:55.140 align:start position:0%
expendable
 
00:53:58.910 --> 00:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
and so I ask you to vote down this
 
00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:01.980 align:start position:0%
proposal thank you thank you Mr John uh
 
00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:08.089 --> 00:54:08.099 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:10.140 align:start position:0%
um representative Jody Newell please
 
00:54:13.130 --> 00:54:13.140 align:start position:0%
next and uh the next witness after that
 
00:54:17.290 --> 00:54:17.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:20.460 align:start position:0%
I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you to
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee my name is
 
00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:25.980 align:start position:0%
Jody Newell I'm a representative
 
00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
representing Cheshire four
 
00:54:30.890 --> 00:54:30.900 align:start position:0%
um a very solidly uh pro-choice District
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to be here today
 
00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
representing my constituency
 
00:54:36.109 --> 00:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
as I thought about what I was going to
 
00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
say today I was once again filled with a
 
00:54:39.950 --> 00:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
sense of discouragement
 
00:54:43.370 --> 00:54:43.380 align:start position:0%
we are so set in our ways it seems we've
 
00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:46.260 align:start position:0%
staked our flags firmly on either side
 
00:54:48.349 --> 00:54:48.359 align:start position:0%
and by God we'll fight to the death to
 
00:54:50.569 --> 00:54:50.579 align:start position:0%
defend our positions
 
00:54:52.849 --> 00:54:52.859 align:start position:0%
now what in this context could I
 
00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
possibly say that would change the mind
 
00:54:57.410 --> 00:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
of someone who believes that abortion is
 
00:54:57.420 --> 00:54:59.450 align:start position:0%
of someone who believes that abortion is
murder

00:54:59.450 --> 00:54:59.460 align:start position:0%
murder
 
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
and after a lot of time and thought I
 
00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
decided to share a little bit about my
 
00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:06.380 align:start position:0%
own Journey from regular March for Life
 
00:55:09.170 --> 00:55:09.180 align:start position:0%
participants in attendee to abortion
 
00:55:11.569 --> 00:55:11.579 align:start position:0%
Storyteller to Civil Disobedience
 
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
participant and willing or SD on behalf
 
00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
of the right to choose
 
00:55:19.010 --> 00:55:19.020 align:start position:0%
I intend to address two points the first
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
is that abortion should be legal and
 
00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
second that it should be an unencumbered
 
00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:24.230 align:start position:0%
second that it should be an unencumbered
right

00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:55:26.569 --> 00:55:26.579 align:start position:0%
and I won't I won't throw statistics at
 
00:55:29.809 --> 00:55:29.819 align:start position:0%
you I know we're a wash with statistics
 
00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
but that part actually plays a pretty
 
00:55:34.730 --> 00:55:34.740 align:start position:0%
significant role in my journey
 
00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
see I was raised in a Conservative
 
00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
Christian household with a fiercely
 
00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:40.740 align:start position:0%
loving mama who devoted much of her time
 
00:55:43.390 --> 00:55:43.400 align:start position:0%
and energy to overturning Roe v Wade
 
00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:46.380 align:start position:0%
every January we travel to DC on a bus
 
00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
to the March for Life and I believe
 
00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:50.220 align:start position:0%
myself that abortion was murder
 
00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
so so much so that I was the one person
 
00:55:55.549 --> 00:55:55.559 align:start position:0%
in my high school class who would stand
 
00:55:58.250 --> 00:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
up Standalone arguing and defending this
 
00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
point I remember a paper I wrote once
 
00:56:03.230 --> 00:56:03.240 align:start position:0%
and the disdain I felt at Corrections
 
00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:04.980 align:start position:0%
from my teacher on the statistics I used
 
00:56:06.770 --> 00:56:06.780 align:start position:0%
to back up my claims
 
00:56:09.410 --> 00:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
but being you know me
 
00:56:11.809 --> 00:56:11.819 align:start position:0%
I was not satisfied with just knowing
 
00:56:14.210 --> 00:56:14.220 align:start position:0%
that I was right I needed to prove my
 
00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
point smug teacher be damned
 
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
that was when I signed up for a
 
00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
newsletter from Nero it's not that I
 
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
trusted them in fact I thought they were
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
evil but I did this in order to pick
 
00:56:30.049 --> 00:56:30.059 align:start position:0%
apart their alternative facts their
 
00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
competing statistics
 
00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
but in the end I had to take a good look
 
00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:35.400 align:start position:0%
at my own
 
00:56:37.130 --> 00:56:37.140 align:start position:0%
this effort led me to understand the
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
true nature of abortion because the way
 
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
it had been presented to me was false it
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
was inaccurate it was emotional
 
00:56:48.170 --> 00:56:48.180 align:start position:0%
I still can't get this image out of my
 
00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:49.190 align:start position:0%
I still can't get this image out of my
mind

00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
mind
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
30 years later and I won't describe it
 
00:56:52.849 --> 00:56:52.859 align:start position:0%
here I don't want to put you all through
 
00:56:52.859 --> 00:56:54.049 align:start position:0%
here I don't want to put you all through
that

00:56:54.049 --> 00:56:54.059 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
let me just say that for a long time I
 
00:56:58.670 --> 00:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
believe that partial birth abortion was
 
00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:00.049 align:start position:0%
believe that partial birth abortion was
abortion

00:57:00.049 --> 00:57:00.059 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:02.220 align:start position:0%
this is propaganda
 
00:57:04.250 --> 00:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
this is indoctrination
 
00:57:08.329 --> 00:57:08.339 align:start position:0%
what it is not is factual in reality
 
00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:10.440 align:start position:0%
the overwhelming majority of abortion is
 
00:57:12.410 --> 00:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
still legal in New Hampshire because it
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
happens well before 20 weeks well before
 
00:57:17.089 --> 00:57:17.099 align:start position:0%
a fetus becomes the full-grown viable
 
00:57:19.250 --> 00:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
precious baby portrayed in the image
 
00:57:21.170 --> 00:57:21.180 align:start position:0%
that I remember in my mind
 
00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
so why as a mother of two amazing human
 
00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
beings created in my own womb and of
 
00:57:28.849 --> 00:57:28.859 align:start position:0%
whom I am so extremely proud to have
 
00:57:30.770 --> 00:57:30.780 align:start position:0%
brought into this world do I believe
 
00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
this should be an unencumbered right
 
00:57:37.130 --> 00:57:37.140 align:start position:0%
with no restrictions from the government
 
00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
well let me tell you about these babies
 
00:57:41.450 --> 00:57:41.460 align:start position:0%
entrants in the world
 
00:57:43.790 --> 00:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
one was a year and the other yet to be
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
born just three weeks out when their
 
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
father my fiance at the time
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
overdose on heroin in our bathroom ten
 
00:57:52.849 --> 00:57:52.859 align:start position:0%
feet away on the other side of a closed
 
00:57:52.859 --> 00:57:53.990 align:start position:0%
feet away on the other side of a closed
door

00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
door
 
00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
even saying that now as a legislator as
 
00:57:59.030 --> 00:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
someone who tries to do good things in
 
00:58:00.349 --> 00:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
this world
 
00:58:02.930 --> 00:58:02.940 align:start position:0%
there's a twinge of fear that you'll
 
00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
judge me
 
00:58:06.049 --> 00:58:06.059 align:start position:0%
demean me
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
I am perpetually afraid that my past
 
00:58:12.829 --> 00:58:12.839 align:start position:0%
even even if the reality in context
 
00:58:15.650 --> 00:58:15.660 align:start position:0%
isn't explained in detail even if you
 
00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:17.700 align:start position:0%
know and love someone who has found
 
00:58:19.790 --> 00:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
themselves in a similar situation even
 
00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:22.680 align:start position:0%
if you are a compassionate person who
 
00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
makes all efforts not to as does my mama
 
00:58:29.809 --> 00:58:29.819 align:start position:0%
that your opinion of me will change and
 
00:58:32.690 --> 00:58:32.700 align:start position:0%
you will value my words less
 
00:58:35.450 --> 00:58:35.460 align:start position:0%
but I say it all the same because having
 
00:58:37.849 --> 00:58:37.859 align:start position:0%
known that judgment having had my
 
00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
Integrity questioned my motive
 
00:58:42.530 --> 00:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
scrutinized and worked
 
00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
in other people's minds and having found
 
00:58:48.589 --> 00:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
the strength to fight back I cannot and
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
will not remain silent when good people

there are as many situations as there

are people and to assign malice to

install roadblocks to impose faceless
 
00:59:09.589 --> 00:59:09.599 align:start position:0%

we as a legislature and collectively the

00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
we be in the business of assessing the

Merit of each individual situation these
 
00:59:32.690 --> 00:59:32.700 align:start position:0%
are these very personal and impactful

reproductive medical decisions
 
01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
in November of 2018 81 percent of New
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire voters approved adding 22 more

in private or personal information is
 
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
natural essential and inherent these
 
01:01:04.789 --> 01:01:04.799 align:start position:0%
words added as article 2B
 
01:01:08.329 --> 01:01:08.339 align:start position:0%
this amendment was about control and who
 
01:01:10.849 --> 01:01:10.859 align:start position:0%
has it New Hampshire citizens want
 
01:01:13.849 --> 01:01:13.859 align:start position:0%
control over their private and personal
 
01:01:13.859 --> 01:01:15.710 align:start position:0%
control over their private and personal

01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:01:19.069 --> 01:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
our proposal of cacr-2 would be added as
 
01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:23.220 align:start position:0%
Article 2 C with 31 Words which
 
01:01:26.030 --> 01:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
complement article 2B
 
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
the right to make personal reproductive
 
01:01:31.309 --> 01:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
medical decisions is in Violet and
 
01:01:33.069 --> 01:01:33.079 align:start position:0%
fundamental to The Human Condition
 
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
neither the state nor any political
 
01:01:38.829 --> 01:01:38.839 align:start position:0%
subdivision shall infringe upon or
 
01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
unduly inconvenience this right this
 
01:01:45.730 --> 01:01:45.740 align:start position:0%
amendment like 2B is also about control
 
01:01:49.490 --> 01:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
and claiming it unequivocally this
 
01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
amendment didn't come out of thin air
 
01:01:53.569 --> 01:01:53.579 align:start position:0%
and it has inspiration from current
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
statutes and legislative intent let me
 
01:01:58.970 --> 01:01:58.980 align:start position:0%
elaborate in doing legislative research
 
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
there's another place in New Hampshire
 
01:02:03.049 --> 01:02:03.059 align:start position:0%
law I would like to share with you the
 
01:02:04.990 --> 01:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
first part of chapter
 
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
137-j titled written directives for
 
01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
adults without capacity to make medical
 
01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:12.109 align:start position:0%
adults without capacity to make medical
decisions

01:02:12.109 --> 01:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
it states its purpose in policy as the
 
01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire recognizes that
 
01:02:21.010 --> 01:02:21.020 align:start position:0%
individual persons have the right
 
01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:24.780 align:start position:0%
founded in the autonomy and sanctity of
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
a person to control the decisions
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
relating to the rendering of their own
 
01:02:33.289 --> 01:02:33.299 align:start position:0%
Medical Care
 
01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire legislature has
 
01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:38.220 align:start position:0%
amended this chapter three times and
 
01:02:42.049 --> 01:02:42.059 align:start position:0%
consistently reiterated that purpose and
 
01:02:44.089 --> 01:02:44.099 align:start position:0%
policy statement the state of New
 
01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire recognizes that its citizens
 
01:02:51.410 --> 01:02:51.420 align:start position:0%
have the right founded in the autonomy
 
01:02:55.370 --> 01:02:55.380 align:start position:0%
and sanctity of a person to control the
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
decisions relating to the rendering of
 
01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:01.079 align:start position:0%
their own Medical Care and yet
 
01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
when that New Hampshire citizen is
 
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
pregnant their rights to control
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
decisions related to their medical care
 
01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:10.380 align:start position:0%
and the privacy of that personal
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
information is thrown away
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
pregnancy seems to be the line where
 
01:03:17.289 --> 01:03:17.299 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights are Stripped Away
 
01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
in Article 1 equality of men origin and
 
01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
object of government all men are born
 
01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:26.940 align:start position:0%
equally free and independent therefore
 
01:03:29.930 --> 01:03:29.940 align:start position:0%
all government of right originates from
 
01:03:33.109 --> 01:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
the people is founded in consent and
 
01:03:36.589 --> 01:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
instituted for the general good
 
01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
there is no caveat in Article 1 that
 
01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
says all men are born equally free and
 
01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:45.829 align:start position:0%
says all men are born equally free and
independent

01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
independent
 
01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:47.700 align:start position:0%
except when pregnant
 
01:03:49.609 --> 01:03:49.619 align:start position:0%
and yet that loss of freedom and
 
01:03:52.849 --> 01:03:52.859 align:start position:0%
Independence is exactly what happens
 
01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
Article 2 natural rights all men have
 
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
certain natural essential and inherent
 
01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:03.839 align:start position:0%

01:04:09.289 --> 01:04:09.299 align:start position:0%
possessing and protecting property and
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
in a word of seeking and obtaining
 
01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:15.180 align:start position:0%
happiness equality of rights under the
 
01:04:18.049 --> 01:04:18.059 align:start position:0%
law shall not be denied or Abridged by
 
01:04:20.450 --> 01:04:20.460 align:start position:0%
this state on account of race Creed

except when pregnant
 
01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire citizen who is pregnant
 
01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
loses the benefit of their life and
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
Liberty particularly if their pregnancy
 
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
is life-threatening or their pregnancy
 
01:04:43.450 --> 01:04:43.460 align:start position:0%
loses viability they're affirmative
 
01:04:46.730 --> 01:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
rights to seek Happiness by making
 
01:04:49.210 --> 01:04:49.220 align:start position:0%
reproductive medical decisions
 
01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
independently as is their natural right
 
01:04:55.849 --> 01:04:55.859 align:start position:0%
is Stripped Away they no longer have
 
01:04:58.069 --> 01:04:58.079 align:start position:0%
control over their own body they are
 
01:05:00.970 --> 01:05:00.980 align:start position:0%
enslaved to a law
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
marginalizing pregnant women by
 
01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:04.740 align:start position:0%
stripping them of their natural
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
essential and inherent rights is not
 
01:05:09.890 --> 01:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire way
 
01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:13.260 align:start position:0%
when a person does not have freedom over
 
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
their reproductive decisions with
 
01:05:20.329 --> 01:05:20.339 align:start position:0%
affirmative rights because the state can
 
01:05:20.339 --> 01:05:21.829 align:start position:0%
affirmative rights because the state can
interfere

01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:21.839 align:start position:0%
interfere
 
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
they are chattel
 
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
this is not the New Hampshire way
 
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens value our natural
 
01:05:32.569 --> 01:05:32.579 align:start position:0%
rights and it is an unjust and undue
 
01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
burden to restrict the reproductive
 
01:05:37.069 --> 01:05:37.079 align:start position:0%
medical decisions made by citizens it is
 
01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
our time to enshrine our values of
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
freedom of reproductive decisions into
 
01:05:46.210 --> 01:05:46.220 align:start position:0%
our state constitution because
 
01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
constitutional protections for
 
01:05:50.569 --> 01:05:50.579 align:start position:0%
Reproductive Rights are the gold
 
01:05:50.579 --> 01:05:51.849 align:start position:0%
Reproductive Rights are the gold
standard

01:05:51.849 --> 01:05:51.859 align:start position:0%
standard
 
01:05:55.730 --> 01:05:55.740 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask you to recommend cacr-2
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
ought to pass thank you questions for
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:05.210 --> 01:06:05.220 align:start position:0%

I'm having difficulty with hearing and
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%

01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%

relative to privacy in this argument in
 
01:06:30.289 --> 01:06:30.299 align:start position:0%
this issue

are there any limits or better term
 
01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
would be conditions
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
on how privacy governs
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
this individual right
 
01:06:45.549 --> 01:06:45.559 align:start position:0%
of reproductive Freedom specifically
 
01:06:47.569 --> 01:06:47.579 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:06:50.930 --> 01:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
how it may affect other persons
 
01:06:54.589 --> 01:06:54.599 align:start position:0%
including the conception partner
 
01:06:57.069 --> 01:06:57.079 align:start position:0%
as well as the
 
01:06:59.210 --> 01:06:59.220 align:start position:0%
individual person
 
01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
being grown in the womb
 
01:07:03.950 --> 01:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry as well as the individual
 
01:07:07.309 --> 01:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
person what that last bit Yeah the
 
01:07:09.710 --> 01:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
individual person being
 
01:07:12.349 --> 01:07:12.359 align:start position:0%
grown in the womb as well as the
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
conception partner to raise that
 
01:07:17.089 --> 01:07:17.099 align:start position:0%
individual if it were to be born
 
01:07:19.130 --> 01:07:19.140 align:start position:0%
I understand that I thank you thank you
 
01:07:20.690 --> 01:07:20.700 align:start position:0%
for the question and allowing me
 
01:07:22.010 --> 01:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
up to
 
01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
um to clarify that
 
01:07:24.599 --> 01:07:26.930 align:start position:0%
um to clarify that
um this

01:07:26.930 --> 01:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
um this
 
01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
this Constitutional Amendment
 
01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
is designed to make sure that we are
 
01:07:37.490 --> 01:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
focusing on the person here the person
 
01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:41.700 align:start position:0%
now who is covered by the Constitution
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
women should have freedom to make their
 
01:07:49.309 --> 01:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
own reproductive choices it is not the
 
01:07:51.890 --> 01:07:51.900 align:start position:0%
state's responsibility it's not the
 
01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
state's purview to get inside a woman's
 
01:07:58.490 --> 01:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
body and make any decisions for what is
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
right for her medically at any point it
 
01:08:05.410 --> 01:08:05.420 align:start position:0%
is her decision to make part
 
01:08:07.809 --> 01:08:07.819 align:start position:0%
particularly reproductive choices
 
01:08:10.730 --> 01:08:10.740 align:start position:0%
because they are reproduction
 
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
reproduction is dangerous it is it can
 
01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
be life-threatening it is not an easy
 
01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
thing to do it permanently changes
 
01:08:23.709 --> 01:08:23.719 align:start position:0%
someone's body and entering into
 
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
making a choice to have a pregnancy and
 
01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
follow through if possible with that
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
pregnancy is not our business the
 
01:08:36.769 --> 01:08:36.779 align:start position:0%
privacy of making medical decisions
 
01:08:39.410 --> 01:08:39.420 align:start position:0%
should be with that person
 
01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:41.460 align:start position:0%
I hope that answers your question in
 
01:08:45.410 --> 01:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
I hear that um
 
01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
but essentially does the conception
 
01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:52.669 align:start position:0%
but essentially does the conception
partner

01:08:52.669 --> 01:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
partner
 
01:08:57.410 --> 01:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
also have that right uh to participate
 
01:09:00.530 --> 01:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
and that's it is a soul right of the
 
01:09:04.729 --> 01:09:04.739 align:start position:0%
woman or does the right expand or extend
 
01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
to the conception partner the other
 
01:09:11.689 --> 01:09:11.699 align:start position:0%
individual who may decide opposite for
 
01:09:11.699 --> 01:09:12.890 align:start position:0%
individual who may decide opposite for
instance

01:09:12.890 --> 01:09:12.900 align:start position:0%
instance
 
01:09:18.650 --> 01:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
so I would say that cacr2 specifies that
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
anyone in New Hampshire's reproductive
 
01:09:25.329 --> 01:09:25.339 align:start position:0%
choices whether they are the person
 
01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
whether they are
 
01:09:29.809 --> 01:09:29.819 align:start position:0%
whatever side of the equation and be
 
01:09:32.209 --> 01:09:32.219 align:start position:0%
delicate here of
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
um of a reproductive Act
 
01:09:40.729 --> 01:09:40.739 align:start position:0%
should have the medical autonomy to make
 
01:09:43.970 --> 01:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
their own choices I would no sooner come
 
01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
before you and put legislation in front
 
01:09:50.689 --> 01:09:50.699 align:start position:0%
of this body that would limit your
 
01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
reproductive choices and where you can
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
control your reproductive health
 
01:10:00.050 --> 01:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
and I would I would that's we are
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
requesting that Equanimity for women too
 
01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:07.860 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you other questions for
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%

and gentlemen uh next is uh Danielle
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
Pimentel and given what I see as the
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
time and the number of additional
 
01:10:23.209 --> 01:10:23.219 align:start position:0%
Witnesses I am going to ask please
 
01:10:25.729 --> 01:10:25.739 align:start position:0%
follow the Miss Pimentel and the
 
01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:27.900 align:start position:0%
witnesses that follow the please limit
 
01:10:30.649 --> 01:10:30.659 align:start position:0%
your remarks to three minutes thank you
 
01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:36.169 --> 01:10:36.179 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and members of
 
01:10:37.490 --> 01:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Danielle
 
01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
pimento and I serve as policy council at
 
01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
Americans United for life which is a
 
01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
national law and policy nonprofit
 
01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:46.020 align:start position:0%
organization with a specialization in
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
abortion end of life issues and
 
01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
bioethics law
 
01:10:53.209 --> 01:10:53.219 align:start position:0%
today I strongly urge the committee to
 
01:10:55.430 --> 01:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
oppose this resolution because it
 
01:10:58.430 --> 01:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
prohibits Common Sense protections for
 
01:11:00.530 --> 01:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
women's health and safety from being
 
01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:02.100 align:start position:0%
enacted in the future as well as
 
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
infringes upon Health Care Providers
 
01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
conscience rights
 
01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
currently New Hampshire has very few
 
01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:10.140 align:start position:0%
protections for pregnant women and The
 
01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
Unborn however if this resolution is
 
01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
passed it will make it even more
 
01:11:16.610 --> 01:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
difficult to enact future protections
 
01:11:18.830 --> 01:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
for the health and safety of women which
 
01:11:20.930 --> 01:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
includes informed consent
 
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
um laws as well or as well as parental
 
01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
involvement laws and this is because the
 
01:11:28.130 --> 01:11:28.140 align:start position:0%
resolution imposes a strict scrutiny
 
01:11:30.290 --> 01:11:30.300 align:start position:0%
standard whereby the state must have a
 
01:11:32.209 --> 01:11:32.219 align:start position:0%
compelling interest
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
um in order to regulate abortion which
 
01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
can be achieved by the least restrictive
 
01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:38.580 align:start position:0%
means currently New Hampshire does not
 
01:11:41.330 --> 01:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
have any informed consent process for
 
01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
women undergoing abortions such as
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
medical disclosures of the risks of
 
01:11:48.530 --> 01:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
abortion the type of procedure or a
 
01:11:50.090 --> 01:11:50.100 align:start position:0%
reflection period which would ensure the
 
01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
woman has the time necessary to consider
 
01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:53.820 align:start position:0%
these risks and information before
 
01:11:56.930 --> 01:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
making a decision on whether to continue
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
her pregnancy these safeguards are
 
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
critical because women cannot agree to
 
01:12:04.490 --> 01:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
medical treatment unless they are
 
01:12:07.130 --> 01:12:07.140 align:start position:0%
competent and have the the adequate
 
01:12:10.370 --> 01:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
information to make that decision
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
informed consent safeguards are also
 
01:12:16.010 --> 01:12:16.020 align:start position:0%
important because many women or protect
 
01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
men and women against coerced abortions
 
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
many women are subject to intimate
 
01:12:22.729 --> 01:12:22.739 align:start position:0%
partner violence as well as reproductive
 
01:12:25.870 --> 01:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
control as many as one quarter of women
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
seeking abortions have some kind of
 
01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
experience with reproductive control and
 
01:12:33.169 --> 01:12:33.179 align:start position:0%
informed consent safeguards women by
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
providing them with material information
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
to let them know that they are not alone
 
01:12:39.169 --> 01:12:39.179 align:start position:0%
in their decision and that they have
 
01:12:41.050 --> 01:12:41.060 align:start position:0%
other Alternatives that they have other
 
01:12:44.450 --> 01:12:44.460 align:start position:0%
resources available to them however the
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
resolution today would prevent States
 
01:12:50.209 --> 01:12:50.219 align:start position:0%
likely from from passing these kind of
 
01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
safeguards to protect women
 
01:12:54.950 --> 01:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
Additionally the resolution contains
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
broad protections for for abortion which
 
01:12:58.850 --> 01:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
raises serious conscience rights
 
01:13:01.010 --> 01:13:01.020 align:start position:0%
concerns New Hampshire does not protect
 
01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:02.460 align:start position:0%
the conscious rights of Health Care
 
01:13:05.450 --> 01:13:05.460 align:start position:0%
providers in the abortion context and
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
although the state's Constitution
 
01:13:08.649 --> 01:13:08.659 align:start position:0%
includes a purported right of conscience
 
01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
it is an adequate protection for health
 
01:13:13.850 --> 01:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
care providers because the Constitution
 
01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
does not include within the language any
 
01:13:19.850 --> 01:13:19.860 align:start position:0%
mention of abortion or health care or
 
01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
anything that would ensure that Health
 
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
Care Providers
 
01:13:25.850 --> 01:13:25.860 align:start position:0%
conscience rights are protected if they
 
01:13:28.130 --> 01:13:28.140 align:start position:0%
have moral or ethical obligations to
 
01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:30.350 align:start position:0%
have moral or ethical obligations to
abortions

01:13:30.350 --> 01:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
abortions
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
um thus this resolution would could
 
01:13:35.090 --> 01:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
leave Healthcare Providers
 
01:13:37.610 --> 01:13:37.620 align:start position:0%
um with either the choice of
 
01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:38.570 align:start position:0%
um with either the choice of
um

01:13:38.570 --> 01:13:38.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:42.290 --> 01:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
losing their or not providing care or
 
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
I'm having to violate their own
 
01:13:46.610 --> 01:13:46.620 align:start position:0%
conscience in performing an abortion
 
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
um so for these reasons I strongly
 
01:13:49.610 --> 01:13:49.620 align:start position:0%
encourage the committee to oppose this
 
01:13:51.229 --> 01:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
resolution in order to protect the
 
01:13:53.330 --> 01:13:53.340 align:start position:0%
health and safety of women as well as
 
01:13:55.070 --> 01:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
protect the conscience rights of Health
 
01:13:57.050 --> 01:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
Care providers in New Hampshire
 
01:13:59.630 --> 01:13:59.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and I any questions thank you
 
01:14:02.930 --> 01:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:02.940 --> 01:14:04.189 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
representative report
 
01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:06.770 align:start position:0%
representative report
um

01:14:06.770 --> 01:14:06.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:09.130 --> 01:14:09.140 align:start position:0%
you're speaking about a
 
01:14:11.870 --> 01:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
coerced abortions does it go the other
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
around other way around sometimes were a
 
01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:17.000 align:start position:0%
woman becomes pregnant but her partner
 
01:14:19.490 --> 01:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
coerces her to stay pregnant even though
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
she doesn't feel that continuity
 
01:14:24.770 --> 01:14:24.780 align:start position:0%
abortion is a good thing to do either
 
01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
for health reasons because
 
01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
not all like uh not all embryos are to
 
01:14:31.790 --> 01:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
conceived developed smoothly into babies
 
01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:34.980 align:start position:0%
or just because of uh her relationship
 
01:14:36.649 --> 01:14:36.659 align:start position:0%
with a partner or where things fit into
 
01:14:38.990 --> 01:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
her life so is it
 
01:14:41.870 --> 01:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
um which is the so is isn't that also a
 
01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:43.580 align:start position:0%
problem though of course uh you know
 
01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
coerced to coerced pregnancy as well as
 
01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
Courage the abortion yes they're good
 
01:14:50.090 --> 01:14:50.100 align:start position:0%
last part
 
01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's part of troll there definitely
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
could be individuals that
 
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
um have exercised some kind of control
 
01:14:57.890 --> 01:14:57.900 align:start position:0%
over a woman to continue her pregnancy
 
01:14:59.450 --> 01:14:59.460 align:start position:0%
that is true
 
01:15:02.990 --> 01:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:04.610 --> 01:15:04.620 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much I'm
 
01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
going to next call on representative uh
 
01:15:10.189 --> 01:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
uh Catherine O'Brien
 
01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
and the next witness after that will be
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:19.729 --> 01:15:19.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:21.590 --> 01:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you the very emotional epic and it
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
is an emotional topic for me as well
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
this bill uh this cacr really is about
 
01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
allowing abortion for any reason at any
 
01:15:35.149 --> 01:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
time in the pregnancy it's not the same
 
01:15:39.290 --> 01:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
as a discussion about a woman who has a
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
a child that has a condition
 
01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:42.970 align:start position:0%
a child that has a condition
inconvenience

01:15:42.970 --> 01:15:42.980 align:start position:0%
inconvenience
 
01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
incompatible with life
 
01:15:46.490 --> 01:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
okay that's a different that's a
 
01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
different argument it's a different
 
01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:49.370 align:start position:0%
different argument it's a different
story

01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
story
 
01:15:51.530 --> 01:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
now when I ran for state representative
 
01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
the first thing I told people when they
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
asked me about myself was that I was
 
01:15:58.189 --> 01:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
pro-life okay and I got elected so I
 
01:16:00.169 --> 01:16:00.179 align:start position:0%
feel a duty to be here and say some
 
01:16:00.179 --> 01:16:02.090 align:start position:0%
feel a duty to be here and say some
things

01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:16:05.209 --> 01:16:05.219 align:start position:0%
my journey to being pro-life is probably
 
01:16:08.209 --> 01:16:08.219 align:start position:0%
unusual and not what you would expect
 
01:16:10.610 --> 01:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
so to talk about it means I have to talk
 
01:16:13.250 --> 01:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
about my life and it's kind of hard but
 
01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
here I go
 
01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:16.070 align:start position:0%
here I go
um

01:16:16.070 --> 01:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:18.590 --> 01:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
I grew up in the 70s and the 80s when
 
01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
there was a lot a large feminist
 
01:16:22.729 --> 01:16:22.739 align:start position:0%
movement where we were told we could do
 
01:16:24.649 --> 01:16:24.659 align:start position:0%
anything and be anything
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
and I took that to heart okay I I really
 
01:16:30.290 --> 01:16:30.300 align:start position:0%
appreciated that kind of equality it
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
meant a lot to me it meant so much to me
 
01:16:34.130 --> 01:16:34.140 align:start position:0%
and I was a huge fan of Susan B Anthony
 
01:16:36.890 --> 01:16:36.900 align:start position:0%
and I read her life story
 
01:16:39.709 --> 01:16:39.719 align:start position:0%
and I took it to heart because
 
01:16:42.350 --> 01:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
she believed in the equality of women
 
01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
and their their ability to uh do what
 
01:16:46.850 --> 01:16:46.860 align:start position:0%
they needed to to support themselves the
 
01:16:48.890 --> 01:16:48.900 align:start position:0%
reason that she was so in favor of women
 
01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
supporting themselves and taking care of
 
01:16:52.970 --> 01:16:52.980 align:start position:0%
themselves was because she saw that it
 
01:16:54.649 --> 01:16:54.659 align:start position:0%
was a way that women
 
01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
could take care of their families and
 
01:16:58.850 --> 01:16:58.860 align:start position:0%
not have to endure the terrible
 
01:17:02.149 --> 01:17:02.159 align:start position:0%
situation of abortion she did speak on
 
01:17:02.159 --> 01:17:03.350 align:start position:0%
situation of abortion she did speak on
abortion

01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
a lot of people don't know that
 
01:17:08.689 --> 01:17:08.699 align:start position:0%
I think she would be proud
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
of what I I did with that and um with
 
01:17:13.970 --> 01:17:13.980 align:start position:0%
her teachings I was the first female at
 
01:17:15.709 --> 01:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
my Vocational High School to graduate
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
from the Machining program and I did
 
01:17:18.410 --> 01:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
support myself
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
in that field for many years
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
I had an unplanned pregnancy at that
 
01:17:25.610 --> 01:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
time and it was it made it all the
 
01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:32.930 align:start position:0%
time and it was it made it all the
difference

01:17:32.930 --> 01:17:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
my own childhood was difficult I've
 
01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
talked about a little bit here in the
 
01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:38.570 align:start position:0%
talked about a little bit here in the
past

01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
past
 
01:17:41.810 --> 01:17:41.820 align:start position:0%
I was born into a kind of poverty that I
 
01:17:43.010 --> 01:17:43.020 align:start position:0%
think a lot of people don't realize
 
01:17:44.689 --> 01:17:44.699 align:start position:0%
happens in the United States I did not
 
01:17:46.189 --> 01:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
have a bed until I was about seven years
 
01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
old I was hungry a lot we were on uh we
 
01:17:52.669 --> 01:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
were in subsidized housing we were on
 
01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
government Aid
 
01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
you would think that maybe that was my
 
01:17:59.330 --> 01:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
family story for Generations but it
 
01:18:00.649 --> 01:18:00.659 align:start position:0%
absolutely wasn't
 
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
my um
 
01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
my grandfather who passed away soon
 
01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
after I was born was a uh around a
 
01:18:09.610 --> 01:18:09.620 align:start position:0%
renowned physician and medical
 
01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:12.300 align:start position:0%
researcher and he was the chief
 
01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
pathologist at usamrid when he passed
 
01:18:16.250 --> 01:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
away you see hammered his United States
 
01:18:18.649 --> 01:18:18.659 align:start position:0%
Army Medical Institute
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
researched something
 
01:18:24.410 --> 01:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry
 
01:18:24.420 --> 01:18:26.630 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry
I

01:18:26.630 --> 01:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
I asked my mother why she did not have
 
01:18:31.310 --> 01:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
an abortion when she was pregnant with
 
01:18:32.450 --> 01:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
me because
 
01:18:36.229 --> 01:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
how much poverty happened after the
 
01:18:39.050 --> 01:18:39.060 align:start position:0%
divorce and the and all of that
 
01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
and she told me about something that
 
01:18:42.830 --> 01:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
happened when she was
 
01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
um a child representative you I I we are
 
01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
I will be quick you're all over three
 
01:18:50.570 --> 01:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
minutes now I will be very quick all
 
01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:52.260 align:start position:0%
right she told me about something very
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
interesting that happened when she was a
 
01:18:55.729 --> 01:18:55.739 align:start position:0%
child she was on the campus of the
 
01:18:57.169 --> 01:18:57.179 align:start position:0%
University of Vermont where her father
 
01:18:59.870 --> 01:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
was a medical professor and she waited
 
01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
for him to at his office
 
01:19:05.090 --> 01:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
and when she was in the office wandering
 
01:19:06.729 --> 01:19:06.739 align:start position:0%
around she found
 
01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
fetuses in Jaws in all stages of
 
01:19:10.260 --> 01:19:11.450 align:start position:0%
fetuses in Jaws in all stages of
development

01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
development
 
01:19:13.610 --> 01:19:13.620 align:start position:0%
and she told me that is why she did not
 
01:19:14.810 --> 01:19:14.820 align:start position:0%
have an abortion when she was pregnant
 
01:19:16.850 --> 01:19:16.860 align:start position:0%
with me despite the fact that it plunged
 
01:19:19.610 --> 01:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
her into years and years of poverty okay
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
she said she knew those were people when
 
01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
she saw them and her father came out of
 
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
his office and told her those are
 
01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
fetuses fetus means baby
 
01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:36.300 align:start position:0%
and those are babies and she said yes I
 
01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
know those are babies obviously they're
 
01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
all babies they were all in very
 
01:19:42.470 --> 01:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
different stages of development I feel
 
01:19:44.450 --> 01:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
like I owe my life to those
 
01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
those medical teaching AIDS
 
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
because my mother really struggled and
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
worked very hard to have children
 
01:19:56.030 --> 01:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:19:58.189 --> 01:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
I'm pro-life because of that I feel like
 
01:20:00.649 --> 01:20:00.659 align:start position:0%
I was a person before I was born just as
 
01:20:03.530 --> 01:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
much as I am a person today worthy of
 
01:20:06.410 --> 01:20:06.420 align:start position:0%
protections and so that I want to share
 
01:20:08.330 --> 01:20:08.340 align:start position:0%

Hampshire uh I'm also a North Country
 
01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
resident for the last 21 years uh I
 
01:20:34.370 --> 01:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
don't want to address you to you as a
 
01:20:35.990 --> 01:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
political director or anything like that
 
01:20:38.330 --> 01:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
but I'm here to talk to you us uh the
 
01:20:41.090 --> 01:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
son of a brave mom as the husband of an
 
01:20:42.770 --> 01:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
amazing woman dedicated to her family
 
01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
and the community in the fight of two
 
01:20:47.570 --> 01:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
amazing beautiful daughters
 
01:20:49.250 --> 01:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
I need to fight day and night for the
 
01:20:51.290 --> 01:20:51.300 align:start position:0%
rights to make their own decisions I'm
 
01:20:54.530 --> 01:20:54.540 align:start position:0%
also a father of four children
 
01:20:57.290 --> 01:20:57.300 align:start position:0%
I was able to after my last baby was up
 
01:20:59.870 --> 01:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
in this world to go to the hospital make
 
01:21:01.370 --> 01:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
an appointment
 
01:21:03.649 --> 01:21:03.659 align:start position:0%
literally in a matter of a week I was
 
01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
able to just replace the vasectomy I was
 
01:21:09.649 --> 01:21:09.659 align:start position:0%
in and out I made my own choice
 
01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:11.460 align:start position:0%
I walked out of the hospital I realized
 
01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
that my wife don't have that right
 
01:21:16.130 --> 01:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
I realized that my daughters won't have
 
01:21:18.530 --> 01:21:18.540 align:start position:0%
that right I realized my mom don't have
 
01:21:20.209 --> 01:21:20.219 align:start position:0%
the right my neighbors my siblings my
 
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
sister don't have the right
 
01:21:24.110 --> 01:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
you feel good to be able to do that but
 
01:21:25.790 --> 01:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
I also felt really worried about their
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
rights uh they were not able to do that
 
01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:28.860 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:21:31.490 --> 01:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
I came 21 years ago from my country
 
01:21:33.649 --> 01:21:33.659 align:start position:0%
where women die and improvised abortion
 
01:21:33.659 --> 01:21:34.790 align:start position:0%
where women die and improvised abortion
centers

01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
centers
 
01:21:37.970 --> 01:21:37.980 align:start position:0%
because abortion was banned
 
01:21:39.649 --> 01:21:39.659 align:start position:0%
I came from a third world country where
 
01:21:44.090 --> 01:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
well were forced to have the uterus
 
01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
removed for money in order to keep
 
01:21:50.270 --> 01:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
poverty low
 
01:21:52.850 --> 01:21:52.860 align:start position:0%
many die in the process many were
 
01:21:52.860 --> 01:21:54.890 align:start position:0%
many die in the process many were
forgotten

01:21:54.890 --> 01:21:54.900 align:start position:0%
forgotten
 
01:21:57.709 --> 01:21:57.719 align:start position:0%
restricting access to reproductive care
 
01:21:59.810 --> 01:21:59.820 align:start position:0%
abortion included is a threat to our
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
communities especially black and black
 
01:22:03.950 --> 01:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
communities in this country
 
01:22:05.689 --> 01:22:05.699 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire needs to move forward when
 
01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
discussing Reproductive Rights and not
 
01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:08.870 align:start position:0%
discussing Reproductive Rights and not
backwards

01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
backwards
 
01:22:11.090 --> 01:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
now for the last seven years I have come
 
01:22:13.910 --> 01:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
to this this state house to testify
 
01:22:15.350 --> 01:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
about many issues from affordable
 
01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:16.669 align:start position:0%
about many issues from affordable
housing

01:22:16.669 --> 01:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:22:19.250 --> 01:22:19.260 align:start position:0%
women's when my my son was three weeks
 
01:22:20.630 --> 01:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
old I came to this same building
 
01:22:22.910 --> 01:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
downstairs to the senate committee to
 
01:22:26.810 --> 01:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:28.790 --> 01:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
for the last seven years I have came to
 
01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
testify about minimum wage
 
01:22:33.470 --> 01:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
I came to testify against guns in
 
01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:34.550 align:start position:0%
I came to testify against guns in
schools

01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:22:39.229 --> 01:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
and many other issues like utility bills
 
01:22:41.209 --> 01:22:41.219 align:start position:0%
and right now right after this I have to
 
01:22:44.570 --> 01:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
go to lob 101 to testify with my son my
 
01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
wife and my daughter about child care
 
01:22:48.050 --> 01:22:48.060 align:start position:0%
affordability because it's something
 
01:22:49.550 --> 01:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
that is hurting us
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
so my question to you all is when are we
 
01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
going to allow young families in New
 
01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:59.630 --> 01:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
enough is enough
 
01:23:01.729 --> 01:23:01.739 align:start position:0%
our state legislators regardless of
 
01:23:03.649 --> 01:23:03.659 align:start position:0%
party affiliation must support
 
01:23:06.729 --> 01:23:06.739 align:start position:0%
affordable access to abortion
 
01:23:09.530 --> 01:23:09.540 align:start position:0%
unbodily autonomy should be left
 
01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
to the discretion of the individuals
 
01:23:13.790 --> 01:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
we should let the residents of New
 
01:23:15.530 --> 01:23:15.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire make their voices heard about
 
01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
my mother my wife my two daughters
 
01:23:22.010 --> 01:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
amazing and thousands of amazing women
 
01:23:23.510 --> 01:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
are waiting for action
 
01:23:27.169 --> 01:23:27.179 align:start position:0%
let's be on the right side we owe that
 
01:23:30.530 --> 01:23:30.540 align:start position:0%
to them so I'm here to support cacr2 and
 
01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
I hope you do that too thank you so much
 
01:23:37.209 --> 01:23:37.219 align:start position:0%

Liz Canada I'm the advocacy manager at
 
01:24:01.010 --> 01:24:01.020 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood of Northern New
 
01:24:02.510 --> 01:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
England and Planned Parenthood New
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire action fund and we're here to
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
support cacr2
 
01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:08.820 align:start position:0%
after the U.S Supreme Court completely
 
01:24:12.290 --> 01:24:12.300 align:start position:0%
overturned Roe v Wade last June abortion
 
01:24:14.570 --> 01:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
was on the ballot very explicitly in
 
01:24:17.930 --> 01:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
four states Vermont Kansas Kentucky and
 
01:24:17.940 --> 01:24:19.010 align:start position:0%
four states Vermont Kansas Kentucky and
Michigan

01:24:19.010 --> 01:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
Michigan
 
01:24:21.169 --> 01:24:21.179 align:start position:0%
two of those measures were to further
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
restrict abortion and two of those
 
01:24:25.610 --> 01:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
measures were to enshrine protections
 
01:24:28.130 --> 01:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
into their State's Constitution
 
01:24:29.630 --> 01:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
those states have very different
 
01:24:31.669 --> 01:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
processes in order to amend their
 
01:24:33.890 --> 01:24:33.900 align:start position:0%
constitutions than we do and they allow
 
01:24:36.410 --> 01:24:36.420 align:start position:0%
ballot measures based on signatures but
 
01:24:38.689 --> 01:24:38.699 align:start position:0%
the overarching question was still the
 
01:24:38.699 --> 01:24:39.590 align:start position:0%
the overarching question was still the
same

01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:24:41.810 --> 01:24:41.820 align:start position:0%
and in all four states which are
 
01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
arguably very different from one another
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
voters overwhelmingly supported
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
Reproductive Rights soundly defeating
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
anti-abortion measures and approving
 
01:24:53.630 --> 01:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
reproductive freedom
 
01:24:56.330 --> 01:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
Reproductive Rights abortion birth
 
01:24:58.970 --> 01:24:58.980 align:start position:0%
control are all bipartisan supported
 
01:25:01.970 --> 01:25:01.980 align:start position:0%
issues they are not red or blue issues
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire
 
01:25:06.110 --> 01:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
we've enjoyed for so long a bipartisan
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
support of Reproductive Rights here in
 
01:25:09.669 --> 01:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
the State House
 
01:25:13.010 --> 01:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
cacr2 would send the question to the
 
01:25:15.649 --> 01:25:15.659 align:start position:0%
voters it would allow for the voters of
 
01:25:18.169 --> 01:25:18.179 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to decide on whether the
 
01:25:20.090 --> 01:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution should be
 
01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
amended to explicitly include
 
01:25:23.810 --> 01:25:23.820 align:start position:0%
reproductive freedom
 
01:25:27.050 --> 01:25:27.060 align:start position:0%
it is a very high bar to amend the state
 
01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
constitution here in New Hampshire
 
01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
but we know that the vast majority of
 
01:25:32.090 --> 01:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
granite Staters support Reproductive
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
Rights and they do not want government
 
01:25:36.110 --> 01:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
interference in their reproductive
 
01:25:38.510 --> 01:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
health care or in anyone's reproductive
 
01:25:39.770 --> 01:25:39.780 align:start position:0%
Health Care
 
01:25:42.350 --> 01:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
polls indicate that New Hampshire is one
 
01:25:44.750 --> 01:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
of the most supportive States regarding
 
01:25:47.149 --> 01:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
reproductive freedoms and limiting
 
01:25:49.689 --> 01:25:49.699 align:start position:0%
government interference on pregnancy
 
01:25:52.729 --> 01:25:52.739 align:start position:0%
ncacr too would let Granite Staters
 
01:25:55.790 --> 01:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
voters voices be heard just like we saw
 
01:25:58.189 --> 01:25:58.199 align:start position:0%
in multiple States this past year so we
 
01:26:00.050 --> 01:26:00.060 align:start position:0%
encourage you to vote ought to pass on
 
01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:02.760 align:start position:0%

01:26:06.110 --> 01:26:06.120 align:start position:0%

01:26:18.850 --> 01:26:18.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:21.410 --> 01:26:21.420 align:start position:0%
good morning Representatives my name is
 
01:26:24.110 --> 01:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
Josie Pinto I'm a constituent of Dover
 
01:26:26.510 --> 01:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm here in my capacity as the
 
01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:28.860 align:start position:0%
executive director of the reproductive
 
01:26:31.129 --> 01:26:31.139 align:start position:0%
Freedom fund of New Hampshire
 
01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:35.159 align:start position:0%
urging you all to support cacr2 my work
 
01:26:37.790 --> 01:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
is about breaking down barriers for
 
01:26:40.189 --> 01:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
patients who need abortions and I
 
01:26:42.050 --> 01:26:42.060 align:start position:0%
believe this legislation would be the
 
01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
strongest possible way we can ensure
 
01:26:46.129 --> 01:26:46.139 align:start position:0%
patients are able to access the
 
01:26:47.689 --> 01:26:47.699 align:start position:0%
reproductive Health Care they need
 
01:26:51.470 --> 01:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
without worry fear or confusion
 
01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
ever since the 24-week abortion ban went
 
01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
into effect in New Hampshire and Roe v
 
01:27:00.110 --> 01:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
Wade fell earlier this summer my
 
01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
organization has dealt with a lot of
 
01:27:03.709 --> 01:27:03.719 align:start position:0%
confusion from patients around where
 
01:27:06.110 --> 01:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
their rights stand it's understandably
 
01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
hard to keep up with the shifting
 
01:27:10.430 --> 01:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
National landscape but I'm confident
 
01:27:12.350 --> 01:27:12.360 align:start position:0%
this bill would help bring voters into
 
01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
the decision process to affirm once and
 
01:27:16.850 --> 01:27:16.860 align:start position:0%
for all that Granite seders support the
 
01:27:18.350 --> 01:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
right to abortion
 
01:27:21.229 --> 01:27:21.239 align:start position:0%
recent polling has already shown us this
 
01:27:23.629 --> 01:27:23.639 align:start position:0%
is true with about 70 percent of
 
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
citizens affirming their support for
 
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
abortion rights regardless of your
 
01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
personal opinion on abortion I urge you
 
01:27:33.709 --> 01:27:33.719 align:start position:0%
all to consider that this issue deserves
 
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
to be decided by the voters of this
 
01:27:37.970 --> 01:27:37.980 align:start position:0%
state the people who would truly be
 
01:27:39.890 --> 01:27:39.900 align:start position:0%
impacted by this
 
01:27:42.169 --> 01:27:42.179 align:start position:0%
when Roe was struck down the decision
 
01:27:44.810 --> 01:27:44.820 align:start position:0%
was handed to the states so let's allow
 
01:27:47.629 --> 01:27:47.639 align:start position:0%
the voters of the state to decide I want
 
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
to see New Hampshire declare our strong
 
01:27:52.129 --> 01:27:52.139 align:start position:0%
support for abortion not just in this
 
01:27:54.050 --> 01:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
current political moment but for the
 
01:27:56.030 --> 01:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
generations to come who deserve to be
 
01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
guaranteed the rights that most of us of
 
01:27:59.930 --> 01:27:59.940 align:start position:0%
reproductive age have had our whole
 
01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:01.490 align:start position:0%
reproductive age have had our whole
lives

01:28:01.490 --> 01:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
lives
 
01:28:03.410 --> 01:28:03.420 align:start position:0%
the right to abortion is a right that
 
01:28:05.709 --> 01:28:05.719 align:start position:0%
goes alongside our values of living free
 
01:28:08.629 --> 01:28:08.639 align:start position:0%
I believe that bodily autonomy is the
 
01:28:10.729 --> 01:28:10.739 align:start position:0%
ultimate form of freedom and that we
 
01:28:12.590 --> 01:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
should be guaranteed that right in the
 
01:28:14.450 --> 01:28:14.460 align:start position:0%
state that so highly values personal
 
01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:15.709 align:start position:0%
state that so highly values personal
autonomy

01:28:15.709 --> 01:28:15.719 align:start position:0%
autonomy
 
01:28:18.350 --> 01:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a long bipartisan
 
01:28:19.990 --> 01:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
history of supporting privacy
 
01:28:22.129 --> 01:28:22.139 align:start position:0%
particularly when it comes to personal
 
01:28:24.010 --> 01:28:24.020 align:start position:0%
medical decisions
 
01:28:26.990 --> 01:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
cacr2 will protect Granite seder's right
 
01:28:29.330 --> 01:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
to reproductive autonomy and prevent
 
01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
future attacks on our access to
 
01:28:34.189 --> 01:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
contraception sterilization and abortion
 
01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
care let's let the voters settle this
 
01:28:39.250 --> 01:28:39.260 align:start position:0%
matter once and for all please support
 
01:28:42.470 --> 01:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
cacr2 to bring our state one step closer
 
01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
to making reproductive Liberty a reality
 
01:28:47.450 --> 01:28:47.460 align:start position:0%
for us all thank you thank you questions
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
saying No thank you uh Megan McNeil and
 
01:28:57.290 --> 01:28:57.300 align:start position:0%
uh after Ms McNeil will be uh
 
01:28:59.870 --> 01:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
Courtney Reed
 
01:29:02.810 --> 01:29:02.820 align:start position:0%
Ms McNeil hi my name is Megan McNeil and
 
01:29:04.850 --> 01:29:04.860 align:start position:0%
I'm a resident of Dover New Hampshire
 
01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
um and I'm here to ask you to support
 
01:29:07.970 --> 01:29:07.980 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:29:10.129 --> 01:29:10.139 align:start position:0%
um as a Libertarian woman I believe that
 
01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
individuals should have the freedom to
 
01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:13.199 align:start position:0%
make their own choices about their
 
01:29:15.590 --> 01:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
bodies and their lives this includes the
 
01:29:18.890 --> 01:29:18.900 align:start position:0%
right to access safe and legal abortion
 
01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
the decision to have an abortion is
 
01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
deeply personal and should be left up to
 
01:29:24.770 --> 01:29:24.780 align:start position:0%
the individual
 
01:29:26.810 --> 01:29:26.820 align:start position:0%
no one knows the circumstances of a
 
01:29:29.090 --> 01:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
woman's life better than she does it's
 
01:29:30.770 --> 01:29:30.780 align:start position:0%
not up to the government or anyone else
 
01:29:32.570 --> 01:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
to dictate what a woman should do with
 
01:29:33.709 --> 01:29:33.719 align:start position:0%
her body
 
01:29:36.050 --> 01:29:36.060 align:start position:0%
in fact attempts to restrict access to
 
01:29:38.090 --> 01:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
abortion are a violation of individual
 
01:29:38.100 --> 01:29:40.129 align:start position:0%
abortion are a violation of individual
liberty

01:29:40.129 --> 01:29:40.139 align:start position:0%
liberty
 
01:29:42.050 --> 01:29:42.060 align:start position:0%
these restrictions not only limit a
 
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
woman's ability to make decisions about
 
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
her own body but all they also
 
01:29:47.810 --> 01:29:47.820 align:start position:0%
disproportionately affect low-income
 
01:29:50.030 --> 01:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
women and women of color who may not
 
01:29:51.890 --> 01:29:51.900 align:start position:0%
have the resources to access safe and
 
01:29:53.930 --> 01:29:53.940 align:start position:0%
legal abortions
 
01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
furthermore making abortion illegal does
 
01:29:58.430 --> 01:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
not stop women from seeking out this
 
01:30:00.830 --> 01:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
necessary medical procedure
 
01:30:02.990 --> 01:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
it only pushes them towards dangerous
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
and potentially deadly alternatives
 
01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
such as self-induced abortion or seeking
 
01:30:09.649 --> 01:30:09.659 align:start position:0%
out unlicensed providers
 
01:30:11.930 --> 01:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
as a Libertarian I also believe the
 
01:30:13.250 --> 01:30:13.260 align:start position:0%
importance of limited government
 
01:30:15.770 --> 01:30:15.780 align:start position:0%
intervention into people's lives
 
01:30:17.810 --> 01:30:17.820 align:start position:0%
laws that restrict access to abortion
 
01:30:19.310 --> 01:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
are a clear example of government
 
01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:20.689 align:start position:0%
are a clear example of government
overreach

01:30:20.689 --> 01:30:20.699 align:start position:0%
overreach
 
01:30:22.430 --> 01:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
the government should not be in the
 
01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
business of dictating medical decisions
 
01:30:26.209 --> 01:30:26.219 align:start position:0%
or moral values
 
01:30:28.250 --> 01:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
ultimately the decision to have an
 
01:30:29.810 --> 01:30:29.820 align:start position:0%
abortion should be left up to the
 
01:30:29.820 --> 01:30:30.830 align:start position:0%
abortion should be left up to the
individual

01:30:30.830 --> 01:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
it is a private matter that should be
 
01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
made in consultation with a health care
 
01:30:38.090 --> 01:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
provider not politicians or activists
 
01:30:39.649 --> 01:30:39.659 align:start position:0%
who seek to impose their beliefs on
 
01:30:39.659 --> 01:30:40.729 align:start position:0%
who seek to impose their beliefs on
others

01:30:40.729 --> 01:30:40.739 align:start position:0%
others
 
01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
in conclusion as a Libertarian woman I
 
01:30:46.250 --> 01:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
firmly believe in the importance of
 
01:30:48.050 --> 01:30:48.060 align:start position:0%
individual liberty and limited
 
01:30:49.729 --> 01:30:49.739 align:start position:0%
government intervention
 
01:30:51.950 --> 01:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
this includes the right to access safe
 
01:30:54.410 --> 01:30:54.420 align:start position:0%
and legal abortion
 
01:30:56.689 --> 01:30:56.699 align:start position:0%
attempts to restrict this right are a
 
01:30:59.090 --> 01:30:59.100 align:start position:0%
violation of individual freedom and have
 
01:31:00.530 --> 01:31:00.540 align:start position:0%
a negative consequence for Women's
 
01:31:03.110 --> 01:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
Health and well-being it's time to trust
 
01:31:04.850 --> 01:31:04.860 align:start position:0%
women to make their own decisions about
 
01:31:07.010 --> 01:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
their bodies and their lives thank you
 
01:31:11.830 --> 01:31:11.840 align:start position:0%

thank you can you hear me yes
 
01:31:32.689 --> 01:31:32.699 align:start position:0%
thank you uh chairman and members of the
 
01:31:34.189 --> 01:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Courtney Reed I'm
 
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
here with the ACLU of New Hampshire and
 
01:31:38.810 --> 01:31:38.820 align:start position:0%
I just want to provide another brief
 
01:31:42.590 --> 01:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
statement of support for this cacr uh as
 
01:31:43.850 --> 01:31:43.860 align:start position:0%
we've heard this amendment would
 
01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
enshrine Reproductive Rights in New
 
01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:48.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state constitution and allow
 
01:31:50.629 --> 01:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
voters the opportunity to ensure that
 
01:31:52.970 --> 01:31:52.980 align:start position:0%
abortion stays legal in the state and
 
01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
that patients continue to have access to
 
01:31:56.930 --> 01:31:56.940 align:start position:0%
necessary reproductive care
 
01:31:59.330 --> 01:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
uh with the current legal landscape that
 
01:32:00.770 --> 01:32:00.780 align:start position:0%
we're we're faced with this is one of
 
01:32:02.629 --> 01:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
the most effective tools we can use to
 
01:32:05.570 --> 01:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
ensure that these reproductive Liberties
 
01:32:08.270 --> 01:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
um remain in place for granite Staters
 
01:32:10.490 --> 01:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
and I just want to speak to why that
 
01:32:13.129 --> 01:32:13.139 align:start position:0%
this is effective in that uh the
 
01:32:15.649 --> 01:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
compelling State interest uh element of
 
01:32:17.810 --> 01:32:17.820 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional Amendment subjects
 
01:32:20.689 --> 01:32:20.699 align:start position:0%
the state to strict scrutiny uh whereby
 
01:32:22.850 --> 01:32:22.860 align:start position:0%
the legislature would need to establish
 
01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
that there is an extremely important
 
01:32:26.990 --> 01:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
reason to enact a law that would further
 
01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:29.400 align:start position:0%
restrict Reproductive Rights and that
 
01:32:31.129 --> 01:32:31.139 align:start position:0%
lawmakers would also need to prove that
 
01:32:33.350 --> 01:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
there are not any other possible ways to
 
01:32:35.209 --> 01:32:35.219 align:start position:0%
address the state interest without
 
01:32:37.729 --> 01:32:37.739 align:start position:0%
infringing on this right to reproductive
 
01:32:37.739 --> 01:32:38.990 align:start position:0%
infringing on this right to reproductive
freedom

01:32:38.990 --> 01:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
freedom
 
01:32:41.209 --> 01:32:41.219 align:start position:0%
we've already seen in response to Rose
 
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
overturn States take proactive measures
 
01:32:46.010 --> 01:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
to protect reproductive Liberties
 
01:32:48.530 --> 01:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
including California Michigan and our
 
01:32:50.330 --> 01:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
neighboring state of Vermont passing
 
01:32:51.770 --> 01:32:51.780 align:start position:0%
their own State constitutional
 
01:32:53.689 --> 01:32:53.699 align:start position:0%
amendments to ensure that these
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
reproductive freedoms are protected
 
01:32:59.209 --> 01:32:59.219 align:start position:0%
and I just want to wrap up by stating
 
01:33:02.209 --> 01:33:02.219 align:start position:0%
that abortion bans pose a life-altering
 
01:33:04.129 --> 01:33:04.139 align:start position:0%
consequences for pregnant individuals
 
01:33:06.350 --> 01:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
whether it be the health risk that they
 
01:33:08.750 --> 01:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
might be faced with needing to continue
 
01:33:11.810 --> 01:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
a pregnancy a more more difficulty
 
01:33:14.030 --> 01:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
escaping poverty perhaps not being able
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
to hold on to a job or continue their
 
01:33:20.450 --> 01:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
education and ultimately reproductive
 
01:33:23.330 --> 01:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
freedom is an essential freedom to
 
01:33:25.370 --> 01:33:25.380 align:start position:0%
fulfill the promise of equality and
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
self-determination so I recommend that
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
the committee move forward with this
 
01:33:32.209 --> 01:33:32.219 align:start position:0%
cacr and ensure that Granite Staters
 
01:33:34.669 --> 01:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to protect
 
01:33:36.890 --> 01:33:36.900 align:start position:0%
reproductive Liberty as a central
 
01:33:38.930 --> 01:33:38.940 align:start position:0%
freedom and a dignity as everyone
 
01:33:41.209 --> 01:33:41.219 align:start position:0%
deserves the power to decide for
 
01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
themselves if and when they want to have
 
01:33:46.129 --> 01:33:46.139 align:start position:0%
a child thank you questions for this
 
01:33:46.139 --> 01:33:48.890 align:start position:0%
a child thank you questions for this
Witness

01:33:48.890 --> 01:33:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
see none thank you uh Miss toffee and
 
01:33:57.950 --> 01:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:59.450 --> 01:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone my name is
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
Jocelyn tofik I live in Dover and I'm
 
01:34:06.169 --> 01:34:06.179 align:start position:0%
here currently to support uh cacr2
 
01:34:06.179 --> 01:34:07.550 align:start position:0%
here currently to support uh cacr2
um

01:34:07.550 --> 01:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:08.990 --> 01:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
none of what I'm about to tell you is
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
anyone's business and I do feel
 
01:34:12.530 --> 01:34:12.540 align:start position:0%
resentful feeling like I have to come
 
01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
down here today
 
01:34:17.810 --> 01:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
to tell this to a room of strangers
 
01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:18.770 align:start position:0%
to tell this to a room of strangers
um

01:34:18.770 --> 01:34:18.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
but that's how important I think this
 
01:34:22.430 --> 01:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
amendment is
 
01:34:26.270 --> 01:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
in 2004 when I was 26
 
01:34:28.729 --> 01:34:28.739 align:start position:0%
I had an abortion I had a two-year-old
 
01:34:30.890 --> 01:34:30.900 align:start position:0%
daughter and lived with her father in a
 
01:34:32.750 --> 01:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
home we owned in Dover
 
01:34:34.910 --> 01:34:34.920 align:start position:0%
I was in my second year of college and I
 
01:34:36.770 --> 01:34:36.780 align:start position:0%
had been on birth control and using it
 
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
fully as directed with no user errors
 
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
confirmed by my gynecologist
 
01:34:44.750 --> 01:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
we knew we did not want another child we
 
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
could not afford another child nor could
 
01:34:49.129 --> 01:34:49.139 align:start position:0%
I have finished my degree as the
 
01:34:50.689 --> 01:34:50.699 align:start position:0%
inherent risk to my health would have
 
01:34:52.430 --> 01:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
been too debilitating
 
01:34:55.010 --> 01:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
my first pregnancy was fine until it
 
01:34:57.110 --> 01:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't and around 34 weeks I went
 
01:34:58.790 --> 01:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
pre-eclamptic and I hemorrhaged
 
01:35:00.770 --> 01:35:00.780 align:start position:0%
immediately after giving birth
 
01:35:03.770 --> 01:35:03.780 align:start position:0%
a hundred years ago I would have died in
 
01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
2004 my odds were better but they were
 
01:35:08.810 --> 01:35:08.820 align:start position:0%
certainly not zero
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
especially here in America with the
 
01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:13.679 align:start position:0%
worst maternal mortality rate among all
 
01:35:15.770 --> 01:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
wealthy countries
 
01:35:17.810 --> 01:35:17.820 align:start position:0%
preeclampsia is still one of the leading
 
01:35:19.610 --> 01:35:19.620 align:start position:0%
causes of pregnancy death in the United
 
01:35:22.970 --> 01:35:22.980 align:start position:0%
States Bleeding Out accounts for 75
 
01:35:25.490 --> 01:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
percent of all pregnancy deaths in the
 
01:35:28.490 --> 01:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
United States not only that the rate of
 
01:35:31.550 --> 01:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
preeclampsia in the U.S has increased by
 
01:35:33.950 --> 01:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
25 percent in the last 20 in the last
 
01:35:36.189 --> 01:35:36.199 align:start position:0%
two decades
 
01:35:39.169 --> 01:35:39.179 align:start position:0%
maternal mortality rates overall for all
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
conditions are increasing year over year
 
01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
in the U.S
 
01:35:47.090 --> 01:35:47.100 align:start position:0%
there are so many good reasons to
 
01:35:48.830 --> 01:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
constitutionally protect a woman's right
 
01:35:50.990 --> 01:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
to decide what happens to her own body
 
01:35:54.169 --> 01:35:54.179 align:start position:0%
but the one I really want to focus on is
 
01:35:56.030 --> 01:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
that pregnancy entails is statistically
 
01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
measurable and significant risk of death
 
01:36:03.649 --> 01:36:03.659 align:start position:0%
who is this or any government to tell me
 
01:36:07.850 --> 01:36:07.860 align:start position:0%
I am required by law to risk my life in
 
01:36:09.490 --> 01:36:09.500 align:start position:0%
a forced pregnancy
 
01:36:12.050 --> 01:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
it's insane
 
01:36:14.330 --> 01:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
although the risk is very much real a
 
01:36:16.370 --> 01:36:16.380 align:start position:0%
history of preeclampsia and hemorrhaging
 
01:36:18.770 --> 01:36:18.780 align:start position:0%
after birth would not preclude me from
 
01:36:21.470 --> 01:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
having another child it would be a risk
 
01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
but by many state standards would not be
 
01:36:26.510 --> 01:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
considered imminent threat enough to
 
01:36:29.390 --> 01:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
allow for termination in more legally
 
01:36:31.970 --> 01:36:31.980 align:start position:0%
restrictive environments
 
01:36:34.850 --> 01:36:34.860 align:start position:0%
this is why constitutionally protecting
 
01:36:37.910 --> 01:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
my right to decide if I live or die
 
01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:39.470 align:start position:0%
my right to decide if I live or die
pregnant

01:36:39.470 --> 01:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
pregnant
 
01:36:41.570 --> 01:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
is important
 
01:36:44.810 --> 01:36:44.820 align:start position:0%
an average of 24 pregnant people in
 
01:36:47.570 --> 01:36:47.580 align:start position:0%
America will die for every 100 000 live
 
01:36:49.790 --> 01:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
births that's one pregnant woman dead
 
01:36:51.850 --> 01:36:51.860 align:start position:0%
for every
 
01:36:55.129 --> 01:36:55.139 align:start position:0%
4167 who get to live
 
01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
if you are black and Pregnant that
 
01:36:59.689 --> 01:36:59.699 align:start position:0%
statistic explodes to one pregnant woman
 
01:37:02.350 --> 01:37:02.360 align:start position:0%
dead out of only
 
01:37:05.990 --> 01:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
1818 pregnancy survivors
 
01:37:09.169 --> 01:37:09.179 align:start position:0%
if you are over 40 which I am that
 
01:37:12.610 --> 01:37:12.620 align:start position:0%
number is now one dead woman for every
 
01:37:16.729 --> 01:37:16.739 align:start position:0%
926 who get to survive that pregnancy
 
01:37:19.310 --> 01:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
those are good odds for a Powerball
 
01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:21.350 align:start position:0%
those are good odds for a Powerball
ticket

01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
ticket
 
01:37:23.209 --> 01:37:23.219 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
01:37:25.970 --> 01:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
who gets determined what is too risky
 
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
for me who gets to say what odds of
 
01:37:32.390 --> 01:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
death I am forced to accept me or my
 
01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:33.129 align:start position:0%
death I am forced to accept me or my
government

01:37:33.129 --> 01:37:33.139 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:37:36.649 --> 01:37:36.659 align:start position:0%
I very much prefer it be me
 
01:37:39.169 --> 01:37:39.179 align:start position:0%
these numbers from the CDC do not even
 
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
include the leading cause of death for
 
01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:43.679 align:start position:0%
pregnant people in America
 
01:37:45.890 --> 01:37:45.900 align:start position:0%
because the leading cause of death is
 
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
not considered a medical result of
 
01:37:50.990 --> 01:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
complications due to pregnancy Because
 
01:37:53.149 --> 01:37:53.159 align:start position:0%
the actual leading cause of death for
 
01:38:02.149 --> 01:38:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:06.890 --> 01:38:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
pregnancy can be and often is lethal and
 
01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
when it is lethal as in the case of
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
bleeding out there is usually no warning
 
01:38:18.110 --> 01:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
I had no indicators prior
 
01:38:21.169 --> 01:38:21.179 align:start position:0%
my pregnancy nearly killed me so who
 
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
gets to decide for me when I will risk
 
01:38:27.290 --> 01:38:27.300 align:start position:0%
my life and how and for what it should
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
be me who decides
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
when I choose to risk my life
 
01:38:34.129 --> 01:38:34.139 align:start position:0%
when the odds of surviving forced
 
01:38:36.830 --> 01:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
pregnancy or any pregnancy are this bad
 
01:38:39.110 --> 01:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
the government should not and should
 
01:38:41.030 --> 01:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
never have the power to force me to be
 
01:38:43.010 --> 01:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
pregnant against my will the
 
01:38:44.750 --> 01:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
government's duty at its very Foundation
 
01:38:47.629 --> 01:38:47.639 align:start position:0%
is to protect my very basic right to
 
01:38:50.030 --> 01:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
live please approve this amendment for
 
01:38:51.530 --> 01:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
public vote and let the people of New
 
01:38:53.209 --> 01:38:53.219 align:start position:0%
Hampshire decide when and how and for
 
01:38:55.370 --> 01:38:55.380 align:start position:0%
what they want to risk their life thank
 
01:38:59.750 --> 01:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:03.169 --> 01:39:03.179 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you uh Maggie O'Neill
 
01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
and next will be Nicole Lyman
 
01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:39:10.970 --> 01:39:10.980 align:start position:0%
my name is Maggie O'Neill and I'm a
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
proud resident of Newmarket New
 
01:39:15.770 --> 01:39:15.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm here today to voice my
 
01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
support for cacr2
 
01:39:24.350 --> 01:39:24.360 align:start position:0%
I attend church nearly every Sunday as I
 
01:39:27.410 --> 01:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
have done most Sundays through my life
 
01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
and as a Christian American I recognize
 
01:39:33.950 --> 01:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
the rightful separation of church and
 
01:39:37.010 --> 01:39:37.020 align:start position:0%
state as well as the pluralistic nature
 
01:39:39.290 --> 01:39:39.300 align:start position:0%
of our society
 
01:39:41.570 --> 01:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
our tradition of protecting religious
 
01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
liberty predates our independence as a
 
01:39:45.290 --> 01:39:45.300 align:start position:0%
nation actually
 
01:39:49.129 --> 01:39:49.139 align:start position:0%
my faith calls me to hold compassion and
 
01:39:51.709 --> 01:39:51.719 align:start position:0%
love for all people and to afford them
 
01:39:53.930 --> 01:39:53.940 align:start position:0%
the dignity to make decisions for
 
01:39:57.169 --> 01:39:57.179 align:start position:0%
themselves according to their own needs
 
01:40:00.830 --> 01:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
and circumstances and it's not just my
 
01:40:03.890 --> 01:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
personal belief either after the fall of
 
01:40:05.810 --> 01:40:05.820 align:start position:0%
Roe the Episcopal Church stated that
 
01:40:09.530 --> 01:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
they uphold the conscience rights of
 
01:40:12.590 --> 01:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
pregnant persons to determine whether
 
01:40:16.070 --> 01:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
they want to continue a pregnancy
 
01:40:20.810 --> 01:40:20.820 align:start position:0%
they have called since 1988 on state and
 
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
federal governments to take this as a
 
01:40:26.149 --> 01:40:26.159 align:start position:0%
quote take special care to see that
 
01:40:29.629 --> 01:40:29.639 align:start position:0%
individual conscience is respected and
 
01:40:32.090 --> 01:40:32.100 align:start position:0%
that the responsibility of individuals
 
01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
to reach informed decisions in this
 
01:40:38.209 --> 01:40:38.219 align:start position:0%
matter is acknowledged and honored
 
01:40:41.330 --> 01:40:41.340 align:start position:0%
I trust people to make their own
 
01:40:44.090 --> 01:40:44.100 align:start position:0%
decisions when it comes to the deeply
 
01:40:47.510 --> 01:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
personal and complex experience of
 
01:40:49.970 --> 01:40:49.980 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and reproduction
 
01:40:53.629 --> 01:40:53.639 align:start position:0%
I am grateful every single day that I
 
01:40:56.209 --> 01:40:56.219 align:start position:0%
was able to access abortion care when I
 
01:40:57.590 --> 01:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
needed it
 
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
abortion care is life-saving health care
 
01:41:05.450 --> 01:41:05.460 align:start position:0%
which all persons deserve access to
 
01:41:08.450 --> 01:41:08.460 align:start position:0%
these decisions should be left to
 
01:41:12.050 --> 01:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
individuals according to their needs I
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
urge you to support this constitutional
 
01:41:18.229 --> 01:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
amendment to protect this right Thank

cacr2
 
01:41:52.609 --> 01:41:52.619 align:start position:0%
my first child wasn't planned I was
 
01:41:55.550 --> 01:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
terrified I was only a year into my
 
01:41:58.129 --> 01:41:58.139 align:start position:0%
sobriety and although I was clean I was
 
01:42:00.050 --> 01:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
going through a period of my life where
 
01:42:01.609 --> 01:42:01.619 align:start position:0%
I was struggling with depression
 
01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
joblessness and having a steady home
 
01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
despite what you may think about
 
01:42:09.290 --> 01:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
pregnancies being obvious I was totally
 
01:42:11.450 --> 01:42:11.460 align:start position:0%
unaware I was pregnant until I was four
 
01:42:14.149 --> 01:42:14.159 align:start position:0%
months along the pregnancy was not easy
 
01:42:16.370 --> 01:42:16.380 align:start position:0%
the father of my child was extremely
 
01:42:18.830 --> 01:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
mentally abusive I needed to do
 
01:42:20.810 --> 01:42:20.820 align:start position:0%
everything I could to get away from him
 
01:42:23.870 --> 01:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
if ever the factors were aligned in my
 
01:42:26.330 --> 01:42:26.340 align:start position:0%
life to choose abortion for convenience
 
01:42:29.209 --> 01:42:29.219 align:start position:0%
this would have been the time I can't
 
01:42:31.310 --> 01:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
imagine not having that choice available
 
01:42:34.609 --> 01:42:34.619 align:start position:0%
to me having that sacred right to choose
 
01:42:37.370 --> 01:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
for my own body was immensely important
 
01:42:38.950 --> 01:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
to the decision-making process
 
01:42:41.330 --> 01:42:41.340 align:start position:0%
essentially changed me to be a better
 
01:42:41.340 --> 01:42:42.530 align:start position:0%
essentially changed me to be a better
person

01:42:42.530 --> 01:42:42.540 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:42:45.229 --> 01:42:45.239 align:start position:0%
I was able to confront my fears and
 
01:42:47.390 --> 01:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
after everything was considered I made
 
01:42:49.729 --> 01:42:49.739 align:start position:0%
the very difficult decision to have the
 
01:42:51.950 --> 01:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
child and raise her essentially on my
 
01:42:53.930 --> 01:42:53.940 align:start position:0%
own in the face of some pretty difficult
 
01:42:57.470 --> 01:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
odds just a few months after my daughter
 
01:43:00.770 --> 01:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
was born I was diagnosed with postpartum
 
01:43:03.290 --> 01:43:03.300 align:start position:0%
depression and at the same day also
 
01:43:06.709 --> 01:43:06.719 align:start position:0%
found out I was pregnant again amazingly
 
01:43:09.109 --> 01:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
I was a small percentage of people who
 
01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
had birth control fail
 
01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
my life was nearly in shambles I was
 
01:43:16.490 --> 01:43:16.500 align:start position:0%
getting out of abusive relationship the
 
01:43:18.709 --> 01:43:18.719 align:start position:0%
stress of being a new mother struggling
 
01:43:21.290 --> 01:43:21.300 align:start position:0%
with income and finding a place to live
 
01:43:23.689 --> 01:43:23.699 align:start position:0%
nearly cost me my sobriety and nearly
 
01:43:25.550 --> 01:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
cost me my life
 
01:43:27.709 --> 01:43:27.719 align:start position:0%
I chose to terminate the second
 
01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
unexpected pregnancy so I could save my
 
01:43:33.530 --> 01:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
health and move on with my life to be a
 
01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
good healthy mother
 
01:43:37.790 --> 01:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
there's no question I made a lot of
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
choices but the most important part of
 
01:43:41.870 --> 01:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
the process was that I had the freedom
 
01:43:44.209 --> 01:43:44.219 align:start position:0%
to do so
 
01:43:46.669 --> 01:43:46.679 align:start position:0%
one of the most heartbreaking moments
 
01:43:49.010 --> 01:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
thus far being a mother was receiving
 
01:43:51.830 --> 01:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
the news of the overturn of Roe v Wade
 
01:43:54.770 --> 01:43:54.780 align:start position:0%
from my 13 year old daughter
 
01:43:57.830 --> 01:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
one of the most she when she gave us the
 
01:44:00.290 --> 01:44:00.300 align:start position:0%
news in the car she had tears in her
 
01:44:02.629 --> 01:44:02.639 align:start position:0%
eyes she looked terrified
 
01:44:04.850 --> 01:44:04.860 align:start position:0%
I was not even aware she knew how
 
01:44:08.750 --> 01:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
serious this was until this moment
 
01:44:10.970 --> 01:44:10.980 align:start position:0%
something happens to a mother when she
 
01:44:13.910 --> 01:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
sees her child feels unsafe
 
01:44:16.850 --> 01:44:16.860 align:start position:0%
I made a promise that I would fight this
 
01:44:19.189 --> 01:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
so she could feel safe and have the same
 
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
freedoms her but to her body that I had
 
01:44:25.129 --> 01:44:25.139 align:start position:0%
it's crazy watching my daughter grow
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
into this independent human with
 
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
independent feelings making her own
 
01:44:31.189 --> 01:44:31.199 align:start position:0%
choices that she will grow through grow
 
01:44:31.199 --> 01:44:33.050 align:start position:0%
choices that she will grow through grow
from

01:44:33.050 --> 01:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:44:35.270 --> 01:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
she's going to make mistakes we all are
 
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
we are human we are flawed it's
 
01:44:39.470 --> 01:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
important for us to have the choices
 
01:44:41.810 --> 01:44:41.820 align:start position:0%
when it comes to body autonomy no matter
 
01:44:44.770 --> 01:44:44.780 align:start position:0%
what the reason please support Bill
 
01:44:48.050 --> 01:44:48.060 align:start position:0%
cacr2 we need not forget the history of
 
01:44:50.209 --> 01:44:50.219 align:start position:0%
what life in our culture was like
 
01:44:52.910 --> 01:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
pre-row I would really love to see my
 
01:44:55.250 --> 01:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
home state stand on the right side of
 
01:44:57.709 --> 01:44:57.719 align:start position:0%
history with this one thank you
 
01:45:01.370 --> 01:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:06.290 --> 01:45:06.300 align:start position:0%
see none thank you um Evan Ringo I hope
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
I've got that right and the next witness
 
01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
after that will be uh
 
01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:14.629 align:start position:0%
after that will be uh
Nico

01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:17.390 --> 01:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
Anna Anniston I believe I hope I'm
 
01:45:19.070 --> 01:45:19.080 align:start position:0%
pronouncing those correctly
 
01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
hi can you hear me
 
01:45:23.689 --> 01:45:23.699 align:start position:0%
cool uh hi I'm Evan Ringo I'm from
 
01:45:23.699 --> 01:45:24.830 align:start position:0%
cool uh hi I'm Evan Ringo I'm from
Pelham

01:45:24.830 --> 01:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
Pelham
 
01:45:27.470 --> 01:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
um I would like to start talking about
 
01:45:30.770 --> 01:45:30.780 align:start position:0%
uh some of the non-abortion uh aspects
 
01:45:32.270 --> 01:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
that this could protect
 
01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
um in 1952 uh Britain chemically
 
01:45:38.330 --> 01:45:38.340 align:start position:0%
castrated one of the greatest computer
 
01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
scientists of History Alan Turing
 
01:45:44.570 --> 01:45:44.580 align:start position:0%
um the power to chemically castrate uh
 
01:45:48.050 --> 01:45:48.060 align:start position:0%
by the state is currently uh uh in law
 
01:45:51.290 --> 01:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
in a number of states here and that this
 
01:45:53.450 --> 01:45:53.460 align:start position:0%
uh protection would help against that
 
01:45:57.229 --> 01:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
and considering how often uh States have
 
01:45:59.570 --> 01:45:59.580 align:start position:0%
wrong wrongfully convict people and put
 
01:46:01.250 --> 01:46:01.260 align:start position:0%
them on death row
 
01:46:03.410 --> 01:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
um only later for it to be overturned
 
01:46:06.590 --> 01:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
I'm very worried about that uh the state
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
having the power to chemically castrate
 
01:46:11.930 --> 01:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
uh or for sterilize for sterilize
 
01:46:16.250 --> 01:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
um someone it I also uh am aware of how
 
01:46:18.770 --> 01:46:18.780 align:start position:0%
easy it is for me as a man to go get a
 
01:46:18.780 --> 01:46:19.609 align:start position:0%
easy it is for me as a man to go get a
uh

01:46:19.609 --> 01:46:19.619 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:46:23.390 --> 01:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
a vasectomy and the number of barriers
 
01:46:25.609 --> 01:46:25.619 align:start position:0%
that are in place uh for a woman to try
 
01:46:27.169 --> 01:46:27.179 align:start position:0%
and get her tubes tied
 
01:46:30.169 --> 01:46:30.179 align:start position:0%
um and having this protection would make
 
01:46:32.450 --> 01:46:32.460 align:start position:0%
it a lot easier for for laws to come in
 
01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
place and for suits to be brought so
 
01:46:36.290 --> 01:46:36.300 align:start position:0%
that women would have the easy the same
 
01:46:38.990 --> 01:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
access uh that a man does to make these
 
01:46:41.870 --> 01:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
choices proactively to you know prevent
 
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
abortions from happening similarly uh
 
01:46:47.209 --> 01:46:47.219 align:start position:0%
there are a number of cases where uh
 
01:46:49.490 --> 01:46:49.500 align:start position:0%
people have tried to restrict uh birth
 
01:46:52.129 --> 01:46:52.139 align:start position:0%
control access which again makes it
 
01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
proactive uh uh so that abortions don't
 
01:46:56.570 --> 01:46:56.580 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:47:00.410 --> 01:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
uh come up um on the abortion issue uh I
 
01:47:03.709 --> 01:47:03.719 align:start position:0%
I as a Libertarian I believe that it
 
01:47:05.390 --> 01:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
your right to your body is the
 
01:47:06.530 --> 01:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
fundamental right
 
01:47:08.090 --> 01:47:08.100 align:start position:0%
um You don't really have any other
 
01:47:09.890 --> 01:47:09.900 align:start position:0%
rights if you don't control your body
 
01:47:12.229 --> 01:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of the basis of it all
 
01:47:14.990 --> 01:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
of your property rights go away if you
 
01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
can't control yourself you can't control
 
01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:17.450 align:start position:0%
can't control yourself you can't control
anything

01:47:17.450 --> 01:47:17.460 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:18.169 align:start position:0%
anything
um

01:47:18.169 --> 01:47:18.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:22.010 --> 01:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
so if the state is willing to take over
 
01:47:25.729 --> 01:47:25.739 align:start position:0%
uh your choices in uh in that then
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
really they're pretty much able to take
 
01:47:30.649 --> 01:47:30.659 align:start position:0%
over your choices with anything so I
 
01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
just uh would urge you to uh to let
 
01:47:36.410 --> 01:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
people make the choice on this to let
 
01:47:38.330 --> 01:47:38.340 align:start position:0%
our citizens vote
 
01:47:40.970 --> 01:47:40.980 align:start position:0%
um because you know that's kind of the
 
01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
whole point of having freedom is letting

people speak their mind and by not
 
01:47:47.689 --> 01:47:47.699 align:start position:0%
letting them vote you're basically
 
01:47:50.450 --> 01:47:50.460 align:start position:0%
saying hey we don't trust you to speak
 
01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
up and think for yourself so you know
 
01:47:54.830 --> 01:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
maybe don't do that
 
01:47:58.970 --> 01:47:58.980 align:start position:0%

uh hello my name is Nico Anastasia I'm
 
01:48:17.689 --> 01:48:17.699 align:start position:0%
from Portsmouth and I'm here today to
 
01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
speak in support of crcr2
 
01:48:21.649 --> 01:48:21.659 align:start position:0%
I rarely speak publicly and I'm here
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
simply in support of the women in my
 
01:48:25.550 --> 01:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
life I strongly believe that women
 
01:48:27.050 --> 01:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
should have the right to choose whether
 
01:48:28.910 --> 01:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
or not to have an abortion
 
01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
while I may not personally be able to
 
01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
experience the physical and emotional
 
01:48:36.050 --> 01:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
toll of pregnancy and childbirth I can
 
01:48:37.850 --> 01:48:37.860 align:start position:0%
certainly empathize with difficult
 
01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
decisions that women face when it comes
 
01:48:41.390 --> 01:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
to the reproductive health
 
01:48:43.070 --> 01:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
there are many reasons why a woman may
 
01:48:44.450 --> 01:48:44.460 align:start position:0%
choose not to have an abortion that we
 
01:48:45.950 --> 01:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
have heard today
 
01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
whatever that reason it is ultimately
 
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
the women's decision to make not mine or
 
01:48:52.370 --> 01:48:52.380 align:start position:0%
anyone else's
 
01:48:54.890 --> 01:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
critics of abortion often argue that it
 
01:48:56.990 --> 01:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
is immoral or goes against religious
 
01:48:59.629 --> 01:48:59.639 align:start position:0%
beliefs however I believe mortality is
 
01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
subjective and everyone has the right to
 
01:49:03.709 --> 01:49:03.719 align:start position:0%
their own religious beliefs as protected
 
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
in our constitution
 
01:49:08.090 --> 01:49:08.100 align:start position:0%
it is not fair or just of course someone
 
01:49:10.390 --> 01:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
to adhere to a specific moral code
 
01:49:13.129 --> 01:49:13.139 align:start position:0%
particularly when it comes to such a
 
01:49:14.510 --> 01:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
personal decision
 
01:49:17.209 --> 01:49:17.219 align:start position:0%
furthermore denying women access to safe
 
01:49:19.609 --> 01:49:19.619 align:start position:0%
and legal abortion Services could have
 
01:49:22.310 --> 01:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
devastating consequences it can lead to
 
01:49:24.010 --> 01:49:24.020 align:start position:0%
dangerous back alley procedures
 
01:49:26.810 --> 01:49:26.820 align:start position:0%
increased maternal morality rates and
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
perpetuate gender inequality
 
01:49:30.950 --> 01:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
it is unfair to force women to carry
 
01:49:33.590 --> 01:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
pregnancy to term against their will
 
01:49:35.570 --> 01:49:35.580 align:start position:0%
in conclusion I believe that it is
 
01:49:36.830 --> 01:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
important for men to support women's
 
01:49:38.330 --> 01:49:38.340 align:start position:0%
right to choose when it comes to the
 
01:49:39.590 --> 01:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
reproductive health
 
01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
we should not seek to control or dictate
 
01:49:44.090 --> 01:49:44.100 align:start position:0%
when a woman can or cannot do with our
 
01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
own body but rather trust and respect
 
01:49:48.050 --> 01:49:48.060 align:start position:0%
her ability to make the best decision
 
01:49:50.450 --> 01:49:50.460 align:start position:0%
for herself and her future
 
01:49:52.310 --> 01:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
access to safe and legal abortion
 
01:49:54.109 --> 01:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
Services is essential for Women's Health
 
01:49:56.930 --> 01:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
and autonomy and we must work to ensure
 
01:49:59.330 --> 01:49:59.340 align:start position:0%
that these Services remain available and
 
01:50:01.070 --> 01:50:01.080 align:start position:0%

01:50:37.430 --> 01:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
colleague of my husband's in high school
 
01:50:40.430 --> 01:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
jumped off the high school roof killing
 
01:50:43.609 --> 01:50:43.619 align:start position:0%
herself because she did not have an
 
01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
option of another way to end her
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
pregnancy so

have not had choice and who will not
 
01:50:55.490 --> 01:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
have choice if their right to abortion
 
01:50:58.010 --> 01:50:58.020 align:start position:0%
is taken from them and they will resort
 
01:51:00.890 --> 01:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
to some method or other and it could be
 
01:51:03.410 --> 01:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
back alley or self-inflicted abortion if
 
01:51:06.050 --> 01:51:06.060 align:start position:0%
there's not legal medical safe means
 
01:51:08.209 --> 01:51:08.219 align:start position:0%

01:51:25.970 --> 01:51:25.980 align:start position:0%
good morning chair and members of the
 
01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Erica Perez I'm
 
01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
from Manchester New Hampshire and today
 
01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
I'm seeking in support of cacr2 because
 
01:51:34.970 --> 01:51:34.980 align:start position:0%
I think Reproductive Rights should be
 
01:51:37.550 --> 01:51:37.560 align:start position:0%
codified into our state constitution
 
01:51:39.649 --> 01:51:39.659 align:start position:0%
I want the security of knowing that
 
01:51:41.450 --> 01:51:41.460 align:start position:0%
anyone from my state that chooses to
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
have an abortion can have one simply
 
01:51:45.109 --> 01:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
because they need one without the red
 
01:51:46.970 --> 01:51:46.980 align:start position:0%
tape of law following them around or
 
01:51:48.709 --> 01:51:48.719 align:start position:0%
trying to intervene
 
01:51:51.050 --> 01:51:51.060 align:start position:0%
the fact is that abortion is legal in
 
01:51:54.709 --> 01:51:54.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire before 24 weeks for now we
 
01:51:56.629 --> 01:51:56.639 align:start position:0%
have no guarantees we have nothing
 
01:51:58.129 --> 01:51:58.139 align:start position:0%
protecting us from the people who
 
01:51:59.990 --> 01:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
represent us one day deciding that we
 
01:52:01.609 --> 01:52:01.619 align:start position:0%
should have a six-week abortion ban
 
01:52:03.530 --> 01:52:03.540 align:start position:0%
which is an actual bill that's come up
 
01:52:05.930 --> 01:52:05.940 align:start position:0%
for the past two years at least I want
 
01:52:08.209 --> 01:52:08.219 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire to decide I
 
01:52:09.950 --> 01:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
think that's fair but a portion on the
 
01:52:11.450 --> 01:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
ballot and see what the people of New
 
01:52:13.669 --> 01:52:13.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire really want the thing is we
 
01:52:15.050 --> 01:52:15.060 align:start position:0%
aren't just talking about Reproductive
 
01:52:16.550 --> 01:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
Rights we're talking about people's
 
01:52:18.109 --> 01:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
futures we're talking about people
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
escaping abuse we're talking about
 
01:52:22.010 --> 01:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
teenagers who aren't ready to be parents
 
01:52:24.649 --> 01:52:24.659 align:start position:0%
we're talking about Freedom do we have
 
01:52:26.990 --> 01:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
it or not do you believe in autonomy or
 
01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:27.830 align:start position:0%
it or not do you believe in autonomy or
not

01:52:27.830 --> 01:52:27.840 align:start position:0%

I hope he submits a written testimony
 
01:52:58.129 --> 01:52:58.139 align:start position:0%
because I would sign my name to it
 
01:53:00.770 --> 01:53:00.780 align:start position:0%
he so succinctly said all the things
 
01:53:04.550 --> 01:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
that I would say I just have two things
 
01:53:08.030 --> 01:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
to add one is I thought Senator Deborah
 
01:53:11.689 --> 01:53:11.699 align:start position:0%
altshire had an excellent case for
 
01:53:14.930 --> 01:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
issues like Ivermectin and vaccine and
 
01:53:17.030 --> 01:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna look it up on the live stream
 
01:53:19.090 --> 01:53:19.100 align:start position:0%
and get that information
 
01:53:23.629 --> 01:53:23.639 align:start position:0%
but uh the last thing I want to put out
 
01:53:26.330 --> 01:53:26.340 align:start position:0%
there is a phrase that my husband came
 
01:53:28.729 --> 01:53:28.739 align:start position:0%
up with years ago why doesn't anybody
 
01:53:32.330 --> 01:53:32.340 align:start position:0%
say this pro-choice that's pro-choice
 
01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
before the ACT not the fact
 
01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
women have a choice but with freedom
 
01:53:42.290 --> 01:53:42.300 align:start position:0%
comes responsibility
 
01:53:44.750 --> 01:53:44.760 align:start position:0%

01:54:26.090 --> 01:54:26.100 align:start position:0%
holding space for folks as they recover
 
01:54:27.530 --> 01:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
um and you know every patient and their
 
01:54:29.930 --> 01:54:29.940 align:start position:0%
experience is different but it is always
 
01:54:31.970 --> 01:54:31.980 align:start position:0%
an honor to support people in this way
 
01:54:34.250 --> 01:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
and I'm really proud to play a small
 
01:54:36.169 --> 01:54:36.179 align:start position:0%
part in helping folks to access the care
 
01:54:38.510 --> 01:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
that they need I'm proud of my friends
 
01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
and my fellow volunteers who are here
 
01:54:42.229 --> 01:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
today and who are here every day in
 
01:54:44.030 --> 01:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
solidarity with each other
 
01:54:46.669 --> 01:54:46.679 align:start position:0%
I'm proud of Tenors like the Love Ring
 
01:54:48.050 --> 01:54:48.060 align:start position:0%
who and their commitment to Safe
 
01:54:50.570 --> 01:54:50.580 align:start position:0%
compassionate and inclusive care and I
 
01:54:52.490 --> 01:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
am the most proud of patients in New
 
01:54:54.350 --> 01:54:54.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who advocate for themselves
 
01:54:56.810 --> 01:54:56.820 align:start position:0%
and show tremendous bravery in the face
 
01:54:59.090 --> 01:54:59.100 align:start position:0%
of fear uncertainty and unnecessary
 
01:54:59.100 --> 01:55:00.470 align:start position:0%
of fear uncertainty and unnecessary
obstacles

01:55:00.470 --> 01:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
obstacles
 
01:55:02.330 --> 01:55:02.340 align:start position:0%
so I'm glad that we're here today to
 
01:55:03.830 --> 01:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
talk about how we can remove those
 
01:55:06.050 --> 01:55:06.060 align:start position:0%
obstacles I'm glad that my reps are
 
01:55:07.550 --> 01:55:07.560 align:start position:0%
listening to the vast majority of
 
01:55:08.990 --> 01:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
granite Staters who believe that
 
01:55:10.790 --> 01:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
abortion should be legal in all or most
 
01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:12.050 align:start position:0%
abortion should be legal in all or most
cases

01:55:12.050 --> 01:55:12.060 align:start position:0%
cases
 
01:55:13.729 --> 01:55:13.739 align:start position:0%
we are one of the most supportive states
 
01:55:15.050 --> 01:55:15.060 align:start position:0%
in the country when it comes to
 
01:55:17.149 --> 01:55:17.159 align:start position:0%
reproductive Freedom so I'm glad for the
 
01:55:19.189 --> 01:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to correct the fact that New
 
01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the only state in New
 
01:55:24.169 --> 01:55:24.179 align:start position:0%
England without protections for abortion
 
01:55:25.729 --> 01:55:25.739 align:start position:0%
because the bottom line is that
 
01:55:27.950 --> 01:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
reproductive freedom is a prerequisite
 
01:55:30.649 --> 01:55:30.659 align:start position:0%
to being a full free and equal citizen
 
01:55:33.530 --> 01:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
it is a foundational essential Liberty
 
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
without which none of the others can
 
01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:36.649 align:start position:0%
without which none of the others can
exist

01:55:36.649 --> 01:55:36.659 align:start position:0%
exist
 
01:55:39.169 --> 01:55:39.179 align:start position:0%
if the state can tell me if when and how
 
01:55:42.050 --> 01:55:42.060 align:start position:0%
I become a parent I am not free
 
01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
if the state can take that choice away
 
01:55:46.790 --> 01:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
from me I cannot participate equally in
 
01:55:49.250 --> 01:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
society and if my doctor needs to double
 
01:55:51.109 --> 01:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
check with a lawyer or a politician
 
01:55:54.410 --> 01:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
before providing care I am not safe
 
01:55:56.629 --> 01:55:56.639 align:start position:0%
until we protect Reproductive Rights not
 
01:55:58.370 --> 01:55:58.380 align:start position:0%
only are we not safe but we are out of
 
01:56:00.590 --> 01:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
step with our tradition of respecting
 
01:56:02.390 --> 01:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
folks privacy and personal decision
 
01:56:04.910 --> 01:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
making and we will continue to waste
 
01:56:07.010 --> 01:56:07.020 align:start position:0%
time and resources fighting regressive
 
01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
legislation rather than working towards
 
01:56:12.050 --> 01:56:12.060 align:start position:0%
a better healthier future
 
01:56:13.729 --> 01:56:13.739 align:start position:0%
the right to Safe accessible
 
01:56:16.370 --> 01:56:16.380 align:start position:0%
reproductive care is a fundamental human
 
01:56:18.350 --> 01:56:18.360 align:start position:0%
right and must be decided by the voters
 
01:56:20.090 --> 01:56:20.100 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time thank you
 
01:56:23.330 --> 01:56:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:28.250 --> 01:56:28.260 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh Mary Rose McLaughlin and
 
01:56:33.410 --> 01:56:33.420 align:start position:0%
next will be uh Omer Ahern
 
01:56:37.430 --> 01:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:38.870 --> 01:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
ate you need to get up close to the mic
 
01:56:41.390 --> 01:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you my name is Mary Rose
 
01:56:43.729 --> 01:56:43.739 align:start position:0%
McLaughlin I am a student and a law
 
01:56:46.250 --> 01:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
intern from Sullivan County
 
01:56:47.649 --> 01:56:47.659 align:start position:0%
as you know
 
01:56:50.450 --> 01:56:50.460 align:start position:0%
cacr2 proposes that an additional
 
01:56:52.729 --> 01:56:52.739 align:start position:0%
section on reproductive Freedom be added
 
01:56:56.530 --> 01:56:56.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:59.570 --> 01:56:59.580 align:start position:0%
cacr-2 states that an individual's right
 
01:57:02.510 --> 01:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
to personal reproductive autonomy is
 
01:57:04.729 --> 01:57:04.739 align:start position:0%
Central to the liberty and dignity to
 
01:57:07.250 --> 01:57:07.260 align:start position:0%
determine one's own life course and
 
01:57:10.129 --> 01:57:10.139 align:start position:0%
shall be not be denied or infringed on
 
01:57:12.649 --> 01:57:12.659 align:start position:0%
unless justified by a compelling State
 
01:57:14.510 --> 01:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
interest achieved by the least
 
01:57:16.850 --> 01:57:16.860 align:start position:0%
restrictive means
 
01:57:19.430 --> 01:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
saying that an individual should have a
 
01:57:21.530 --> 01:57:21.540 align:start position:0%
right to personal reproductive autonomy
 
01:57:23.870 --> 01:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
is completely good and true
 
01:57:26.629 --> 01:57:26.639 align:start position:0%
however this amendment should not be
 
01:57:27.890 --> 01:57:27.900 align:start position:0%
added to the New Hampshire state
 
01:57:30.770 --> 01:57:30.780 align:start position:0%
constitution because it implies that the
 
01:57:32.390 --> 01:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
current laws against infringing on
 
01:57:36.109 --> 01:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:38.570 --> 01:57:38.580 align:start position:0%
the amendment being proposed implies
 
01:57:40.490 --> 01:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
that abortion will perfectly ensure
 
01:57:43.310 --> 01:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
reproductive freedom and the ability to
 
01:57:45.649 --> 01:57:45.659 align:start position:0%
choose one's course of life
 
01:57:47.950 --> 01:57:47.960 align:start position:0%
this is false
 
01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
cacr2 will have the complete opposite
 
01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:51.729 align:start position:0%
cacr2 will have the complete opposite
effect

01:57:51.729 --> 01:57:51.739 align:start position:0%
effect
 
01:57:54.410 --> 01:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
reproductive Freedom defined as a
 
01:57:56.930 --> 01:57:56.940 align:start position:0%
person's freedom to choose when they
 
01:57:59.330 --> 01:57:59.340 align:start position:0%
wish to have a child and who they wish
 
01:58:02.030 --> 01:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
to have it with is already protected in
 
01:58:05.330 --> 01:58:05.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire RSA 632a
 
01:58:07.850 --> 01:58:07.860 align:start position:0%
abortion takes away another individual
 
01:58:09.890 --> 01:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
person's reproductive freedom and
 
01:58:12.589 --> 01:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
autonomy and most importantly another
 
01:58:12.599 --> 01:58:14.810 align:start position:0%
autonomy and most importantly another
life

01:58:14.810 --> 01:58:14.820 align:start position:0%
life
 
01:58:17.930 --> 01:58:17.940 align:start position:0%
abortion infringes on Liberty dignity
 
01:58:20.030 --> 01:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
autonomy and most especially the future
 
01:58:22.629 --> 01:58:22.639 align:start position:0%
course of life of the fetal human being
 
01:58:25.669 --> 01:58:25.679 align:start position:0%
therefore because this amendment implies
 
01:58:28.189 --> 01:58:28.199 align:start position:0%
the legality of abortion it should not
 
01:58:29.570 --> 01:58:29.580 align:start position:0%
be added to New Hampshire state
 
01:58:32.629 --> 01:58:32.639 align:start position:0%
constitution thank you thank you
 
01:58:36.709 --> 01:58:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:38.510 --> 01:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much man
 
01:58:40.010 --> 01:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:58:46.669 --> 01:58:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:49.490 --> 01:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:58:52.850 --> 01:58:52.860 align:start position:0%
my name is Omer Ahern Jr
 
01:58:56.510 --> 01:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
and I am from Wentworth Grafton County
 
01:58:58.609 --> 01:58:58.619 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:59:02.450 --> 01:59:02.460 align:start position:0%
I am one of seven children
 
01:59:05.689 --> 01:59:05.699 align:start position:0%
I am the father of four children
 
01:59:09.050 --> 01:59:09.060 align:start position:0%
and the grandfather of eight
 
01:59:09.060 --> 01:59:11.689 align:start position:0%
and the grandfather of eight
grandchildren

01:59:11.689 --> 01:59:11.699 align:start position:0%
grandchildren
 
01:59:19.010 --> 01:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:22.790 --> 01:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
to me this is about saving precious
 
01:59:27.530 --> 01:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:30.430 --> 01:59:30.440 align:start position:0%
I do believe that life
 
01:59:33.649 --> 01:59:33.659 align:start position:0%
begins at conception
 
01:59:38.750 --> 01:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
and ends at natural death
 
01:59:41.270 --> 01:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
as humans
 
01:59:46.250 --> 01:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
we can decide what we do
 
01:59:48.169 --> 01:59:48.179 align:start position:0%
we are not
 
01:59:48.179 --> 01:59:53.390 align:start position:0%
we are not
animals

01:59:53.390 --> 01:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:57.470 --> 01:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
so people already do have
 
01:59:57.480 --> 02:00:00.410 align:start position:0%
so people already do have
reproductive

02:00:00.410 --> 02:00:00.420 align:start position:0%
reproductive
 
02:00:00.420 --> 02:00:03.350 align:start position:0%
reproductive
autonomy

02:00:03.350 --> 02:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
autonomy
 
02:00:06.830 --> 02:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
decisions and choices are not always
 
02:00:06.840 --> 02:00:11.330 align:start position:0%
decisions and choices are not always
easy

02:00:11.330 --> 02:00:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:16.129 --> 02:00:16.139 align:start position:0%
but they do have consequences
 
02:00:19.490 --> 02:00:19.500 align:start position:0%
if a person does not want to have
 
02:00:21.290 --> 02:00:21.300 align:start position:0%
a baby
 
02:00:24.589 --> 02:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
just say no
 
02:00:24.599 --> 02:00:26.390 align:start position:0%
just say no
before

02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
before
 
02:00:29.930 --> 02:00:29.940 align:start position:0%
doing the Act of Creation
 
02:00:32.570 --> 02:00:32.580 align:start position:0%
even if the pregnancy is caused by a
 
02:00:34.129 --> 02:00:34.139 align:start position:0%
criminal act
 
02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
and the woman after thought does not
 
02:00:39.649 --> 02:00:39.659 align:start position:0%
want to have the baby
 
02:00:44.629 --> 02:00:44.639 align:start position:0%
a second crime is not justified in any
 
02:00:44.639 --> 02:00:45.530 align:start position:0%
a second crime is not justified in any
way

02:00:45.530 --> 02:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
way
 
02:00:50.450 --> 02:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
taking the life of another human being
 
02:00:53.470 --> 02:00:53.480 align:start position:0%
there are many families who would
 
02:00:58.609 --> 02:00:58.619 align:start position:0%
uh love to be able to help women in
 
02:01:01.550 --> 02:01:01.560 align:start position:0%
these situations and there are medical
 
02:01:04.910 --> 02:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
providers who will also help
 
02:01:07.750 --> 02:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
the mother saved the life of the baby
 
02:01:10.850 --> 02:01:10.860 align:start position:0%
and then this family or these families
 
02:01:14.629 --> 02:01:14.639 align:start position:0%
would raise the child who can grow up to
 
02:01:18.350 --> 02:01:18.360 align:start position:0%
be a great benefit to our Republic and
 
02:01:20.689 --> 02:01:20.699 align:start position:0%
our society
 
02:01:22.790 --> 02:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
I'm also an attorney
 
02:01:25.729 --> 02:01:25.739 align:start position:0%
and in my law practice over the last 44
 
02:01:25.739 --> 02:01:26.930 align:start position:0%
and in my law practice over the last 44
years

02:01:26.930 --> 02:01:26.940 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
I would have married couples come into
 
02:01:30.530 --> 02:01:30.540 align:start position:0%
my office
 
02:01:35.149 --> 02:01:35.159 align:start position:0%
and ask me to help them find a baby if
 
02:01:38.870 --> 02:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
they could adopt love and raise in a
 
02:01:41.870 --> 02:01:41.880 align:start position:0%

Hampshire
 
02:02:15.770 --> 02:02:15.780 align:start position:0%
um there's no way this is not going to
 
02:02:18.229 --> 02:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
be emotional and subjective to one
 
02:02:19.550 --> 02:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
degree or another
 
02:02:22.729 --> 02:02:22.739 align:start position:0%
but I work with post-abortion survivors
 
02:02:25.070 --> 02:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
who are horrified and traumatized by
 
02:02:27.290 --> 02:02:27.300 align:start position:0%
what they've been through
 
02:02:29.870 --> 02:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
my husband and when he was sitting to be
 
02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
a physician
 
02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:32.030 align:start position:0%
a physician
um

02:02:32.030 --> 02:02:32.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:35.390 --> 02:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
assisted in a procedure dilation
 
02:02:35.400 --> 02:02:37.129 align:start position:0%
assisted in a procedure dilation
curettage

02:02:37.129 --> 02:02:37.139 align:start position:0%
curettage
 
02:02:40.490 --> 02:02:40.500 align:start position:0%
and watched as a living human being
 
02:02:43.550 --> 02:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
struggled inside the womb and was hacked
 
02:02:45.169 --> 02:02:45.179 align:start position:0%
to pieces
 
02:02:50.930 --> 02:02:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:52.669 --> 02:02:52.679 align:start position:0%
you can't have a foundation for anything
 
02:02:55.129 --> 02:02:55.139 align:start position:0%
if you build it on
 
02:02:57.169 --> 02:02:57.179 align:start position:0%
a false assumption
 
02:03:00.229 --> 02:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
there's no foundation for freedom
 
02:03:04.129 --> 02:03:04.139 align:start position:0%
or love or care anything we believe in
 
02:03:06.530 --> 02:03:06.540 align:start position:0%
if we don't understand
 
02:03:09.350 --> 02:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
what is essentially human and why we
 
02:03:11.990 --> 02:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
must protect it and I want to ask those
 
02:03:13.609 --> 02:03:13.619 align:start position:0%
of you women who've been hurt to please
 
02:03:16.129 --> 02:03:16.139 align:start position:0%
forgive us
 
02:03:22.910 --> 02:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:24.890 --> 02:03:24.900 align:start position:0%
personally support an organization that
 
02:03:27.290 --> 02:03:27.300 align:start position:0%
will fly women any from anywhere in the
 
02:03:27.300 --> 02:03:28.850 align:start position:0%
will fly women any from anywhere in the
country

02:03:28.850 --> 02:03:28.860 align:start position:0%
country
 
02:03:31.129 --> 02:03:31.139 align:start position:0%
to be cared for completely through nine
 
02:03:33.470 --> 02:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
months of pregnancy given everything
 
02:03:35.270 --> 02:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
they need
 
02:03:37.490 --> 02:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
this is the kind of thing we need I have
 
02:03:39.589 --> 02:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
a lovely spiritual daughter
 
02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
who went through an abortion because she
 
02:03:43.430 --> 02:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
didn't believe she could survive
 
02:03:46.310 --> 02:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
I found out afterwards and I told her if
 
02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
I had known I would have done absolutely
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
everything I could to save her and her
 
02:03:50.159 --> 02:03:51.109 align:start position:0%
everything I could to save her and her
child

02:03:51.109 --> 02:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
child
 
02:03:53.510 --> 02:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
and if it really really was an issue of
 
02:03:55.850 --> 02:03:55.860 align:start position:0%
the choice of her life or the child's I
 
02:03:59.390 --> 02:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
would have I would have chosen her
 
02:04:01.370 --> 02:04:01.380 align:start position:0%
the reality is you had a senator stand
 
02:04:02.870 --> 02:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
right there and talk about essential
 
02:04:04.430 --> 02:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
constitutional liberties who was
 
02:04:06.649 --> 02:04:06.659 align:start position:0%
ill-informed about something called
 
02:04:10.089 --> 02:04:10.099 align:start position:0%
common law and um
 
02:04:13.370 --> 02:04:13.380 align:start position:0%
essential natural rights
 
02:04:15.709 --> 02:04:15.719 align:start position:0%
she said something about autonomy and
 
02:04:17.209 --> 02:04:17.219 align:start position:0%
the sanctity of a person but she didn't
 
02:04:19.010 --> 02:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
realize that the natural that the
 
02:04:20.750 --> 02:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
natural rights she referred to in our
 
02:04:20.760 --> 02:04:21.770 align:start position:0%
natural rights she referred to in our
constitution

02:04:21.770 --> 02:04:21.780 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
02:04:24.290 --> 02:04:24.300 align:start position:0%
uh the the formation of those relied on
 
02:04:26.270 --> 02:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
something called maxims of law that come
 
02:04:28.370 --> 02:04:28.380 align:start position:0%
from the 17th century
 
02:04:31.189 --> 02:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
and the maxims of law that informed uh
 
02:04:33.589 --> 02:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
John Locke and the former the formers of
 
02:04:35.149 --> 02:04:35.159 align:start position:0%
the Constitutions
 
02:04:37.010 --> 02:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
our state constitutions and our
 
02:04:39.589 --> 02:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
essential idea of what is human and what
 
02:04:42.310 --> 02:04:42.320 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
02:04:46.609 --> 02:04:46.619 align:start position:0%
Sanctified to protect comes from a maxim
 
02:04:49.430 --> 02:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
law of law which is
 
02:04:50.870 --> 02:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
um let me just find it here and read it
 
02:04:52.030 --> 02:04:52.040 align:start position:0%
to you
 
02:04:55.729 --> 02:04:55.739 align:start position:0%
maxims of law 58c who he who is in the
 
02:04:58.850 --> 02:04:58.860 align:start position:0%
womb is considered as born when his
 
02:05:01.129 --> 02:05:01.139 align:start position:0%
benefit is concerned that is the
 
02:05:04.970 --> 02:05:04.980 align:start position:0%
foundation for uh natural law and common
 
02:05:07.010 --> 02:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
law that were the foreign foundations of
 
02:05:08.750 --> 02:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
our constitution
 
02:05:10.550 --> 02:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
everything else is going to have to flow
 
02:05:12.709 --> 02:05:12.719 align:start position:0%
from our reality and our acceptance at
 
02:05:16.910 --> 02:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
every that humanity is messy
 
02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:19.010 align:start position:0%
every that humanity is messy
foreign

02:05:19.010 --> 02:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:05:21.770 --> 02:05:21.780 align:start position:0%
that we will die when we try to care for
 
02:05:23.930 --> 02:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
one another it will hurt it will cost us
 
02:05:25.310 --> 02:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
we will fail
 
02:05:27.589 --> 02:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
but if we think a human baby is
 
02:05:29.390 --> 02:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
three-fifths of a person like they
 
02:05:31.310 --> 02:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
thought a slave was
 
02:05:34.189 --> 02:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
and we don't move past that we will
 
02:05:36.290 --> 02:05:36.300 align:start position:0%
never build anything that will create a
 
02:05:36.300 --> 02:05:37.370 align:start position:0%
never build anything that will create a
foundation

02:05:37.370 --> 02:05:37.380 align:start position:0%
foundation
 
02:05:39.950 --> 02:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
of Truth to build all our other values
 
02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:41.169 align:start position:0%
of Truth to build all our other values
on

02:05:41.169 --> 02:05:41.179 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:05:43.490 --> 02:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment is not
 
02:05:45.770 --> 02:05:45.780 align:start position:0%
something to just throw around if you
 
02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
don't build from the right foundation
 
02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
about what is human what deserves
 
02:05:53.330 --> 02:05:53.340 align:start position:0%
protection you won't build true
 
02:05:56.450 --> 02:05:56.460 align:start position:0%
Essential Health Care for Women we've
 
02:05:59.089 --> 02:05:59.099 align:start position:0%
failed it's time for a new thing but we
 
02:06:01.669 --> 02:06:01.679 align:start position:0%
can't build anything good and true and
 
02:06:05.030 --> 02:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
Lasting and compassionate and truly free
 
02:06:07.669 --> 02:06:07.679 align:start position:0%
if we don't understand but it's
 
02:06:09.530 --> 02:06:09.540 align:start position:0%
essentially human
 
02:06:12.709 --> 02:06:12.719 align:start position:0%
and must be protected at all costs or in
 
02:06:14.870 --> 02:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
a painful time
 
02:06:16.970 --> 02:06:16.980 align:start position:0%
we're in a painful time
 
02:06:18.770 --> 02:06:18.780 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to rethink so many
 
02:06:18.780 --> 02:06:20.089 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to rethink so many
things

02:06:20.089 --> 02:06:20.099 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:06:22.310 --> 02:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
we failed so many women and so many
 
02:06:22.320 --> 02:06:23.810 align:start position:0%
we failed so many women and so many
babies

02:06:23.810 --> 02:06:23.820 align:start position:0%
babies
 
02:06:26.270 --> 02:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
but you don't build what is good and
 
02:06:28.970 --> 02:06:28.980 align:start position:0%
true and Lasting on a foundation of
 
02:06:28.980 --> 02:06:30.050 align:start position:0%
true and Lasting on a foundation of
lying

02:06:30.050 --> 02:06:30.060 align:start position:0%
lying
 
02:06:32.990 --> 02:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
what is essentially human from the
 
02:06:36.589 --> 02:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:40.070 --> 02:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh questions to this Witness
 
02:06:41.570 --> 02:06:41.580 align:start position:0%
representative Morgan did you have a
 
02:06:41.580 --> 02:06:42.470 align:start position:0%
representative Morgan did you have a
question

02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:06:45.290 --> 02:06:45.300 align:start position:0%
um first of all well I hesitate to ask
 
02:06:47.870 --> 02:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
you but um your heartening back to John
 
02:06:50.089 --> 02:06:50.099 align:start position:0%
Locke's time and I'm not sure if I I'm
 
02:06:52.669 --> 02:06:52.679 align:start position:0%
familiar with John Locke I'm not
 
02:06:55.790 --> 02:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
um in his time was reproductive Health
 
02:06:58.370 --> 02:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
something that was handled truthfully by
 
02:07:02.149 --> 02:07:02.159 align:start position:0%
or primarily by men or is that something
 
02:07:04.129 --> 02:07:04.139 align:start position:0%
that was with considered the time to be
 
02:07:05.870 --> 02:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
kind of within the women's sphere of
 
02:07:08.390 --> 02:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
influence um my point was simply that
 
02:07:11.030 --> 02:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
when these matters were being considered
 
02:07:13.250 --> 02:07:13.260 align:start position:0%
that even our forefathers and the people
 
02:07:15.050 --> 02:07:15.060 align:start position:0%
who wrote the Constitution understood
 
02:07:17.629 --> 02:07:17.639 align:start position:0%
there was an issue of life in the womb
 
02:07:20.689 --> 02:07:20.699 align:start position:0%
and believe me abortion was very much an
 
02:07:20.699 --> 02:07:21.649 align:start position:0%
and believe me abortion was very much an
issue

02:07:21.649 --> 02:07:21.659 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:07:24.830 --> 02:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
it always has been the issue of life and
 
02:07:27.050 --> 02:07:27.060 align:start position:0%
death it's always been messy it's always
 
02:07:30.649 --> 02:07:30.659 align:start position:0%
been difficult it's when we somehow just
 
02:07:30.659 --> 02:07:32.570 align:start position:0%
been difficult it's when we somehow just
assume

02:07:32.570 --> 02:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
assume
 
02:07:35.209 --> 02:07:35.219 align:start position:0%
that somehow what creates essential
 
02:07:38.149 --> 02:07:38.159 align:start position:0%
freedom is a woman's right to choose and
 
02:07:40.250 --> 02:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
we we forget the foundation that freedom
 
02:07:43.370 --> 02:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
is based on the value of humanity
 
02:07:44.930 --> 02:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
we've got to go all the way back to the
 
02:07:44.940 --> 02:07:46.010 align:start position:0%
we've got to go all the way back to the
beginning

02:07:46.010 --> 02:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
02:07:47.870 --> 02:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
and our Founders actually thought about
 
02:07:49.669 --> 02:07:49.679 align:start position:0%
these things they really did so I
 
02:07:51.189 --> 02:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
believe that Senator was pretty much
 
02:07:53.810 --> 02:07:53.820 align:start position:0%
misrepresenting the idea of natural
 
02:07:56.930 --> 02:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
constitutional law okay other questions
 
02:07:59.930 --> 02:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
for this week um well then
 
02:08:02.330 --> 02:08:02.340 align:start position:0%
the Constitution like it says all what
 
02:08:03.950 --> 02:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
they wrote was all men are created equal
 
02:08:06.290 --> 02:08:06.300 align:start position:0%
and I guess we the role of men and women
 
02:08:08.990 --> 02:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
has changed a lot but actually all of
 
02:08:11.030 --> 02:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
our men are born equal so why did they
 
02:08:13.970 --> 02:08:13.980 align:start position:0%
do it board instead of conceived like
 
02:08:16.550 --> 02:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
well I just was taking issue with the
 
02:08:18.109 --> 02:08:18.119 align:start position:0%
fact that he had a senator who came here
 
02:08:20.629 --> 02:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
and stood on constitutional law and you
 
02:08:22.010 --> 02:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
could say well then maybe we shouldn't
 
02:08:24.050 --> 02:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
listen to her because what she quoted
 
02:08:25.490 --> 02:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
was written by men
 
02:08:27.229 --> 02:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
I think it's just important that we
 
02:08:30.970 --> 02:08:30.980 align:start position:0%
understand that our founders understood
 
02:08:33.890 --> 02:08:33.900 align:start position:0%
How Deeply important it was to know who
 
02:08:34.970 --> 02:08:34.980 align:start position:0%
is human
 
02:08:37.790 --> 02:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
and why that matters in the womb
 
02:08:39.830 --> 02:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
and why we can build from that something
 
02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:41.510 align:start position:0%
and why we can build from that something
better

02:08:41.510 --> 02:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
better
 
02:08:43.790 --> 02:08:43.800 align:start position:0%
that serves everyone
 
02:08:46.970 --> 02:08:46.980 align:start position:0%
thank you cic R2 isn't it
 
02:08:49.129 --> 02:08:49.139 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
 
02:08:49.139 --> 02:08:50.750 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this

cacr2 a bill that supports the
 
02:09:27.470 --> 02:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
reproductive decisions of all
 
02:09:31.550 --> 02:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
at least 10 times a day I am witness to
 
02:09:34.790 --> 02:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
the trauma and difficulty life brings to
 
02:09:35.990 --> 02:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
so many
 
02:09:39.169 --> 02:09:39.179 align:start position:0%
my patients are not here today due to
 
02:09:41.810 --> 02:09:41.820 align:start position:0%
the many barriers some of which include
 
02:09:44.390 --> 02:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
the inability to get time off from work
 
02:09:46.729 --> 02:09:46.739 align:start position:0%
not having someone to watch their
 
02:09:49.550 --> 02:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
children not having access to reliable
 
02:09:52.729 --> 02:09:52.739 align:start position:0%
transportation or simply not speaking
 
02:09:56.570 --> 02:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
English so I am here today to speak for
 
02:09:59.750 --> 02:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
them and their families
 
02:10:01.970 --> 02:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
I see how difficult reproductive
 
02:10:04.250 --> 02:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
decisions are without the government
 
02:10:09.229 --> 02:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
posing barriers I can confidently say as
 
02:10:11.330 --> 02:10:11.340 align:start position:0%
an individual and as a health care
 
02:10:14.930 --> 02:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
provider that it is your duty as
 
02:10:19.669 --> 02:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
representatives to support individuals
 
02:10:22.790 --> 02:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
in helping to make active decisions for
 
02:10:26.270 --> 02:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
themselves and their families as we know
 
02:10:29.450 --> 02:10:29.460 align:start position:0%
only an individual knows the best
 
02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
situation for themselves the best
 
02:10:34.189 --> 02:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
decision for themselves at that time in
 
02:10:36.350 --> 02:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
their life
 
02:10:38.990 --> 02:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
please vote to protect these families
 
02:10:41.570 --> 02:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
and making decisions that are best for
 
02:10:43.729 --> 02:10:43.739 align:start position:0%
them by codifying this constitutional
 
02:10:43.739 --> 02:10:45.970 align:start position:0%
them by codifying this constitutional
right

02:10:45.970 --> 02:10:45.980 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:10:49.089 --> 02:10:49.099 align:start position:0%
someone just a little while ago
 
02:10:54.950 --> 02:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
suggested the idea of just saying no
 
02:10:58.790 --> 02:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
I wish I could invite this person and
 
02:11:01.729 --> 02:11:01.739 align:start position:0%
others who feel this way to Shadow me
 
02:11:04.310 --> 02:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
for one day at work
 
02:11:08.209 --> 02:11:08.219 align:start position:0%
or even just an hour
 
02:11:11.990 --> 02:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
you would see this is not an option for
 
02:11:13.910 --> 02:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
so many
 
02:11:16.609 --> 02:11:16.619 align:start position:0%
while I would love to share the details
 
02:11:19.850 --> 02:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
of stories of why saying no just doesn't
 
02:11:22.850 --> 02:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
work for all I know it would keep you up
 
02:11:25.189 --> 02:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
at night and I know I only have three
 
02:11:27.790 --> 02:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
minutes to speak today
 
02:11:32.149 --> 02:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
I only heard of this hearing last night
 
02:11:34.790 --> 02:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
so I didn't have time to quite prepare
 
02:11:37.250 --> 02:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
the statement I would like so I hope
 
02:11:39.410 --> 02:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
this suffices
 
02:11:42.470 --> 02:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
it's hard as a health care provider to
 
02:11:44.930 --> 02:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
be present in vital hearings like this
 
02:11:47.629 --> 02:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
one today when you are busy on the
 
02:11:50.510 --> 02:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
ground doing the work caring for
 
02:11:53.330 --> 02:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
individuals and their families their
 
02:11:56.089 --> 02:11:56.099 align:start position:0%
fetuses and their babies
 
02:11:59.270 --> 02:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
many of my colleagues are overwhelmed
 
02:12:02.149 --> 02:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
and overworked ensuring that they
 
02:12:05.149 --> 02:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
provide quality sensitive care to all
 
02:12:07.729 --> 02:12:07.739 align:start position:0%
individuals so they don't have the
 
02:12:12.890 --> 02:12:12.900 align:start position:0%
capacity to wait to speak here today
 
02:12:16.129 --> 02:12:16.139 align:start position:0%
I have written testimony I have also
 
02:12:18.649 --> 02:12:18.659 align:start position:0%
submit and I just want to offer the
 
02:12:21.290 --> 02:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
space for questions now or at a later
 
02:12:21.300 --> 02:12:22.669 align:start position:0%
space for questions now or at a later
time

02:12:22.669 --> 02:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:12:27.050 --> 02:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:28.850 --> 02:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
02:12:31.729 --> 02:12:31.739 align:start position:0%
you for your time uh I I don't have any
 
02:12:33.890 --> 02:12:33.900 align:start position:0%
other pink cars is there anyone else who
 
02:12:39.649 --> 02:12:39.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:39.659 --> 02:12:41.030 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:12:41.030 --> 02:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:12:43.189 --> 02:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
um you need to submit a card do you need
 
02:12:46.609 --> 02:12:46.619 align:start position:0%
to submit one of the pink cards and
 
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
you can speak first and fill it out you
 
02:12:51.050 --> 02:12:51.060 align:start position:0%
can speak first and fill it out later
 
02:12:51.060 --> 02:12:52.790 align:start position:0%
can speak first and fill it out later
okay

02:12:52.790 --> 02:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:12:55.930 --> 02:12:55.940 align:start position:0%
I wasn't planning to speak but this uh
 
02:12:58.069 --> 02:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
session move me my name is Catherine
 
02:13:00.830 --> 02:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
haraki I live in Hampton New Hampshire
 
02:13:03.350 --> 02:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
um statistically speaking one in five
 
02:13:06.410 --> 02:13:06.420 align:start position:0%
pregnancies uh ended an abortion that
 
02:13:09.669 --> 02:13:09.679 align:start position:0%
means that of these five Great Men
 
02:13:13.790 --> 02:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
Behind you these framed leaders one of
 
02:13:16.550 --> 02:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
their wives most likely had an abortion
 
02:13:19.129 --> 02:13:19.139 align:start position:0%
why did that matter then because
 
02:13:20.930 --> 02:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
what women did didn't matter then they
 
02:13:22.490 --> 02:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
weren't considered so what they did
 
02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
didn't matter either it wasn't worth
 
02:13:26.689 --> 02:13:26.699 align:start position:0%
making legal or illegal
 
02:13:28.910 --> 02:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
and I couldn't help but think what a
 
02:13:31.250 --> 02:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
coincident it was that abortion didn't
 
02:13:34.790 --> 02:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
become illegal until around 1829 the
 
02:13:36.649 --> 02:13:36.659 align:start position:0%
same year or the year same year within a
 
02:13:38.450 --> 02:13:38.460 align:start position:0%
year when the first
 
02:13:40.729 --> 02:13:40.739 align:start position:0%
women's strike which happened in Dover
 
02:13:45.649 --> 02:13:45.659 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire when 800 mil girls left
 
02:13:47.810 --> 02:13:47.820 align:start position:0%
the factory
 
02:13:49.669 --> 02:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
because of terrible conditions and what
 
02:13:51.890 --> 02:13:51.900 align:start position:0%
a coincidence that the moment women
 
02:13:54.470 --> 02:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
start asking for some rights other
 
02:13:56.689 --> 02:13:56.699 align:start position:0%
rights start getting taken away
 
02:14:00.109 --> 02:14:00.119 align:start position:0%
so this discussion isn't about right or
 
02:14:03.290 --> 02:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
wrong we're all sinners
 
02:14:05.750 --> 02:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
and if this was about right and wrong we
 
02:14:07.430 --> 02:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have a governor we'd have an
 
02:14:10.550 --> 02:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
Ayatollah this is about wants I want
 
02:14:12.290 --> 02:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
Reproductive Rights she wants me
 
02:14:13.910 --> 02:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
productive rights he wants Reproductive
 
02:14:15.410 --> 02:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
Rights and some of you want Reproductive
 
02:14:17.390 --> 02:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
Rights as well that's what we want and
 
02:14:19.450 --> 02:14:19.460 align:start position:0%
that's what we're here discussing
 
02:14:22.910 --> 02:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
although even so far as to say
 
02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:24.550 align:start position:0%
although even so far as to say
that

02:14:24.550 --> 02:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:14:28.550 --> 02:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
by saying no to CRC or two it's not only
 
02:14:30.830 --> 02:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
carpet bagging a philosophy that doesn't
 
02:14:33.169 --> 02:14:33.179 align:start position:0%
belong in New Hampshire I would go so
 
02:14:34.729 --> 02:14:34.739 align:start position:0%
far to say after hearing some comments
 
02:14:34.739 --> 02:14:35.510 align:start position:0%
far to say after hearing some comments
today

02:14:35.510 --> 02:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:14:38.270 --> 02:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
no to this to me might be saying that
 
02:14:40.069 --> 02:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
you're trying to compensate for your own
 
02:14:43.669 --> 02:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
sins and perversities
 
02:14:47.030 --> 02:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
so my push today is for you to think
 
02:14:49.069 --> 02:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
very carefully about New Hampshire's
 
02:14:51.649 --> 02:14:51.659 align:start position:0%
History New Hampshire's wants and look
 
02:14:54.589 --> 02:14:54.599 align:start position:0%
into your own soul and make the right
 
02:14:56.930 --> 02:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
decision thank you questions to this
 
02:14:56.940 --> 02:14:59.390 align:start position:0%
decision thank you questions to this
Witness

02:14:59.390 --> 02:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:01.310 --> 02:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you anyone else who
 
02:15:05.930 --> 02:15:05.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:10.010 --> 02:15:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:12.229 --> 02:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
oh yeah please don't forget to fill out
 
02:15:14.209 --> 02:15:14.219 align:start position:0%
the pink card okay so you know uh other
 
02:15:15.830 --> 02:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
Witnesses desire to testify I'm going to
 
02:15:18.950 --> 02:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on this and uh we've
 
02:15:22.129 --> 02:15:22.139 align:start position:0%
been going now for uh
 
02:15:24.530 --> 02:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
over two hours so I'm gonna take a brief
 
02:15:28.430 --> 02:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
recess before we uh resume uh by taking
 
02:15:33.350 --> 02:15:33.360 align:start position:0%

all right um this is the house Judiciary
 
02:29:42.290 --> 02:29:42.300 align:start position:0%
Committee I'm going to call it uh back
 
02:29:44.750 --> 02:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
into session uh
 
02:29:49.250 --> 02:29:49.260 align:start position:0%
to hear House Bill 271 FN
 
02:29:51.530 --> 02:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
um and um I'm first going to recognize
 
02:29:53.030 --> 02:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
the sponsor
 
02:29:56.690 --> 02:29:56.700 align:start position:0%
um and because she is a sponsor I'm she
 
02:29:59.630 --> 02:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
may speak for however long she needs to
 
02:30:01.929 --> 02:30:01.939 align:start position:0%
speak to to tell us about the the bill
 
02:30:05.330 --> 02:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
after she speaks I will uh because I
 
02:30:07.429 --> 02:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
have uh because of time and because of
 
02:30:09.290 --> 02:30:09.300 align:start position:0%
the number of people who have indicated
 
02:30:11.750 --> 02:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
a desire to speak I will impose a a
 
02:30:13.790 --> 02:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
three-minute limit on on other people
 
02:30:17.270 --> 02:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
that uh wish to speak so without further
 
02:30:19.070 --> 02:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
Ado I would recognize the prime sponsor
 
02:30:22.490 --> 02:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:22.500 --> 02:30:23.929 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:30:23.929 --> 02:30:23.939 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:30:30.710 --> 02:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:32.870 --> 02:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
please no not
 
02:30:35.450 --> 02:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
to try Okay
 
02:30:38.809 --> 02:30:38.819 align:start position:0%
um the sound system is terrible
 
02:30:43.429 --> 02:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
uh let me set the stage Mr chair my name
 
02:30:46.429 --> 02:30:46.439 align:start position:0%
is Marjorie Smith I'm honored to serve
 
02:30:48.050 --> 02:30:48.060 align:start position:0%
on this committee
 
02:30:52.030 --> 02:30:52.040 align:start position:0%
this is my 13th term during those 13
 
02:30:57.170 --> 02:30:57.180 align:start position:0%
terms I have served on two major policy
 
02:31:00.790 --> 02:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
committees only Judiciary and finance
 
02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
and I have chaired each of those twice
 
02:31:09.349 --> 02:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
so the connection between Judiciary and
 
02:31:12.910 --> 02:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
finance is one that is very close to me
 
02:31:15.469 --> 02:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
I care about
 
02:31:15.479 --> 02:31:17.530 align:start position:0%
I care about
policy

02:31:17.530 --> 02:31:17.540 align:start position:0%
policy
 
02:31:21.950 --> 02:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
procedures and politics in the Greek
 
02:31:23.990 --> 02:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
sense of the word
 
02:31:27.469 --> 02:31:27.479 align:start position:0%
trying to bring people together to solve
 
02:31:32.230 --> 02:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
common problems not the same goals as
 
02:31:36.050 --> 02:31:36.060 align:start position:0%
partisan politics which I have never
 
02:31:38.870 --> 02:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
been good at
 
02:31:42.950 --> 02:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
every two years how spill one is the
 
02:31:46.490 --> 02:31:46.500 align:start position:0%
budget House Bill 2 is what we refer to
 
02:31:50.330 --> 02:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
as the trailer Bill and House Bill 25 is
 
02:31:52.870 --> 02:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
the capital budget bill that happens
 
02:31:57.469 --> 02:31:57.479 align:start position:0%
every two years the trailer bill is the
 
02:32:02.030 --> 02:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
bill that is created to provide any
 
02:32:04.910 --> 02:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
language necessary
 
02:32:08.870 --> 02:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
for the numbers that appear in house
 
02:32:12.010 --> 02:32:12.020 align:start position:0%
bill one that is the only
 
02:32:15.309 --> 02:32:15.319 align:start position:0%
material that is supposed to go into
 
02:32:19.849 --> 02:32:19.859 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 language which makes the
 
02:32:21.730 --> 02:32:21.740 align:start position:0%
budget work
 
02:32:26.870 --> 02:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
I am stuffy and I'm old-fashioned I
 
02:32:29.570 --> 02:32:29.580 align:start position:0%
believe in doing what we are supposed to
 
02:32:34.130 --> 02:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
do within the legal structure that we as
 
02:32:35.270 --> 02:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
a nation
 
02:32:38.929 --> 02:32:38.939 align:start position:0%
and a state and A legislature have
 
02:32:38.939 --> 02:32:40.610 align:start position:0%
and a state and A legislature have
established

02:32:40.610 --> 02:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
established
 
02:32:44.870 --> 02:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
two years ago in complete violation of
 
02:32:44.880 --> 02:32:46.130 align:start position:0%
two years ago in complete violation of
policy

02:32:46.130 --> 02:32:46.140 align:start position:0%
policy
 
02:32:48.889 --> 02:32:48.899 align:start position:0%
practice and procedures
 
02:32:52.010 --> 02:32:52.020 align:start position:0%
a section was included in House Bill 2
 
02:32:55.790 --> 02:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
that had absolutely nothing
 
02:32:59.270 --> 02:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with the budget
 
02:33:02.809 --> 02:33:02.819 align:start position:0%
there had been no assignment to a policy
 
02:33:02.819 --> 02:33:03.830 align:start position:0%
there had been no assignment to a policy
committee

02:33:03.830 --> 02:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:33:07.630 --> 02:33:07.640 align:start position:0%
no hearing no relevant Committee Action
 
02:33:12.889 --> 02:33:12.899 align:start position:0%
and no public dollars involved let me
 
02:33:17.030 --> 02:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
repeat that no public dollars involved
 
02:33:19.730 --> 02:33:19.740 align:start position:0%
the house and the Senate passed the
 
02:33:22.190 --> 02:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
budget bills and the governor signed
 
02:33:25.849 --> 02:33:25.859 align:start position:0%
them saying he objected to the language
 
02:33:29.929 --> 02:33:29.939 align:start position:0%
that I object to here but he had no
 
02:33:33.230 --> 02:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
choice because the budget had to pass
 
02:33:35.330 --> 02:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
now let's think about that for a moment
 
02:33:38.389 --> 02:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
that was an interesting statement on the
 
02:33:40.490 --> 02:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
part of his Excellency
 
02:33:44.389 --> 02:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
for two reasons the first is he claims
 
02:33:48.770 --> 02:33:48.780 align:start position:0%
to respect the rights of women to
 
02:33:51.710 --> 02:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
control their own bodies to make their
 
02:33:53.630 --> 02:33:53.640 align:start position:0%
own choice
 
02:33:57.349 --> 02:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
and he repeats that as he goes about the
 
02:33:58.730 --> 02:33:58.740 align:start position:0%
country now
 
02:34:02.750 --> 02:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
having an opportunity to present himself
 
02:34:06.770 --> 02:34:06.780 align:start position:0%
to voters in other states
 
02:34:09.830 --> 02:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
he talks about being pro-choice
 
02:34:12.050 --> 02:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
and the other reason this is interesting
 
02:34:15.349 --> 02:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
is not just two years before the
 
02:34:18.410 --> 02:34:18.420 align:start position:0%
governor acted on his right to veto his
 
02:34:22.070 --> 02:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
the budget and then a new budget was
 
02:34:24.469 --> 02:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
formed he knew from his own experience
 
02:34:26.630 --> 02:34:26.640 align:start position:0%
that he didn't have to sign a budget
 
02:34:31.910 --> 02:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:34.370 --> 02:34:34.380 align:start position:0%
if he had wanted to follow a policy
 
02:34:37.070 --> 02:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
procedure and practice since then there
 
02:34:39.590 --> 02:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
have been multiple efforts to try to
 
02:34:41.750 --> 02:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
stop the Damage Done
 
02:34:44.450 --> 02:34:44.460 align:start position:0%
and some but not all of the most
 
02:34:46.309 --> 02:34:46.319 align:start position:0%
egregious components of this section
 
02:34:48.849 --> 02:34:48.859 align:start position:0%
have been repealed
 
02:34:51.770 --> 02:34:51.780 align:start position:0%
specifically the removal of the
 
02:34:55.389 --> 02:34:55.399 align:start position:0%
intrusive and medically unjustifiable
 
02:34:59.809 --> 02:34:59.819 align:start position:0%
requirement for ultrasound tests and
 
02:35:03.110 --> 02:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
also by adding
 
02:35:05.450 --> 02:35:05.460 align:start position:0%
language which acknowledged the
 
02:35:09.530 --> 02:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
possibility of fatal fetal abnormalities
 
02:35:13.610 --> 02:35:13.620 align:start position:0%
today you will hear in bills before us
 
02:35:16.730 --> 02:35:16.740 align:start position:0%
some other efforts to try to erase more
 
02:35:19.309 --> 02:35:19.319 align:start position:0%
of the language that never should have
 
02:35:21.710 --> 02:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
become law
 
02:35:25.010 --> 02:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
I'm not interested in a change here and
 
02:35:28.010 --> 02:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
a change there in this case what I'm
 
02:35:31.429 --> 02:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
looking forward to is tabula rasa a
 
02:35:34.490 --> 02:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
blank slate that would then make it
 
02:35:37.130 --> 02:35:37.140 align:start position:0%
possible for us to construct new
 
02:35:39.889 --> 02:35:39.899 align:start position:0%
language following an appropriate
 
02:35:42.170 --> 02:35:42.180 align:start position:0%
legislative process
 
02:35:45.170 --> 02:35:45.180 align:start position:0%
to accomplish what an overwhelming
 
02:35:47.929 --> 02:35:47.939 align:start position:0%
percentage of voter support

02:36:01.250 --> 02:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
the right of people to decide for
 
02:36:04.070 --> 02:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
themselves how to control their own
 
02:36:07.070 --> 02:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
bodies I've had two children and I've
 
02:36:11.030 --> 02:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
had my time in an obstetrician's office
 
02:36:16.429 --> 02:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
never have I been in office big enough
 
02:36:19.190 --> 02:36:19.200 align:start position:0%
to accommodate the patient the doctor
 
02:36:24.710 --> 02:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
and 424 legislators we legislators have
 
02:36:26.770 --> 02:36:26.780 align:start position:0%
no business
 
02:36:30.650 --> 02:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
practicing medicine we are trained
 
02:36:33.469 --> 02:36:33.479 align:start position:0%
in many fields
 
02:36:36.710 --> 02:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
um but we are not trained as medical
 
02:36:39.349 --> 02:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
professionals we are not subject to
 
02:36:42.050 --> 02:36:42.060 align:start position:0%
centering if we violate medical
 
02:36:46.010 --> 02:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
procedure we are not trained or equipped
 
02:36:50.170 --> 02:36:50.180 align:start position:0%
to take the place of those with Germany
 
02:36:52.490 --> 02:36:52.500 align:start position:0%
appropriate medical behavior and
 
02:36:55.030 --> 02:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
enforcing those regulations
 
02:36:57.610 --> 02:36:57.620 align:start position:0%
administratively and judicially medical
 
02:37:00.349 --> 02:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
professionals are under
 
02:37:04.550 --> 02:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
the supervision of people who know how
 
02:37:06.710 --> 02:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
that should be conducted when I was
 
02:37:10.250 --> 02:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
first elected in 1996 I was asked why
 
02:37:12.710 --> 02:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
would I want to join a legislature that
 
02:37:15.530 --> 02:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
not had not had a democratic majority in
 
02:37:17.389 --> 02:37:17.399 align:start position:0%
the history of time or at least modern
 
02:37:17.399 --> 02:37:18.469 align:start position:0%
the history of time or at least modern
time

02:37:18.469 --> 02:37:18.479 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:37:24.830 --> 02:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
my answer was that I believed not in the
 
02:37:28.309 --> 02:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
Democratic platform or the Republican
 
02:37:31.250 --> 02:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
platform but in the concepts of the
 
02:37:34.790 --> 02:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
libertarian that had long been
 
02:37:38.870 --> 02:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
the the force that governed the state of
 
02:37:41.750 --> 02:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire a classic libertarian
 
02:37:45.050 --> 02:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
philosophy that respected the right of
 
02:37:47.750 --> 02:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
the individual to live
 
02:37:47.760 --> 02:37:49.309 align:start position:0%
the individual to live
free

02:37:49.309 --> 02:37:49.319 align:start position:0%
free
 
02:37:52.870 --> 02:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
of Nest unnecessary government intrusion
 
02:37:56.270 --> 02:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
and respected the principles of civil
 
02:37:58.490 --> 02:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
rights and civil liberties
 
02:38:03.550 --> 02:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
the corruption of House Bill 2 in 2021
 
02:38:06.050 --> 02:38:06.060 align:start position:0%
violated that tradition
 
02:38:09.370 --> 02:38:09.380 align:start position:0%
and we have a chance with this bill
 
02:38:12.590 --> 02:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
to erase the blight
 
02:38:15.770 --> 02:38:15.780 align:start position:0%
that exists because of the inappropriate
 
02:38:19.070 --> 02:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
action of this legislature I hope you
 
02:38:23.450 --> 02:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
will consider supporting this
 
02:38:26.690 --> 02:38:26.700 align:start position:0%
bill which tries to undo something that
 
02:38:28.849 --> 02:38:28.859 align:start position:0%
should never have been done in the first
 
02:38:31.250 --> 02:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
place and I thank you very much
 
02:38:32.990 --> 02:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Smith questions
 
02:38:36.530 --> 02:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
for uh the sponsor
 
02:38:38.990 --> 02:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative greeson thank you Mr
 
02:38:40.429 --> 02:38:40.439 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative how
 
02:38:42.590 --> 02:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
are you this morning I'm happy to see
 
02:38:46.070 --> 02:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
you representative oh goody
 
02:38:49.210 --> 02:38:49.220 align:start position:0%
given the level of misunderstanding
 
02:38:52.250 --> 02:38:52.260 align:start position:0%
regarding the provisions of the fetal
 
02:38:55.370 --> 02:38:55.380 align:start position:0%
Life protection act before we vote to
 
02:38:57.590 --> 02:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
repeal it or not
 
02:38:59.690 --> 02:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
I thought it would be beneficial if
 
02:39:03.230 --> 02:39:03.240 align:start position:0%
everyone knew what the actual law says
 
02:39:06.710 --> 02:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
so would you please explain what the law
 
02:39:10.070 --> 02:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
actually says including any provisions
 
02:39:12.469 --> 02:39:12.479 align:start position:0%
in the law that might prevent someone
 
02:39:15.830 --> 02:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
from inadvertently running a foul of the
 
02:39:19.250 --> 02:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
law that's a very good question and what
 
02:39:21.349 --> 02:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
I should have done is to have the text
 
02:39:24.469 --> 02:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
with me perhaps someone else does but I
 
02:39:26.830 --> 02:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
can tell you that one of the most
 
02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:28.630 align:start position:0%
can tell you that one of the most
egregious

02:39:28.630 --> 02:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
egregious
 
02:39:33.170 --> 02:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
remaining sections is that which
 
02:39:37.610 --> 02:39:37.620 align:start position:0%
um basically permits anyone to bring
 
02:39:41.270 --> 02:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
like a vigilante Squad to bring charges
 
02:39:45.530 --> 02:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
against medical professionals for that
 
02:39:48.469 --> 02:39:48.479 align:start position:0%
can result in felony convictions and
 
02:39:51.250 --> 02:39:51.260 align:start position:0%
fines and obviously lost the license
 
02:39:55.030 --> 02:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh that is something that is absolutely
 
02:39:58.010 --> 02:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
appropriate to be done by medical
 
02:40:00.530 --> 02:40:00.540 align:start position:0%
professionals who are violating the law
 
02:40:03.590 --> 02:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
and violating the ethics of being a
 
02:40:05.570 --> 02:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
medical professional I have no problem
 
02:40:08.750 --> 02:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
with that my problem is that that should
 
02:40:13.670 --> 02:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
happen in a due process logical way a
 
02:40:15.410 --> 02:40:15.420 align:start position:0%
way that we have constructed over the
 
02:40:17.929 --> 02:40:17.939 align:start position:0%
years and for for medical professionals
 
02:40:21.050 --> 02:40:21.060 align:start position:0%
they cannot get a license unless they
 
02:40:23.570 --> 02:40:23.580 align:start position:0%
pass certain tests training whatever
 
02:40:26.870 --> 02:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
they have to periodically get new
 
02:40:29.090 --> 02:40:29.100 align:start position:0%
training not training provided by the
 
02:40:31.849 --> 02:40:31.859 align:start position:0%
legislature but by medical professionals
 
02:40:34.429 --> 02:40:34.439 align:start position:0%
there if there is a complaint to be made
 
02:40:36.889 --> 02:40:36.899 align:start position:0%
there is a body against
 
02:40:40.309 --> 02:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
which that claim can be presented of
 
02:40:43.969 --> 02:40:43.979 align:start position:0%
medical professionals who can say yes
 
02:40:45.950 --> 02:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
this is a perfectly appropriate act
 
02:40:49.010 --> 02:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
under the circumstances or no it isn't
 
02:40:52.550 --> 02:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
and yes this medical professional should
 
02:40:52.560 --> 02:40:53.530 align:start position:0%
and yes this medical professional should
be

02:40:53.530 --> 02:40:53.540 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:40:56.809 --> 02:40:56.819 align:start position:0%
uh punish and I'll use that Loosely in
 
02:40:58.849 --> 02:40:58.859 align:start position:0%
some way it might be to have more
 
02:41:01.550 --> 02:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
training it might be to go through a
 
02:41:04.190 --> 02:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
period of supervision it might be to
 
02:41:06.230 --> 02:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
lose the license all of that is
 
02:41:09.349 --> 02:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
perfectly appropriate as long as that is
 
02:41:11.450 --> 02:41:11.460 align:start position:0%
performed by the people who should do
 
02:41:14.330 --> 02:41:14.340 align:start position:0%
that and that is the people whose job
 
02:41:18.230 --> 02:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that doctors do what
 
02:41:20.630 --> 02:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
they should do just as we have people
 
02:41:23.450 --> 02:41:23.460 align:start position:0%
who make sure that lawyers do what they
 
02:41:27.230 --> 02:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
should do or that contractors do what
 
02:41:31.370 --> 02:41:31.380 align:start position:0%
they should do not 424 legislators who
 
02:41:35.210 --> 02:41:35.220 align:start position:0%
wanted to make a political issue
 
02:41:38.690 --> 02:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
out of something that is not a political
 
02:41:41.210 --> 02:41:41.220 align:start position:0%
issue that has to do with personal
 
02:41:43.610 --> 02:41:43.620 align:start position:0%
individual rights
 
02:41:45.110 --> 02:41:45.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chair if I may follow up please
 
02:41:46.730 --> 02:41:46.740 align:start position:0%
because I don't think I got a complete
 
02:41:49.490 --> 02:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
answer on that is that the only thing
 
02:41:51.349 --> 02:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
that this law the fee Life protection
 
02:41:53.870 --> 02:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
act does is penalize doctors for
 
02:41:56.210 --> 02:41:56.220 align:start position:0%
performing an abortion or are there
 
02:41:58.969 --> 02:41:58.979 align:start position:0%
other Provisions well there have been
 
02:42:00.770 --> 02:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
other Provisions
 
02:42:04.550 --> 02:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
um uh uh is representative the former
 
02:42:07.510 --> 02:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
version of a welfare still here
 
02:42:10.250 --> 02:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
representative welper and I served
 
02:42:13.490 --> 02:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
together on the Judiciary Committee
 
02:42:15.950 --> 02:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
um and I was chair and I asked
 
02:42:18.530 --> 02:42:18.540 align:start position:0%
representative Welter to be my clerk
 
02:42:20.750 --> 02:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
there's never been a better clerk maybe
 
02:42:22.790 --> 02:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
in the future there's going to be but in
 
02:42:25.910 --> 02:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
the past there never was a better Clerk
 
02:42:28.130 --> 02:42:28.140 align:start position:0%
representative welper and I could not
 
02:42:31.429 --> 02:42:31.439 align:start position:0%
disagree more on this issue
 
02:42:35.809 --> 02:42:35.819 align:start position:0%
but last term we came together and the
 
02:42:38.570 --> 02:42:38.580 align:start position:0%
two of us helped to bring a bill through
 
02:42:41.690 --> 02:42:41.700 align:start position:0%
the house and then the Senate that dealt
 
02:42:45.670 --> 02:42:45.680 align:start position:0%
with the inappropriate use of um
 
02:42:45.680 --> 02:42:47.830 align:start position:0%
with the inappropriate use of um
uh

02:42:47.830 --> 02:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:42:50.210 --> 02:42:50.220 align:start position:0%
ultrasound tests
 
02:42:53.389 --> 02:42:53.399 align:start position:0%
subsequent to that conversation
 
02:42:56.809 --> 02:42:56.819 align:start position:0%
um the Senate on the basis of superb
 
02:42:59.990 --> 02:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
testimony by people from across the
 
02:43:04.250 --> 02:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
state agreed that there was the concept
 
02:43:07.730 --> 02:43:07.740 align:start position:0%
of fatal fetal abnormality and that
 
02:43:10.070 --> 02:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
there should not be
 
02:43:11.929 --> 02:43:11.939 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
02:43:15.230 --> 02:43:15.240 align:start position:0%
a a denial of the right for someone to
 
02:43:17.830 --> 02:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
end a pregnancy so those are two changes
 
02:43:22.309 --> 02:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
there is another change remaining and
 
02:43:25.490 --> 02:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
I'm actually not sure how I feel about
 
02:43:28.969 --> 02:43:28.979 align:start position:0%
it but I think and to be honest I must
 
02:43:31.849 --> 02:43:31.859 align:start position:0%
acknowledge it to you and that is the
 
02:43:36.770 --> 02:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
Restriction of 24 weeks I I'm not sure
 
02:43:40.790 --> 02:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
that that that is
 
02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:41.510 align:start position:0%
that that that is
um

02:43:41.510 --> 02:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:43.969 --> 02:43:43.979 align:start position:0%
isn't I'm not sure that it's an
 
02:43:47.809 --> 02:43:47.819 align:start position:0%
inappropriate specification and I say
 
02:43:50.210 --> 02:43:50.220 align:start position:0%
that for a number of reasons there's
 
02:43:52.969 --> 02:43:52.979 align:start position:0%
virtually no doctor in this state who
 
02:43:55.790 --> 02:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
would perform an abortion even as late
 
02:44:00.969 --> 02:44:00.979 align:start position:0%
as 24 weeks unless there was another
 
02:44:05.690 --> 02:44:05.700 align:start position:0%
overriding reason such as a fatal fetal
 
02:44:08.690 --> 02:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
and rally the life of the mother
 
02:44:12.170 --> 02:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
um so on that sense I'm not so sure it's
 
02:44:14.690 --> 02:44:14.700 align:start position:0%
disastrous but on the principle
 
02:44:18.410 --> 02:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
of having this in-house Bill too
 
02:44:21.950 --> 02:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
that's where I have problems it does did
 
02:44:23.990 --> 02:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
not belong it shouldn't have come in
 
02:44:27.530 --> 02:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
that way and if in its wisdom the
 
02:44:30.830 --> 02:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
legislature constructed a new
 
02:44:33.650 --> 02:44:33.660 align:start position:0%
that's fine but they ought to do it the
 
02:44:36.590 --> 02:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
right way you have a bill you bring it
 
02:44:38.389 --> 02:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
to a policy committee the policy
 
02:44:40.309 --> 02:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
committee debates it
 
02:44:42.349 --> 02:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
um there are procedures there are
 
02:44:44.170 --> 02:44:44.180 align:start position:0%
processes and we go through it that way
 
02:44:48.410 --> 02:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
I think representative that that covers
 
02:44:51.410 --> 02:44:51.420 align:start position:0%
all the components but if you know of
 
02:44:53.270 --> 02:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
something else that I haven't mentioned
 
02:44:55.190 --> 02:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
I hope you'll remind me
 
02:44:58.790 --> 02:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
I most certainly will thank you other
 
02:45:01.670 --> 02:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
questions for this week yes
 
02:45:03.950 --> 02:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry oh yes I'm sorry
 
02:45:06.530 --> 02:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
representative Andrews
 
02:45:10.190 --> 02:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair uh just one
 
02:45:10.200 --> 02:45:11.870 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair uh just one
question

02:45:11.870 --> 02:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:45:15.770 --> 02:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
has any parts of this bill have been
 
02:45:19.550 --> 02:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:22.130 --> 02:45:22.140 align:start position:0%
any parts of this bill been challenged
 
02:45:24.230 --> 02:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
in court
 
02:45:24.240 --> 02:45:27.050 align:start position:0%
in court
um

02:45:27.050 --> 02:45:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:29.270 --> 02:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
I'm drawing a blank right now
 
02:45:31.490 --> 02:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
representative and I hope that you could
 
02:45:34.969 --> 02:45:34.979 align:start position:0%
ask that question of people who have
 
02:45:38.770 --> 02:45:38.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:42.469 --> 02:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
02:45:46.730 --> 02:45:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:48.950 --> 02:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
well I'm sorry
 
02:45:50.450 --> 02:45:50.460 align:start position:0%
representative Paris had a question
 
02:45:54.170 --> 02:45:54.180 align:start position:0%
representative Perez yes please
 
02:45:56.929 --> 02:45:56.939 align:start position:0%
you use the term vigilante
 
02:45:59.270 --> 02:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
um with doctors so
 
02:46:02.750 --> 02:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
under this bill
 
02:46:05.090 --> 02:46:05.100 align:start position:0%
you may then later you mentioned that
 
02:46:08.750 --> 02:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
doctors could refuse to perform these
 
02:46:08.760 --> 02:46:10.429 align:start position:0%
doctors could refuse to perform these
abortions

02:46:10.429 --> 02:46:10.439 align:start position:0%
abortions
 
02:46:10.439 --> 02:46:11.510 align:start position:0%
abortions
um

02:46:11.510 --> 02:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:13.910 --> 02:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
I'm confused by that what would these
 
02:46:18.050 --> 02:46:18.060 align:start position:0%
Vigilantes be doing to to these doctors
 
02:46:20.570 --> 02:46:20.580 align:start position:0%
would it be if they did not perform the
 
02:46:23.750 --> 02:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
abortion or if there was
 
02:46:25.429 --> 02:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
um some type of
 
02:46:27.830 --> 02:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
something that happened at the abortion
 
02:46:32.270 --> 02:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
or if they uh performed an abortion at
 
02:46:35.510 --> 02:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
30 weeks I don't understand where the
 
02:46:38.210 --> 02:46:38.220 align:start position:0%
doctors would be prosecuted thank you
 
02:46:40.010 --> 02:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:46:42.950 --> 02:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
um for asking the question you know we
 
02:46:44.809 --> 02:46:44.819 align:start position:0%
always say that and we don't necessarily
 
02:46:46.670 --> 02:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
mean it but we always say thank you for
 
02:46:48.650 --> 02:46:48.660 align:start position:0%
asking the question
 
02:46:50.330 --> 02:46:50.340 align:start position:0%
um sometimes we just assume you didn't
 
02:46:52.010 --> 02:46:52.020 align:start position:0%
ask the question but it's a fine
 
02:46:54.770 --> 02:46:54.780 align:start position:0%
question I don't believe I ever said
 
02:46:58.790 --> 02:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
anything about a doctor refusing
 
02:47:02.750 --> 02:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
to perform an abortion what I did
 
02:47:05.690 --> 02:47:05.700 align:start position:0%
indicate that is under current Medical
 
02:47:08.530 --> 02:47:08.540 align:start position:0%
Practice in this state
 
02:47:12.170 --> 02:47:12.180 align:start position:0%
doctors who have special who specialize
 
02:47:15.010 --> 02:47:15.020 align:start position:0%
in certain areas in including by the way
 
02:47:18.530 --> 02:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
Obstetrics and Gynecology
 
02:47:22.210 --> 02:47:22.220 align:start position:0%
um uh do not
 
02:47:25.130 --> 02:47:25.140 align:start position:0%
necessarily have the equipment or the
 
02:47:30.250 --> 02:47:30.260 align:start position:0%
experience to do the very very rare Act
 
02:47:34.610 --> 02:47:34.620 align:start position:0%
of performing an abortion later in
 
02:47:37.250 --> 02:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
pregnancy so it's not a question of
 
02:47:39.910 --> 02:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
refusing it's a question of a doctor
 
02:47:42.770 --> 02:47:42.780 align:start position:0%
understanding exactly what his or her
 
02:47:45.770 --> 02:47:45.780 align:start position:0%
training has prepared him or her to do
 
02:47:49.070 --> 02:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
and making sure that anyone who is going
 
02:47:52.429 --> 02:47:52.439 align:start position:0%
to perform a medical procedure has the
 
02:47:55.309 --> 02:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
necessary training and experience that
 
02:47:57.110 --> 02:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
can happen for example in a state like
 
02:47:58.910 --> 02:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts we're at the large
 
02:47:58.920 --> 02:48:00.309 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts we're at the large
hospitals

02:48:00.309 --> 02:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
02:48:03.770 --> 02:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
pregnancies that are have gone on and
 
02:48:06.410 --> 02:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
are running into terrible trouble that's
 
02:48:09.469 --> 02:48:09.479 align:start position:0%
where people go in terms of my use of
 
02:48:12.950 --> 02:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
the word vigilante it was right for you
 
02:48:15.770 --> 02:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
to pick up on that word it's not a
 
02:48:17.870 --> 02:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
polite word and it's not a word that I
 
02:48:20.929 --> 02:48:20.939 align:start position:0%
would ordinarily use but I'm using it in
 
02:48:24.530 --> 02:48:24.540 align:start position:0%
this sense because it is someone who is
 
02:48:24.540 --> 02:48:26.270 align:start position:0%
this sense because it is someone who is
not

02:48:26.270 --> 02:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:48:29.090 --> 02:48:29.100 align:start position:0%
directly involved in the situation in
 
02:48:31.210 --> 02:48:31.220 align:start position:0%
other words not that the pregnant person
 
02:48:34.070 --> 02:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
not anyone else the pregnant person
 
02:48:36.349 --> 02:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
chooses to involve whether it's a
 
02:48:39.950 --> 02:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
partner or a parent or a religious
 
02:48:41.630 --> 02:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
02:48:41.640 --> 02:48:43.210 align:start position:0%
um uh
consultant

02:48:43.210 --> 02:48:43.220 align:start position:0%
consultant
 
02:48:46.670 --> 02:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
and of course the doctor but someone who
 
02:48:50.870 --> 02:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
was not involved who chooses to come in
 
02:48:53.150 --> 02:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
and determine
 
02:48:56.530 --> 02:48:56.540 align:start position:0%
that what had happened was not
 
02:49:00.170 --> 02:49:00.180 align:start position:0%
appropriate and it is that person who in
 
02:49:02.210 --> 02:49:02.220 align:start position:0%
the section the relevant section in
 
02:49:06.230 --> 02:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 is given this Authority and
 
02:49:08.630 --> 02:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
um I think that although the word is not
 
02:49:11.990 --> 02:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
a polite word the closest uh parallel
 
02:49:15.590 --> 02:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
that I could come up with is vigilante
 
02:49:20.889 --> 02:49:20.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:23.330 --> 02:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:49:25.849 --> 02:49:25.859 align:start position:0%
the the current law
 
02:49:27.710 --> 02:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
says that there are no restrictions
 
02:49:29.990 --> 02:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
whatsoever on abortions for the first 24
 
02:49:32.750 --> 02:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
weeks and then a woman May obtain an
 
02:49:35.510 --> 02:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
abortion after 24 weeks under certain
 
02:49:38.330 --> 02:49:38.340 align:start position:0%
conditions rape incest fatal fetal
 
02:49:41.929 --> 02:49:41.939 align:start position:0%
anomalies and health of the woman
 
02:49:44.270 --> 02:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
there are no Provisions in the law to
 
02:49:46.429 --> 02:49:46.439 align:start position:0%
even determine whether or not the baby's
 
02:49:49.670 --> 02:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
at 24 weeks or as by your own statement
 
02:49:52.910 --> 02:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
that the the ultrasound provision has
 
02:49:54.230 --> 02:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
been stripped out so that is actually
 
02:49:55.610 --> 02:49:55.620 align:start position:0%
not part of the law so there's no
 
02:49:57.830 --> 02:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
Provisions at all regarding that so
 
02:49:59.270 --> 02:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
given that
 
02:50:01.849 --> 02:50:01.859 align:start position:0%
is it not true that abortions performed
 
02:50:04.790 --> 02:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
after the first trimester are in fact of
 
02:50:07.010 --> 02:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
significantly greater risk to the woman
 
02:50:09.410 --> 02:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
herself so this fetal Life protection
 
02:50:11.870 --> 02:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
act is actually also a pregnant woman's
 
02:50:14.510 --> 02:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
Life protection act
 
02:50:16.969 --> 02:50:16.979 align:start position:0%
um well first of all representative
 
02:50:19.910 --> 02:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
um as I say I don't have uh the full
 
02:50:23.270 --> 02:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
text in front of me but I beg to differ
 
02:50:26.690 --> 02:50:26.700 align:start position:0%
with you I don't think that all of the
 
02:50:29.450 --> 02:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
exceptions that you noted are in fact in
 
02:50:32.510 --> 02:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
that legislation I could be wrong and
 
02:50:34.849 --> 02:50:34.859 align:start position:0%
therefore I ask you to let someone who
 
02:50:38.270 --> 02:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
follows me who has direct access to that
 
02:50:42.349 --> 02:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
text to um to say what's accurate
 
02:50:46.130 --> 02:50:46.140 align:start position:0%
um I have no problem at all claiming
 
02:50:49.190 --> 02:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
um a vagueness in that second
 
02:50:51.830 --> 02:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
um I my point in all of this with all
 
02:50:55.190 --> 02:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
due respect is that I don't think that
 
02:50:55.200 --> 02:50:56.950 align:start position:0%
due respect is that I don't think that
you

02:50:56.950 --> 02:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:50:59.270 --> 02:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
or I
 
02:51:02.389 --> 02:51:02.399 align:start position:0%
whether as a man or as a woman as
 
02:51:05.210 --> 02:51:05.220 align:start position:0%
someone who is pro-choice or whatever
 
02:51:07.730 --> 02:51:07.740 align:start position:0%
that means and I don't think any of us
 
02:51:11.270 --> 02:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
have the right to decide for someone
 
02:51:11.280 --> 02:51:12.410 align:start position:0%
have the right to decide for someone
else

02:51:12.410 --> 02:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
else
 
02:51:14.450 --> 02:51:14.460 align:start position:0%
how to control
 
02:51:18.590 --> 02:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
their own lives I don't need
 
02:51:22.610 --> 02:51:22.620 align:start position:0%
the government to decide that the way to
 
02:51:24.650 --> 02:51:24.660 align:start position:0%
protect a woman
 
02:51:26.570 --> 02:51:26.580 align:start position:0%
who is
 
02:51:28.849 --> 02:51:28.859 align:start position:0%
um who has the possibility of getting
 
02:51:28.859 --> 02:51:30.650 align:start position:0%
um who has the possibility of getting
pregnant

02:51:30.650 --> 02:51:30.660 align:start position:0%
pregnant
 
02:51:33.469 --> 02:51:33.479 align:start position:0%
um should be determined
 
02:51:36.410 --> 02:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
by the government I think that the woman
 
02:51:38.210 --> 02:51:38.220 align:start position:0%
should know
 
02:51:41.270 --> 02:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
and I say woman and we understand that
 
02:51:44.270 --> 02:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
as we come to better understand gender
 
02:51:47.389 --> 02:51:47.399 align:start position:0%
and sex issues that might not be the
 
02:51:50.750 --> 02:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
exactly right word but you know I've
 
02:51:52.670 --> 02:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
been using that word for a long time so
 
02:51:54.889 --> 02:51:54.899 align:start position:0%
it's hard to change
 
02:51:54.899 --> 02:51:56.349 align:start position:0%
it's hard to change
um

02:51:56.349 --> 02:51:56.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:59.870 --> 02:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
the government has no right
 
02:52:03.110 --> 02:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
to be making this determination I think
 
02:52:04.630 --> 02:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
at the moment
 
02:52:07.969 --> 02:52:07.979 align:start position:0%
that a pregnancy has developed to the
 
02:52:11.510 --> 02:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
stage where in fact
 
02:52:11.520 --> 02:52:12.230 align:start position:0%
stage where in fact
um

02:52:12.230 --> 02:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:16.429 --> 02:52:16.439 align:start position:0%
the embryo the fetus has left the
 
02:52:18.830 --> 02:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
woman's body
 
02:52:22.490 --> 02:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
um and is able to function
 
02:52:27.370 --> 02:52:27.380 align:start position:0%
on its own outside of the woman's body
 
02:52:31.730 --> 02:52:31.740 align:start position:0%
at that point the state I believe has an
 
02:52:34.190 --> 02:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
interest and I would hope they would do
 
02:52:36.849 --> 02:52:36.859 align:start position:0%
what happens in almost every other
 
02:52:38.929 --> 02:52:38.939 align:start position:0%
industrialized State and some states
 
02:52:41.510 --> 02:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
that aren't that the state has a program
 
02:52:44.690 --> 02:52:44.700 align:start position:0%
to for example have people immediately
 
02:52:46.910 --> 02:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
go to the home and say how are you doing
 
02:52:49.490 --> 02:52:49.500 align:start position:0%
can we help you do you need some help
 
02:52:53.750 --> 02:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
with uh without a nurse uh do you need
 
02:52:55.910 --> 02:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
you know oh I see the toddlers wandering
 
02:52:57.710 --> 02:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
around could I prepare peanut butter and
 
02:52:59.389 --> 02:52:59.399 align:start position:0%
jelly sandwich for them all of those
 
02:53:01.550 --> 02:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
kinds of supports are a way for the
 
02:53:04.490 --> 02:53:04.500 align:start position:0%
state to send a message to a family
 
02:53:07.130 --> 02:53:07.140 align:start position:0%
where there's a newborn that the state
 
02:53:10.490 --> 02:53:10.500 align:start position:0%
cares the public cares about you and
 
02:53:11.870 --> 02:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
your family and we're going to do
 
02:53:14.210 --> 02:53:14.220 align:start position:0%
everything that we can to help that's at
 
02:53:15.230 --> 02:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
the point
 
02:53:18.969 --> 02:53:18.979 align:start position:0%
that the fetus is independent physically
 
02:53:24.349 --> 02:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
of of the pregnant person and up until
 
02:53:27.290 --> 02:53:27.300 align:start position:0%
then when the fetus cannot survive on
 
02:53:28.969 --> 02:53:28.979 align:start position:0%
its own
 
02:53:31.429 --> 02:53:31.439 align:start position:0%
it is to me
 
02:53:34.790 --> 02:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
not yet in a state where the government
 
02:53:36.710 --> 02:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
has an interest
 
02:53:40.429 --> 02:53:40.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:42.650 --> 02:53:42.660 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
02:53:45.170 --> 02:53:45.180 align:start position:0%
you for your courtesy
 
02:53:47.450 --> 02:53:47.460 align:start position:0%
um next I'm going to call on former
 
02:53:54.410 --> 02:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:56.809 --> 02:53:56.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
02:53:59.929 --> 02:53:59.939 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Tom
 
02:54:03.530 --> 02:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
Sherman I am from Rye New Hampshire I'm
 
02:54:05.210 --> 02:54:05.220 align:start position:0%
representing myself
 
02:54:09.050 --> 02:54:09.060 align:start position:0%
I'm a former State Rep state senator and
 
02:54:13.309 --> 02:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:16.070 --> 02:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
as a practicing physician and a New
 
02:54:18.410 --> 02:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state senator I spoke against
 
02:54:21.290 --> 02:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
and voted against the first abortion ban
 
02:54:24.230 --> 02:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
in this in our state's modern history
 
02:54:26.090 --> 02:54:26.100 align:start position:0%
which circumvented the standard
 
02:54:28.730 --> 02:54:28.740 align:start position:0%
legislative route for passage of policy
 
02:54:30.650 --> 02:54:30.660 align:start position:0%
by being attached to the last budget
 
02:54:34.370 --> 02:54:34.380 align:start position:0%
Bill signed into law by governor sununu
 
02:54:37.730 --> 02:54:37.740 align:start position:0%
today I'm speaking in support of HP 271
 
02:54:40.429 --> 02:54:40.439 align:start position:0%
which would repeal that ban
 
02:54:43.790 --> 02:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
the abortion ban from its outset was a
 
02:54:45.950 --> 02:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
solution in search of a problem
 
02:54:48.290 --> 02:54:48.300 align:start position:0%
that actually put the health of both the
 
02:54:50.570 --> 02:54:50.580 align:start position:0%
pregnant woman and the fetus at
 
02:54:52.790 --> 02:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
increased risk
 
02:54:55.070 --> 02:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
elective abortions
 
02:54:59.030 --> 02:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
are not performed in New Hampshire
 
02:55:01.370 --> 02:55:01.380 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry elected late term abortions
 
02:55:03.650 --> 02:55:03.660 align:start position:0%

02:55:09.469 --> 02:55:09.479 align:start position:0%
on the other hand there was ample
 
02:55:12.110 --> 02:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
testimony raising concerns about the
 
02:55:14.870 --> 02:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
ability of the medical community to
 
02:55:16.730 --> 02:55:16.740 align:start position:0%
respond to situations in the third
 
02:55:19.730 --> 02:55:19.740 align:start position:0%

02:55:23.690 --> 02:55:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:27.010 --> 02:55:27.020 align:start position:0%
for which there were no appropriate
 
02:55:29.809 --> 02:55:29.819 align:start position:0%
exceptions in that bill
 
02:55:32.150 --> 02:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
which increased the risk for both the
 
02:55:34.370 --> 02:55:34.380 align:start position:0%
mother and the fetus
 
02:55:37.969 --> 02:55:37.979 align:start position:0%

as a doctor I recognize that this delay

02:59:23.570 --> 02:59:23.580 align:start position:0%
both in the individual clinical
 
02:59:26.750 --> 02:59:26.760 align:start position:0%
situations and also
 
02:59:29.389 --> 02:59:29.399 align:start position:0%
in order to assure ensure the viability
 
02:59:31.849 --> 02:59:31.859 align:start position:0%
of our maternal fetal medicine programs
 
02:59:34.190 --> 02:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
02:59:35.809 --> 02:59:35.819 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:59:38.690 --> 02:59:38.700 align:start position:0%
that was run through the budget
 
02:59:41.269 --> 02:59:41.279 align:start position:0%
was a mistake
 
02:59:45.530 --> 02:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
we keep spending your valuable time
 
02:59:48.650 --> 02:59:48.660 align:start position:0%
trying to repair the damage correct the
 
02:59:48.660 --> 02:59:50.030 align:start position:0%
trying to repair the damage correct the
mistakes

02:59:50.030 --> 02:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
mistakes
 
02:59:53.210 --> 02:59:53.220 align:start position:0%
and oddly enough in a bill that was
 
02:59:54.590 --> 02:59:54.600 align:start position:0%
brought forward
 
02:59:59.450 --> 02:59:59.460 align:start position:0%
to protect the life of the fetus
 
03:00:02.870 --> 03:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
to actually turn around and change that
 
03:00:06.170 --> 03:00:06.180 align:start position:0%
bill over and over again
 
03:00:08.870 --> 03:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
to protect the life of the mother and
 
03:00:11.570 --> 03:00:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:16.309 --> 03:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
that bill that ban needs to be repealed
 
03:00:19.070 --> 03:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
and as representative Smith said
 
03:00:22.010 --> 03:00:22.020 align:start position:0%
you need to start over
 
03:00:24.429 --> 03:00:24.439 align:start position:0%
if you believe there should be a ban
 
03:00:28.550 --> 03:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
make it one that does not threaten
 
03:00:31.730 --> 03:00:31.740 align:start position:0%
the lives of pregnant women
 
03:00:35.570 --> 03:00:35.580 align:start position:0%
the lives of their fetuses
 
03:00:39.130 --> 03:00:39.140 align:start position:0%
and the viability of some of the top
 
03:00:42.710 --> 03:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
programs in Maternal Fetal Medicine in
 
03:00:44.870 --> 03:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
the country thank you I'm happy to take
 
03:00:49.790 --> 03:00:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:56.269 --> 03:00:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:56.279 --> 03:00:57.290 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:00:57.290 --> 03:00:57.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:59.450 --> 03:00:59.460 align:start position:0%
the way the law is written in New
 
03:01:01.730 --> 03:01:01.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would this be an accurate
 
03:01:03.830 --> 03:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
assessment I'm not sure if it is or not
 
03:01:06.050 --> 03:01:06.060 align:start position:0%
and maybe you can answer this maybe you
 
03:01:06.060 --> 03:01:07.309 align:start position:0%
and maybe you can answer this maybe you
can't

03:01:07.309 --> 03:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
can't
 
03:01:12.050 --> 03:01:12.060 align:start position:0%
um if say after 24 weeks I as a pregnant
 
03:01:12.060 --> 03:01:13.429 align:start position:0%
um if say after 24 weeks I as a pregnant
woman

03:01:13.429 --> 03:01:13.439 align:start position:0%
woman
 
03:01:15.230 --> 03:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
um went to another state
 
03:01:17.990 --> 03:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
that would take care of the abortion say
 
03:01:21.230 --> 03:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
it was in a case of an in vitro like
 
03:01:22.670 --> 03:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
there was multiple births and you had to
 
03:01:24.410 --> 03:01:24.420 align:start position:0%
downsize and there wasn't the ability to
 
03:01:26.450 --> 03:01:26.460 align:start position:0%
do it here in this state I went to the
 
03:01:28.730 --> 03:01:28.740 align:start position:0%
other state had the downsize of the one
 
03:01:30.530 --> 03:01:30.540 align:start position:0%
child came back that was life
 
03:01:33.290 --> 03:01:33.300 align:start position:0%
threatening to the other baby or myself
 
03:01:38.210 --> 03:01:38.220 align:start position:0%
if I came back to this state would I be
 
03:01:43.550 --> 03:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:45.170 --> 03:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
having that
 
03:01:45.180 --> 03:01:47.210 align:start position:0%
having that
baby

03:01:47.210 --> 03:01:47.220 align:start position:0%
baby
 
03:01:51.530 --> 03:01:51.540 align:start position:0%
taken so if if I have the question if
 
03:01:55.130 --> 03:01:55.140 align:start position:0%
you were facing for example a threat to
 
03:01:57.889 --> 03:01:57.899 align:start position:0%
your health yes not your life yet so
 
03:02:00.469 --> 03:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
something like preeclampsia in the third
 
03:02:00.479 --> 03:02:02.030 align:start position:0%
something like preeclampsia in the third
trimester

03:02:02.030 --> 03:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
trimester
 
03:02:05.750 --> 03:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
and you know that that could get worse
 
03:02:08.870 --> 03:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
and that it's progressing but the
 
03:02:12.170 --> 03:02:12.180 align:start position:0%
attorneys at your hospital along with
 
03:02:14.450 --> 03:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
the team of doctors can't definitively
 
03:02:17.510 --> 03:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
say that it is life-threatening which is
 
03:02:19.969 --> 03:02:19.979 align:start position:0%
the exception in New Hampshire if you go
 
03:02:22.849 --> 03:02:22.859 align:start position:0%
to another state to get the care that
 
03:02:25.610 --> 03:02:25.620 align:start position:0%
you believe you need
 
03:02:28.969 --> 03:02:28.979 align:start position:0%
um I think that's I I actually don't
 
03:02:30.830 --> 03:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
know if you could be prosecuted if you
 
03:02:33.710 --> 03:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
came back into the state but
 
03:02:36.950 --> 03:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
since the physician who performed that
 
03:02:39.530 --> 03:02:39.540 align:start position:0%
or the provider of Reform that is out of
 
03:02:39.540 --> 03:02:40.670 align:start position:0%
or the provider of Reform that is out of
state

03:02:40.670 --> 03:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:02:43.790 --> 03:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
then they could not be prosecuted and
 
03:02:48.050 --> 03:02:48.060 align:start position:0%
that I know of uh in other words the
 
03:02:50.750 --> 03:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
bill the law that's there now actually
 
03:02:53.690 --> 03:02:53.700 align:start position:0%
the the felony conviction is of the
 
03:02:53.700 --> 03:02:56.570 align:start position:0%
the the felony conviction is of the
provider

03:02:56.570 --> 03:02:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:00.769 --> 03:03:00.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:02.990 --> 03:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
yes representative Andrews
 
03:03:05.150 --> 03:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
03:03:07.969 --> 03:03:07.979 align:start position:0%
chairman for taking my question do you
 
03:03:11.090 --> 03:03:11.100 align:start position:0%
know if the current abortion law
 
03:03:14.510 --> 03:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
has been or is currently challenged in
 
03:03:16.670 --> 03:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
any Court
 
03:03:18.590 --> 03:03:18.600 align:start position:0%
I don't know of any
 
03:03:18.600 --> 03:03:20.750 align:start position:0%
I don't know of any
challenge

03:03:20.750 --> 03:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
03:03:23.570 --> 03:03:23.580 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
03:03:25.809 --> 03:03:25.819 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much sir oh
 
03:03:28.389 --> 03:03:28.399 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
03:03:31.790 --> 03:03:31.800 align:start position:0%
representative Perez sorry
 
03:03:33.889 --> 03:03:33.899 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:03:36.769 --> 03:03:36.779 align:start position:0%
um what is your practice
 
03:03:39.410 --> 03:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
I'm your favorite kind of doctor so I
 
03:03:40.969 --> 03:03:40.979 align:start position:0%
hope you all are up to date on your
 
03:03:44.150 --> 03:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
colonoscopies I'm a gastroenterologist
 
03:03:46.550 --> 03:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
it's good for your health I I have
 
03:03:50.330 --> 03:03:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:53.030 --> 03:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
so if we repeal this law we would go
 
03:03:55.070 --> 03:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
back to NOLA
 
03:03:59.170 --> 03:03:59.180 align:start position:0%
correct and that would mean that anyone
 
03:04:02.150 --> 03:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire could have
 
03:04:06.530 --> 03:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
an abortion at any time with no for any
 
03:04:10.070 --> 03:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
reason with no limitation
 
03:04:13.250 --> 03:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
um up to birth
 
03:04:16.190 --> 03:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:04:19.490 --> 03:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
do you not see
 
03:04:24.530 --> 03:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
the concern about the life of the mother
 
03:04:26.330 --> 03:04:26.340 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
03:04:29.330 --> 03:04:29.340 align:start position:0%
I have I was worked in recovery room and
 
03:04:33.410 --> 03:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
I actually took care of others
 
03:04:33.420 --> 03:04:34.010 align:start position:0%
I actually took care of others
um

03:04:34.010 --> 03:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:36.290 --> 03:04:36.300 align:start position:0%
in late term abortions it was very
 
03:04:38.269 --> 03:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
similar and I'm not saying it's the same
 
03:04:42.010 --> 03:04:42.020 align:start position:0%
but very similar to post C-section care
 
03:04:46.550 --> 03:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
and delivery and I just
 
03:04:49.309 --> 03:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
did you feel that going back to no law
 
03:04:52.070 --> 03:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
is the way to protect women here in New
 
03:04:52.080 --> 03:04:53.690 align:start position:0%
is the way to protect women here in New
Hampshire

03:04:53.690 --> 03:04:53.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:04:57.190 --> 03:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
well first of all that's not what I said
 
03:05:01.490 --> 03:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
uh what Young so
 
03:05:04.130 --> 03:05:04.140 align:start position:0%
we have lived with the protections of
 
03:05:07.969 --> 03:05:07.979 align:start position:0%
Roe versus Wade since the early 1970s
 
03:05:11.690 --> 03:05:11.700 align:start position:0%
prior to that if you talk to
 
03:05:11.700 --> 03:05:12.590 align:start position:0%
prior to that if you talk to
um

03:05:12.590 --> 03:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:15.830 --> 03:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
some of the OB gyns who are still around
 
03:05:18.410 --> 03:05:18.420 align:start position:0%
from prior to that they saw the
 
03:05:21.469 --> 03:05:21.479 align:start position:0%
complications of illegal abortions
 
03:05:24.590 --> 03:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh many of which the women died of
 
03:05:28.250 --> 03:05:28.260 align:start position:0%
sepsis they died of hemorrhage
 
03:05:28.260 --> 03:05:30.110 align:start position:0%
sepsis they died of hemorrhage
um

03:05:30.110 --> 03:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:33.230 --> 03:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
but what we've seen since the early 70s
 
03:05:35.929 --> 03:05:35.939 align:start position:0%
is we don't see what you've described in
 
03:05:37.910 --> 03:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire
 
03:05:41.030 --> 03:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
it's not something it's not a thing
 
03:05:44.030 --> 03:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
there are not providers in the state of
 
03:05:46.250 --> 03:05:46.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire licensed by the Board of
 
03:05:49.550 --> 03:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
Medicine who perform elective late-term
 
03:05:52.010 --> 03:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
abortions I said that early in my
 
03:05:52.020 --> 03:05:53.150 align:start position:0%
abortions I said that early in my
testimony

03:05:53.150 --> 03:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
03:05:55.490 --> 03:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure where you were
 
03:05:58.670 --> 03:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
practicing but in New Hampshire
 
03:06:01.429 --> 03:06:01.439 align:start position:0%
it is such a high risk procedure it
 
03:06:03.790 --> 03:06:03.800 align:start position:0%
would be like me going and doing routine
 
03:06:07.610 --> 03:06:07.620 align:start position:0%
colonoscopies on 90 plus year olds we
 
03:06:11.030 --> 03:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
don't do that it's not a thing
 
03:06:13.190 --> 03:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
so so that's
 
03:06:17.389 --> 03:06:17.399 align:start position:0%
that is we have lived without an
 
03:06:19.429 --> 03:06:19.439 align:start position:0%
abortion ban in the Live Free or Die
 
03:06:19.439 --> 03:06:20.630 align:start position:0%
abortion ban in the Live Free or Die
state

03:06:20.630 --> 03:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:06:24.710 --> 03:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
for decades and we have not seen what
 
03:06:27.889 --> 03:06:27.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:31.730 --> 03:06:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:33.889 --> 03:06:33.899 align:start position:0%
I was saying when the I should have said
 
03:06:36.469 --> 03:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
when the life of the mother was
 
03:06:37.790 --> 03:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
um in jeopardy
 
03:06:41.030 --> 03:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
and it was here in New Hampshire and my
 
03:06:44.210 --> 03:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
question to you is where did without any
 
03:06:44.220 --> 03:06:45.830 align:start position:0%
question to you is where did without any
law

03:06:45.830 --> 03:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:06:49.010 --> 03:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
where did late term where did mothers
 
03:06:51.889 --> 03:06:51.899 align:start position:0%
who wanted late-term abortions go to
 
03:06:54.349 --> 03:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
have their abortions if you said they
 
03:06:55.610 --> 03:06:55.620 align:start position:0%
are not
 
03:06:58.490 --> 03:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
they were not being done here in New
 
03:07:02.030 --> 03:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or were they done illegally my
 
03:07:03.950 --> 03:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
concern is if we eliminate this
 
03:07:07.670 --> 03:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
completely are we going back to yeah
 
03:07:10.429 --> 03:07:10.439 align:start position:0%
kitchen table abortions for people who
 
03:07:12.469 --> 03:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
want them no we're actually going back
 
03:07:15.110 --> 03:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
to the way we were two years ago
 
03:07:18.590 --> 03:07:18.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire before January 1st 2022
 
03:07:21.530 --> 03:07:21.540 align:start position:0%
for the last 30 years that's where we're
 
03:07:23.690 --> 03:07:23.700 align:start position:0%
maybe 40 years I can't do the higher
 
03:07:23.700 --> 03:07:24.650 align:start position:0%
maybe 40 years I can't do the higher
math

03:07:24.650 --> 03:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
math
 
03:07:26.870 --> 03:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
that's where we're going
 
03:07:28.790 --> 03:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
doctors in New Hampshire don't perform
 
03:07:32.690 --> 03:07:32.700 align:start position:0%
elective late-term abortions they do
 
03:07:35.389 --> 03:07:35.399 align:start position:0%
very rarely
 
03:07:39.170 --> 03:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
do the necessary and appropriate medical
 
03:07:42.050 --> 03:07:42.060 align:start position:0%
procedure to save the life or to
 
03:07:43.969 --> 03:07:43.979 align:start position:0%
preserve the health of the mother
 
03:07:46.670 --> 03:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
that's where we were before January 1st
 
03:07:46.680 --> 03:07:48.769 align:start position:0%
that's where we were before January 1st
2022

03:07:48.769 --> 03:07:48.779 align:start position:0%
2022
 
03:07:51.370 --> 03:07:51.380 align:start position:0%
and if they wanted an elective abortion
 
03:07:53.870 --> 03:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that there are only
 
03:07:56.450 --> 03:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
a few places in the entire country and
 
03:07:58.550 --> 03:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
there are none in New Hampshire where
 
03:08:00.110 --> 03:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
you can go for an elected third
 
03:08:04.790 --> 03:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:07.250 --> 03:08:07.260 align:start position:0%
which Stapleton
 
03:08:10.070 --> 03:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
my question is that
 
03:08:12.710 --> 03:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
do we have any statistics
 
03:08:12.720 --> 03:08:14.230 align:start position:0%
do we have any statistics
that

03:08:14.230 --> 03:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:08:17.990 --> 03:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
indicate whether this bill has resulted
 
03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:22.010 align:start position:0%
indicate whether this bill has resulted
in

03:08:22.010 --> 03:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:22.020 --> 03:08:23.750 align:start position:0%
 
a

03:08:23.750 --> 03:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:08:26.510 --> 03:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
positions being deterred
 
03:08:29.269 --> 03:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
or otherwise attracted to New Hampshire
 
03:08:34.190 --> 03:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:37.670 --> 03:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:42.349 --> 03:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
a question or response as a physician
 
03:08:45.650 --> 03:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
so maybe it's a little rhetorical
 
03:08:49.309 --> 03:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
if I had a choice of going to Vermont
 
03:08:53.030 --> 03:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
to practice Gastroenterology
 
03:08:55.670 --> 03:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
and I could do it freely
 
03:08:57.769 --> 03:08:57.779 align:start position:0%
using standard of practice and the Board
 
03:09:02.210 --> 03:09:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:02.220 --> 03:09:04.130 align:start position:0%
 
or

03:09:04.130 --> 03:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:09:07.370 --> 03:09:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:10.910 --> 03:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
where doing everything appropriate in
 
03:09:13.370 --> 03:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
the practice of my medicine I could end
 
03:09:14.630 --> 03:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
up with a
 
03:09:17.210 --> 03:09:17.220 align:start position:0%
jail term of seven years
 
03:09:20.210 --> 03:09:20.220 align:start position:0%
and a hundred thousand dollar fine loss
 
03:09:21.530 --> 03:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
of my career
 
03:09:23.330 --> 03:09:23.340 align:start position:0%
and all the other things that go along
 
03:09:25.730 --> 03:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
with not even just a felony conviction
 
03:09:28.429 --> 03:09:28.439 align:start position:0%
but a felony charge
 
03:09:32.630 --> 03:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:35.150 --> 03:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
they have three providers right now
 
03:09:37.370 --> 03:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
approaching retirement in the seven
 
03:09:37.380 --> 03:09:39.230 align:start position:0%
approaching retirement in the seven
physician

03:09:39.230 --> 03:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
physician
 
03:09:41.389 --> 03:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
maternal fetal medicine program at
 
03:09:44.809 --> 03:09:44.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:47.630 --> 03:09:47.640 align:start position:0%
I would never
 
03:09:49.309 --> 03:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire
 
03:09:52.610 --> 03:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
under the threat that this ban presents
 
03:09:55.790 --> 03:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
that's my own personal opinion as a
 
03:09:55.800 --> 03:09:56.750 align:start position:0%
that's my own personal opinion as a
physician

03:09:56.750 --> 03:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
physician
 
03:10:00.050 --> 03:10:00.060 align:start position:0%
I I thank you for relating that uh but
 
03:10:03.050 --> 03:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
my question was do we have statistics
 
03:10:07.130 --> 03:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
that show that this bill has resulted in
 
03:10:10.370 --> 03:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
Physicians being deterred from coming to
 
03:10:12.650 --> 03:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to practice I guess the
 
03:10:15.650 --> 03:10:15.660 align:start position:0%
answer I don't know of any felony
 
03:10:19.190 --> 03:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
charges haven't been brought yet
 
03:10:22.429 --> 03:10:22.439 align:start position:0%
but I can guarantee you that the threat
 
03:10:24.950 --> 03:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
alone which is supposed to be a
 
03:10:27.530 --> 03:10:27.540 align:start position:0%
deterrent right it's not just a
 
03:10:29.950 --> 03:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
deterrent for doing
 
03:10:33.769 --> 03:10:33.779 align:start position:0%
inappropriate Medical Care in the third
 
03:10:35.650 --> 03:10:35.660 align:start position:0%
trimester it's a deterrent for doing
 
03:10:38.150 --> 03:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate Medical Care
 
03:10:40.969 --> 03:10:40.979 align:start position:0%
and it's a deterrent from any of us
 
03:10:43.010 --> 03:10:43.020 align:start position:0%
thinking about New Hampshire as a good
 
03:10:47.870 --> 03:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:51.410 --> 03:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
I believe you had a question
 
03:10:53.750 --> 03:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
oh yeah thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:10:55.670 --> 03:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
you Dr Sherman you bet
 
03:10:58.250 --> 03:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
uh I guess my question is in the absence
 
03:10:59.750 --> 03:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
of this
 
03:11:02.150 --> 03:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
um and and across Medical Care in
 
03:11:04.670 --> 03:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
general as a physician
 
03:11:07.610 --> 03:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
um the conduct of providers is governed
 
03:11:10.070 --> 03:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
by a range of other
 
03:11:13.490 --> 03:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
um structures uh from the hypocratic
 
03:11:16.730 --> 03:11:16.740 align:start position:0%
oath from the get from the beginning to
 
03:11:16.740 --> 03:11:17.269 align:start position:0%
oath from the get from the beginning to
um

03:11:17.269 --> 03:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:19.190 --> 03:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
standards of care in the various
 
03:11:22.309 --> 03:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
professions and and then also within
 
03:11:24.290 --> 03:11:24.300 align:start position:0%
each organization and maybe beyond the
 
03:11:27.230 --> 03:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
medical ethics boards that I presume
 
03:11:29.389 --> 03:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
would potentially have an interest in in
 
03:11:30.889 --> 03:11:30.899 align:start position:0%
a case like this if it were to be
 
03:11:32.690 --> 03:11:32.700 align:start position:0%
presented could you say a little bit
 
03:11:36.230 --> 03:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
more about how they uh these parameters
 
03:11:39.050 --> 03:11:39.060 align:start position:0%
sort of work and have worked in the past
 
03:11:39.060 --> 03:11:40.190 align:start position:0%
sort of work and have worked in the past
and

03:11:40.190 --> 03:11:40.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:11:43.190 --> 03:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
um and I guess uh well let me leave it
 
03:11:46.250 --> 03:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
there actually so
 
03:11:49.070 --> 03:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
um I've practiced in multiple States
 
03:11:51.170 --> 03:11:51.180 align:start position:0%
and it's slightly different from state
 
03:11:55.570 --> 03:11:55.580 align:start position:0%
to state but the governing principle in
 
03:11:58.670 --> 03:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
healthcare is you know the oath the
 
03:12:01.429 --> 03:12:01.439 align:start position:0%
Hippocratic Oath our training
 
03:12:03.790 --> 03:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
and then following standards of practice
 
03:12:06.650 --> 03:12:06.660 align:start position:0%
and standard of practice is pretty well
 
03:12:09.349 --> 03:12:09.359 align:start position:0%
delineated for each of our Specialties
 
03:12:11.230 --> 03:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
for how we practice
 
03:12:14.870 --> 03:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
deviations from that
 
03:12:17.870 --> 03:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
um especially where they end up causing
 
03:12:17.880 --> 03:12:19.070 align:start position:0%
um especially where they end up causing
harm

03:12:19.070 --> 03:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
harm
 
03:12:20.809 --> 03:12:20.819 align:start position:0%
are brought before the Board of Medicine
 
03:12:24.769 --> 03:12:24.779 align:start position:0%
if they cause a death or if there is
 
03:12:28.130 --> 03:12:28.140 align:start position:0%
that level it can even go as far as
 
03:12:30.830 --> 03:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
being criminally investigated
 
03:12:33.349 --> 03:12:33.359 align:start position:0%
so there's already a mechanism as
 
03:12:35.030 --> 03:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative Smith was talking about
 
03:12:38.210 --> 03:12:38.220 align:start position:0%
there's already a mechanism for what
 
03:12:40.790 --> 03:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
happens when you practice inappropriate
 
03:12:43.010 --> 03:12:43.020 align:start position:0%
care that can be inappropriate
 
03:12:45.290 --> 03:12:45.300 align:start position:0%
prescribing it can be a procedure that
 
03:12:48.230 --> 03:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
you're not doing appropriately
 
03:12:52.010 --> 03:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
um and in every state there is that
 
03:12:55.070 --> 03:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
mechanism I believe
 
03:12:58.190 --> 03:12:58.200 align:start position:0%
that that mechanism has for the most
 
03:13:01.130 --> 03:13:01.140 align:start position:0%
part it's not perfect but none of these
 
03:13:02.750 --> 03:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
systems are perfect whether you're a
 
03:13:05.570 --> 03:13:05.580 align:start position:0%
lawyer or a doctor or a businessman or
 
03:13:07.849 --> 03:13:07.859 align:start position:0%
or any profession
 
03:13:10.610 --> 03:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
but it really is geared toward the
 
03:13:13.550 --> 03:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
protection of the patient and the life
 
03:13:15.290 --> 03:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
of the patient and the well-being of the
 
03:13:15.300 --> 03:13:16.490 align:start position:0%
of the patient and the well-being of the
patient

03:13:16.490 --> 03:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
patient
 
03:13:18.790 --> 03:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
representative did you have a question
 
03:13:21.590 --> 03:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
all right any other questions for this
 
03:13:21.600 --> 03:13:23.630 align:start position:0%
all right any other questions for this
Witness

03:13:23.630 --> 03:13:23.640 align:start position:0%
Witness
 
03:13:25.490 --> 03:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
03:13:26.990 --> 03:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
you good to see you all representative
 
03:13:38.630 --> 03:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:38.640 --> 03:13:39.769 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:13:39.769 --> 03:13:39.779 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:13:41.990 --> 03:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
oh are you um yeah I'm gonna call on
 
03:13:43.849 --> 03:13:43.859 align:start position:0%
representative uh former representative
 
03:13:47.269 --> 03:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:49.010 --> 03:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
afternoon Mr chairman and members of the
 
03:13:49.020 --> 03:13:50.090 align:start position:0%
afternoon Mr chairman and members of the
committee

03:13:50.090 --> 03:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:13:53.090 --> 03:13:53.100 align:start position:0%
um Hillsboro 12th I represent uh was on
 
03:13:55.910 --> 03:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
Judiciary last term and we all got along
 
03:13:57.889 --> 03:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
very well even though we don't agree on
 
03:13:59.389 --> 03:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
this issue and we never will no matter
 
03:14:01.309 --> 03:14:01.319 align:start position:0%
what we say to each other
 
03:14:01.319 --> 03:14:02.990 align:start position:0%
what we say to each other
so

03:14:02.990 --> 03:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:14:04.849 --> 03:14:04.859 align:start position:0%
two and a half years ago when I knocked
 
03:14:08.330 --> 03:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
on doors and we talk about abortion
 
03:14:10.190 --> 03:14:10.200 align:start position:0%
most of the people that I talked to
 
03:14:12.170 --> 03:14:12.180 align:start position:0%
would say by the third trimester oh yeah
 
03:14:13.969 --> 03:14:13.979 align:start position:0%
by then that's too late
 
03:14:16.969 --> 03:14:16.979 align:start position:0%
so we Pat we only passed late term
 
03:14:19.790 --> 03:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
abortion this time around this campaign
 
03:14:22.309 --> 03:14:22.319 align:start position:0%
season I couldn't believe how many
 
03:14:24.830 --> 03:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
people think that we banned abortion are
 
03:14:26.269 --> 03:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
all nine months
 
03:14:27.950 --> 03:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
either these people were lied to or
 
03:14:30.349 --> 03:14:30.359 align:start position:0%
they're just completely misinformed I
 
03:14:31.070 --> 03:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
don't know where they got the
 
03:14:32.750 --> 03:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
information from
 
03:14:35.809 --> 03:14:35.819 align:start position:0%
but it's only the third trimester when
 
03:14:37.130 --> 03:14:37.140 align:start position:0%
the child
 
03:14:40.929 --> 03:14:40.939 align:start position:0%
can survive outside the womb
 
03:14:44.750 --> 03:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
if if it's so rare then why repeal it I
 
03:14:46.250 --> 03:14:46.260 align:start position:0%
remember sitting on that committee on
 
03:14:48.769 --> 03:14:48.779 align:start position:0%
this committee and asking an abortionist
 
03:14:51.110 --> 03:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
well how often do you have late-term
 
03:14:52.849 --> 03:14:52.859 align:start position:0%
abortions and she said oh it's very very
 
03:14:56.750 --> 03:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
rare and like well how do you know I've
 
03:14:58.969 --> 03:14:58.979 align:start position:0%
sponsored the statistics bills we don't
 
03:15:00.889 --> 03:15:00.899 align:start position:0%
have any statistics in New Hampshire we
 
03:15:03.110 --> 03:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
don't know who's give doing abortions
 
03:15:05.570 --> 03:15:05.580 align:start position:0%
how many even aggregate we couldn't even
 
03:15:09.230 --> 03:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
get past it as aggregated
 
03:15:11.750 --> 03:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
um statistics you know by County so that
 
03:15:13.849 --> 03:15:13.859 align:start position:0%
to protect you know if somebody has one
 
03:15:15.410 --> 03:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
you don't want to find out in a small
 
03:15:18.710 --> 03:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
town so I'm losing my train of thought
 
03:15:22.130 --> 03:15:22.140 align:start position:0%
here but I also um wanted to mention
 
03:15:25.070 --> 03:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
a woman named Gianna Jensen maybe you've
 
03:15:26.510 --> 03:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
heard of her
 
03:15:27.950 --> 03:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
she's one of the leading pro-life
 
03:15:30.290 --> 03:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
activists in the country
 
03:15:33.170 --> 03:15:33.180 align:start position:0%
in the 1970s her mother
 
03:15:35.630 --> 03:15:35.640 align:start position:0%
um went underwent a saline abortion
 
03:15:39.050 --> 03:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
and Giannis survived and it is only
 
03:15:41.990 --> 03:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
because the nurse working at the clinic
 
03:15:45.349 --> 03:15:45.359 align:start position:0%
called an ambulance that this this woman
 
03:15:48.469 --> 03:15:48.479 align:start position:0%
went on went on to live she had cerebral
 
03:15:50.570 --> 03:15:50.580 align:start position:0%
palsy and she has some other issues from
 
03:15:52.910 --> 03:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
the saline that burned her
 
03:15:55.370 --> 03:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
but I first met her while I talked to
 
03:15:56.809 --> 03:15:56.819 align:start position:0%
her on the phone when she was a young
 
03:15:58.670 --> 03:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
teenager and I interviewed her I had to
 
03:15:59.870 --> 03:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
get through her mother first on the
 
03:16:01.190 --> 03:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
phone it was like very difficult I had
 
03:16:02.990 --> 03:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
to I had to convince her that I was a
 
03:16:05.210 --> 03:16:05.220 align:start position:0%
friendly and not someone was going to be
 
03:16:07.550 --> 03:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
mean to her and then I met her here in
 
03:16:08.809 --> 03:16:08.819 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:16:11.809 --> 03:16:11.819 align:start position:0%
it was in Manchester and I interviewed
 
03:16:13.849 --> 03:16:13.859 align:start position:0%
her again
 
03:16:15.469 --> 03:16:15.479 align:start position:0%
um we talked about
 
03:16:15.479 --> 03:16:16.070 align:start position:0%
um we talked about
um

03:16:16.070 --> 03:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:18.530 --> 03:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
rape and incest there's a woman in New
 
03:16:20.030 --> 03:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who's written a book she's
 
03:16:21.830 --> 03:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
also been very outspoken her name is
 
03:16:23.389 --> 03:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
Darlene Pollock
 
03:16:25.790 --> 03:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
her mother was raped she's the product
 
03:16:29.269 --> 03:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
of that crime she herself was raped her
 
03:16:31.670 --> 03:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
daughter is a product of that crime
 
03:16:33.650 --> 03:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
but she knew that killing the baby
 
03:16:35.510 --> 03:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to make what happened to
 
03:16:38.230 --> 03:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
her go away
 
03:16:40.910 --> 03:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
and uh the last thing I want to say is
 
03:16:43.010 --> 03:16:43.020 align:start position:0%
we had a former representative
 
03:16:44.570 --> 03:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
I don't know how many terms ago it was
 
03:16:47.990 --> 03:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
but he stood at the well and said in the
 
03:16:50.330 --> 03:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
case of rape if someone has to die why
 
03:16:52.070 --> 03:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
not kill the rapist
 
03:16:55.429 --> 03:16:55.439 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for the switch
 
03:16:57.710 --> 03:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
representative Morgan
 
03:17:00.050 --> 03:17:00.060 align:start position:0%

uh what oh he's not taking you well she
 
03:17:09.950 --> 03:17:09.960 align:start position:0%

understand yeah the uh
 
03:17:23.030 --> 03:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:25.790 --> 03:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh for the record
 
03:17:27.950 --> 03:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
again my name is Kurt welper I live in
 
03:17:30.950 --> 03:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
Stratford and I'm here speaking for
 
03:17:30.960 --> 03:17:32.450 align:start position:0%
Stratford and I'm here speaking for
myself

03:17:32.450 --> 03:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
myself
 
03:17:32.460 --> 03:17:36.650 align:start position:0%
myself
microphone

03:17:36.650 --> 03:17:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:40.010 --> 03:17:40.020 align:start position:0%
I'll confine myself to the process
 
03:17:42.290 --> 03:17:42.300 align:start position:0%
of passing the feed away protection act
 
03:17:44.210 --> 03:17:44.220 align:start position:0%
because what I've heard here just makes
 
03:17:47.570 --> 03:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:50.870 --> 03:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
House Bill 625 came to the Judiciary
 
03:17:50.880 --> 03:17:53.210 align:start position:0%
House Bill 625 came to the Judiciary
Committee

03:17:53.210 --> 03:17:53.220 align:start position:0%
Committee
 
03:17:56.150 --> 03:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
it was had a public hearing
 
03:17:58.550 --> 03:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
it was voted in expedient to legislate
 
03:18:00.950 --> 03:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
to the house floor
 
03:18:04.130 --> 03:18:04.140 align:start position:0%
that vote was overturned by a vote of
 
03:18:08.269 --> 03:18:08.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:12.530 --> 03:18:12.540 align:start position:0%
it was vote it was moved ought to pass
 
03:18:16.490 --> 03:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
that vote succeeded on a vote of 191 to
 
03:18:18.889 --> 03:18:18.899 align:start position:0%
160. I'll get that backwards the
 
03:18:21.769 --> 03:18:21.779 align:start position:0%
overturn was 162 to 190.
 
03:18:23.210 --> 03:18:23.220 align:start position:0%
so we overturned the committee
 
03:18:26.210 --> 03:18:26.220 align:start position:0%
recommendation a lot in expedient
 
03:18:28.490 --> 03:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
and we voted the house voted it ought to
 
03:18:31.969 --> 03:18:31.979 align:start position:0%
pass 191 to 160.
 
03:18:34.130 --> 03:18:34.140 align:start position:0%
it went to the Senate
 
03:18:38.809 --> 03:18:38.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:42.349 --> 03:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
and then Things become murky
 
03:18:45.530 --> 03:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
because it never got under the heading
 
03:18:48.170 --> 03:18:48.180 align:start position:0%
of Hillsville 625
 
03:18:52.250 --> 03:18:52.260 align:start position:0%
it never got a hearing in uh a vote in
 
03:18:56.929 --> 03:18:56.939 align:start position:0%
the Senate what it did get was amended
 
03:19:04.250 --> 03:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:06.110 --> 03:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
that Amendment
 
03:19:09.769 --> 03:19:09.779 align:start position:0%
was thoroughly devoted on debated
 
03:19:13.849 --> 03:19:13.859 align:start position:0%
on the senate floor so just to be clear
 
03:19:18.349 --> 03:19:18.359 align:start position:0%
the house house bill 625 had full
 
03:19:21.170 --> 03:19:21.180 align:start position:0%
procedures in the house
 
03:19:25.670 --> 03:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:28.490 --> 03:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
and then hp2 went
 
03:19:30.889 --> 03:19:30.899 align:start position:0%
to the house it went through Committee
 
03:19:33.349 --> 03:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
of conference with the Senate
 
03:19:35.750 --> 03:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
and it was voted ought to pass
 
03:19:38.389 --> 03:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
by both bodies
 
03:19:41.510 --> 03:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
so I think that's six votes
 
03:19:43.849 --> 03:19:43.859 align:start position:0%
of the House and Senate
 
03:19:47.330 --> 03:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
to approve Hospital 625 or the fetal
 
03:19:50.030 --> 03:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
Life protection act
 
03:19:53.269 --> 03:19:53.279 align:start position:0%
in this in these in these walls that's
 
03:19:56.570 --> 03:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
the full blood full monty they called
 
03:19:56.580 --> 03:19:57.710 align:start position:0%
the full blood full monty they called
right

03:19:57.710 --> 03:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:19:59.450 --> 03:19:59.460 align:start position:0%
and it went to the governor and he did
 
03:20:02.389 --> 03:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
sign it and he did not approve of it
 
03:20:06.230 --> 03:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
but he signed what hp2 anyway
 
03:20:08.450 --> 03:20:08.460 align:start position:0%
and we'll leave that with that
 
03:20:10.130 --> 03:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
and ever since he's been trying to get
 
03:20:10.140 --> 03:20:10.790 align:start position:0%
and ever since he's been trying to get
it

03:20:10.790 --> 03:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:20:10.800 --> 03:20:15.349 align:start position:0%
it
modified

03:20:15.349 --> 03:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:17.870 --> 03:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
the other thing I've been a lot of
 
03:20:20.030 --> 03:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
discussion about the uh actual
 
03:20:22.550 --> 03:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
construction of the bill
 
03:20:24.469 --> 03:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
and you're going to hear more about that
 
03:20:26.530 --> 03:20:26.540 align:start position:0%
later the only thing I want to say is
 
03:20:31.370 --> 03:20:31.380 align:start position:0%
that when House Bill 2 passed House Bill
 
03:20:34.010 --> 03:20:34.020 align:start position:0%
625 passed
 
03:20:37.250 --> 03:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional order
 
03:20:40.010 --> 03:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
was that any
 
03:20:41.870 --> 03:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
abortion ban
 
03:20:43.190 --> 03:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
had to be
 
03:20:46.429 --> 03:20:46.439 align:start position:0%
later in the in the pregnancy after an
 
03:20:48.530 --> 03:20:48.540 align:start position:0%
at a viability standard
 
03:20:51.530 --> 03:20:51.540 align:start position:0%
which 24 weeks met and it had to have
 
03:20:52.969 --> 03:20:52.979 align:start position:0%
two exceptions
 
03:20:55.190 --> 03:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
for the life of the mother and for the
 
03:20:56.870 --> 03:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
health of the mother
 
03:21:00.410 --> 03:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
both were included in House Bill 625
 
03:21:03.889 --> 03:21:03.899 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for this Witness
 
03:21:06.650 --> 03:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
representative Horton
 
03:21:09.290 --> 03:21:09.300 align:start position:0%
thank you and this is uh
 
03:21:10.849 --> 03:21:10.859 align:start position:0%
just give me a chance to ask what I
 
03:21:12.530 --> 03:21:12.540 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask the previous uh previous
 
03:21:14.630 --> 03:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
member and you gave a pretty good
 
03:21:16.190 --> 03:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
explanation of the legislative history
 
03:21:17.690 --> 03:21:17.700 align:start position:0%
of it um
 
03:21:20.150 --> 03:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
and this the governor gave a budget
 
03:21:21.889 --> 03:21:21.899 align:start position:0%
address yesterday just like he did two
 
03:21:25.849 --> 03:21:25.859 align:start position:0%
years ago and two years ago this was not
 
03:21:28.429 --> 03:21:28.439 align:start position:0%
um this was not in his initial budget
 
03:21:30.290 --> 03:21:30.300 align:start position:0%
proposal but uh
 
03:21:32.210 --> 03:21:32.220 align:start position:0%
then it goes to the house and said it's
 
03:21:33.710 --> 03:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
a very lengthy process and lots of
 
03:21:33.720 --> 03:21:34.670 align:start position:0%
a very lengthy process and lots of
things

03:21:34.670 --> 03:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
things
 
03:21:37.550 --> 03:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
creep into the uh creep into the Budget
 
03:21:39.290 --> 03:21:39.300 align:start position:0%
Trailer build but
 
03:21:41.990 --> 03:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
so is the governor totally powerless
 
03:21:44.210 --> 03:21:44.220 align:start position:0%
well the House and Senate are working on
 
03:21:47.510 --> 03:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
it or does he have some uh influence
 
03:21:50.150 --> 03:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
either publicly and or behind the scenes
 
03:21:53.809 --> 03:21:53.819 align:start position:0%
over what is or is not included in the
 
03:21:55.969 --> 03:21:55.979 align:start position:0%
final product that is then sent to his
 
03:21:55.979 --> 03:21:57.290 align:start position:0%
final product that is then sent to his
desk

03:21:57.290 --> 03:21:57.300 align:start position:0%
desk
 
03:22:01.790 --> 03:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
in in June yes
 
03:22:04.910 --> 03:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
thank you yes all right next question is
 
03:22:07.670 --> 03:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:09.830 --> 03:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'm next going to
 
03:22:20.150 --> 03:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:22.130 --> 03:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the House
 
03:22:23.690 --> 03:22:23.700 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee my name is Kayla
 
03:22:25.670 --> 03:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
Montgomery I am the vice president of
 
03:22:27.230 --> 03:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
public affairs for Planned Parenthood of
 
03:22:28.370 --> 03:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
Northern New England and Planned
 
03:22:30.349 --> 03:22:30.359 align:start position:0%
Parenthood New Hampshire action fund and
 
03:22:31.849 --> 03:22:31.859 align:start position:0%
we support this bill before you house
 
03:22:35.030 --> 03:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
bill 271. so three points for you today
 
03:22:37.370 --> 03:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
about why New Hampshire's abortion ban
 
03:22:39.889 --> 03:22:39.899 align:start position:0%
should be repealed in its entirety
 
03:22:39.899 --> 03:22:41.090 align:start position:0%
should be repealed in its entirety
first

03:22:41.090 --> 03:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
first
 
03:22:43.969 --> 03:22:43.979 align:start position:0%
the current law has an exception to
 
03:22:46.790 --> 03:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
abortion after 24 weeks in the case of a
 
03:22:49.730 --> 03:22:49.740 align:start position:0%
fatal fetal diagnosis and that critical
 
03:22:52.070 --> 03:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
exception was added to this body just
 
03:22:53.210 --> 03:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
last year
 
03:22:56.030 --> 03:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
now some lawmakers have questioned why
 
03:22:58.250 --> 03:22:58.260 align:start position:0%
someone would need an abortion later in
 
03:23:00.650 --> 03:23:00.660 align:start position:0%
pregnancy if not for a fatal fetal
 
03:23:00.660 --> 03:23:01.790 align:start position:0%
pregnancy if not for a fatal fetal
diagnosis

03:23:01.790 --> 03:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
diagnosis
 
03:23:05.090 --> 03:23:05.100 align:start position:0%
and to be perfectly clear no one no one
 
03:23:07.190 --> 03:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
wakes up at eight or nine months
 
03:23:09.290 --> 03:23:09.300 align:start position:0%
pregnant and just decides they no longer
 
03:23:12.410 --> 03:23:12.420 align:start position:0%
want to be pregnant that doesn't happen
 
03:23:15.650 --> 03:23:15.660 align:start position:0%
but the fact is that every pregnancy is
 
03:23:17.809 --> 03:23:17.819 align:start position:0%
different and that our bodies don't
 
03:23:20.330 --> 03:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
always follow black and white laws
 
03:23:22.250 --> 03:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
and that is why blanket abortion bans
 
03:23:24.590 --> 03:23:24.600 align:start position:0%
don't work
 
03:23:27.170 --> 03:23:27.180 align:start position:0%
carving out exceptions also creates a
 
03:23:29.870 --> 03:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
legal gray area and we know this
 
03:23:32.330 --> 03:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
because with rogon we are hearing of
 
03:23:35.090 --> 03:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
more sexual assault victims including
 
03:23:35.100 --> 03:23:36.229 align:start position:0%
more sexual assault victims including
children

03:23:36.229 --> 03:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:23:38.389 --> 03:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
who are denied abortion care at all
 
03:23:40.309 --> 03:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
stages of pregnancy
 
03:23:42.950 --> 03:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
and prior to row falling these
 
03:23:45.530 --> 03:23:45.540 align:start position:0%
absolutely horrific examples like the 10
 
03:23:48.590 --> 03:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
year old in Ohio last year would have
 
03:23:50.570 --> 03:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
remained under the radar because these
 
03:23:52.670 --> 03:23:52.680 align:start position:0%
survivors would been able to get care in
 
03:23:54.349 --> 03:23:54.359 align:start position:0%
their home state
 
03:23:56.690 --> 03:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
and these stories they're heartbreaking
 
03:23:59.090 --> 03:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
and they're cruel but they're an awful
 
03:23:59.100 --> 03:24:00.590 align:start position:0%
and they're cruel but they're an awful
reality

03:24:00.590 --> 03:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
reality
 
03:24:03.050 --> 03:24:03.060 align:start position:0%
and we should not have to hear firsthand
 
03:24:05.330 --> 03:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
from these patients to understand that
 
03:24:06.710 --> 03:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
this happens
 
03:24:09.530 --> 03:24:09.540 align:start position:0%
we should instead have compassion
 
03:24:12.050 --> 03:24:12.060 align:start position:0%
and respect and allow doctors to help
 
03:24:14.269 --> 03:24:14.279 align:start position:0%
their patients make these incredibly
 
03:24:16.790 --> 03:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
complicated decisions
 
03:24:19.190 --> 03:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
and second the current abortion
 
03:24:20.750 --> 03:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
restrictions impact our health care
 
03:24:23.750 --> 03:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
landscape at a time when chaos and
 
03:24:26.090 --> 03:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
confusion around the full range of
 
03:24:27.889 --> 03:24:27.899 align:start position:0%
reproductive health and rights Reign
 
03:24:30.349 --> 03:24:30.359 align:start position:0%
because of the overturning of Roe v Wade
 
03:24:32.330 --> 03:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
the current law criminalizes our
 
03:24:34.610 --> 03:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
providers who are exercising their best
 
03:24:36.530 --> 03:24:36.540 align:start position:0%
medical judgment
 
03:24:38.330 --> 03:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
I think we can all agree that New
 
03:24:40.309 --> 03:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is home to world-class doctors
 
03:24:43.130 --> 03:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
and hospitals who are highly trained and
 
03:24:45.349 --> 03:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
experienced in their fields so should
 
03:24:47.929 --> 03:24:47.939 align:start position:0%
our state be sending its citizens in
 
03:24:50.570 --> 03:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
these complex medical situations out of
 
03:24:52.550 --> 03:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
state to get the care that New Hampshire
 
03:24:55.309 --> 03:24:55.319 align:start position:0%
doctors are trained to deliver
 
03:24:57.229 --> 03:24:57.239 align:start position:0%
and finally the state of New Hampshire
 
03:24:59.809 --> 03:24:59.819 align:start position:0%
has a long bipartisan history of
 
03:25:01.490 --> 03:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
supporting privacy around reproductive
 
03:25:03.769 --> 03:25:03.779 align:start position:0%
Health it was a New Hampshire
 
03:25:06.290 --> 03:25:06.300 align:start position:0%
republican-led legislature that repealed
 
03:25:09.889 --> 03:25:09.899 align:start position:0%
Three pre-roll Laws 25 years ago and it
 
03:25:11.450 --> 03:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
was a New Hampshire republican-led
 
03:25:13.429 --> 03:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
legislature that was the first in the
 
03:25:15.769 --> 03:25:15.779 align:start position:0%
nation to urge the FDA to approve
 
03:25:19.190 --> 03:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
medication abortion back in 1991 citing
 
03:25:22.190 --> 03:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
Quote The issue is freedom of choice and
 
03:25:24.410 --> 03:25:24.420 align:start position:0%
medical treatment unquote
 
03:25:26.030 --> 03:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire has a proud
 
03:25:27.830 --> 03:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
history of trusting doctors and women
 
03:25:30.229 --> 03:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
and families in these complexities
 
03:25:32.929 --> 03:25:32.939 align:start position:0%
decisions to do what's best for them the
 
03:25:34.849 --> 03:25:34.859 align:start position:0%
state government should not be reaching
 
03:25:37.010 --> 03:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
into these decisions people must have
 
03:25:38.870 --> 03:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
the freedom and privacy to make their
 
03:25:40.550 --> 03:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
decisions about their pregnancy and
 
03:25:42.830 --> 03:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
consultation with their doctors so we
 
03:25:45.590 --> 03:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
urge a vote of ought to pass on 271 and
 
03:25:47.570 --> 03:25:47.580 align:start position:0%
trust women and doctors to make these
 
03:25:49.250 --> 03:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
private decisions without government
 
03:25:53.330 --> 03:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
interference questions for this Witness
 
03:25:56.389 --> 03:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
representative Perez hey thank you I
 
03:25:58.969 --> 03:25:58.979 align:start position:0%
have three very quick questions prior to
 
03:26:01.790 --> 03:26:01.800 align:start position:0%
Roe versus Wade up to what gestation
 
03:26:04.790 --> 03:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
does Planned paren up Planned Parenthood
 
03:26:08.450 --> 03:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
perform abortions after Roe versus Wade
 
03:26:11.870 --> 03:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
up to what gestation does Planned
 
03:26:16.550 --> 03:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
Parenthood now perform abortions and do
 
03:26:18.650 --> 03:26:18.660 align:start position:0%
you know of any
 
03:26:21.950 --> 03:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
abortions being denied to any of the
 
03:26:23.769 --> 03:26:23.779 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood
 
03:26:27.889 --> 03:26:27.899 align:start position:0%
clients since this abortion
 
03:26:30.469 --> 03:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so
 
03:26:30.479 --> 03:26:31.130 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so
um

03:26:31.130 --> 03:26:31.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:33.830 --> 03:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
abortion after 24 weeks is out of the
 
03:26:35.389 --> 03:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
scope of Planned Parenthood practice to
 
03:26:37.070 --> 03:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
be perfectly clear that is care that
 
03:26:39.530 --> 03:26:39.540 align:start position:0%
happens in a hospital setting that's
 
03:26:40.969 --> 03:26:40.979 align:start position:0%
care in New Hampshire that would happen
 
03:26:43.130 --> 03:26:43.140 align:start position:0%
at places like Dartmouth or the Elliot
 
03:26:44.750 --> 03:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
it does not happen at Planned Parenthood
 
03:26:47.150 --> 03:26:47.160 align:start position:0%
so you know as a representative Planned
 
03:26:48.710 --> 03:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
Parenthood it is not within our scope of
 
03:26:51.050 --> 03:26:51.060 align:start position:0%
work Planned Parenthood in New Hampshire
 
03:26:53.630 --> 03:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
we have four sites in New Hampshire to
 
03:26:56.450 --> 03:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
perform abortion two do not Manchester
 
03:26:59.690 --> 03:26:59.700 align:start position:0%
performs both medication abortion and in
 
03:27:02.750 --> 03:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
in-house Center abortion up to 15.6
 
03:27:02.760 --> 03:27:04.670 align:start position:0%
in-house Center abortion up to 15.6
weeks

03:27:04.670 --> 03:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
03:27:09.530 --> 03:27:09.540 align:start position:0%
uh in Manchester it's 15 weeks six days
 
03:27:11.750 --> 03:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
and in Keen it's medication abortion
 
03:27:14.750 --> 03:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
only which is up to 11 weeks now that's
 
03:27:16.130 --> 03:27:16.140 align:start position:0%
at Planned Parenthood in New Hampshire
 
03:27:18.469 --> 03:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood of Northern New
 
03:27:20.510 --> 03:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
England is the affiliate and that is
 
03:27:23.150 --> 03:27:23.160 align:start position:0%
Maine Vermont and New Hampshire in
 
03:27:25.309 --> 03:27:25.319 align:start position:0%
Vermont and Maine the house centers go a
 
03:27:27.410 --> 03:27:27.420 align:start position:0%
little bit later gestation but in
 
03:27:29.450 --> 03:27:29.460 align:start position:0%
Manchester that's where it is that was
 
03:27:32.030 --> 03:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
the case before rofel and that is also
 
03:27:34.250 --> 03:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
the case now that didn't change with row
 
03:27:36.349 --> 03:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
falling and I'm sorry I forgot your
 
03:27:38.269 --> 03:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
third question representative Stapleton
 
03:27:39.889 --> 03:27:39.899 align:start position:0%
I think you had a question
 
03:27:41.750 --> 03:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:27:43.250 --> 03:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
my question
 
03:27:46.910 --> 03:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:49.190 --> 03:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
rape victims
 
03:27:53.990 --> 03:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:56.030 --> 03:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
why would
 
03:27:58.070 --> 03:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
we wait
 
03:28:01.429 --> 03:28:01.439 align:start position:0%
until the third trimester to
 
03:28:04.729 --> 03:28:04.739 align:start position:0%
resolve or answer that issue there by
 
03:28:07.429 --> 03:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
creating a greater risk
 
03:28:09.769 --> 03:28:09.779 align:start position:0%
for the women involved
 
03:28:13.729 --> 03:28:13.739 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for that question and
 
03:28:16.070 --> 03:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
there's no easy answer here because this
 
03:28:19.010 --> 03:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
is complicated anyone who is a victim of
 
03:28:20.929 --> 03:28:20.939 align:start position:0%
sexual assault is dealing with a
 
03:28:23.210 --> 03:28:23.220 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of barriers
 
03:28:25.670 --> 03:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
barriers including maybe not knowing
 
03:28:27.650 --> 03:28:27.660 align:start position:0%
that they're pregnant not sure how to
 
03:28:30.170 --> 03:28:30.180 align:start position:0%
get the care they need not sure where to
 
03:28:31.370 --> 03:28:31.380 align:start position:0%
get the care not be able to afford it
 
03:28:33.889 --> 03:28:33.899 align:start position:0%
there's many many different reasons
 
03:28:36.469 --> 03:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
that is true for any victim or any
 
03:28:38.389 --> 03:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
Survivor of sexual assault but when you
 
03:28:40.610 --> 03:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
add the fact that there's potentially
 
03:28:43.250 --> 03:28:43.260 align:start position:0%
minors in this situation and we know we
 
03:28:44.510 --> 03:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
know that there are potentially that
 
03:28:46.030 --> 03:28:46.040 align:start position:0%
there are minors who are in a situation
 
03:28:48.950 --> 03:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
these barriers become overwhelming how
 
03:28:51.830 --> 03:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
can we expect a child to navigate the
 
03:28:55.849 --> 03:28:55.859 align:start position:0%
Health Care system so unfortunately the
 
03:28:57.889 --> 03:28:57.899 align:start position:0%
reality is that sometimes people can't
 
03:28:59.809 --> 03:28:59.819 align:start position:0%
get the care that they want when they
 
03:29:01.910 --> 03:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
know it sometimes it takes them longer
 
03:29:04.429 --> 03:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
because of these barriers and that's
 
03:29:06.469 --> 03:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
true that was true before real following
 
03:29:08.450 --> 03:29:08.460 align:start position:0%
and that's especially true now when half
 
03:29:09.950 --> 03:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
of our country is experiencing these
 
03:29:11.690 --> 03:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
abortion Bans
 
03:29:15.110 --> 03:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Manish
 
03:29:17.330 --> 03:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:29:19.370 --> 03:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
um Miss Montgomery we heard conflicting
 
03:29:22.610 --> 03:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
testimony about the exceptions in the uh
 
03:29:25.130 --> 03:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
fetal Life protection act and I was
 
03:29:26.870 --> 03:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
wondering if you would clarify your
 
03:29:28.849 --> 03:29:28.859 align:start position:0%
understanding of what the exceptions are
 
03:29:33.710 --> 03:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
thank you certainly so RSA 324 Colin I'm
 
03:29:37.190 --> 03:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
sorry 329 Colin 44 is the RSA you can
 
03:29:38.210 --> 03:29:38.220 align:start position:0%
look that up
 
03:29:41.510 --> 03:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
um so the exceptions as it is now as the
 
03:29:44.210 --> 03:29:44.220 align:start position:0%
law is currently today there's an
 
03:29:46.490 --> 03:29:46.500 align:start position:0%
exception for maternal life and there's
 
03:29:48.050 --> 03:29:48.060 align:start position:0%
a very narrow exception for physical
 
03:29:50.030 --> 03:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
health as well and then of course
 
03:29:52.130 --> 03:29:52.140 align:start position:0%
there's the Fatal fetal diagnosis which
 
03:29:54.469 --> 03:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
was added last year
 
03:29:56.809 --> 03:29:56.819 align:start position:0%
and those are the exceptions and that's
 
03:29:59.690 --> 03:29:59.700 align:start position:0%
it so am I correct that that as you just
 
03:30:03.769 --> 03:30:03.779 align:start position:0%
said there is an exception for for uh
 
03:30:07.070 --> 03:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
for the one the health of the mother
 
03:30:09.830 --> 03:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
even if it's not even if it's not a
 
03:30:11.450 --> 03:30:11.460 align:start position:0%
threat to the life of the mother it has
 
03:30:13.309 --> 03:30:13.319 align:start position:0%
to be a significant threat to the health
 
03:30:15.650 --> 03:30:15.660 align:start position:0%
but there is a health exception in the
 
03:30:18.590 --> 03:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
current law there is a life exception
 
03:30:21.229 --> 03:30:21.239 align:start position:0%
and there is a physical a very narrow
 
03:30:23.030 --> 03:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
physical health exception which lists
 
03:30:25.610 --> 03:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
some things but the I think it's
 
03:30:27.229 --> 03:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
important to remember when it comes to
 
03:30:28.729 --> 03:30:28.739 align:start position:0%
exceptions is that there's a lot of
 
03:30:31.490 --> 03:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
legal gray areas because council at One
 
03:30:33.290 --> 03:30:33.300 align:start position:0%
hospital might view it differently than
 
03:30:35.510 --> 03:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
council at another hospital and these
 
03:30:37.550 --> 03:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
are of course moments you know when
 
03:30:39.530 --> 03:30:39.540 align:start position:0%
you're dealing when you're dealing with
 
03:30:42.110 --> 03:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
these moments this is minutes count and
 
03:30:44.809 --> 03:30:44.819 align:start position:0%
so the that's why there's a tremendous
 
03:30:46.550 --> 03:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
amount of gray area and that's by just
 
03:30:48.710 --> 03:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
removing that barrier altogether would
 
03:30:51.410 --> 03:30:51.420 align:start position:0%
be a better approach other questions for
 
03:30:54.050 --> 03:30:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:56.809 --> 03:30:56.819 align:start position:0%
yes representative greeson thank you Mr
 
03:30:58.070 --> 03:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking our
 
03:31:00.050 --> 03:31:00.060 align:start position:0%
questions you said that at the
 
03:31:01.610 --> 03:31:01.620 align:start position:0%
Manchester Clinic where they perform
 
03:31:04.969 --> 03:31:04.979 align:start position:0%
actual physical abortions uh you go out
 
03:31:08.030 --> 03:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
to 15 weeks and six days correct how do
 
03:31:10.070 --> 03:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
you determine that it's 15 weeks and six
 
03:31:12.830 --> 03:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
days versus 16 full weeks how do you
 
03:31:17.150 --> 03:31:17.160 align:start position:0%
actually know the gestation of the baby
 
03:31:18.950 --> 03:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
certainly so there's lots of different
 
03:31:21.170 --> 03:31:21.180 align:start position:0%
ways and there's a you know this we
 
03:31:23.090 --> 03:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
offer patient-centered care so every
 
03:31:25.630 --> 03:31:25.640 align:start position:0%
situation is going to be very different
 
03:31:27.769 --> 03:31:27.779 align:start position:0%
medication abortion which I said is
 
03:31:30.410 --> 03:31:30.420 align:start position:0%
offer up to 11 weeks here in uh here at
 
03:31:32.570 --> 03:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
our health centers in health centers in
 
03:31:34.790 --> 03:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire if someone comes in and
 
03:31:36.469 --> 03:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
they know exactly the date of their last
 
03:31:40.250 --> 03:31:40.260 align:start position:0%
period they are low risk maybe they know
 
03:31:41.929 --> 03:31:41.939 align:start position:0%
that they're eight weeks then they can
 
03:31:43.969 --> 03:31:43.979 align:start position:0%
have their medication abortion if
 
03:31:46.309 --> 03:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
someone's not sure the date of their
 
03:31:48.889 --> 03:31:48.899 align:start position:0%
last period That's generally the most
 
03:31:51.590 --> 03:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
um the biggest factor in not having the
 
03:31:53.450 --> 03:31:53.460 align:start position:0%
dates for your pregnancy then you could
 
03:31:55.670 --> 03:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
do an ultrasound to figure that out but
 
03:31:57.050 --> 03:31:57.060 align:start position:0%
every situation is going to be different
 
03:31:59.330 --> 03:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
every pregnancy is going to be different
 
03:32:00.410 --> 03:32:00.420 align:start position:0%
and we're going to work with each
 
03:32:02.030 --> 03:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
patient to decide what's best for their
 
03:32:02.040 --> 03:32:03.710 align:start position:0%
patient to decide what's best for their
care

03:32:03.710 --> 03:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
care
 
03:32:07.010 --> 03:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
03:32:09.410 --> 03:32:09.420 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you I'm next
 
03:32:11.809 --> 03:32:11.819 align:start position:0%
going to call on Bob Dunn I'm sorry I'm
 
03:32:13.309 --> 03:32:13.319 align:start position:0%
going to call on representative sellers
 
03:32:15.229 --> 03:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
I got out of order and Bob Dunn will be
 
03:32:16.309 --> 03:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
next and I'm going to ask everyone
 
03:32:19.610 --> 03:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
please it's now 12 30.
 
03:32:21.410 --> 03:32:21.420 align:start position:0%
um we're supposed to start the hearing
 
03:32:23.150 --> 03:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
on the third bill in half an hour no one
 
03:32:24.590 --> 03:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
has had lunch yet so I'm going to ask
 
03:32:27.469 --> 03:32:27.479 align:start position:0%
you to please keep your remarks uh to
 
03:32:29.090 --> 03:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
three minutes and I'm going to enforce
 
03:32:31.250 --> 03:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you thank you Mr chair
 
03:32:33.650 --> 03:32:33.660 align:start position:0%
and committee members uh I will only
 
03:32:35.809 --> 03:32:35.819 align:start position:0%
take less than a minute I hope
 
03:32:37.670 --> 03:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
um I want to just State a couple things
 
03:32:40.190 --> 03:32:40.200 align:start position:0%
uh I actually agree with representative
 
03:32:42.229 --> 03:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
Smith I don't think anything should be
 
03:32:44.030 --> 03:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
stuffed into a budget and even though
 
03:32:45.889 --> 03:32:45.899 align:start position:0%
there's a process for reviewing and
 
03:32:49.190 --> 03:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
triple checking it it you know years and
 
03:32:50.929 --> 03:32:50.939 align:start position:0%
years and A's and let's move forward and
 
03:32:53.630 --> 03:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
let the governor actually sign it or not
 
03:32:56.570 --> 03:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
sign it all right however now on the
 
03:33:00.170 --> 03:33:00.180 align:start position:0%
next thing is uh honorable Sherman
 
03:33:02.870 --> 03:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
he mentioned something about
 
03:33:07.250 --> 03:33:07.260 align:start position:0%
um there are no abortions actually after
 
03:33:09.769 --> 03:33:09.779 align:start position:0%
24 weeks or at that point on
 
03:33:12.889 --> 03:33:12.899 align:start position:0%
I'm saying we don't track the bushes we
 
03:33:14.150 --> 03:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
don't even know how many we do in the
 
03:33:14.160 --> 03:33:15.050 align:start position:0%
don't even know how many we do in the
state

03:33:15.050 --> 03:33:15.060 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:33:17.030 --> 03:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
so how does he know and how do we know
 
03:33:17.040 --> 03:33:18.590 align:start position:0%
so how does he know and how do we know
that

03:33:18.590 --> 03:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:33:22.250 --> 03:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
does any of you have any members on how
 
03:33:24.110 --> 03:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
many abortions we do
 
03:33:27.410 --> 03:33:27.420 align:start position:0%
I've seen guesstimates of 2200 a year
 
03:33:29.330 --> 03:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
and I probably think they're taking that
 
03:33:30.830 --> 03:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
by because of the other states that
 
03:33:32.990 --> 03:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
allow abortions and number of people in
 
03:33:34.309 --> 03:33:34.319 align:start position:0%
our state they're just guesstimating
 
03:33:37.309 --> 03:33:37.319 align:start position:0%
that we do 2200 a year so therefore I do
 
03:33:38.809 --> 03:33:38.819 align:start position:0%
want to make sure because I didn't say
 
03:33:40.910 --> 03:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
it on the last one I oppose this bill
 
03:33:43.250 --> 03:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
all right I think right now it's in
 
03:33:44.809 --> 03:33:44.819 align:start position:0%
place and it's working and we should
 
03:33:47.150 --> 03:33:47.160 align:start position:0%
move forward and I also oppose the loss
 
03:33:48.349 --> 03:33:48.359 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you
 
03:33:52.729 --> 03:33:52.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:55.610 --> 03:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh Bob Dunn and the next
 
03:34:00.290 --> 03:34:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:02.690 --> 03:34:02.700 align:start position:0%
Mr Dunn uh thank you Mr chair and
 
03:34:04.250 --> 03:34:04.260 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
03:34:05.630 --> 03:34:05.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to keep this very short
 
03:34:08.570 --> 03:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
I've got written testimony I'll defer to
 
03:34:12.170 --> 03:34:12.180 align:start position:0%
what I said earlier except uh and I'm
 
03:34:15.050 --> 03:34:15.060 align:start position:0%
Bob Dunn uh the public policy director
 
03:34:16.490 --> 03:34:16.500 align:start position:0%
for the Roman Catholic Diocese
 
03:34:19.309 --> 03:34:19.319 align:start position:0%
Manchester representing uh Bishop Peter
 
03:34:21.469 --> 03:34:21.479 align:start position:0%
labashi and the diocese and I'm going to
 
03:34:24.650 --> 03:34:24.660 align:start position:0%
quote from Roe v Wade
 
03:34:26.990 --> 03:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
um this is what Rose said and I think
 
03:34:30.290 --> 03:34:30.300 align:start position:0%
sometimes this is often forgotten in row
 
03:34:33.590 --> 03:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
the court recognized and this is a quote
 
03:34:35.630 --> 03:34:35.640 align:start position:0%
the state's important and legitimate
 
03:34:38.570 --> 03:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
interest in potential life and the court
 
03:34:41.510 --> 03:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
determined that again quote if the state
 
03:34:43.670 --> 03:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
is interested in protecting fetal life
 
03:34:47.530 --> 03:34:47.540 align:start position:0%
after viability it may go so far as to
 
03:34:50.030 --> 03:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
prescribe abortion during that period
 
03:34:52.550 --> 03:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
except when it is necessary to preserve
 
03:34:55.070 --> 03:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
the life or health of the mother
 
03:34:57.710 --> 03:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
um and so the law that's in place today
 
03:35:01.190 --> 03:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
is consistent with Roe the law was
 
03:35:04.490 --> 03:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
remember enacted before Dobbs was ever
 
03:35:04.500 --> 03:35:05.750 align:start position:0%
remember enacted before Dobbs was ever
decided

03:35:05.750 --> 03:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
decided
 
03:35:09.290 --> 03:35:09.300 align:start position:0%
so it was consistent I think with the
 
03:35:13.729 --> 03:35:13.739 align:start position:0%
Constitutional situation that was uh in
 
03:35:16.190 --> 03:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
place two years ago
 
03:35:19.309 --> 03:35:19.319 align:start position:0%
um and so uh the law that is in place
 
03:35:21.590 --> 03:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
today was consistent with what Roe
 
03:35:24.469 --> 03:35:24.479 align:start position:0%
allowed and uh we think it would be
 
03:35:26.870 --> 03:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
inadvisable to go back to a situation
 
03:35:29.050 --> 03:35:29.060 align:start position:0%
where there was absolutely no limit
 
03:35:31.550 --> 03:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
abortion for any reason up to birth
 
03:35:36.590 --> 03:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:39.590 --> 03:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you uh Miss Pimentel
 
03:35:42.290 --> 03:35:42.300 align:start position:0%
and then the next one up will be Allison
 
03:35:44.870 --> 03:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
Bedell and I'm just I direct this to
 
03:35:46.070 --> 03:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
their other members of the committee
 
03:35:49.370 --> 03:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
given the uh the time if some of you
 
03:35:52.130 --> 03:35:52.140 align:start position:0%
want to go have lunch go right ahead I'm
 
03:35:54.050 --> 03:35:54.060 align:start position:0%
going to stay and what maybe what I'll
 
03:35:56.750 --> 03:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
do is after somebody after the sort of
 
03:35:56.760 --> 03:35:57.530 align:start position:0%
do is after somebody after the sort of
first

03:35:57.530 --> 03:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
first
 
03:35:59.809 --> 03:35:59.819 align:start position:0%
group of people who may decide to have
 
03:36:02.690 --> 03:36:02.700 align:start position:0%
lunch do that when you get back I may uh
 
03:36:05.389 --> 03:36:05.399 align:start position:0%
ask uh someone to take over from me
 
03:36:07.130 --> 03:36:07.140 align:start position:0%
while for a few minutes while I go have
 
03:36:08.870 --> 03:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
lunch but please feel free to do that
 
03:36:12.469 --> 03:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
and we'll hear next from Ms Pimentel
 
03:36:14.570 --> 03:36:14.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
03:36:16.190 --> 03:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Danielle Pimentel
 
03:36:17.450 --> 03:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
it's a pleasure to speak with you again
 
03:36:19.969 --> 03:36:19.979 align:start position:0%
this morning as I stated earlier I serve
 
03:36:21.769 --> 03:36:21.779 align:start position:0%
as policy council at Americans United
 
03:36:24.410 --> 03:36:24.420 align:start position:0%
for life which is a national law and
 
03:36:26.510 --> 03:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
policy nonprofit organization with a
 
03:36:29.090 --> 03:36:29.100 align:start position:0%
specialization an abortion end of life
 
03:36:31.309 --> 03:36:31.319 align:start position:0%
issues and bioethics law and I will try
 
03:36:32.750 --> 03:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
to be brief um given the time
 
03:36:35.210 --> 03:36:35.220 align:start position:0%
constraints I urge the committee today
 
03:36:38.630 --> 03:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
to oppose hb271 because it removes
 
03:36:41.030 --> 03:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
necessary protections for the health and
 
03:36:42.830 --> 03:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
safety of pregnant women and unborn
 
03:36:45.229 --> 03:36:45.239 align:start position:0%
children and is inconsistent with New
 
03:36:46.969 --> 03:36:46.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's legitimate interest in
 
03:36:49.190 --> 03:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
protecting human life
 
03:36:52.550 --> 03:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
if HB 271 is passed abortion on demand
 
03:36:54.950 --> 03:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
up until birth will be allowed in New
 
03:36:57.469 --> 03:36:57.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which will subject women to
 
03:37:00.650 --> 03:37:00.660 align:start position:0%
higher risks of Health complications as
 
03:37:03.349 --> 03:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
well as maternal deaths only six states
 
03:37:05.809 --> 03:37:05.819 align:start position:0%
explicitly endorse abortion on demand
 
03:37:07.490 --> 03:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire should not become one
 
03:37:09.590 --> 03:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
of those states it is well known that
 
03:37:12.410 --> 03:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
abortions carry a higher medical risk
 
03:37:14.990 --> 03:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
when done later in pregnancy and 10
 
03:37:16.550 --> 03:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
percent of women experience immediate
 
03:37:18.650 --> 03:37:18.660 align:start position:0%
complications from abortion that can be
 
03:37:21.170 --> 03:37:21.180 align:start position:0%
life-threatening after eight weeks
 
03:37:23.570 --> 03:37:23.580 align:start position:0%
gestation the risk of death increases by
 
03:37:27.229 --> 03:37:27.239 align:start position:0%
38 with each additional week
 
03:37:29.929 --> 03:37:29.939 align:start position:0%
because hb271 would allow abortions on
 
03:37:32.269 --> 03:37:32.279 align:start position:0%
demand up until birth more women will
 
03:37:33.469 --> 03:37:33.479 align:start position:0%
experience life-threatening
 
03:37:35.510 --> 03:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
complications from later term abortions
 
03:37:37.490 --> 03:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
which will likely also increase the
 
03:37:39.889 --> 03:37:39.899 align:start position:0%
number of maternal deaths the woman of
 
03:37:41.570 --> 03:37:41.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire deserved better than to be
 
03:37:43.490 --> 03:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
subjected to later term abortion
 
03:37:44.809 --> 03:37:44.819 align:start position:0%
procedures that threaten their health
 
03:37:46.429 --> 03:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
and safety in that way
 
03:37:48.110 --> 03:37:48.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire also has a legitimate
 
03:37:50.150 --> 03:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
interest in preventing fetal pain as
 
03:37:52.190 --> 03:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
noted by the Supreme Court in the Dobbs
 
03:37:52.200 --> 03:37:53.750 align:start position:0%
noted by the Supreme Court in the Dobbs
decision

03:37:53.750 --> 03:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
decision
 
03:37:56.030 --> 03:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
um if the fetal Life protection act is
 
03:37:58.370 --> 03:37:58.380 align:start position:0%
repealed and abortions are allowed up
 
03:38:00.769 --> 03:38:00.779 align:start position:0%
until birth that will leave unborn
 
03:38:02.570 --> 03:38:02.580 align:start position:0%
children who can experience pain from
 
03:38:05.150 --> 03:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
abortion unprotected current Medical
 
03:38:07.190 --> 03:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
Science has firmly established the
 
03:38:09.530 --> 03:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
existence of pain and pre-born infants
 
03:38:11.990 --> 03:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
on or before or at least by 20 weeks
 
03:38:12.000 --> 03:38:13.370 align:start position:0%
on or before or at least by 20 weeks
gestation

03:38:13.370 --> 03:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
gestation
 
03:38:15.830 --> 03:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
so given the substantial evidence that
 
03:38:18.410 --> 03:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
that pre-born babies experience pain by
 
03:38:20.090 --> 03:38:20.100 align:start position:0%
at least 20 weeks gestation if not
 
03:38:21.830 --> 03:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
earlier it Is Well with the New
 
03:38:23.389 --> 03:38:23.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's legitimate interest to
 
03:38:25.670 --> 03:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
oppose a spell in order to minimize
 
03:38:28.070 --> 03:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
fetal pain as much as possible
 
03:38:29.570 --> 03:38:29.580 align:start position:0%
um lastly I'll be brief and my last
 
03:38:29.580 --> 03:38:30.670 align:start position:0%
um lastly I'll be brief and my last
point

03:38:30.670 --> 03:38:30.680 align:start position:0%
point
 
03:38:32.630 --> 03:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
hb27 would also get rid of the
 
03:38:36.410 --> 03:38:36.420 align:start position:0%
ultrasound requirement HP pardon me the
 
03:38:38.750 --> 03:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
Life protection act requires that an
 
03:38:40.610 --> 03:38:40.620 align:start position:0%
ultrasound be performed
 
03:38:44.090 --> 03:38:44.100 align:start position:0%
um if a woman is a 24 weeks gestation
 
03:38:46.070 --> 03:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
and these are important protections
 
03:38:48.110 --> 03:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
because they enable health care provided
 
03:38:50.330 --> 03:38:50.340 align:start position:0%
to accurately date the gestation of the
 
03:38:52.550 --> 03:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
baby which protects the woman by
 
03:38:54.110 --> 03:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
ensuring the appropriate abortion
 
03:38:56.590 --> 03:38:56.600 align:start position:0%
procedure is performed
 
03:39:00.110 --> 03:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
my last point is there are numerous
 
03:39:01.670 --> 03:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
states have enacted strong pro-life
 
03:39:03.950 --> 03:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
bills law is part of me after Roe v Wade
 
03:39:05.389 --> 03:39:05.399 align:start position:0%
was overturned there's at least three
 
03:39:07.429 --> 03:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
other states that maintain enforceable
 
03:39:10.550 --> 03:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
limit on abortion at 24 weeks 18 states
 
03:39:12.950 --> 03:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
have protected life at conception and
 
03:39:15.290 --> 03:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
three states to protect life after a
 
03:39:16.969 --> 03:39:16.979 align:start position:0%
heartbeat has been detected so by
 
03:39:16.979 --> 03:39:18.250 align:start position:0%
heartbeat has been detected so by
rejecting

03:39:18.250 --> 03:39:18.260 align:start position:0%
rejecting
 
03:39:20.570 --> 03:39:20.580 align:start position:0%
hb271 New Hampshire will be joining
 
03:39:23.330 --> 03:39:23.340 align:start position:0%
numerous states to continue having laws
 
03:39:25.370 --> 03:39:25.380 align:start position:0%
that affirm life
 
03:39:29.030 --> 03:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for this weapons
 
03:39:31.729 --> 03:39:31.739 align:start position:0%
seeing none of Allison thank you uh
 
03:39:35.170 --> 03:39:35.180 align:start position:0%
bodell and the next witness will be
 
03:39:42.309 --> 03:39:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:45.469 --> 03:39:45.479 align:start position:0%
oh that's fine that's fine all right yes
 
03:39:45.479 --> 03:39:46.729 align:start position:0%
oh that's fine that's fine all right yes
please

03:39:46.729 --> 03:39:46.739 align:start position:0%
please
 
03:39:49.490 --> 03:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Allison bodell and I'm a
 
03:39:51.290 --> 03:39:51.300 align:start position:0%
resident of hooks at New Hampshire
 
03:39:54.469 --> 03:39:54.479 align:start position:0%
and I'm here in support of little babies
 
03:39:56.450 --> 03:39:56.460 align:start position:0%
in the womb
 
03:39:59.090 --> 03:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
um I oppose the uh repeal of the fetal
 
03:40:00.710 --> 03:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
protection act
 
03:40:03.010 --> 03:40:03.020 align:start position:0%
I think if you knew more about
 
03:40:05.870 --> 03:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
fetuses and abortions you would you
 
03:40:08.090 --> 03:40:08.100 align:start position:0%
would want to repeal it too let me
 
03:40:10.790 --> 03:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
explain what happens when abortion is
 
03:40:10.800 --> 03:40:11.570 align:start position:0%
explain what happens when abortion is
done

03:40:11.570 --> 03:40:11.580 align:start position:0%
done
 
03:40:13.610 --> 03:40:13.620 align:start position:0%
I have to warn you that and I think I
 
03:40:17.090 --> 03:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
gave you all a copy of this so I'll kind
 
03:40:18.950 --> 03:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
of keep it kind of brief but um I have
 
03:40:21.590 --> 03:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
to warn you that it is very graphic to
 
03:40:23.630 --> 03:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
perform an abortion the mother is given
 
03:40:26.570 --> 03:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
anesthesia the doctor then uses an
 
03:40:29.210 --> 03:40:29.220 align:start position:0%
instance called a forceps which are
 
03:40:32.750 --> 03:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
actually just big tweezers and they they
 
03:40:36.290 --> 03:40:36.300 align:start position:0%
enter the womb and um they start pulling
 
03:40:39.229 --> 03:40:39.239 align:start position:0%
out pieces of the of the baby the fetus
 
03:40:40.849 --> 03:40:40.859 align:start position:0%
First It's usually the feet because
 
03:40:43.130 --> 03:40:43.140 align:start position:0%
that's the position that the fetus is in
 
03:40:46.490 --> 03:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
at the time at the time the vision
 
03:40:48.349 --> 03:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
the babies are in that position at the
 
03:40:50.510 --> 03:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
time so they pull one leg and then they
 
03:40:52.429 --> 03:40:52.439 align:start position:0%
pull the other and then they pull the
 
03:40:54.590 --> 03:40:54.600 align:start position:0%
arms and finally when they get to the
 
03:40:58.370 --> 03:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
head because it's not really a um a
 
03:41:01.429 --> 03:41:01.439 align:start position:0%
birth that kind of a thing the canal is
 
03:41:03.590 --> 03:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
very small so they have to squish the
 
03:41:05.690 --> 03:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
head and break the head
 
03:41:07.849 --> 03:41:07.859 align:start position:0%
and the Brain comes
 
03:41:10.550 --> 03:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
sizzling out it's like I said it's very
 
03:41:10.560 --> 03:41:12.050 align:start position:0%
sizzling out it's like I said it's very
graphic

03:41:12.050 --> 03:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
graphic
 
03:41:12.060 --> 03:41:12.650 align:start position:0%
graphic
um

03:41:12.650 --> 03:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:16.370 --> 03:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
so that's basically it and I think she
 
03:41:17.690 --> 03:41:17.700 align:start position:0%
had talked about
 
03:41:19.550 --> 03:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
um having pain and I was wondering if
 
03:41:22.010 --> 03:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
you thought about if the fetus does feel
 
03:41:25.130 --> 03:41:25.140 align:start position:0%
pain well has anyone ever heard of Dr
 
03:41:26.809 --> 03:41:26.819 align:start position:0%
Ben Carlson
 
03:41:30.530 --> 03:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
he is a pediatric neurosurgeon and he
 
03:41:33.110 --> 03:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
specializes in in people and babies for
 
03:41:36.229 --> 03:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
example works on co-joined twins also
 
03:41:38.090 --> 03:41:38.100 align:start position:0%
known as Siamese twins
 
03:41:40.670 --> 03:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
he's discovered that fetuses do Winston
 
03:41:42.530 --> 03:41:42.540 align:start position:0%
Payne when he would attempt to do their
 
03:41:45.830 --> 03:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
surgeries all of his tiny patients after
 
03:41:47.929 --> 03:41:47.939 align:start position:0%
that would receive anesthesia for all
 
03:41:50.870 --> 03:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
their surgeries just like their mother
 
03:41:53.210 --> 03:41:53.220 align:start position:0%
so in closing my hope is that you
 
03:41:55.370 --> 03:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
realize that fetuses are tiny living
 
03:41:58.490 --> 03:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
babies not just masses of cells
 
03:42:01.969 --> 03:42:01.979 align:start position:0%
and that we should repeal this this act
 
03:42:03.710 --> 03:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
does that have any questions thank you
 
03:42:06.889 --> 03:42:06.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:09.130 --> 03:42:09.140 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:42:13.510 --> 03:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
Michelle foisy and next will be
 
03:42:23.510 --> 03:42:23.520 align:start position:0%

protection act
 
03:42:47.929 --> 03:42:47.939 align:start position:0%
before telling my daughter Kayla's
 
03:42:50.630 --> 03:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
abortion story at 22 weeks due to a
 
03:42:52.490 --> 03:42:52.500 align:start position:0%
fatal fetal anomaly to the New Hampshire

house Judiciary Committee last February
 
03:42:58.250 --> 03:42:58.260 align:start position:0%
I had never told my ice our story in
 
03:42:58.260 --> 03:43:00.170 align:start position:0%
I had never told my ice our story in
public

03:43:00.170 --> 03:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
public
 
03:43:02.330 --> 03:43:02.340 align:start position:0%
over the last year I have had the honor
 
03:43:04.070 --> 03:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
of meeting people from all over the
 
03:43:05.990 --> 03:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
state while advocating for Reproductive
 
03:43:06.000 --> 03:43:07.070 align:start position:0%

Rights
 
03:43:09.590 --> 03:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
through my own storytelling I have in
 
03:43:12.229 --> 03:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
turn heard many stories of abortion
 
03:43:14.450 --> 03:43:14.460 align:start position:0%
stories of relief for their life and
 
03:43:17.030 --> 03:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
future ahead after having an abortion
 
03:43:19.130 --> 03:43:19.140 align:start position:0%
stories of loss of dearly wanted
 
03:43:22.010 --> 03:43:22.020 align:start position:0%
pregnancies and stories of self-love
 
03:43:24.950 --> 03:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
after enduring a horrifying sexual
 
03:43:24.960 --> 03:43:26.570 align:start position:0%
after enduring a horrifying sexual
assault

03:43:26.570 --> 03:43:26.580 align:start position:0%
assault
 
03:43:28.550 --> 03:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
on this journey I have learned that
 
03:43:30.650 --> 03:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters overwhelmingly believe
 
03:43:33.469 --> 03:43:33.479 align:start position:0%
in and support legal and safe accessible
 
03:43:35.269 --> 03:43:35.279 align:start position:0%
abortions for all
 
03:43:37.550 --> 03:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
but New Hampshire's abortion ban puts
 
03:43:39.950 --> 03:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
politicians between patients and
 
03:43:39.960 --> 03:43:42.050 align:start position:0%
politicians between patients and
providers

03:43:42.050 --> 03:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
providers
 
03:43:44.630 --> 03:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
18 years ago I sat with my husband in
 
03:43:46.910 --> 03:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
the paranatologist's office we were
 
03:43:48.530 --> 03:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
devastated by the news we had just
 
03:43:48.540 --> 03:43:49.910 align:start position:0%
devastated by the news we had just
received

03:43:49.910 --> 03:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
received
 
03:43:52.790 --> 03:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
we learned that our second child who we
 
03:43:54.769 --> 03:43:54.779 align:start position:0%
desperately wanted had no chance of
 
03:43:57.290 --> 03:43:57.300 align:start position:0%
surviving outside of my body due to her
 
03:43:59.389 --> 03:43:59.399 align:start position:0%
fatal anomalies
 
03:44:02.389 --> 03:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
though my heart was crushed I felt the
 
03:44:04.490 --> 03:44:04.500 align:start position:0%
most incredible compassion and empathy
 
03:44:07.250 --> 03:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
from our medical provider
 
03:44:09.349 --> 03:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
listening to him explain our options
 
03:44:11.690 --> 03:44:11.700 align:start position:0%
with the patience and understanding he
 
03:44:14.690 --> 03:44:14.700 align:start position:0%
exemplified with us on that day is
 
03:44:17.690 --> 03:44:17.700 align:start position:0%
something I will never forget
 
03:44:20.330 --> 03:44:20.340 align:start position:0%
the relationship we developed in a very
 
03:44:23.150 --> 03:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
short amount of time was a bond I cannot
 
03:44:25.969 --> 03:44:25.979 align:start position:0%
describe and a trust that cannot be felt
 
03:44:29.090 --> 03:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
without living the experience itself
 
03:44:32.090 --> 03:44:32.100 align:start position:0%
without my provider's expertise I firmly
 
03:44:34.370 --> 03:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
believe my life would not be as it is
 
03:44:38.570 --> 03:44:38.580 align:start position:0%
today as a mother of six living children
 
03:44:40.610 --> 03:44:40.620 align:start position:0%
a medical provider that has the burden
 
03:44:42.590 --> 03:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
to share the horrible news that a wanted
 
03:44:45.469 --> 03:44:45.479 align:start position:0%
pregnancy will not have the outcome once
 
03:44:49.010 --> 03:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
dreamed of deserves compassion as well
 
03:44:51.229 --> 03:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
all medical professionals enter the
 
03:44:53.269 --> 03:44:53.279 align:start position:0%
world of Medicine with the desire to
 
03:44:55.790 --> 03:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
help others and as their own states to
 
03:44:57.590 --> 03:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
do no harm
 
03:44:59.330 --> 03:44:59.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's abortion ban
 
03:45:01.910 --> 03:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
criminalizes doctors for doing their job
 
03:45:04.130 --> 03:45:04.140 align:start position:0%
and working with their patients to get
 
03:45:06.889 --> 03:45:06.899 align:start position:0%
the care they need just as my doctor did
 
03:45:09.290 --> 03:45:09.300 align:start position:0%
on that fateful day
 
03:45:11.510 --> 03:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
as a person who has had an abortion
 
03:45:14.150 --> 03:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
later in pregnancy I understand the
 
03:45:16.969 --> 03:45:16.979 align:start position:0%
complexity of reproductive Health Care
 
03:45:18.830 --> 03:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
families in New Hampshire can face
 
03:45:21.110 --> 03:45:21.120 align:start position:0%

03:45:22.729 --> 03:45:22.739 align:start position:0%
we're you're at the three-minute Mark so
 
03:45:25.550 --> 03:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
can I ask you to finish up please
 
03:45:27.830 --> 03:45:27.840 align:start position:0%
and may have difficult they may have to
 
03:45:30.410 --> 03:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
make difficult choices letting Kayla go
 
03:45:31.969 --> 03:45:31.979 align:start position:0%
from the body that was not able to
 
03:45:34.070 --> 03:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
sustain her life outside of mine was our
 
03:45:35.990 --> 03:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
way of setting her soul free
 
03:45:38.090 --> 03:45:38.100 align:start position:0%
for me and my family choosing abortion
 
03:45:40.790 --> 03:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
was a true Act of Love last year the New
 
03:45:42.410 --> 03:45:42.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislator took an important
 
03:45:44.210 --> 03:45:44.220 align:start position:0%
step to mitigate some of the harm caused
 
03:45:46.010 --> 03:45:46.020 align:start position:0%
by the state's abortion ban adding an
 
03:45:47.870 --> 03:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
exception for fatal fetal diagnoses
 
03:45:50.330 --> 03:45:50.340 align:start position:0%
however it's kind of going over the
 
03:45:51.830 --> 03:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
limit now ma'am I really need to have
 
03:45:54.590 --> 03:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
you finish up okay okay I apologize
 
03:45:56.570 --> 03:45:56.580 align:start position:0%
studies show that survivors of rape
 
03:45:58.550 --> 03:45:58.560 align:start position:0%

time limit
 
03:46:12.590 --> 03:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
Staters knows no no I'm I'm sorry ma'am
 
03:46:14.269 --> 03:46:14.279 align:start position:0%
you really are way up your time thank
 
03:46:17.750 --> 03:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:19.910 --> 03:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you next I'm going to
 
03:46:24.290 --> 03:46:24.300 align:start position:0%
call on Maura Casey and the next witness

after that will be Peter Hogan
 
03:46:29.990 --> 03:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
Miss uh Casey yes
 
03:46:32.330 --> 03:46:32.340 align:start position:0%
hi my name is Maura Casey I live in
 
03:46:34.250 --> 03:46:34.260 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire and I'm here in
 
03:46:37.190 --> 03:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
support of house bill 271. can you hear
 
03:46:39.170 --> 03:46:39.180 align:start position:0%
me okay yes okay
 
03:46:41.150 --> 03:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
I never thought that I would be affected
 
03:46:44.269 --> 03:46:44.279 align:start position:0%
by the politics around abortion Ron and
 
03:46:46.309 --> 03:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
I wanted a baby very badly and we're
 
03:46:47.809 --> 03:46:47.819 align:start position:0%
thrilled when I finally got pregnant
 
03:46:49.250 --> 03:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
last year
 
03:46:51.590 --> 03:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately after the first trimester
 
03:46:53.870 --> 03:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
our joy and excitement turned to shock
 
03:46:55.429 --> 03:46:55.439 align:start position:0%
and grief
 
03:46:57.650 --> 03:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
neither of us had heard of Trisomy 18
 
03:47:00.290 --> 03:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
before but now I know that that it is a
 
03:47:02.330 --> 03:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
rare severe and life-threatening genetic
 
03:47:02.340 --> 03:47:03.590 align:start position:0%
rare severe and life-threatening genetic
condition

03:47:03.590 --> 03:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
condition
 
03:47:05.929 --> 03:47:05.939 align:start position:0%
even though we hoped it wasn't true both
 
03:47:08.090 --> 03:47:08.100 align:start position:0%
a blood test and an ultrasound confirmed
 
03:47:10.849 --> 03:47:10.859 align:start position:0%
the diagnosis we had incredibly hard
 
03:47:12.469 --> 03:47:12.479 align:start position:0%
decision to make
 
03:47:14.690 --> 03:47:14.700 align:start position:0%
if I stayed pregnant the most likely
 
03:47:17.030 --> 03:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
outcome was a stillbirth which I
 
03:47:19.010 --> 03:47:19.020 align:start position:0%
honestly was terrified of
 
03:47:21.170 --> 03:47:21.180 align:start position:0%
if my pregnancy was brought to term the
 
03:47:23.030 --> 03:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
baby could die from hard and or
 
03:47:26.210 --> 03:47:26.220 align:start position:0%
breathing problems during the birth
 
03:47:28.490 --> 03:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
if by some miracle the baby was born
 
03:47:30.710 --> 03:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
alive it would be a short and painful
 
03:47:34.250 --> 03:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
life probably lasting only a few days
 
03:47:36.050 --> 03:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
we would never want to put a baby
 
03:47:38.150 --> 03:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
through that I also didn't want to put
 
03:47:39.650 --> 03:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
myself through the trauma of a
 
03:47:39.660 --> 03:47:40.849 align:start position:0%
myself through the trauma of a
stillbirth

03:47:40.849 --> 03:47:40.859 align:start position:0%
stillbirth
 
03:47:42.650 --> 03:47:42.660 align:start position:0%
on the other hand I was worried about
 
03:47:45.290 --> 03:47:45.300 align:start position:0%
having an abortion I was mostly scared
 
03:47:47.809 --> 03:47:47.819 align:start position:0%
the baby would feel pain I was already
 
03:47:49.849 --> 03:47:49.859 align:start position:0%
attached to this baby and wanted to do
 
03:47:51.290 --> 03:47:51.300 align:start position:0%
right by it
 
03:47:53.389 --> 03:47:53.399 align:start position:0%
I learned that the baby wouldn't feel
 
03:47:55.670 --> 03:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
anything and made sure that the remains
 
03:47:57.710 --> 03:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
would be handled respectfully
 
03:47:59.690 --> 03:47:59.700 align:start position:0%
I learned that the baby wouldn't feel
 
03:48:03.170 --> 03:48:03.180 align:start position:0%
pain by medical providers not the
 
03:48:03.180 --> 03:48:04.849 align:start position:0%
pain by medical providers not the
internet

03:48:04.849 --> 03:48:04.859 align:start position:0%
internet
 
03:48:06.889 --> 03:48:06.899 align:start position:0%
although I had so many confusing
 
03:48:08.690 --> 03:48:08.700 align:start position:0%
emotions going on I'm completely
 
03:48:10.790 --> 03:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
confident that the decision to end the
 
03:48:13.670 --> 03:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
pregnancy was the Humane one
 
03:48:15.769 --> 03:48:15.779 align:start position:0%
after the surgery it took time to
 
03:48:18.410 --> 03:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
process and grieve unfortunately our
 
03:48:20.210 --> 03:48:20.220 align:start position:0%
ability to go through that process was
 
03:48:21.830 --> 03:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
derailed when we got the bill for
 
03:48:23.870 --> 03:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
sixteen thousand two hundred ninety
 
03:48:26.150 --> 03:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
three dollars which later increased to
 
03:48:28.070 --> 03:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
twenty two thousand seven hundred and
 
03:48:29.809 --> 03:48:29.819 align:start position:0%
forty four dollars
 
03:48:31.910 --> 03:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
prior to getting that bill I hadn't even
 
03:48:34.250 --> 03:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
considered that it might not be covered
 
03:48:35.630 --> 03:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
by insurance
 
03:48:38.150 --> 03:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
I tried to appeal based on the severity
 
03:48:40.250 --> 03:48:40.260 align:start position:0%
of the baby's diagnosis but was again
 
03:48:40.260 --> 03:48:41.690 align:start position:0%
of the baby's diagnosis but was again
denied

03:48:41.690 --> 03:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
denied
 
03:48:43.790 --> 03:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
I hope that sharing this story helps
 
03:48:45.349 --> 03:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
people understand that people have
 
03:48:48.590 --> 03:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
abortions for many reasons abortions can
 
03:48:51.370 --> 03:48:51.380 align:start position:0%
be incredibly sad scary and painful
 
03:48:53.929 --> 03:48:53.939 align:start position:0%
women need to feel safe when they're
 
03:48:55.550 --> 03:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
making these difficult and personal
 
03:48:55.560 --> 03:48:56.870 align:start position:0%
making these difficult and personal
choices

03:48:56.870 --> 03:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
choices
 
03:48:59.210 --> 03:48:59.220 align:start position:0%
please consider that abortion isn't
 
03:49:01.550 --> 03:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
cruel it can be a way to decrease
 
03:49:04.370 --> 03:49:04.380 align:start position:0%
suffering of fetuses babies and
 
03:49:06.110 --> 03:49:06.120 align:start position:0%
potential parents
 
03:49:10.610 --> 03:49:10.620 align:start position:0%
please consider passing HB 271 thank you
 
03:49:12.050 --> 03:49:12.060 align:start position:0%
questions for this one yes
 
03:49:14.570 --> 03:49:14.580 align:start position:0%
representative Perez excuse me and how
 
03:49:16.250 --> 03:49:16.260 align:start position:0%
many weeks did you have your uh
 
03:49:18.410 --> 03:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
termination of your pregnancy it was 14
 
03:49:21.950 --> 03:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
14 weeks and how would this a bill that
 
03:49:23.929 --> 03:49:23.939 align:start position:0%
you would like to see go away have
 
03:49:26.630 --> 03:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
prevented that from happening I think
 
03:49:26.640 --> 03:49:27.349 align:start position:0%
prevented that from happening I think
that

03:49:27.349 --> 03:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:49:29.630 --> 03:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
insurance and
 
03:49:31.790 --> 03:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
intertwined so I think that my health
 
03:49:34.429 --> 03:49:34.439 align:start position:0%
insurance likely was affected my private
 
03:49:36.650 --> 03:49:36.660 align:start position:0%
health insurance was likely affected by
 
03:49:39.830 --> 03:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
the politics around I'm sorry I think
 
03:49:42.650 --> 03:49:42.660 align:start position:0%
that politics and health insurance are
 
03:49:45.769 --> 03:49:45.779 align:start position:0%
intertwined in some ways and I think
 
03:49:47.330 --> 03:49:47.340 align:start position:0%
that um
 
03:49:49.610 --> 03:49:49.620 align:start position:0%
my health insurance made the decisions
 
03:49:52.429 --> 03:49:52.439 align:start position:0%
not to cover my
 
03:49:56.150 --> 03:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
treatment because of politics political
 
03:49:58.670 --> 03:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
reasons I don't know more than that I'm
 
03:50:01.010 --> 03:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
not a politician so I'm sorry I'm not
 
03:50:02.570 --> 03:50:02.580 align:start position:0%
going to take any more questions thank
 
03:50:02.580 --> 03:50:03.290 align:start position:0%
going to take any more questions thank
you

03:50:03.290 --> 03:50:03.300 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:50:05.510 --> 03:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
a follow-up I just how would this bill
 
03:50:07.070 --> 03:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
have stopped you from having that
 
03:50:07.080 --> 03:50:12.889 align:start position:0%
have stopped you from having that
abortion

03:50:12.889 --> 03:50:12.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:15.469 --> 03:50:15.479 align:start position:0%
all right um other questions all right
 
03:50:19.969 --> 03:50:19.979 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Peter Hogan please
 
03:50:30.410 --> 03:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:33.229 --> 03:50:33.239 align:start position:0%
my name is Peter Hogan I'm a student
 
03:50:36.050 --> 03:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
high school student in Sullivan County
 
03:50:38.870 --> 03:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
House Bill 271 seeks to repeal the fetal
 
03:50:40.790 --> 03:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
Life protection act which restricts
 
03:50:43.969 --> 03:50:43.979 align:start position:0%
abortion after 24 weeks this act is
 
03:50:45.889 --> 03:50:45.899 align:start position:0%
repealed it will allow a woman to have
 
03:50:47.389 --> 03:50:47.399 align:start position:0%
an abortion at any stage of her
 
03:50:47.399 --> 03:50:48.530 align:start position:0%
an abortion at any stage of her
pregnancy

03:50:48.530 --> 03:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
pregnancy
 
03:50:51.410 --> 03:50:51.420 align:start position:0%
at 24 weeks a human person is able to
 
03:50:54.469 --> 03:50:54.479 align:start position:0%
survive outside the womb that our heart
 
03:50:56.809 --> 03:50:56.819 align:start position:0%
has already been beating for 18 to 19
 
03:51:00.349 --> 03:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
weeks by week seven of the baby's
 
03:51:03.050 --> 03:51:03.060 align:start position:0%
development the brain begins to take
 
03:51:05.990 --> 03:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
shape by week 10 of their life their
 
03:51:08.389 --> 03:51:08.399 align:start position:0%
eyelids nostrils and mouth have already
 
03:51:10.010 --> 03:51:10.020 align:start position:0%
begun to form
 
03:51:13.429 --> 03:51:13.439 align:start position:0%
by week 15 the baby will be able to hear
 
03:51:15.410 --> 03:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
these are just a handful of things that
 
03:51:17.690 --> 03:51:17.700 align:start position:0%
a person in the womb can do
 
03:51:19.370 --> 03:51:19.380 align:start position:0%
the thought of repealing the fetal Life
 
03:51:22.010 --> 03:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
protection act act should be Unthinkable
 
03:51:24.290 --> 03:51:24.300 align:start position:0%
the restrictions that are now in place
 
03:51:26.269 --> 03:51:26.279 align:start position:0%
are not enough to protect a person in
 
03:51:28.429 --> 03:51:28.439 align:start position:0%
the womb so to repeal them would only
 
03:51:30.710 --> 03:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
infringe upon the right to life of an
 
03:51:32.750 --> 03:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
unborn person even more
 
03:51:35.530 --> 03:51:35.540 align:start position:0%
and 24 of the 50 states of our country
 
03:51:38.809 --> 03:51:38.819 align:start position:0%
abortion is highly restricted and out of
 
03:51:40.490 --> 03:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
those 24 States
 
03:51:42.650 --> 03:51:42.660 align:start position:0%
half of them have outlawed abortion
 
03:51:45.229 --> 03:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
completely there are only 10 states in
 
03:51:46.670 --> 03:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
which abortion is completely
 
03:51:50.450 --> 03:51:50.460 align:start position:0%
unrestricted or protected by the law
 
03:51:53.210 --> 03:51:53.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire needs to defend the right
 
03:51:56.510 --> 03:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
of unborn humans and the only way it can
 
03:51:58.610 --> 03:51:58.620 align:start position:0%
start is by upholding the fetal like
 
03:52:01.550 --> 03:52:01.560 align:start position:0%
protection act thank you thank you
 
03:52:03.950 --> 03:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
03:52:07.910 --> 03:52:07.920 align:start position:0%

03:52:20.269 --> 03:52:20.279 align:start position:0%
I asked the committee to oppose
 
03:52:24.410 --> 03:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:27.650 --> 03:52:27.660 align:start position:0%

um I agree with the remarks of
 
03:52:34.490 --> 03:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
Representative Sellers and this young
 
03:52:37.190 --> 03:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
man right here again I urge the
 
03:52:40.269 --> 03:52:40.279 align:start position:0%
committee to oppose House Bill
 
03:52:43.370 --> 03:52:43.380 align:start position:0%
271- FN thank you and I yield the
 
03:52:45.469 --> 03:52:45.479 align:start position:0%
remainder of my time thank you questions
 
03:52:47.030 --> 03:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
to this Witness
 
03:52:49.429 --> 03:52:49.439 align:start position:0%

is

03:52:56.929 --> 03:52:56.939 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:52:56.939 --> 03:53:06.790 align:start position:0%
is
Laura

03:53:06.790 --> 03:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:11.929 --> 03:53:11.939 align:start position:0%
is Miss Miss at Miss El Aslam here
 
03:53:15.110 --> 03:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
do not see her so I will call on Phyllis
 
03:53:19.250 --> 03:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:21.229 --> 03:53:21.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
03:53:21.239 --> 03:53:22.250 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
committee

03:53:22.250 --> 03:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:53:25.070 --> 03:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm Phyllis woods from Dover
 
03:53:28.849 --> 03:53:28.859 align:start position:0%
um I can recall being on that side of
 
03:53:32.450 --> 03:53:32.460 align:start position:0%
the committee uh as a former member of
 
03:53:35.630 --> 03:53:35.640 align:start position:0%
Judiciary and Judge Lynn testifying on
 
03:53:38.030 --> 03:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
this side so this is bringing back a lot
 
03:53:40.990 --> 03:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
of kind of memories for me
 
03:53:43.910 --> 03:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
I also one of the memories that I'm
 
03:53:46.969 --> 03:53:46.979 align:start position:0%
having is what uh confusion some of the
 
03:53:48.889 --> 03:53:48.899 align:start position:0%
members might be having with the
 
03:53:50.990 --> 03:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
testimony that you're hearing first
 
03:53:53.750 --> 03:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
we're hearing that late term abortions
 
03:53:58.190 --> 03:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
from six months on never happen but yet
 
03:54:01.630 --> 03:54:01.640 align:start position:0%
we don't want to make them illegal
 
03:54:05.510 --> 03:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
it may be the case that we are not doing
 
03:54:09.290 --> 03:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
late-term abortions here now but if this
 
03:54:13.370 --> 03:54:13.380 align:start position:0%
law that protects late-term abortions is
 
03:54:17.269 --> 03:54:17.279 align:start position:0%
repealed I submit that we may have an
 
03:54:19.250 --> 03:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
influx of people coming from other
 
03:54:21.889 --> 03:54:21.899 align:start position:0%
states wanting to have late-term
 
03:54:25.809 --> 03:54:25.819 align:start position:0%
abortions right now we have
 
03:54:28.670 --> 03:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
unrestricted abortions up to six months
 
03:54:32.229 --> 03:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
as you know this the repeal of this ban
 
03:54:35.330 --> 03:54:35.340 align:start position:0%
would make unrestricted abortions right
 
03:54:37.849 --> 03:54:37.859 align:start position:0%
up through the ninth month totally legal
 
03:54:40.670 --> 03:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
which is out of the mainstream of what
 
03:54:44.050 --> 03:54:44.060 align:start position:0%
the people in this state I believe want
 
03:54:48.769 --> 03:54:48.779 align:start position:0%
43 States currently have restrictions on
 
03:54:52.070 --> 03:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
abortions at six months or even earlier
 
03:54:55.490 --> 03:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
so we would be quite the exception we
 
03:54:57.769 --> 03:54:57.779 align:start position:0%
would be joining perhaps seven other
 
03:55:00.349 --> 03:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
countries in the whole world including
 
03:55:03.950 --> 03:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
North North Korea and China who have
 
03:55:07.969 --> 03:55:07.979 align:start position:0%
absolutely no restrictions on abortion
 
03:55:10.130 --> 03:55:10.140 align:start position:0%
as I look to the committee when you were
 
03:55:11.689 --> 03:55:11.699 align:start position:0%
all here
 
03:55:14.210 --> 03:55:14.220 align:start position:0%
um I could certain that you would
 
03:55:17.330 --> 03:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
probably be quite evenly divided on this
 
03:55:22.429 --> 03:55:22.439 align:start position:0%
issue but I would see suggest that
 
03:55:27.050 --> 03:55:27.060 align:start position:0%
you will have common ground between you
 
03:55:30.950 --> 03:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
and I think in three areas you will find
 
03:55:34.010 --> 03:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
a lot of common ground number one
 
03:55:37.550 --> 03:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
I believe that you and I and all the
 
03:55:39.769 --> 03:55:39.779 align:start position:0%
members of the committee agree that
 
03:55:43.510 --> 03:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
choice is important Pro being being
 
03:55:46.610 --> 03:55:46.620 align:start position:0%
free to make our own decisions and our
 
03:55:49.670 --> 03:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
own choices an American tradition
 
03:55:51.830 --> 03:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
so we believe in choice
 
03:55:55.309 --> 03:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
but I also believe that none of you
 
03:55:59.630 --> 03:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
believe in unrestricted choice
 
03:56:01.610 --> 03:56:01.620 align:start position:0%
you have to think about this our
 
03:56:05.269 --> 03:56:05.279 align:start position:0%
responsibility as Citizens and voters
 
03:56:08.450 --> 03:56:08.460 align:start position:0%
and your responsibility as lawmakers
 
03:56:13.070 --> 03:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
is to have laws in place that restrict
 
03:56:18.110 --> 03:56:18.120 align:start position:0%
choices that harm our ourselves our
 
03:56:21.130 --> 03:56:21.140 align:start position:0%
neighbors and our culture we don't have
 
03:56:24.769 --> 03:56:24.779 align:start position:0%
unrestricted Choice none of us would say
 
03:56:27.610 --> 03:56:27.620 align:start position:0%
it's your free choice that
 
03:56:31.429 --> 03:56:31.439 align:start position:0%
incest is a free choice or rape is a
 
03:56:34.370 --> 03:56:34.380 align:start position:0%
free choice or murder or any other
 
03:56:37.370 --> 03:56:37.380 align:start position:0%
things that we activities that we what
 
03:56:39.469 --> 03:56:39.479 align:start position:0%
can I you're getting pushing up against
 
03:56:41.450 --> 03:56:41.460 align:start position:0%
your time I wonder if I can ask you to
 
03:56:44.330 --> 03:56:44.340 align:start position:0%
sort of sum up please okay
 
03:56:47.150 --> 03:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
for okay first we have Choice the other
 
03:56:49.070 --> 03:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
thing that I think we all have in common
 
03:56:52.189 --> 03:56:52.199 align:start position:0%
as the is that we appreciate the
 
03:56:56.750 --> 03:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
sanctity of life we do want uh and to
 
03:57:00.050 --> 03:57:00.060 align:start position:0%
Value life if any of us saw somebody at
 
03:57:02.150 --> 03:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
the side of the road uh that had been
 
03:57:04.189 --> 03:57:04.199 align:start position:0%
hit by a car you would rush to help them
 
03:57:08.150 --> 03:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
if you were on a suicide line you would
 
03:57:10.429 --> 03:57:10.439 align:start position:0%
try to talk somebody out of committing
 
03:57:12.410 --> 03:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
suicide if you saw somebody wanting to
 
03:57:14.870 --> 03:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
jump off the bridge you would try to
 
03:57:17.450 --> 03:57:17.460 align:start position:0%
protect that life the last thing that I
 
03:57:19.550 --> 03:57:19.560 align:start position:0%
think we have in common is that we all
 
03:57:21.830 --> 03:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
care about women
 
03:57:25.550 --> 03:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
uh this law is not going to be something
 
03:57:27.769 --> 03:57:27.779 align:start position:0%
if we have a late-term abortion that's
 
03:57:29.450 --> 03:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
going to be in the best interest of
 
03:57:32.450 --> 03:57:32.460 align:start position:0%
women no one wants to have a woman and
 
03:57:35.030 --> 03:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
this is my final point no one wants to
 
03:57:38.750 --> 03:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
have a woman give birth or to deliver a
 
03:57:41.929 --> 03:57:41.939 align:start position:0%
dead baby that is not only not in the
 
03:57:45.050 --> 03:57:45.060 align:start position:0%
best interest of the unborn child but
 
03:57:46.790 --> 03:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
it's certainly not in the best interest
 
03:57:50.929 --> 03:57:50.939 align:start position:0%
of women so I implore you please vote no
 
03:57:55.070 --> 03:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 271 so that we have some
 
03:57:58.429 --> 03:57:58.439 align:start position:0%
protections not only for The Unborn but
 
03:58:00.170 --> 03:58:00.180 align:start position:0%
for the women and thank you for your
 
03:58:01.969 --> 03:58:01.979 align:start position:0%

defects in the fetal Life protection act
 
03:59:06.590 --> 03:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
as it is today that will be worked on

um my name is Beth scare and I'm a
 
04:01:11.929 --> 04:01:11.939 align:start position:0%
mother from Nashua I'm here to speak in
 
04:01:14.510 --> 04:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
defense of New Hampshire's fetal Life
 
04:01:17.389 --> 04:01:17.399 align:start position:0%
protection act which protects Healthy
 
04:01:19.550 --> 04:01:19.560 align:start position:0%
Babies just a few weeks from being born
 
04:01:22.910 --> 04:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
from being killed in an abortion
 
04:01:25.070 --> 04:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
um and I'll in my testimony which is on
 
04:01:27.830 --> 04:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
your desks I included a picture
 
04:01:30.830 --> 04:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
of an abortion at 23 weeks
 
04:01:33.530 --> 04:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
a week before the fetal Life protection
 
04:01:35.450 --> 04:01:35.460 align:start position:0%
act kicks in
 
04:01:38.030 --> 04:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
so you can see the gruesome you can see
 
04:01:41.150 --> 04:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
the gruesome procedure here and as an
 
04:01:44.269 --> 04:01:44.279 align:start position:0%
another person testified I included the
 
04:01:47.150 --> 04:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
steps of an abortion a late-term
 
04:01:49.250 --> 04:01:49.260 align:start position:0%
abortion which I won't repeat
 
04:01:51.410 --> 04:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
and as you can see this is a gruesome
 
04:01:53.809 --> 04:01:53.819 align:start position:0%
procedure who here on the committee or
 
04:01:56.870 --> 04:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
who among any of those testifying in
 
04:01:58.490 --> 04:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
support of repealing the fetal Life
 
04:02:01.250 --> 04:02:01.260 align:start position:0%
protection act could stand to watch such
 
04:02:03.110 --> 04:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
a bloody procedure
 
04:02:05.269 --> 04:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
medical professionals reform these
 
04:02:07.309 --> 04:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
abortions have to harden their hearts to
 
04:02:09.849 --> 04:02:09.859 align:start position:0%
the inhumanity of what they are doing
 
04:02:12.170 --> 04:02:12.180 align:start position:0%
many workers who've left the field
 
04:02:14.450 --> 04:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
confessed that they became suicidal
 
04:02:18.650 --> 04:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
after participating in these procedures
 
04:02:21.050 --> 04:02:21.060 align:start position:0%
and despite
 
04:02:23.929 --> 04:02:23.939 align:start position:0%
what some of the other people said it
 
04:02:25.849 --> 04:02:25.859 align:start position:0%
cannot be used to save a pregnant mother
 
04:02:27.590 --> 04:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
in the case of an urgent medical
 
04:02:30.530 --> 04:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
condition because these abortions take
 
04:02:32.090 --> 04:02:32.100 align:start position:0%
multiple days
 
04:02:35.030 --> 04:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
to open up the cervix wide enough to
 
04:02:37.790 --> 04:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
extract the fetus
 
04:02:39.950 --> 04:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
and because of the size of the baby
 
04:02:41.990 --> 04:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
these procedures are dangerous to the
 
04:02:45.229 --> 04:02:45.239 align:start position:0%
mother's health and I'm grateful to Dr
 
04:02:47.510 --> 04:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
Sherman for pointing that out in his
 
04:02:47.520 --> 04:02:49.309 align:start position:0%
Sherman for pointing that out in his
testimony

04:02:49.309 --> 04:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:02:52.189 --> 04:02:52.199 align:start position:0%
and and also
 
04:02:55.490 --> 04:02:55.500 align:start position:0%
um he was very wrong when he said it
 
04:02:57.290 --> 04:02:57.300 align:start position:0%
didn't allow for the help of the mother
 
04:02:59.809 --> 04:02:59.819 align:start position:0%
it allows currently for serious risk of
 
04:03:02.269 --> 04:03:02.279 align:start position:0%
substantial and irreversible impairment
 
04:03:04.670 --> 04:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
of a major bodily function
 
04:03:04.680 --> 04:03:07.189 align:start position:0%
of a major bodily function
so

04:03:07.189 --> 04:03:07.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:03:09.950 --> 04:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
a late-term abortion is just a very bit
 
04:03:13.490 --> 04:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
serious risk for the mother and there's
 
04:03:15.410 --> 04:03:15.420 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
04:03:17.750 --> 04:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
we need to protect the mom and the baby
 
04:03:20.689 --> 04:03:20.699 align:start position:0%
by keeping the fetal Life protection act
 
04:03:21.830 --> 04:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
in place
 
04:03:23.630 --> 04:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
and the reason that Planned Parenthood
 
04:03:25.729 --> 04:03:25.739 align:start position:0%
and the other abortion businesses are so
 
04:03:28.010 --> 04:03:28.020 align:start position:0%
determined to repeal it is because it
 
04:03:30.469 --> 04:03:30.479 align:start position:0%
draws attention to the inhumanity of
 
04:03:32.929 --> 04:03:32.939 align:start position:0%
abortion it's the same re it's the same
 
04:03:34.490 --> 04:03:34.500 align:start position:0%
reason that Planned Parenthood fought
 
04:03:36.469 --> 04:03:36.479 align:start position:0%
tooth and nail against the passage of
 
04:03:39.530 --> 04:03:39.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's fetal homicide law
 
04:03:41.990 --> 04:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
because both the fetal homicide law and
 
04:03:43.630 --> 04:03:43.640 align:start position:0%
the fetal Life protection act
 
04:03:45.950 --> 04:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
demonstrates that the baby's human and
 
04:03:48.889 --> 04:03:48.899 align:start position:0%
deserving of protection please vote in
 
04:03:51.530 --> 04:03:51.540 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate on HB 271 to
 
04:03:53.450 --> 04:03:53.460 align:start position:0%
protect innocent babies from a gruesome
 
04:03:55.309 --> 04:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
death and their mothers from physical
 
04:03:57.830 --> 04:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
harm and the abortion workers from the
 
04:04:00.469 --> 04:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
serious mental health repercussions of
 
04:04:02.450 --> 04:04:02.460 align:start position:0%
participating in these inhumane
 
04:04:06.170 --> 04:04:06.180 align:start position:0%
procedures thanks questions for this way
 
04:04:09.469 --> 04:04:09.479 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
04:04:12.650 --> 04:04:12.660 align:start position:0%
next is Karen Reed
 
04:04:17.330 --> 04:04:17.340 align:start position:0%
and after that uh Ian Hewitt please
 
04:04:19.790 --> 04:04:19.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of
 
04:04:21.950 --> 04:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
this committee I'll keep this short uh
 
04:04:23.330 --> 04:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
my name is Karen Reed I'm a
 
04:04:25.130 --> 04:04:25.140 align:start position:0%
representative for Hillsborough District
 
04:04:28.309 --> 04:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
27 Deering in Francis town but I am here
 
04:04:31.189 --> 04:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
speaking on my own behalf today
 
04:04:36.650 --> 04:04:36.660 align:start position:0%
um I oppose bill um House Bill 271
 
04:04:39.410 --> 04:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
um because
 
04:04:43.070 --> 04:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
in I as a nurse for 30 years
 
04:04:45.710 --> 04:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
um 30 years ago I took an oath to do no
 
04:04:45.720 --> 04:04:46.610 align:start position:0%
um 30 years ago I took an oath to do no
harm

04:04:46.610 --> 04:04:46.620 align:start position:0%
harm
 
04:04:48.710 --> 04:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
that rule has not only guided my
 
04:04:51.170 --> 04:04:51.180 align:start position:0%
professional practice but how I live my
 
04:04:52.429 --> 04:04:52.439 align:start position:0%
life as well
 
04:04:54.950 --> 04:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
I said I stand before you not to change
 
04:04:56.929 --> 04:04:56.939 align:start position:0%
your mind or convince you that I am
 
04:04:58.790 --> 04:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
right or to
 
04:05:01.070 --> 04:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
um but but more to give you something to
 
04:05:03.110 --> 04:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
think about tonight when you state when
 
04:05:05.150 --> 04:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
you're alone with your own thoughts on
 
04:05:06.349 --> 04:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
the way home
 
04:05:09.050 --> 04:05:09.060 align:start position:0%
or when you really have to do us do some
 
04:05:10.490 --> 04:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
soul searching
 
04:05:12.950 --> 04:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
I've been present when life entered the
 
04:05:15.769 --> 04:05:15.779 align:start position:0%
world with all its energetic Sparkle and
 
04:05:17.929 --> 04:05:17.939 align:start position:0%
excitement and I've had the honor and
 
04:05:21.349 --> 04:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
privilege as well to to be there um as
 
04:05:24.889 --> 04:05:24.899 align:start position:0%
life left in its quiet release or in its
 
04:05:27.590 --> 04:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
abrupt and tragic end
 
04:05:29.570 --> 04:05:29.580 align:start position:0%
it is easy to take a life that you
 
04:05:32.030 --> 04:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
cannot see and have no feelings for but
 
04:05:34.610 --> 04:05:34.620 align:start position:0%
taking a life is a slippery slope
 
04:05:37.010 --> 04:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
when when Society kills its children
 
04:05:40.429 --> 04:05:40.439 align:start position:0%
what is the next logical step
 
04:05:43.490 --> 04:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
the old and in in firm all you have to
 
04:05:45.170 --> 04:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
do is look at our neighbors to the north
 
04:05:45.180 --> 04:05:46.550 align:start position:0%
do is look at our neighbors to the north
Canada

04:05:46.550 --> 04:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
Canada
 
04:05:49.570 --> 04:05:49.580 align:start position:0%
who now practices made medical
 
04:05:52.729 --> 04:05:52.739 align:start position:0%
assistance in dying they're looking to
 
04:05:56.269 --> 04:05:56.279 align:start position:0%
expand that to anyone who who seeks this
 
04:05:59.570 --> 04:05:59.580 align:start position:0%
service young old or just down on their
 
04:05:59.580 --> 04:06:01.370 align:start position:0%
service young old or just down on their
luck

04:06:01.370 --> 04:06:01.380 align:start position:0%
luck
 
04:06:04.450 --> 04:06:04.460 align:start position:0%
take a moment to Google Ezekiel Ram
 
04:06:08.210 --> 04:06:08.220 align:start position:0%
Emmanuel Ram's brother Ezekiel was the
 
04:06:11.330 --> 04:06:11.340 align:start position:0%
health advisor for President Obama and
 
04:06:15.050 --> 04:06:15.060 align:start position:0%
he was a bioethicist who believed that
 
04:06:18.530 --> 04:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
in the name of social justice that
 
04:06:22.130 --> 04:06:22.140 align:start position:0%
anyone under 14 were over 50 wasn't
 
04:06:25.130 --> 04:06:25.140 align:start position:0%
deserving of care that Health Care
 
04:06:25.140 --> 04:06:26.809 align:start position:0%
deserving of care that Health Care
rationing

04:06:26.809 --> 04:06:26.819 align:start position:0%
rationing
 
04:06:31.550 --> 04:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:33.889 --> 04:06:33.899 align:start position:0%
take if you have a moment watch the
 
04:06:35.990 --> 04:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
movie The Giver or read the book the
 
04:06:38.510 --> 04:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
movie had Kurt Russell and Katie Holmes
 
04:06:43.010 --> 04:06:43.020 align:start position:0%
it was a story of a world where only the
 
04:06:43.020 --> 04:06:44.269 align:start position:0%
it was a story of a world where only the
perfect

04:06:44.269 --> 04:06:44.279 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
04:06:46.790 --> 04:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
um got to live babies who were not
 
04:06:49.130 --> 04:06:49.140 align:start position:0%
perfect or disposed of and everybody
 
04:06:51.889 --> 04:06:51.899 align:start position:0%
looked lived in their similar perfect
 
04:06:51.899 --> 04:06:56.450 align:start position:0%
looked lived in their similar perfect
commonness

04:06:56.450 --> 04:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:56.460 --> 04:06:59.450 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:06:59.450 --> 04:06:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:04.610 --> 04:07:04.620 align:start position:0%
look at so under that you know Insight
 
04:07:06.650 --> 04:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
when you go home and look at your family
 
04:07:09.110 --> 04:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
album your aunts your uncles your mother
 
04:07:11.689 --> 04:07:11.699 align:start position:0%
your father your grandparents who is
 
04:07:13.670 --> 04:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
deserving to live who
 
04:07:15.950 --> 04:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
who would have been not made it if
 
04:07:17.750 --> 04:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
abortion or
 
04:07:20.689 --> 04:07:20.699 align:start position:0%
um Healthcare rationing does become a
 
04:07:20.699 --> 04:07:21.650 align:start position:0%
um Healthcare rationing does become a
reality

04:07:21.650 --> 04:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
reality
 
04:07:25.550 --> 04:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
so I guess the my point being today is
 
04:07:29.389 --> 04:07:29.399 align:start position:0%
to allow one
 
04:07:33.110 --> 04:07:33.120 align:start position:0%
segment of the population to be aborted
 
04:07:36.469 --> 04:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
it's opening up to you know to a society
 
04:07:39.229 --> 04:07:39.239 align:start position:0%
that doesn't value life in general and
 
04:07:41.650 --> 04:07:41.660 align:start position:0%
we run the potential of becoming a
 
04:07:44.030 --> 04:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
country in a state that does not value
 
04:07:48.170 --> 04:07:48.180 align:start position:0%
life and becomes more of a culture that
 
04:07:51.469 --> 04:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
um you know accepts death as a normal
 
04:07:51.479 --> 04:07:52.910 align:start position:0%
um you know accepts death as a normal
outcome

04:07:52.910 --> 04:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
outcome
 
04:07:54.590 --> 04:07:54.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you questions
 
04:07:56.389 --> 04:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
to this Witness
 
04:07:59.450 --> 04:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
no questions being none thank you
 
04:08:01.910 --> 04:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
um next I'm going to call on Ian Hewitt
 
04:08:04.630 --> 04:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
and after that will be dick
 
04:08:07.429 --> 04:08:07.439 align:start position:0%
La Luna
 
04:08:11.090 --> 04:08:11.100 align:start position:0%
um I hope I pronounced that correct
 
04:08:15.469 --> 04:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:17.510 --> 04:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:08:19.670 --> 04:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
representatives for uh giving up your
 
04:08:22.370 --> 04:08:22.380 align:start position:0%
lunch time to hear both sides of this
 
04:08:22.380 --> 04:08:24.469 align:start position:0%
lunch time to hear both sides of this
issue

04:08:24.469 --> 04:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:08:26.870 --> 04:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
Ian Hewitt appearing for Cornerstone in
 
04:08:29.349 --> 04:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill
 
04:08:33.290 --> 04:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
271. we appreciate that this bill is
 
04:08:35.269 --> 04:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
honest and consistent in what it
 
04:08:37.309 --> 04:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
represents but it will surprise no one
 
04:08:39.849 --> 04:08:39.859 align:start position:0%
that Cornerstone opposes forthrightly
 
04:08:42.290 --> 04:08:42.300 align:start position:0%
legalizing abortion weeks or hours
 
04:08:46.070 --> 04:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
before birth for any or no reason I
 
04:08:47.510 --> 04:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to make myself available to
 
04:08:49.849 --> 04:08:49.859 align:start position:0%
answer any legal questions about our law
 
04:08:52.370 --> 04:08:52.380 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire which by the way had
 
04:08:54.710 --> 04:08:54.720 align:start position:0%
full hearings in both houses of the
 
04:08:57.110 --> 04:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
legislature as a standalone Bill and
 
04:08:58.969 --> 04:08:58.979 align:start position:0%
received majority votes in both houses
 
04:09:02.330 --> 04:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
as a standalone item before being signed
 
04:09:05.030 --> 04:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
by the governor but I did want to First
 
04:09:07.910 --> 04:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
bring two points to your attention I've
 
04:09:09.830 --> 04:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
heard a number of things today that were
 
04:09:11.450 --> 04:09:11.460 align:start position:0%
demonstrably false but I don't expect
 
04:09:13.070 --> 04:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
I'll be able to answer all of them
 
04:09:14.950 --> 04:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
unless you all have a lot of questions
 
04:09:17.570 --> 04:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
first of all Massachusetts until
 
04:09:21.349 --> 04:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
December of 2020 had a felony six-month
 
04:09:23.630 --> 04:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
abortion prohibition which had no
 
04:09:26.929 --> 04:09:26.939 align:start position:0%
exceptions for fatal fetal anomalies and
 
04:09:28.849 --> 04:09:28.859 align:start position:0%
being a six-month abortion prohibition
 
04:09:31.189 --> 04:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
like most late term abortion laws that
 
04:09:32.929 --> 04:09:32.939 align:start position:0%
have ever existed in the country did not
 
04:09:35.389 --> 04:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
have an exception for rape most
 
04:09:37.550 --> 04:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
criticisms you'll hear of our law can be
 
04:09:40.550 --> 04:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
resolved with that fact alone if our law
 
04:09:43.849 --> 04:09:43.859 align:start position:0%
is Extreme for some undefined reason was
 
04:09:47.090 --> 04:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
massachusetts's law extreme before 2021
 
04:09:49.610 --> 04:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
if our law is going to cause Physicians
 
04:09:51.469 --> 04:09:51.479 align:start position:0%
to flee from New Hampshire did that
 
04:09:54.530 --> 04:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
happen in Massachusetts in 2020 of
 
04:09:56.689 --> 04:09:56.699 align:start position:0%
course last year the legislature added a
 
04:09:58.550 --> 04:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
fatal fetal anomalies exception to our
 
04:10:00.410 --> 04:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
law which Massachusetts did not have
 
04:10:04.370 --> 04:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
before December of 2020 and so our law
 
04:10:06.410 --> 04:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
is now more moderate than a law that
 
04:10:07.969 --> 04:10:07.979 align:start position:0%
existed in the Commonwealth of
 
04:10:10.370 --> 04:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts less than three years ago
 
04:10:12.950 --> 04:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
secondly as far as the views of the
 
04:10:14.809 --> 04:10:14.819 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire on this issue
 
04:10:17.210 --> 04:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
poll after poll at this point has shown
 
04:10:19.849 --> 04:10:19.859 align:start position:0%
60 to 65 percent of people in New
 
04:10:21.769 --> 04:10:21.779 align:start position:0%
Hampshire support some limits on
 
04:10:24.650 --> 04:10:24.660 align:start position:0%
abortion including a majority of
 
04:10:26.689 --> 04:10:26.699 align:start position:0%
unregistered and independent voters and
 
04:10:29.090 --> 04:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
depending on the poll between a quarter
 
04:10:31.910 --> 04:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
and a third of democratic voters in fact
 
04:10:34.729 --> 04:10:34.739 align:start position:0%
polls show that the more information is
 
04:10:37.070 --> 04:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
given to people being pulled on what our
 
04:10:39.650 --> 04:10:39.660 align:start position:0%
law says the more supportive people are
 
04:10:43.130 --> 04:10:43.140 align:start position:0%
of the law a March 2022 poll found that
 
04:10:45.530 --> 04:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
when our law is accurately described as
 
04:10:47.510 --> 04:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
quote a Prohibition at six months of
 
04:10:49.610 --> 04:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
pregnancy with exceptions for the
 
04:10:52.130 --> 04:10:52.140 align:start position:0%
mother's life and physical health it
 
04:10:54.650 --> 04:10:54.660 align:start position:0%
does not have even majority opposition
 
04:10:57.710 --> 04:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
among Democratic voters and 24 percent
 
04:11:00.110 --> 04:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire Democrats support are
 
04:11:02.030 --> 04:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
strongly supported typically what you'll
 
04:11:03.710 --> 04:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
hear people on the other side of this do
 
04:11:05.570 --> 04:11:05.580 align:start position:0%
is they'll say that a majority of people
 
04:11:07.309 --> 04:11:07.319 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire think abortion should
 
04:11:09.889 --> 04:11:09.899 align:start position:0%
be legal in quote unquote all or most
 
04:11:09.899 --> 04:11:10.910 align:start position:0%
be legal in quote unquote all or most
cases

04:11:10.910 --> 04:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
cases
 
04:11:12.950 --> 04:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
but consistently when you look at those
 
04:11:14.809 --> 04:11:14.819 align:start position:0%
polls whether it's Pew or American
 
04:11:17.510 --> 04:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
values Atlas you will see that what
 
04:11:19.309 --> 04:11:19.319 align:start position:0%
people have done is they have combined
 
04:11:21.889 --> 04:11:21.899 align:start position:0%
the plurality that supports moderate
 
04:11:23.929 --> 04:11:23.939 align:start position:0%
restrictions and nothing further with
 
04:11:26.150 --> 04:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
the minority that supports unlimited
 
04:11:28.790 --> 04:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
abortion up to birth papering over this
 
04:11:32.150 --> 04:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
really unquantifiable moral Gulf sphere
 
04:11:35.630 --> 04:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
you're kind of uh you're you're at your
 
04:11:39.050 --> 04:11:39.060 align:start position:0%
time so if you want to ask you to sum up
 
04:11:40.250 --> 04:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
if you would please well if you're
 
04:11:41.870 --> 04:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
giving me an additional sentence Mr
 
04:11:44.570 --> 04:11:44.580 align:start position:0%
chair I'll just say that when you hear
 
04:11:46.790 --> 04:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
that statistic all or most bear in mind
 
04:11:49.130 --> 04:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
that most people in that category are
 
04:11:50.929 --> 04:11:50.939 align:start position:0%
more aligned with this law than with
 
04:11:53.750 --> 04:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
those trying to repeal it I would be
 
04:11:56.150 --> 04:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
happy to take any legal questions about
 
04:11:57.830 --> 04:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
the law or abortion law generally if I
 
04:12:00.469 --> 04:12:00.479 align:start position:0%
may Mr chair all right thank you uh
 
04:12:03.590 --> 04:12:03.600 align:start position:0%

seeing none thank you Mr Hewitt um next
 
04:12:09.290 --> 04:12:09.300 align:start position:0%

04:12:22.490 --> 04:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
LeBlanc from Gary from Derry New
 
04:12:24.710 --> 04:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire first of all I want to point
 
04:12:27.110 --> 04:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
out to everybody here with I'm here for
 
04:12:29.090 --> 04:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
self I'm not here to point send you some
 
04:12:30.830 --> 04:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
moms that might want they have an
 
04:12:34.070 --> 04:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
abortion not report woman
 
04:12:37.610 --> 04:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
that one not to have an abortion we're
 
04:12:39.110 --> 04:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
not here to judge
 
04:12:41.870 --> 04:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
but I am here my parents by the way had
 
04:12:45.769 --> 04:12:45.779 align:start position:0%
13 kids you know and my aunt had 13 kids
 
04:12:47.630 --> 04:12:47.640 align:start position:0%
so I guess you know where I stand on the
 
04:12:47.640 --> 04:12:50.389 align:start position:0%
so I guess you know where I stand on the
issue

04:12:50.389 --> 04:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:55.610 --> 04:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:57.889 --> 04:12:57.899 align:start position:0%
this seeks the elimination of the
 
04:13:00.889 --> 04:13:00.899 align:start position:0%
recently passed fetal protection act
 
04:13:03.830 --> 04:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
recently passed
 
04:13:07.550 --> 04:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
by our respiring presidential hopeful
 
04:13:10.429 --> 04:13:10.439 align:start position:0%
Governor it was signed by him a bill
 
04:13:13.610 --> 04:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
that allowed abortion up to 24 weeks and
 
04:13:17.450 --> 04:13:17.460 align:start position:0%
yet hit where we have some training not
 
04:13:20.990 --> 04:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
only to eliminate and recall the 24 week
 
04:13:23.389 --> 04:13:23.399 align:start position:0%
feed of protection act but to allow
 
04:13:26.150 --> 04:13:26.160 align:start position:0%
abortion all the way up the bird
 
04:13:28.250 --> 04:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
there were over 1 million abortions in
 
04:13:30.110 --> 04:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
our country last year you know when
 
04:13:32.269 --> 04:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
you're here tell me how these abortions
 
04:13:34.070 --> 04:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
have anything to do with women's health
 
04:13:36.650 --> 04:13:36.660 align:start position:0%
or being pregnant these days is
 
04:13:39.410 --> 04:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
unhealthy and inconvenient to one's
 
04:13:42.229 --> 04:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
lifestyle and why even when abortions
 
04:13:44.389 --> 04:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
are reliable
 
04:13:47.990 --> 04:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
up to 24 weeks then it is necessary to
 
04:13:50.090 --> 04:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
try to repeal the 24
 
04:13:53.450 --> 04:13:53.460 align:start position:0%
weeks the bottom line
 
04:13:55.910 --> 04:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
is it because the bottom line
 
04:13:58.969 --> 04:13:58.979 align:start position:0%
like organizations such as planned
 
04:14:02.330 --> 04:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
parenthood profit much by every abortion
 
04:14:04.910 --> 04:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
and they'll make much to political
 
04:14:07.330 --> 04:14:07.340 align:start position:0%
entities that result in favorable
 
04:14:10.610 --> 04:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
legislation that help Planned Parenthood
 
04:14:14.330 --> 04:14:14.340 align:start position:0%
in other such organisms organizations to
 
04:14:16.250 --> 04:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
Blossom financially
 
04:14:18.590 --> 04:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
no I am not a radical Christian
 
04:14:21.469 --> 04:14:21.479 align:start position:0%
conservative as you can see
 
04:14:26.030 --> 04:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
I think I look normal don't I uh
 
04:14:28.250 --> 04:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
no response
 
04:14:30.650 --> 04:14:30.660 align:start position:0%
and yes I will always pray for my
 
04:14:32.269 --> 04:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
opponents who have a change of heart
 
04:14:35.870 --> 04:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
always help and support parents in need
 
04:14:38.210 --> 04:14:38.220 align:start position:0%
they were organizations by the way like
 
04:14:41.630 --> 04:14:41.640 align:start position:0%
real options in Manchester and Mantua uh
 
04:14:44.809 --> 04:14:44.819 align:start position:0%
burnt right Gianna's House they helping
 
04:14:44.819 --> 04:14:46.070 align:start position:0%
burnt right Gianna's House they helping
advise

04:14:46.070 --> 04:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
advise
 
04:14:48.170 --> 04:14:48.180 align:start position:0%
pregnant woman
 
04:14:49.969 --> 04:14:49.979 align:start position:0%
hopefully to advise them in the
 
04:14:53.170 --> 04:14:53.180 align:start position:0%
direction of birth of their child
 
04:14:56.269 --> 04:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
ah almost done as for me I will always
 
04:14:58.070 --> 04:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
speak for the babies yet to be born
 
04:15:00.950 --> 04:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully a voice for the voiceless a
 
04:15:04.070 --> 04:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
voice for reason and love for The Unborn
 
04:15:07.309 --> 04:15:07.319 align:start position:0%
babies I have one final question for you
 
04:15:11.389 --> 04:15:11.399 align:start position:0%

04:15:18.050 --> 04:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:19.729 --> 04:15:19.739 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you

and the next witness after that will be
 
04:15:45.110 --> 04:15:45.120 align:start position:0%

04:15:55.010 --> 04:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
Rochester's Awards one through four and
 
04:15:55.020 --> 04:15:56.990 align:start position:0%
Rochester's Awards one through four and
six

04:15:56.990 --> 04:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
six
 
04:15:59.389 --> 04:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
I had a couple different things prepared
 
04:16:01.189 --> 04:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
but I'm just going to actually speak
 
04:16:04.189 --> 04:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
from my own personal experience in uh
 
04:16:05.990 --> 04:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
speaking with
 
04:16:07.490 --> 04:16:07.500 align:start position:0%
thousands of people actually in
 
04:16:09.650 --> 04:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
Rochester during my campaign
 
04:16:12.889 --> 04:16:12.899 align:start position:0%
I knocked on every door it didn't matter
 
04:16:15.889 --> 04:16:15.899 align:start position:0%
whether they had an R by their name or a
 
04:16:18.229 --> 04:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
d by their name and I told people the
 
04:16:18.239 --> 04:16:19.309 align:start position:0%
d by their name and I told people the
truth

04:16:19.309 --> 04:16:19.319 align:start position:0%
truth
 
04:16:21.830 --> 04:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
and I believe that this law that's
 
04:16:23.870 --> 04:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
currently in place so that's why I
 
04:16:27.229 --> 04:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
strongly oppose of course this repeal
 
04:16:27.239 --> 04:16:28.189 align:start position:0%
strongly oppose of course this repeal
um

04:16:28.189 --> 04:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:28.199 --> 04:16:30.170 align:start position:0%
um
is

04:16:30.170 --> 04:16:30.180 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:16:31.790 --> 04:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
is very minimal we're just like
 
04:16:33.950 --> 04:16:33.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh it's still extremely
 
04:16:36.229 --> 04:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
liberal one month two months three
 
04:16:38.330 --> 04:16:38.340 align:start position:0%
months four months five month six month
 
04:16:41.150 --> 04:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
for any reason whatsoever it's only in
 
04:16:43.130 --> 04:16:43.140 align:start position:0%
the seventh eighth and my month and I
 
04:16:45.530 --> 04:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
told people the truth
 
04:16:45.540 --> 04:16:46.969 align:start position:0%
told people the truth
especially

04:16:46.969 --> 04:16:46.979 align:start position:0%
especially
 
04:16:49.610 --> 04:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
um I'm a pro-life person and I told them
 
04:16:51.349 --> 04:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
that I was pro-life but I spoke with
 
04:16:53.389 --> 04:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
pro-choice people and I know I won their
 
04:16:55.550 --> 04:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
vote because I told them the truth about
 
04:16:57.590 --> 04:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
what the law was on the books
 
04:16:59.510 --> 04:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
and there's been a lot of things here
 
04:17:01.490 --> 04:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
that have that have gone on during the
 
04:17:03.830 --> 04:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
campaign and it's just it was a lot of
 
04:17:05.450 --> 04:17:05.460 align:start position:0%
heated rhetoric
 
04:17:07.309 --> 04:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
and nobody ever told people the truth
 
04:17:09.590 --> 04:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
about what the law was and some of the
 
04:17:11.689 --> 04:17:11.699 align:start position:0%
people that I talked to that were
 
04:17:11.699 --> 04:17:13.250 align:start position:0%
people that I talked to that were
adamantly

04:17:13.250 --> 04:17:13.260 align:start position:0%
adamantly
 
04:17:19.550 --> 04:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:22.490 --> 04:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
and I turned I I turned their minds I
 
04:17:24.050 --> 04:17:24.060 align:start position:0%
turned their hearts
 
04:17:26.269 --> 04:17:26.279 align:start position:0%
and I think if we just
 
04:17:29.450 --> 04:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
focus on that I don't understand why we
 
04:17:29.460 --> 04:17:30.410 align:start position:0%
focus on that I don't understand why we
are

04:17:30.410 --> 04:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:17:32.389 --> 04:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
wanting to repeal something that is
 
04:17:34.969 --> 04:17:34.979 align:start position:0%
truly common sense
 
04:17:37.429 --> 04:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
also I guess throughout this this
 
04:17:40.250 --> 04:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
hearing it has been repeated multiple
 
04:17:44.510 --> 04:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
times that this um that this
 
04:17:47.450 --> 04:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
Health exception is narrow
 
04:17:49.849 --> 04:17:49.859 align:start position:0%
that's not the truth
 
04:17:52.670 --> 04:17:52.680 align:start position:0%
right now the health exception that we
 
04:17:55.969 --> 04:17:55.979 align:start position:0%
have is exactly the same as the parental
 
04:17:58.309 --> 04:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
Health notification law that has been on
 
04:18:00.710 --> 04:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
the books for 10 years
 
04:18:03.410 --> 04:18:03.420 align:start position:0%
I repeat it has been on the books for 10
 
04:18:03.420 --> 04:18:04.670 align:start position:0%
I repeat it has been on the books for 10
years

04:18:04.670 --> 04:18:04.680 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:18:07.550 --> 04:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
so it is not narrow in the regards with
 
04:18:09.710 --> 04:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
the health exception it's exactly the
 
04:18:12.410 --> 04:18:12.420 align:start position:0%
same as what we have now
 
04:18:14.330 --> 04:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much my testimony I know
 
04:18:16.309 --> 04:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
you guys have been hearing a lot so if
 
04:18:18.050 --> 04:18:18.060 align:start position:0%
you have any questions thank you very
 
04:18:21.050 --> 04:18:21.060 align:start position:0%
much questions for this Witness
 
04:18:23.210 --> 04:18:23.220 align:start position:0%
you see none thank you
 
04:18:27.010 --> 04:18:27.020 align:start position:0%
um Kathy Holmes and then uh Jason
 
04:18:30.650 --> 04:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
Hennessy uh next
 
04:18:33.290 --> 04:18:33.300 align:start position:0%
thank you I hope to keep this under two
 
04:18:33.300 --> 04:18:34.429 align:start position:0%
thank you I hope to keep this under two
minutes

04:18:34.429 --> 04:18:34.439 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
04:18:38.750 --> 04:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh what is the driving force that's
 
04:18:42.110 --> 04:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
pushing later and later abortions
 
04:18:45.050 --> 04:18:45.060 align:start position:0%
it's money it's always money
 
04:18:47.510 --> 04:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
the left has successfully muzzled
 
04:18:51.290 --> 04:18:51.300 align:start position:0%
project veracas which exposed the
 
04:18:54.290 --> 04:18:54.300 align:start position:0%
industry of selling baby organs
 
04:18:57.110 --> 04:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
the organs they get the most money for
 
04:19:00.050 --> 04:19:00.060 align:start position:0%
are the late term ones in the video
 
04:19:03.010 --> 04:19:03.020 align:start position:0%
Planned Parenthood lady was advising
 
04:19:05.750 --> 04:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
crushed the head so that you don't
 
04:19:07.550 --> 04:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
damage the organs they'll be more
 
04:19:07.560 --> 04:19:08.870 align:start position:0%
damage the organs they'll be more
valuable

04:19:08.870 --> 04:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
valuable
 
04:19:08.880 --> 04:19:10.510 align:start position:0%
valuable
but

04:19:10.510 --> 04:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:19:14.090 --> 04:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
the powers of the government which are
 
04:19:15.710 --> 04:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
really people
 
04:19:18.469 --> 04:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
uh they have
 
04:19:24.050 --> 04:19:24.060 align:start position:0%
caved they've stifled the truth in the
 
04:19:27.469 --> 04:19:27.479 align:start position:0%
video and even confiscated stuff from
 
04:19:30.650 --> 04:19:30.660 align:start position:0%
his house now my question is how can the
 
04:19:33.830 --> 04:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
left be against slavery but in favor of
 
04:19:36.950 --> 04:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
selling baby parts
 
04:19:40.429 --> 04:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
and if some of you could share my
 
04:19:42.590 --> 04:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
thoughts with the absent ones when you
 
04:19:44.750 --> 04:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
are debating then I'll appreciate that
 
04:19:46.189 --> 04:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:19:49.610 --> 04:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for this Witness
 
04:19:51.769 --> 04:19:51.779 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
04:19:58.250 --> 04:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:59.870 --> 04:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
04:20:01.790 --> 04:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Jason Hennessey I'm the
 
04:20:03.050 --> 04:20:03.060 align:start position:0%
president for New Hampshire right to
 
04:20:05.090 --> 04:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
life which is the largest dedicated
 
04:20:06.969 --> 04:20:06.979 align:start position:0%
pro-life organization in New Hampshire
 
04:20:09.889 --> 04:20:09.899 align:start position:0%
and I there's been a lot of amazing
 
04:20:11.990 --> 04:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
testimony uh just for the record we're
 
04:20:14.389 --> 04:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
against HB 271 in case anybody who's
 
04:20:16.130 --> 04:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
confused about that
 
04:20:16.140 --> 04:20:17.570 align:start position:0%
confused about that
um

04:20:17.570 --> 04:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:19.670 --> 04:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
I I just wanted to relate this to a
 
04:20:20.990 --> 04:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
story that you probably heard in the
 
04:20:23.630 --> 04:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
news that is probably disjoint in your
 
04:20:26.389 --> 04:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
minds and that is the story of this uh
 
04:20:29.809 --> 04:20:29.819 align:start position:0%
this this baby that was born in a in a
 
04:20:32.870 --> 04:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
tent outside in December in Manchester
 
04:20:35.269 --> 04:20:35.279 align:start position:0%
and uh what happened is that this baby
 
04:20:36.650 --> 04:20:36.660 align:start position:0%
was born outside in the freezing
 
04:20:36.660 --> 04:20:38.630 align:start position:0%
was born outside in the freezing
temperatures

04:20:38.630 --> 04:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
temperatures
 
04:20:40.849 --> 04:20:40.859 align:start position:0%
um and and there's a a lot of heart
 
04:20:40.859 --> 04:20:42.229 align:start position:0%
um and and there's a a lot of heart
swell

04:20:42.229 --> 04:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
swell
 
04:20:44.150 --> 04:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
um concern about this baby the First
 
04:20:45.710 --> 04:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
Responders got involved they searched
 
04:20:48.830 --> 04:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
for this baby uh after after some some
 
04:20:50.689 --> 04:20:50.699 align:start position:0%
time some hours they found they found
 
04:20:52.250 --> 04:20:52.260 align:start position:0%
him they brought him to the hospital and
 
04:20:55.790 --> 04:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
thank God he was fine as far as I know
 
04:20:58.550 --> 04:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
but I want to ask you the question if we
 
04:21:02.450 --> 04:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
pass HP 271 and repeal the flpa
 
04:21:05.269 --> 04:21:05.279 align:start position:0%
all that all that heartfelt protection
 
04:21:07.550 --> 04:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
or desire to protect this baby that we
 
04:21:09.290 --> 04:21:09.300 align:start position:0%
have in society
 
04:21:11.389 --> 04:21:11.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have applied to him to just one
 
04:21:13.490 --> 04:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
week before
 
04:21:14.990 --> 04:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
so I want to ask you the question what's
 
04:21:17.210 --> 04:21:17.220 align:start position:0%
the difference between this baby just
 
04:21:19.910 --> 04:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
hours literally hours after he's born
 
04:21:23.630 --> 04:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:25.550 --> 04:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
04:21:27.530 --> 04:21:27.540 align:start position:0%
you know we had so in this case there
 
04:21:28.849 --> 04:21:28.859 align:start position:0%
were charges brought against people who
 
04:21:30.710 --> 04:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
hindered the First Responders looking
 
04:21:32.389 --> 04:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
for that child
 
04:21:35.330 --> 04:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
and you know the the late term abortions
 
04:21:36.889 --> 04:21:36.899 align:start position:0%
that are covered by the flpa which are
 
04:21:38.809 --> 04:21:38.819 align:start position:0%
six months and Beyond
 
04:21:41.570 --> 04:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
you know that baby is closer to to being
 
04:21:45.290 --> 04:21:45.300 align:start position:0%
born than they were to being conceived
 
04:21:47.389 --> 04:21:47.399 align:start position:0%
so repealing this would would legalize
 
04:21:47.399 --> 04:21:48.710 align:start position:0%
so repealing this would would legalize
abortion

04:21:48.710 --> 04:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
04:21:51.110 --> 04:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
through birth every Le every level of
 
04:21:53.990 --> 04:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
human civilization that uh is applicable
 
04:21:56.210 --> 04:21:56.220 align:start position:0%
here today
 
04:21:58.490 --> 04:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
disagrees with repealing this if you
 
04:22:00.110 --> 04:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
look at the statistics the the New
 
04:22:01.429 --> 04:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Institute of politics poll
 
04:22:04.370 --> 04:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
from August of last year said over 70
 
04:22:05.689 --> 04:22:05.699 align:start position:0%
percent of New Hampshire agrees with
 
04:22:08.030 --> 04:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
abortion restrictions at some point this
 
04:22:09.650 --> 04:22:09.660 align:start position:0%
is the most moderate latest point you
 
04:22:11.330 --> 04:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
could have it
 
04:22:13.670 --> 04:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
if you look at the United States 43
 
04:22:15.229 --> 04:22:15.239 align:start position:0%
States according to a pro-choice
 
04:22:17.630 --> 04:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
research group gutmocker have have
 
04:22:20.510 --> 04:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
protections at this place or earlier
 
04:22:22.729 --> 04:22:22.739 align:start position:0%
so on so the vast majority of the states
 
04:22:24.889 --> 04:22:24.899 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the world my last I
 
04:22:27.130 --> 04:22:27.140 align:start position:0%
checked there were only seven countries
 
04:22:29.689 --> 04:22:29.699 align:start position:0%
that don't pre that don't protect the
 
04:22:31.550 --> 04:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
the pre-born children at this stage or
 
04:22:33.830 --> 04:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
earlier amongst those are known are
 
04:22:35.929 --> 04:22:35.939 align:start position:0%
those known for tragic human or other
 
04:22:38.210 --> 04:22:38.220 align:start position:0%
human rights violations like China and
 
04:22:43.070 --> 04:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:45.590 --> 04:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
so the uh one thing I wanted to address
 
04:22:47.630 --> 04:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
the statistics that are there's not a
 
04:22:48.830 --> 04:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
lot of Statistics but there are a couple
 
04:22:50.570 --> 04:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
states that do keep statistics on the
 
04:22:52.429 --> 04:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
reasons for late-term abortions
 
04:22:55.070 --> 04:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
the the stats that we do have show that
 
04:22:56.450 --> 04:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
the majority of them are actually
 
04:22:58.790 --> 04:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
elective they wouldn't fall into rape
 
04:22:58.800 --> 04:23:00.229 align:start position:0%
elective they wouldn't fall into rape
incest

04:23:00.229 --> 04:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
incest
 
04:23:02.389 --> 04:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
um or health of the mother or fetal
 
04:23:04.969 --> 04:23:04.979 align:start position:0%
anomaly kind of classification so if New
 
04:23:05.990 --> 04:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is like the rest of the
 
04:23:08.150 --> 04:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
country that's probably the case here as
 
04:23:08.160 --> 04:23:09.170 align:start position:0%
country that's probably the case here as
well

04:23:09.170 --> 04:23:09.180 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:23:12.229 --> 04:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
the flpa protects not just a baby's life
 
04:23:14.269 --> 04:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
it also protects the mother's life as
 
04:23:16.250 --> 04:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
you heard uh late-term abortions are
 
04:23:19.370 --> 04:23:19.380 align:start position:0%
very very risky and you can so you're
 
04:23:21.410 --> 04:23:21.420 align:start position:0%
you're kind of getting over your time I
 
04:23:23.210 --> 04:23:23.220 align:start position:0%
appreciate if you sum up please okay
 
04:23:24.830 --> 04:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I will say I will sum
 
04:23:25.790 --> 04:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
up quickly
 
04:23:28.969 --> 04:23:28.979 align:start position:0%
uh so nobody no mother in New Hampshire
 
04:23:30.950 --> 04:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
is required to raise the child New
 
04:23:32.870 --> 04:23:32.880 align:start position:0%

purpose of government this fits with the
 
04:23:41.870 --> 04:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
ethics of the vast majority of citizens
 
04:23:43.130 --> 04:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
in the state in this country in this
 
04:23:43.140 --> 04:23:43.849 align:start position:0%
in the state in this country in this
world

04:23:43.849 --> 04:23:43.859 align:start position:0%

questions for this witness yes
 
04:23:54.170 --> 04:23:54.180 align:start position:0%
representative Staples
 
04:23:56.210 --> 04:23:56.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:23:58.010 --> 04:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:24:00.349 --> 04:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
was an interesting term you was the
 
04:24:01.670 --> 04:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
choice of
 
04:24:04.010 --> 04:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
the baby to be born
 
04:24:08.570 --> 04:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
if we repeal this protection
 
04:24:13.309 --> 04:24:13.319 align:start position:0%
do we not obliterate that initiative if
 
04:24:15.290 --> 04:24:15.300 align:start position:0%
not choice at least
 
04:24:19.010 --> 04:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
initiative in nature for the child to be
 
04:24:19.020 --> 04:24:20.269 align:start position:0%
initiative in nature for the child to be
born

04:24:20.269 --> 04:24:20.279 align:start position:0%
born
 
04:24:20.279 --> 04:24:22.070 align:start position:0%
born
and

04:24:22.070 --> 04:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:24:25.250 --> 04:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
does that comport with
 
04:24:25.260 --> 04:24:27.229 align:start position:0%
does that comport with
personhood

04:24:27.229 --> 04:24:27.239 align:start position:0%
personhood
 
04:24:30.590 --> 04:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
of being a person in the 14th Amendment
 
04:24:33.530 --> 04:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
of the U.S Constitution
 
04:24:36.290 --> 04:24:36.300 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh I I am not a
 
04:24:39.469 --> 04:24:39.479 align:start position:0%
lawyer but as a as an armchair reader
 
04:24:42.469 --> 04:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
and and uh lover of the US Constitution
 
04:24:45.229 --> 04:24:45.239 align:start position:0%
I I do believe that you can't take away
 
04:24:48.110 --> 04:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
somebody's life without due process and
 
04:24:48.120 --> 04:24:49.010 align:start position:0%
somebody's life without due process and
so

04:24:49.010 --> 04:24:49.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:24:51.830 --> 04:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh apart especially a viable child would
 
04:24:53.630 --> 04:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
be recognized by the vast majority of
 
04:24:56.689 --> 04:24:56.699 align:start position:0%
Americans as as a person in in deserving
 
04:24:58.250 --> 04:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
of Rights
 
04:24:59.510 --> 04:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:25:03.710 --> 04:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:05.570 --> 04:25:05.580 align:start position:0%

and I'm going to ask my vice chair
 
04:25:32.870 --> 04:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative Wallace if he will take
 
04:25:34.550 --> 04:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
over and introduce the hearing on the
 
04:25:37.010 --> 04:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
next bill House Bill 88 I'm going to
 
04:25:50.750 --> 04:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:53.210 --> 04:25:53.220 align:start position:0%
okay we'll now openly
 
04:25:55.070 --> 04:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing on House Bill 88 and
 
04:26:02.149 --> 04:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:05.809 --> 04:26:05.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:08.149 --> 04:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone my name is
 
04:26:10.910 --> 04:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
representative Alexis Simpson I'm from
 
04:26:13.910 --> 04:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
Rockingham District 33 representing the
 
04:26:16.729 --> 04:26:16.739 align:start position:0%
people of Exeter Stratham New Market and
 
04:26:20.389 --> 04:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
new fields I'm honored to introduce hb88
 
04:26:23.990 --> 04:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
the access to abortion Care Act
 
04:26:27.170 --> 04:26:27.180 align:start position:0%
since we introduced this bill last year
 
04:26:29.090 --> 04:26:29.100 align:start position:0%
the Roe versus Wade Supreme Court
 
04:26:31.550 --> 04:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
decision is no longer the law of the
 
04:26:31.560 --> 04:26:32.630 align:start position:0%
decision is no longer the law of the
land

04:26:32.630 --> 04:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
land
 
04:26:35.570 --> 04:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
since Roe v Wade was overturned I have
 
04:26:37.969 --> 04:26:37.979 align:start position:0%
heard from my constituents and people
 
04:26:40.550 --> 04:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
across the state that they are scared
 
04:26:43.010 --> 04:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
they aren't sure if they are protected
 
04:26:44.750 --> 04:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire
 
04:26:47.090 --> 04:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
and if they will have access to the care
 
04:26:49.849 --> 04:26:49.859 align:start position:0%
they need and even more so they're
 
04:26:51.830 --> 04:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
scared of what the future looks like for
 
04:26:54.290 --> 04:26:54.300 align:start position:0%
their children and grandchildren
 
04:26:56.450 --> 04:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
it may seem that these fears are
 
04:26:59.330 --> 04:26:59.340 align:start position:0%
overstated but most of my constituents
 
04:27:01.490 --> 04:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
watch the national news
 
04:27:04.010 --> 04:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
they've watched as state after State
 
04:27:07.070 --> 04:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
across the country has banned abortion
 
04:27:10.070 --> 04:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
early in pregnancy before people even
 
04:27:12.769 --> 04:27:12.779 align:start position:0%
know they're pregnant and in some cases
 
04:27:15.290 --> 04:27:15.300 align:start position:0%
banned abortion completely
 
04:27:17.809 --> 04:27:17.819 align:start position:0%
in a time when people are uncertain
 
04:27:21.070 --> 04:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
about so many things the cost of housing
 
04:27:24.830 --> 04:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
electricity and child care to name a few
 
04:27:27.649 --> 04:27:27.659 align:start position:0%
losing control over your body and the
 
04:27:29.870 --> 04:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
ability to make decisions about the
 
04:27:32.389 --> 04:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
security of your family's future is
 
04:27:32.399 --> 04:27:33.410 align:start position:0%
security of your family's future is
scary

04:27:33.410 --> 04:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
scary
 
04:27:35.929 --> 04:27:35.939 align:start position:0%
as a mother myself I understand those
 
04:27:35.939 --> 04:27:37.189 align:start position:0%
as a mother myself I understand those
fears

04:27:37.189 --> 04:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
fears
 
04:27:39.830 --> 04:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
there's no decision more critical than
 
04:27:44.269 --> 04:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
if when and how to start and grow a
 
04:27:44.279 --> 04:27:45.769 align:start position:0%
if when and how to start and grow a
family

04:27:45.769 --> 04:27:45.779 align:start position:0%
family
 
04:27:47.990 --> 04:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
I want to be really clear about what
 
04:27:50.570 --> 04:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
this bill does and does not do
 
04:27:53.269 --> 04:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
this bill does not change any current
 
04:27:56.210 --> 04:27:56.220 align:start position:0%
abortion laws it does not change the
 
04:27:59.389 --> 04:27:59.399 align:start position:0%
24-week ban at all it does not change
 
04:28:03.410 --> 04:28:03.420 align:start position:0%
the parental notification law instead it
 
04:28:05.809 --> 04:28:05.819 align:start position:0%
puts into state law that the state
 
04:28:09.410 --> 04:28:09.420 align:start position:0%
cannot further restrict or interfere in
 
04:28:11.330 --> 04:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
an individual's ability to access
 
04:28:11.340 --> 04:28:13.010 align:start position:0%
an individual's ability to access
abortion

04:28:13.010 --> 04:28:13.020 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
04:28:16.250 --> 04:28:16.260 align:start position:0%
currently there's a legal void regarding
 
04:28:18.229 --> 04:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
the affirmative right to an abortion in
 
04:28:19.490 --> 04:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:28:21.830 --> 04:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that grants Granite
 
04:28:24.469 --> 04:28:24.479 align:start position:0%
Staters abortion rights there are only
 
04:28:26.630 --> 04:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
restrictions and the restrictions are
 
04:28:26.640 --> 04:28:28.610 align:start position:0%
restrictions and the restrictions are
clear

04:28:28.610 --> 04:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
clear
 
04:28:30.649 --> 04:28:30.659 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is one of three states
 
04:28:33.530 --> 04:28:33.540 align:start position:0%
where abortion is legal but not
 
04:28:36.229 --> 04:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
protected and New Hampshire is the only
 
04:28:38.450 --> 04:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
state in New England without this
 
04:28:40.189 --> 04:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
affirmative right
 
04:28:43.309 --> 04:28:43.319 align:start position:0%
our neighboring states all have this
 
04:28:45.349 --> 04:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
type of statutory language on their
 
04:28:47.689 --> 04:28:47.699 align:start position:0%
books it may be worded slightly
 
04:28:50.510 --> 04:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
differently but Maine's law for example
 
04:28:54.469 --> 04:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
is almost identical to this bill's text
 
04:28:56.210 --> 04:28:56.220 align:start position:0%
let me quote it
 
04:28:58.610 --> 04:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
it is the public policy of the state
 
04:29:01.490 --> 04:29:01.500 align:start position:0%
that the state not restrict a woman's
 
04:29:04.070 --> 04:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
exercise of her private decision to
 
04:29:06.769 --> 04:29:06.779 align:start position:0%
terminate a pregnancy
 
04:29:08.330 --> 04:29:08.340 align:start position:0%
end quote
 
04:29:10.969 --> 04:29:10.979 align:start position:0%
and then their specific ban on abortion
 
04:29:13.370 --> 04:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
is listed there
 
04:29:17.389 --> 04:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
similar to Maine's language in HB 88 the
 
04:29:19.969 --> 04:29:19.979 align:start position:0%
access to abortion Care Act we have
 
04:29:22.070 --> 04:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
included the current abortion laws
 
04:29:26.330 --> 04:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
though we've used the rsas as reference
 
04:29:28.490 --> 04:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does not have explicit
 
04:29:30.830 --> 04:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
State protections for abortion the
 
04:29:33.469 --> 04:29:33.479 align:start position:0%
access to abortion Care Act adds Clarity
 
04:29:37.189 --> 04:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
on where we the legislature stand and
 
04:29:39.410 --> 04:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
what our intent is for abortion laws in
 
04:29:40.550 --> 04:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:29:43.490 --> 04:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
indeed perhaps this bill wasn't needed
 
04:29:45.590 --> 04:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
when there was a federal legal framework
 
04:29:48.229 --> 04:29:48.239 align:start position:0%
for abortion rights but all that has
 
04:29:51.050 --> 04:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
changed with the overturning of Roe
 
04:29:53.030 --> 04:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
we have an obligation to our
 
04:29:55.729 --> 04:29:55.739 align:start position:0%
constituents the overwhelming majority
 
04:29:57.649 --> 04:29:57.659 align:start position:0%
of whom believe that decisions about
 
04:30:00.769 --> 04:30:00.779 align:start position:0%
reproduction and abortion care belong to
 
04:30:02.870 --> 04:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
pregnant people and the people who
 
04:30:04.370 --> 04:30:04.380 align:start position:0%
provide them care
 
04:30:06.590 --> 04:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters are looking to us
 
04:30:09.649 --> 04:30:09.659 align:start position:0%
they're elected officials right now for
 
04:30:12.110 --> 04:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
clarity and security
 
04:30:15.170 --> 04:30:15.180 align:start position:0%
access to abortion care up to 24 weeks
 
04:30:17.750 --> 04:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
is legal in New Hampshire and we should
 
04:30:20.210 --> 04:30:20.220 align:start position:0%
reassure our constituents by securing
 
04:30:23.149 --> 04:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
this in statute passing the access to
 
04:30:25.550 --> 04:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
abortion Care Act will show the people
 
04:30:28.550 --> 04:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
that we understand what is at stake and
 
04:30:31.370 --> 04:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
that we trust them and their doctors
 
04:30:35.990 --> 04:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:39.410 --> 04:30:39.420 align:start position:0%
any questions representative Simpson
 
04:30:42.050 --> 04:30:42.060 align:start position:0%
representative mcbeath
 
04:30:43.670 --> 04:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
04:30:45.769 --> 04:30:45.779 align:start position:0%
question um representative Simpson
 
04:30:47.870 --> 04:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to clarify so this
 
04:30:50.090 --> 04:30:50.100 align:start position:0%
bill will do nothing it will not repeal
 
04:30:50.100 --> 04:30:50.990 align:start position:0%
bill will do nothing it will not repeal
the

04:30:50.990 --> 04:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:30:53.450 --> 04:30:53.460 align:start position:0%
um 24-week ban that Governor sununu
 
04:30:55.550 --> 04:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
signed into law two years ago is that
 
04:30:55.560 --> 04:30:58.070 align:start position:0%
signed into law two years ago is that
correct

04:30:58.070 --> 04:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:59.149 --> 04:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:31:01.969 --> 04:31:01.979 align:start position:0%
representative you are correct this does
 
04:31:05.750 --> 04:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
not change the 24-week abortion ban in
 
04:31:05.760 --> 04:31:07.130 align:start position:0%
not change the 24-week abortion ban in
statute

04:31:07.130 --> 04:31:07.140 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:31:08.389 --> 04:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:31:10.250 --> 04:31:10.260 align:start position:0%
representative greeson
 
04:31:11.689 --> 04:31:11.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:31:12.969 --> 04:31:12.979 align:start position:0%
representative for taking our questions
 
04:31:17.090 --> 04:31:17.100 align:start position:0%
uh in the uh in the bill lines 13 and 14
 
04:31:19.790 --> 04:31:19.800 align:start position:0%
say an individual injured as a result of
 
04:31:22.070 --> 04:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
a violation of this chapter shall have a
 
04:31:24.050 --> 04:31:24.060 align:start position:0%
private right of action in Superior
 
04:31:25.729 --> 04:31:25.739 align:start position:0%
Court against the state for injunctive
 
04:31:28.070 --> 04:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
Relief arising from the violation would
 
04:31:31.010 --> 04:31:31.020 align:start position:0%
this not then prohibit a doctor from
 
04:31:33.170 --> 04:31:33.180 align:start position:0%
refusing to perform an abortion against
 
04:31:35.990 --> 04:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:37.250 --> 04:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:31:37.260 --> 04:31:38.990 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
representative

04:31:38.990 --> 04:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:31:41.870 --> 04:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
I believe that under the enforcement
 
04:31:44.149 --> 04:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
section of the bill you're pointing to
 
04:31:47.510 --> 04:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
It lines 13 and 14. that this is
 
04:31:47.520 --> 04:31:48.590 align:start position:0%
It lines 13 and 14. that this is
actually

04:31:48.590 --> 04:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:31:51.469 --> 04:31:51.479 align:start position:0%
um just against the state and actor of
 
04:31:54.950 --> 04:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
the state not a private actor
 
04:31:57.710 --> 04:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
which a doctor would be unless they were
 
04:32:01.189 --> 04:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
employed by the state I would presume
 
04:32:04.790 --> 04:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:07.370 --> 04:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question uh
 
04:32:11.210 --> 04:32:11.220 align:start position:0%
during your presentation you made uh the
 
04:32:13.790 --> 04:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
statement that uh uh in New Hampshire
 
04:32:17.030 --> 04:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's abortion is legal but not protected
 
04:32:20.389 --> 04:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
could you explain what you mean by that
 
04:32:21.830 --> 04:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question
 
04:32:25.429 --> 04:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
representative so right now abortion is
 
04:32:28.309 --> 04:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
legal up to 24 weeks the 24-week ban
 
04:32:32.149 --> 04:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
starts right then but there is no place
 
04:32:35.389 --> 04:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
in the statute where it is
 
04:32:40.670 --> 04:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:43.849 --> 04:32:43.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:45.410 --> 04:32:45.420 align:start position:0%
any further questions for representative
 
04:32:45.420 --> 04:32:47.889 align:start position:0%
any further questions for representative
Simpson

04:32:47.889 --> 04:32:47.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:50.689 --> 04:32:50.699 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:32:53.030 --> 04:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh we we now call Senator Perkins
 
04:32:53.040 --> 04:33:00.710 align:start position:0%
uh we we now call Senator Perkins
Hawkeye

04:33:00.710 --> 04:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:02.990 --> 04:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman members of the
 
04:33:04.849 --> 04:33:04.859 align:start position:0%
committee I am Senator Rebecca Perkins
 
04:33:07.131 --> 04:33:07.141 align:start position:0%
quoka here to represent district 21
 
04:33:09.170 --> 04:33:09.180 align:start position:0%
which is the city of Portsmouth and the
 
04:33:13.010 --> 04:33:13.020 align:start position:0%
surrounding towns in support of HB 88.
 
04:33:15.830 --> 04:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
in 2021 I was a first-term Senator and
 
04:33:18.470 --> 04:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
one of two young moms in the chamber
 
04:33:20.330 --> 04:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
as many of you may remember the same
 
04:33:22.070 --> 04:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
term new abortion restrictions were
 
04:33:24.949 --> 04:33:24.959 align:start position:0%
passed into law through our budget
 
04:33:27.709 --> 04:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
I was just around 24 weeks pregnant when
 
04:33:29.570 --> 04:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
we first debated this bill
 
04:33:31.490 --> 04:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
I was experiencing firsthand how
 
04:33:33.590 --> 04:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
frightening frightening it is to think
 
04:33:35.810 --> 04:33:35.820 align:start position:0%
you won't be allowed a full range of
 
04:33:37.849 --> 04:33:37.859 align:start position:0%
medical care that was available to you
 
04:33:39.769 --> 04:33:39.779 align:start position:0%
when you started a journey
 
04:33:41.990 --> 04:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
no future parent should ever again have
 
04:33:43.730 --> 04:33:43.740 align:start position:0%
to worry that their rights will be taken
 
04:33:43.740 --> 04:33:45.349 align:start position:0%
to worry that their rights will be taken
away

04:33:45.349 --> 04:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
away
 
04:33:48.769 --> 04:33:48.779 align:start position:0%
last year this same bill the access to
 
04:33:51.349 --> 04:33:51.359 align:start position:0%
abortion Care Act was introduced to
 
04:33:52.910 --> 04:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
guarantee the right to abortion before
 
04:33:55.310 --> 04:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
24 weeks in New Hampshire
 
04:33:58.250 --> 04:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
months later the Supreme Court leaked
 
04:33:59.750 --> 04:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
the eventual dabs decision that
 
04:34:02.390 --> 04:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
overturned Roe leaving folks across the
 
04:34:03.949 --> 04:34:03.959 align:start position:0%
country vulnerable
 
04:34:06.170 --> 04:34:06.180 align:start position:0%
it didn't take long for many to lose
 
04:34:08.990 --> 04:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
their rights today around 20 million
 
04:34:11.150 --> 04:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
people have lost access to abortion in
 
04:34:13.849 --> 04:34:13.859 align:start position:0%
their home state including one in three
 
04:34:17.029 --> 04:34:17.039 align:start position:0%
American women of reproductive age
 
04:34:18.769 --> 04:34:18.779 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire there is nothing giving
 
04:34:20.510 --> 04:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
the affirmative right to an abortion
 
04:34:23.029 --> 04:34:23.039 align:start position:0%
prior to 24 weeks in this chamber
 
04:34:25.070 --> 04:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
nothing to prevent what is happening
 
04:34:26.990 --> 04:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
across the country to reach our state
 
04:34:27.000 --> 04:34:27.949 align:start position:0%
across the country to reach our state
too

04:34:27.949 --> 04:34:27.959 align:start position:0%
too
 
04:34:30.470 --> 04:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
the overturning of Roe versus Wade means
 
04:34:32.269 --> 04:34:32.279 align:start position:0%
that the entire legal framework for
 
04:34:34.789 --> 04:34:34.799 align:start position:0%
Reproductive Rights no longer exists
 
04:34:36.349 --> 04:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is one of three states
 
04:34:38.449 --> 04:34:38.459 align:start position:0%
where abortion is legal but not
 
04:34:40.910 --> 04:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
protected as we just heard about with
 
04:34:42.789 --> 04:34:42.799 align:start position:0%
new court cases starting to come out
 
04:34:45.170 --> 04:34:45.180 align:start position:0%
including one that could affect a form
 
04:34:47.631 --> 04:34:47.641 align:start position:0%
of abortion in every state including New
 
04:34:47.641 --> 04:34:48.470 align:start position:0%
of abortion in every state including New
Hampshire

04:34:48.470 --> 04:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:34:51.289 --> 04:34:51.299 align:start position:0%
we need to fill the void on our books
 
04:34:53.390 --> 04:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
for a state that Prides itself on local
 
04:34:55.670 --> 04:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
control we must enact a New Hampshire
 
04:34:59.631 --> 04:34:59.641 align:start position:0%
solution before one is imposed upon us
 
04:35:02.449 --> 04:35:02.459 align:start position:0%
last session we tried to do just that we
 
04:35:04.250 --> 04:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
garnered bipartisan support in this
 
04:35:06.051 --> 04:35:06.061 align:start position:0%
chamber but ultimately fell one vote
 
04:35:07.789 --> 04:35:07.799 align:start position:0%
short in the Senate
 
04:35:09.590 --> 04:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
some of my colleagues said we needed to
 
04:35:11.330 --> 04:35:11.340 align:start position:0%
wait for the Supreme Court to act before
 
04:35:12.709 --> 04:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
we took action
 
04:35:14.689 --> 04:35:14.699 align:start position:0%
for many a world without Roe seemed
 
04:35:14.699 --> 04:35:15.949 align:start position:0%
for many a world without Roe seemed
impossible

04:35:15.949 --> 04:35:15.959 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
04:35:17.631 --> 04:35:17.641 align:start position:0%
for many more still the idea that
 
04:35:19.131 --> 04:35:19.141 align:start position:0%
abortion could ever be illegal in New
 
04:35:21.230 --> 04:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire seemed impossible
 
04:35:23.390 --> 04:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
I for one at this point am not willing
 
04:35:25.970 --> 04:35:25.980 align:start position:0%
to wait and see any longer we must act
 
04:35:27.650 --> 04:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
now to ensure the women of New Hampshire
 
04:35:29.390 --> 04:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
are protected
 
04:35:31.369 --> 04:35:31.379 align:start position:0%
this bill is not radical
 
04:35:33.529 --> 04:35:33.539 align:start position:0%
it does not even change state law or
 
04:35:36.230 --> 04:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
amend parental notification instead it
 
04:35:38.449 --> 04:35:38.459 align:start position:0%
makes good on something that 71 of
 
04:35:40.609 --> 04:35:40.619 align:start position:0%
Granite State or support access to
 
04:35:42.529 --> 04:35:42.539 align:start position:0%
reproductive Health Care
 
04:35:44.570 --> 04:35:44.580 align:start position:0%
it's also about respect
 
04:35:46.310 --> 04:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
it's about respect for the women who
 
04:35:48.051 --> 04:35:48.061 align:start position:0%
bear the important responsibility of
 
04:35:50.449 --> 04:35:50.459 align:start position:0%
carrying our society's children and for
 
04:35:51.769 --> 04:35:51.779 align:start position:0%
their right to personal physical
 
04:35:51.779 --> 04:35:53.330 align:start position:0%
their right to personal physical
autonomy

04:35:53.330 --> 04:35:53.340 align:start position:0%
autonomy
 
04:35:55.970 --> 04:35:55.980 align:start position:0%
we are women mothers and pregnant people
 
04:35:58.310 --> 04:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
and when we are pregnant our ability to
 
04:36:00.410 --> 04:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
be complex highly intelligent decision
 
04:36:02.449 --> 04:36:02.459 align:start position:0%
makers doesn't change
 
04:36:04.369 --> 04:36:04.379 align:start position:0%
I urge you to support a not to pass
 
04:36:06.830 --> 04:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
recommendation on HP 88 and I'm happy to
 
04:36:10.551 --> 04:36:10.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:13.849 --> 04:36:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:15.709 --> 04:36:15.719 align:start position:0%
see none thank you thank you very much
 
04:36:19.310 --> 04:36:19.320 align:start position:0%

and you've asked for 10 minutes from
 
04:36:22.670 --> 04:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
maybe shave it down a bit
 
04:36:24.650 --> 04:36:24.660 align:start position:0%
oh 10 minutes I don't need 10 minutes
 
04:36:25.910 --> 04:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
pardon me
 
04:36:28.131 --> 04:36:28.141 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair good afternoon
 
04:36:29.570 --> 04:36:29.580 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
04:36:31.849 --> 04:36:31.859 align:start position:0%
my name is Becky Whitley and I'm honored
 
04:36:33.769 --> 04:36:33.779 align:start position:0%
to represent Senate District 15 which
 
04:36:36.109 --> 04:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
includes the communities of Beau Concord
 
04:36:38.090 --> 04:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
Penacook and Hopkinton thank you very
 
04:36:39.949 --> 04:36:39.959 align:start position:0%
much for welcoming me to your chamber
 
04:36:42.349 --> 04:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
and I'm here to testify in support of HB
 
04:36:45.470 --> 04:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
88. so I'm gonna talk a little bit about
 
04:36:47.330 --> 04:36:47.340 align:start position:0%
the legal background about how we
 
04:36:49.609 --> 04:36:49.619 align:start position:0%
arrived at the need for this bill so as
 
04:36:52.310 --> 04:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
many folks know 50 years ago Roe v Wade
 
04:36:54.470 --> 04:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
was decided by the U.S Supreme Court and
 
04:36:57.230 --> 04:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
made abortion a constitutional right in
 
04:36:59.570 --> 04:36:59.580 align:start position:0%
all 50 states the Supreme Court later
 
04:37:02.269 --> 04:37:02.279 align:start position:0%
affirmed that decision in the Casey case
 
04:37:04.730 --> 04:37:04.740 align:start position:0%
these rulings gave people the right to
 
04:37:07.429 --> 04:37:07.439 align:start position:0%
access abortion legally in every state
 
04:37:09.830 --> 04:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
although of course that didn't mean that
 
04:37:12.470 --> 04:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
everyone had that the same amount of
 
04:37:15.470 --> 04:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
access last year just last year the
 
04:37:18.289 --> 04:37:18.299 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court overturned 50 years of
 
04:37:20.150 --> 04:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
legal precedent when it decided the
 
04:37:22.010 --> 04:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
Dobbs V Jackson Women's Health
 
04:37:24.890 --> 04:37:24.900 align:start position:0%
Organization case the overturning of Roe
 
04:37:27.590 --> 04:37:27.600 align:start position:0%
v Wade in the Dobbs case means that the
 
04:37:30.410 --> 04:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
entire constitutional framework for
 
04:37:33.470 --> 04:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
Reproductive Rights no longer exists it
 
04:37:36.529 --> 04:37:36.539 align:start position:0%
was white clean no there's no longer a
 
04:37:38.209 --> 04:37:38.219 align:start position:0%
federally constitutionally protected
 
04:37:41.390 --> 04:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
right to access abortion in our country
 
04:37:43.369 --> 04:37:43.379 align:start position:0%
that means that the legal landscape
 
04:37:46.010 --> 04:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
across the country and in New Hampshire
 
04:37:51.051 --> 04:37:51.061 align:start position:0%
without Roe v Wade is recklessly unclear
 
04:37:53.510 --> 04:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
in the Dobbs case the Supreme Court left
 
04:37:55.510 --> 04:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
the issue of Reproductive Rights
 
04:37:59.029 --> 04:37:59.039 align:start position:0%
squarely with State legislatures and
 
04:38:00.949 --> 04:38:00.959 align:start position:0%
with State politicians like me and you
 
04:38:04.250 --> 04:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
well here we are it's our turn to act
 
04:38:07.010 --> 04:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
and it's our turn to listen to the vast
 
04:38:09.170 --> 04:38:09.180 align:start position:0%
majority of Grant Staters who support
 
04:38:11.990 --> 04:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
the rights that we had under Roe v Wade
 
04:38:15.529 --> 04:38:15.539 align:start position:0%
our constituents are watching us and
 
04:38:18.109 --> 04:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
they're waiting for us to act
 
04:38:20.810 --> 04:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
many states like Missouri have tried and
 
04:38:22.970 --> 04:38:22.980 align:start position:0%
are continuing to try to restrict
 
04:38:25.429 --> 04:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
patients from accessing abortion in
 
04:38:26.689 --> 04:38:26.699 align:start position:0%
other states
 
04:38:29.150 --> 04:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
the Texas abortion ban includes a bounty
 
04:38:31.131 --> 04:38:31.141 align:start position:0%
hunter provision allowing essentially
 
04:38:34.970 --> 04:38:34.980 align:start position:0%
any individual anywhere to seek a civil
 
04:38:37.970 --> 04:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
lawsuit against anyone who obeyed who
 
04:38:40.131 --> 04:38:40.141 align:start position:0%
AIDS and abats an abortion which is a
 
04:38:41.570 --> 04:38:41.580 align:start position:0%
provision that has not been struck down
 
04:38:43.310 --> 04:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
by the U.S Supreme Court
 
04:38:45.410 --> 04:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
local municipalities across the country
 
04:38:47.330 --> 04:38:47.340 align:start position:0%
are also attempting to pass local
 
04:38:49.429 --> 04:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
ordinances including to restrict
 
04:38:53.150 --> 04:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
medication abortion as seen in Minnesota
 
04:38:57.230 --> 04:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
this bill before us hb88 would give New
 
04:38:59.990 --> 04:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a legal lend to stand on not
 
04:39:03.890 --> 04:39:03.900 align:start position:0%
if but when another state tries to reach
 
04:39:03.900 --> 04:39:05.510 align:start position:0%
if but when another state tries to reach
in

04:39:05.510 --> 04:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:39:06.769 --> 04:39:06.779 align:start position:0%
two years ago the New Hampshire
 
04:39:08.631 --> 04:39:08.641 align:start position:0%
legislature passed a law Banning
 
04:39:10.670 --> 04:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
abortion at 24 weeks with very very
 
04:39:13.250 --> 04:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
limited exceptions as part of that law
 
04:39:17.150 --> 04:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
which is now RSA 329.49 that law states
 
04:39:19.810 --> 04:39:19.820 align:start position:0%
nothing in the subdivision shall be
 
04:39:23.689 --> 04:39:23.699 align:start position:0%
construed as creating or recognizing a
 
04:39:25.189 --> 04:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
right to abortion
 
04:39:27.529 --> 04:39:27.539 align:start position:0%
that means that in New Hampshire we do
 
04:39:29.990 --> 04:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
not have a law protecting access to
 
04:39:33.109 --> 04:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
abortion before 20 weeks but the passage
 
04:39:36.109 --> 04:39:36.119 align:start position:0%
of HB 88 would put this right explicitly
 
04:39:39.050 --> 04:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
into state law just to be crystal clear
 
04:39:41.630 --> 04:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
the bill before you does not amend the
 
04:39:44.810 --> 04:39:44.820 align:start position:0%
24-week ban it does not amend parental
 
04:39:47.510 --> 04:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
notification it simply addresses the
 
04:39:49.788 --> 04:39:49.798 align:start position:0%
legal void in our state laws and
 
04:39:52.010 --> 04:39:52.020 align:start position:0%
provides Clarity for nearly half of our
 
04:39:52.020 --> 04:39:53.868 align:start position:0%
provides Clarity for nearly half of our
population

04:39:53.868 --> 04:39:53.878 align:start position:0%
population
 
04:39:55.610 --> 04:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is one of three states
 
04:39:58.430 --> 04:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
where abortion is technically legal but
 
04:40:01.670 --> 04:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
not protected This legal gray area is
 
04:40:04.130 --> 04:40:04.140 align:start position:0%
confusing and disconcerting to Granite
 
04:40:05.930 --> 04:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
Staters as they look around the country
 
04:40:09.350 --> 04:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
as millions and millions of women lose
 
04:40:12.350 --> 04:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
access to their reproductive freedom
 
04:40:14.330 --> 04:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
Granite theaters need these protections
 
04:40:17.150 --> 04:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
and we need them now there is an urgency
 
04:40:19.610 --> 04:40:19.620 align:start position:0%
and often a panic when I talk to my
 
04:40:22.490 --> 04:40:22.500 align:start position:0%
constituents and my contemporaries what
 
04:40:24.590 --> 04:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
is going to happen in New Hampshire do
 
04:40:27.350 --> 04:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire politicians value freedom
 
04:40:30.350 --> 04:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
will they step up to protect my right to
 
04:40:32.510 --> 04:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
determine my own future
 
04:40:34.970 --> 04:40:34.980 align:start position:0%
this bill would make it crystal clear to
 
04:40:37.130 --> 04:40:37.140 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters and to a future New
 
04:40:39.288 --> 04:40:39.298 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court what the intent
 
04:40:42.288 --> 04:40:42.298 align:start position:0%
of this legislature is we have a void on
 
04:40:45.410 --> 04:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
the books an unresolved status there is
 
04:40:47.750 --> 04:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
nothing in New Hampshire law that any
 
04:40:50.030 --> 04:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
judge can point to which says the intent
 
04:40:52.490 --> 04:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
of the new of New Hampshire law and the
 
04:40:55.010 --> 04:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
legislature is that abortion is legal up
 
04:40:58.130 --> 04:40:58.140 align:start position:0%
to 24 weeks the only Clarity in New
 
04:41:00.050 --> 04:41:00.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law is the Restriction to
 
04:41:00.060 --> 04:41:01.310 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law is the Restriction to
abortion

04:41:01.310 --> 04:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
04:41:03.288 --> 04:41:03.298 align:start position:0%
do we want to be a state that starts
 
04:41:05.090 --> 04:41:05.100 align:start position:0%
with the presumption of the unknown
 
04:41:08.090 --> 04:41:08.100 align:start position:0%
because that is where we are right now
 
04:41:11.990 --> 04:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
as we speak 25 million people have lost
 
04:41:13.930 --> 04:41:13.940 align:start position:0%
access to abortion in their home state
 
04:41:17.390 --> 04:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
including one in three American women of
 
04:41:20.330 --> 04:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
reproductive age this is staggering and
 
04:41:22.430 --> 04:41:22.440 align:start position:0%
something I never thought I would see in
 
04:41:23.990 --> 04:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
my lifetime
 
04:41:26.510 --> 04:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
I'm scared and the women in my life are
 
04:41:26.520 --> 04:41:27.650 align:start position:0%
I'm scared and the women in my life are
scared

04:41:27.650 --> 04:41:27.660 align:start position:0%
scared
 
04:41:29.810 --> 04:41:29.820 align:start position:0%
that we won't have the freedom to
 
04:41:32.510 --> 04:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
determine our own Futures and the course
 
04:41:35.090 --> 04:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
of Our Lives that we will net that that
 
04:41:37.250 --> 04:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
the rights to bodily autonomy will be
 
04:41:39.470 --> 04:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
taken away from us that we will be
 
04:41:41.810 --> 04:41:41.820 align:start position:0%
forced to carry pregnancies against our
 
04:41:45.590 --> 04:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
will it sounds dystopian because it is
 
04:41:47.330 --> 04:41:47.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and I respectfully
 
04:41:49.550 --> 04:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
ask for the committee's support of hb88
 
04:41:53.570 --> 04:41:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:53.580 --> 04:41:56.690 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:41:56.690 --> 04:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:59.930 --> 04:41:59.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh the
 
04:42:02.990 --> 04:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
previous speaker made the same statement
 
04:42:04.610 --> 04:42:04.620 align:start position:0%
that you did that
 
04:42:06.590 --> 04:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
uh in New Hampshire
 
04:42:08.510 --> 04:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
the abortion is illegal but an honor
 
04:42:10.070 --> 04:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
protected right
 
04:42:13.190 --> 04:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh could you please explain to me how
 
04:42:15.230 --> 04:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
House Bill 88 will make it a protected
 
04:42:17.030 --> 04:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
right yeah thank you very much for that
 
04:42:18.410 --> 04:42:18.420 align:start position:0%
question this is the confusing area
 
04:42:21.170 --> 04:42:21.180 align:start position:0%
right the reason why we say it's legal
 
04:42:22.610 --> 04:42:22.620 align:start position:0%
is because there are no current
 
04:42:24.708 --> 04:42:24.718 align:start position:0%
restrictions the only restrictions on
 
04:42:28.490 --> 04:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
abortion are at that 24-week period but
 
04:42:30.530 --> 04:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
there is nothing in state law and in
 
04:42:32.930 --> 04:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
fact existing law says it very clearly
 
04:42:34.970 --> 04:42:34.980 align:start position:0%
there's nothing about the right to
 
04:42:38.448 --> 04:42:38.458 align:start position:0%
access abortion up to 24 weeks it's our
 
04:42:41.090 --> 04:42:41.100 align:start position:0%
law is silent
 
04:42:43.070 --> 04:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
no follow-up
 
04:42:43.080 --> 04:42:45.830 align:start position:0%
no follow-up
uh

04:42:45.830 --> 04:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:42:49.030 --> 04:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
I know that uh representative Gleason
 
04:42:52.070 --> 04:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
active asked this question earlier but I
 
04:42:54.890 --> 04:42:54.900 align:start position:0%
must not have been listening on lines uh
 
04:42:58.910 --> 04:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
13 and 14. there's a statement that uh
 
04:43:01.670 --> 04:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
an individual suffering an injury could
 
04:43:03.890 --> 04:43:03.900 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah could you please explain
 
04:43:06.830 --> 04:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
what kind of Entry is covered in this
 
04:43:10.550 --> 04:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
yep so thank you for that question so
 
04:43:14.330 --> 04:43:14.340 align:start position:0%
the bill is very simple pair uh lines 8
 
04:43:16.850 --> 04:43:16.860 align:start position:0%
through 11 give the right so this is
 
04:43:19.850 --> 04:43:19.860 align:start position:0%
very typical statutory construction that
 
04:43:21.948 --> 04:43:21.958 align:start position:0%
part of the bill gives this right right
 
04:43:23.628 --> 04:43:23.638 align:start position:0%
and the right is freedom from
 
04:43:25.788 --> 04:43:25.798 align:start position:0%
governmental intrusion up to this
 
04:43:27.470 --> 04:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
24-week point that's the right
 
04:43:29.448 --> 04:43:29.458 align:start position:0%
government you can't interfere
 
04:43:31.910 --> 04:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
and then the second portion you have a
 
04:43:33.708 --> 04:43:33.718 align:start position:0%
right your right means nothing unless
 
04:43:35.990 --> 04:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's enforced so it's not a penalty it's
 
04:43:38.868 --> 04:43:38.878 align:start position:0%
an enforcement mechanism my right was
 
04:43:40.788 --> 04:43:40.798 align:start position:0%
violated this gives me the legal
 
04:43:44.628 --> 04:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
authority to um to enforce that right so
 
04:43:46.190 --> 04:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
and it's very I just want to be very
 
04:43:48.170 --> 04:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
clear and reiterate the fact that this
 
04:43:50.628 --> 04:43:50.638 align:start position:0%
is only related to governmental action
 
04:43:53.030 --> 04:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
this is not related to private action
 
04:43:55.128 --> 04:43:55.138 align:start position:0%
this is governmental action which again
 
04:43:57.650 --> 04:43:57.660 align:start position:0%
is typical statutory construction the
 
04:43:59.208 --> 04:43:59.218 align:start position:0%
right is freedom from governmental
 
04:44:01.070 --> 04:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
intrusion and this is how you exercise
 
04:44:02.510 --> 04:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
that right
 
04:44:05.448 --> 04:44:05.458 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
04:44:07.730 --> 04:44:07.740 align:start position:0%
representative Perez
 
04:44:09.470 --> 04:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:44:13.670 --> 04:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
not legal I'm not legal so I apologize
 
04:44:16.430 --> 04:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
so again I'm going to do the legal so
 
04:44:18.470 --> 04:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
you're saying right now
 
04:44:21.050 --> 04:44:21.060 align:start position:0%
the law says
 
04:44:21.060 --> 04:44:22.910 align:start position:0%
the law says
you

04:44:22.910 --> 04:44:22.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:44:26.090 --> 04:44:26.100 align:start position:0%
can have an abort it doesn't say you can
 
04:44:28.910 --> 04:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
have an abortion up to 24 weeks it only
 
04:44:31.430 --> 04:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
says when you can't have an abortion is
 
04:44:32.628 --> 04:44:32.638 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
04:44:35.930 --> 04:44:35.940 align:start position:0%
that's correct and then specifically in
 
04:44:38.990 --> 04:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
in statute now as of two years ago the
 
04:44:40.970 --> 04:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
law also States specifically and this is
 
04:44:45.170 --> 04:44:45.180 align:start position:0%
a quote from RSA 329.49 nothing in this
 
04:44:46.850 --> 04:44:46.860 align:start position:0%
subdivision shall be construed as
 
04:44:49.128 --> 04:44:49.138 align:start position:0%
creating or recognizing a right to
 
04:44:51.890 --> 04:44:51.900 align:start position:0%
abortion so it's very clear that we that
 
04:44:54.530 --> 04:44:54.540 align:start position:0%
there is no right to be free from
 
04:44:56.448 --> 04:44:56.458 align:start position:0%
governmental intrusion
 
04:44:59.150 --> 04:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
when a woman seeks an abortion up to
 
04:45:01.368 --> 04:45:01.378 align:start position:0%
that 24-week period have we had any
 
04:45:03.050 --> 04:45:03.060 align:start position:0%
problems with it
 
04:45:05.510 --> 04:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
access to abortion I mean I can't speak
 
04:45:07.190 --> 04:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
to that and I'm surely the providers
 
04:45:09.470 --> 04:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
will be able to seek that but certainly
 
04:45:12.170 --> 04:45:12.180 align:start position:0%
around the country we have seen States
 
04:45:14.628 --> 04:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
rushing in to create those restrictions
 
04:45:17.810 --> 04:45:17.820 align:start position:0%
and I understand that but um have we had
 
04:45:20.628 --> 04:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
have you heard of any women who have had
 
04:45:25.070 --> 04:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
their right to have an abortion up to 21
 
04:45:27.170 --> 04:45:27.180 align:start position:0%
stopped from having that happen I think
 
04:45:28.730 --> 04:45:28.740 align:start position:0%
I'll have to defer that question to our
 
04:45:30.288 --> 04:45:30.298 align:start position:0%
providers in the room but thank you for
 
04:45:34.550 --> 04:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:36.770 --> 04:45:36.780 align:start position:0%
representative Beth
 
04:45:39.050 --> 04:45:39.060 align:start position:0%
thank you um Sharon thank you for taking
 
04:45:41.150 --> 04:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
my question Senator the just because
 
04:45:43.190 --> 04:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
it's been um this the whole thing about
 
04:45:44.930 --> 04:45:44.940 align:start position:0%
going to the superior court for
 
04:45:47.330 --> 04:45:47.340 align:start position:0%
injunction so what somebody would do I I
 
04:45:48.350 --> 04:45:48.360 align:start position:0%
don't know if you could explain what
 
04:45:50.390 --> 04:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
what that is so if somebody's prevented
 
04:45:52.430 --> 04:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
from could you explain the injunction
 
04:45:55.128 --> 04:45:55.138 align:start position:0%
part what that does or yeah well it's
 
04:45:56.448 --> 04:45:56.458 align:start position:0%
been a while since I've been in a
 
04:45:59.030 --> 04:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
courtroom but right so um the
 
04:46:00.948 --> 04:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism and you'll see
 
04:46:05.150 --> 04:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
that online uh 13 and 14 is that if
 
04:46:07.190 --> 04:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
someone believes that their right was
 
04:46:10.190 --> 04:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
violated that the government intruded on
 
04:46:12.530 --> 04:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
their rights as described in eight
 
04:46:14.570 --> 04:46:14.580 align:start position:0%
through eleven they have the ability
 
04:46:16.190 --> 04:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
they have the authority under the
 
04:46:17.930 --> 04:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
statute to go and Superior your court
 
04:46:20.090 --> 04:46:20.100 align:start position:0%
and file an action so that's what it is
 
04:46:22.430 --> 04:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
and then the second part is this is very
 
04:46:24.230 --> 04:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
typical language too if you have an
 
04:46:25.970 --> 04:46:25.980 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism if you have a
 
04:46:28.368 --> 04:46:28.378 align:start position:0%
right of action then you also have this
 
04:46:29.868 --> 04:46:29.878 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
04:46:31.610 --> 04:46:31.620 align:start position:0%
um get injunctive relief so that means
 
04:46:34.128 --> 04:46:34.138 align:start position:0%
injunctive release means government stop
 
04:46:36.288 --> 04:46:36.298 align:start position:0%
you're not allowed to intrude
 
04:46:39.288 --> 04:46:39.298 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:46:42.110 --> 04:46:42.120 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
04:46:44.570 --> 04:46:44.580 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you uh we
 
04:46:50.208 --> 04:46:50.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:58.190 --> 04:46:58.200 align:start position:0%

no one to speak for them and that is all
 
04:47:20.390 --> 04:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:23.330 --> 04:47:23.340 align:start position:0%

04:47:58.788 --> 04:47:58.798 align:start position:0%
here to urge support for this bill and
 
04:48:01.070 --> 04:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
I'm only here to speak about two issues
 
04:48:03.110 --> 04:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
today although I feel very strongly
 
04:48:05.570 --> 04:48:05.580 align:start position:0%
about a breath of them
 
04:48:07.730 --> 04:48:07.740 align:start position:0%
the first issue
 
04:48:10.910 --> 04:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
um is purely a professional many of my
 
04:48:13.490 --> 04:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
constituents are these states best
 
04:48:16.730 --> 04:48:16.740 align:start position:0%
leading OB gyns practitioners and
 
04:48:18.530 --> 04:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
Healthcare professionals
 
04:48:20.868 --> 04:48:20.878 align:start position:0%
uh I'm here to report that they're quite
 
04:48:22.610 --> 04:48:22.620 align:start position:0%
anxious about the current state of our
 
04:48:22.620 --> 04:48:23.390 align:start position:0%
anxious about the current state of our
law

04:48:23.390 --> 04:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:48:25.310 --> 04:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
they feel threatened in fact by the
 
04:48:28.010 --> 04:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
24-week abortion ban the criminalization
 
04:48:29.868 --> 04:48:29.878 align:start position:0%
that goes along with their
 
04:48:32.448 --> 04:48:32.458 align:start position:0%
um practitioning and the requirement in
 
04:48:34.550 --> 04:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
law to disregard the national standards
 
04:48:35.628 --> 04:48:35.638 align:start position:0%
of care
 
04:48:38.208 --> 04:48:38.218 align:start position:0%
in particular against their oath to do
 
04:48:40.850 --> 04:48:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:43.970 --> 04:48:43.980 align:start position:0%
denying abortion care is a very very
 
04:48:46.788 --> 04:48:46.798 align:start position:0%
real harm that we're talking about
 
04:48:49.850 --> 04:48:49.860 align:start position:0%
the the tool of abortion access that has
 
04:48:51.708 --> 04:48:51.718 align:start position:0%
helped make it possible for many of
 
04:48:55.010 --> 04:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
these leading abortion care providers
 
04:48:57.410 --> 04:48:57.420 align:start position:0%
is actually being denied to their
 
04:48:59.390 --> 04:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
patients and they find that very
 
04:49:02.570 --> 04:49:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:02.580 --> 04:49:04.128 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:49:04.128 --> 04:49:04.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:06.948 --> 04:49:06.958 align:start position:0%
you know the ability to have that tool
 
04:49:08.448 --> 04:49:08.458 align:start position:0%
in your pocket as a young professional
 
04:49:10.128 --> 04:49:10.138 align:start position:0%
in trading for these medical professions
 
04:49:12.770 --> 04:49:12.780 align:start position:0%
is what enables them to become women
 
04:49:15.708 --> 04:49:15.718 align:start position:0%
leading their field and you know it's a
 
04:49:17.750 --> 04:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
real kick in the seat to not be able to
 
04:49:19.670 --> 04:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
protect your own patients in the same
 
04:49:19.680 --> 04:49:21.830 align:start position:0%
protect your own patients in the same
way

04:49:21.830 --> 04:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
way
 
04:49:24.470 --> 04:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
I implore this committee to please
 
04:49:26.510 --> 04:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
relieve these Professionals of their
 
04:49:26.520 --> 04:49:27.530 align:start position:0%
relieve these Professionals of their
fears

04:49:27.530 --> 04:49:27.540 align:start position:0%
fears
 
04:49:30.170 --> 04:49:30.180 align:start position:0%
of being prosecuted
 
04:49:32.570 --> 04:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
please pave a clear pathway for these
 
04:49:34.010 --> 04:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
professionals to practice the best
 
04:49:36.410 --> 04:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed medical guidelines by
 
04:49:38.810 --> 04:49:38.820 align:start position:0%

that message
 
04:50:08.690 --> 04:50:08.700 align:start position:0%
as a member of House Finance I've been
 
04:50:10.070 --> 04:50:10.080 align:start position:0%

04:50:15.110 --> 04:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
like to speak to commissioner Taylor
 
04:50:17.390 --> 04:50:17.400 align:start position:0%

to retain and recruit a modern Workforce
 
04:50:26.030 --> 04:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
this bill would support Bea's Michigan
 
04:50:28.788 --> 04:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
mission mission excuse me by supporting
 
04:50:30.590 --> 04:50:30.600 align:start position:0%

the nation's best medicine
 
04:50:36.170 --> 04:50:36.180 align:start position:0%
the second issue I'm here to speak about
 
04:50:39.708 --> 04:50:39.718 align:start position:0%
is the financial and economic issue
 
04:50:41.990 --> 04:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
in house finance I'm also briefed by
 
04:50:44.510 --> 04:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
Brian Gottlieb the director of economic
 
04:50:46.070 --> 04:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's economic and labor
 
04:50:48.708 --> 04:50:48.718 align:start position:0%
market information Bureau and the 23
 
04:50:50.690 --> 04:50:50.700 align:start position:0%
outlook for New Hampshire's labor and
 
04:50:53.030 --> 04:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
market economy
 
04:50:54.770 --> 04:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
according to Brian
 
04:50:56.990 --> 04:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
um the state's biggest challenge to
 
04:51:01.010 --> 04:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
growth is the labor force shortage and
 
04:51:03.590 --> 04:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
he estimates that we're about 8 500
 
04:51:06.770 --> 04:51:06.780 align:start position:0%
workers short for pre-pandemic levels so
 
04:51:10.788 --> 04:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
that 8 500 worked for shortage the
 
04:51:13.368 --> 04:51:13.378 align:start position:0%
biggest group that he can point to for
 
04:51:16.190 --> 04:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
the a drop who's not back yet to the
 
04:51:18.470 --> 04:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
workforce are women between the ages of
 
04:51:22.128 --> 04:51:22.138 align:start position:0%
25 and 34. among those women
 
04:51:25.490 --> 04:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
that category of women these are the
 
04:51:27.050 --> 04:51:27.060 align:start position:0%
most likely ages for women to be
 
04:51:27.060 --> 04:51:28.430 align:start position:0%
most likely ages for women to be
reproducing

04:51:28.430 --> 04:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
reproducing
 
04:51:30.948 --> 04:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about a huge piece of
 
04:51:32.510 --> 04:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
the workforce shortage that you can
 
04:51:34.310 --> 04:51:34.320 align:start position:0%
incentivize to return to the workplace
 
04:51:36.288 --> 04:51:36.298 align:start position:0%
by giving them this tool
 
04:51:39.110 --> 04:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
this abortion access will allow them and
 
04:51:41.150 --> 04:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
Empower them to control their own family
 
04:51:43.970 --> 04:51:43.980 align:start position:0%
planning explicitly explicitly through
 
04:51:46.250 --> 04:51:46.260 align:start position:0%
this abortion access to choose how many
 
04:51:48.230 --> 04:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
miles they'll feed how many seats at
 
04:51:50.270 --> 04:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
their table they'll need to pull up how
 
04:51:51.948 --> 04:51:51.958 align:start position:0%
many spots in child care they'll need to
 
04:51:51.958 --> 04:51:53.208 align:start position:0%
many spots in child care they'll need to
secure

04:51:53.208 --> 04:51:53.218 align:start position:0%
secure
 
04:51:56.270 --> 04:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:58.610 --> 04:51:58.620 align:start position:0%
giving full determination of your
 
04:52:00.170 --> 04:52:00.180 align:start position:0%
family's makeup is the financial
 
04:52:02.690 --> 04:52:02.700 align:start position:0%
consideration this is a decision you
 
04:52:04.190 --> 04:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
have to make every day
 
04:52:06.530 --> 04:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
and if we want to reach full economic
 
04:52:08.030 --> 04:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
growth as a state then we're going to
 
04:52:10.250 --> 04:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
need to incentivize giving these this
 
04:52:12.350 --> 04:52:12.360 align:start position:0%
specific group of women back into the
 
04:52:12.360 --> 04:52:13.788 align:start position:0%
specific group of women back into the
workforce

04:52:13.788 --> 04:52:13.798 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
04:52:16.250 --> 04:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
so as you know there's a lot of moral
 
04:52:18.770 --> 04:52:18.780 align:start position:0%
ethical religious legal Arguments for
 
04:52:20.750 --> 04:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
why this bill is needed but I want you
 
04:52:22.430 --> 04:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
to remember that there are Financial and
 
04:52:25.610 --> 04:52:25.620 align:start position:0%
Professional real implications to
 
04:52:27.830 --> 04:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill especially if we
 
04:52:29.690 --> 04:52:29.700 align:start position:0%
want to reach that full Workforce
 
04:52:31.430 --> 04:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
potential here in our state
 
04:52:33.830 --> 04:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:52:36.170 --> 04:52:36.180 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions yeah
 
04:52:39.410 --> 04:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for this witness yes
 
04:52:41.510 --> 04:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:52:42.890 --> 04:52:42.900 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:52:44.868 --> 04:52:44.878 align:start position:0%
um do you find that these
 
04:52:46.670 --> 04:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
um uh professionals that you're working
 
04:52:48.770 --> 04:52:48.780 align:start position:0%
with alongside are they looking for
 
04:52:50.690 --> 04:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
other positions outside of the State of
 
04:52:52.070 --> 04:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
04:52:53.570 --> 04:52:53.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh
 
04:52:55.070 --> 04:52:55.080 align:start position:0%
representative I know that there are
 
04:52:58.128 --> 04:52:58.138 align:start position:0%
folks here from um Healthcare
 
04:53:00.770 --> 04:53:00.780 align:start position:0%
providers in our state who can speak to
 
04:53:02.390 --> 04:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
that with more
 
04:53:02.400 --> 04:53:03.550 align:start position:0%
that with more
um

04:53:03.550 --> 04:53:03.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:06.530 --> 04:53:06.540 align:start position:0%
direct factual examples but I can tell
 
04:53:08.090 --> 04:53:08.100 align:start position:0%
you anecdotally
 
04:53:09.948 --> 04:53:09.958 align:start position:0%
um having close personal relationships
 
04:53:12.050 --> 04:53:12.060 align:start position:0%
with many of professional women
 
04:53:15.288 --> 04:53:15.298 align:start position:0%
providers in our state that this is a
 
04:53:17.270 --> 04:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
major issue on the Forefront of their
 
04:53:20.208 --> 04:53:20.218 align:start position:0%
mind and it has not ebbed since the
 
04:53:22.490 --> 04:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
moment that Roe fell this is something
 
04:53:24.590 --> 04:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
that they are continually worried about
 
04:53:26.868 --> 04:53:26.878 align:start position:0%
for not only themselves as working
 
04:53:29.208 --> 04:53:29.218 align:start position:0%
Professionals of maternal age but a
 
04:53:31.250 --> 04:53:31.260 align:start position:0%
maternal reproductive age but also as
 
04:53:34.788 --> 04:53:34.798 align:start position:0%
mothers as wives as grandmothers
 
04:53:37.910 --> 04:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
um so you know please don't discount
 
04:53:40.368 --> 04:53:40.378 align:start position:0%
um these real real
 
04:53:42.530 --> 04:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
tax paying and I would say highly tax
 
04:53:45.288 --> 04:53:45.298 align:start position:0%
paying citizens in our state and their
 
04:53:45.298 --> 04:53:46.670 align:start position:0%
paying citizens in our state and their
needs

04:53:46.670 --> 04:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
needs
 
04:53:48.650 --> 04:53:48.660 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
 
04:53:48.660 --> 04:53:51.530 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
women's

04:53:51.530 --> 04:53:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:53.690 --> 04:53:53.700 align:start position:0%
yes representative Stapleton
 
04:53:55.850 --> 04:53:55.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:53:58.730 --> 04:53:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:58.740 --> 04:53:59.868 align:start position:0%
 
if

04:53:59.868 --> 04:53:59.878 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:54:03.650 --> 04:54:03.660 align:start position:0%
the right to an abortion is not inherent
 
04:54:07.010 --> 04:54:07.020 align:start position:0%
within currently inherent within the New
 
04:54:10.368 --> 04:54:10.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:12.910 --> 04:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't it really require a
 
04:54:15.530 --> 04:54:15.540 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment
 
04:54:18.590 --> 04:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
we ruled on in the ballot initiative by
 
04:54:21.288 --> 04:54:21.298 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire rather than
 
04:54:27.230 --> 04:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:31.070 --> 04:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
and my best answer to that is that this
 
04:54:33.890 --> 04:54:33.900 align:start position:0%
is not a constitutional request this is
 
04:54:36.590 --> 04:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
a statutory request and as you know
 
04:54:38.330 --> 04:54:38.340 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of federal laws that
 
04:54:40.868 --> 04:54:40.878 align:start position:0%
are reduced to statute that support
 
04:54:42.830 --> 04:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
fundamental rights across our country
 
04:54:45.288 --> 04:54:45.298 align:start position:0%
that are not included in you know the
 
04:54:47.690 --> 04:54:47.700 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights for instance so
 
04:54:48.890 --> 04:54:48.900 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
04:54:50.628 --> 04:54:50.638 align:start position:0%
just off the top of my head I think
 
04:54:52.550 --> 04:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
about workers rights you know OSHA
 
04:54:54.788 --> 04:54:54.798 align:start position:0%
concerns I think about just
 
04:54:56.448 --> 04:54:56.458 align:start position:0%
anti-discriminatory Clauses for
 
04:54:58.368 --> 04:54:58.378 align:start position:0%
accommodations none of that is included
 
04:54:59.868 --> 04:54:59.878 align:start position:0%
in our constitution but there are
 
04:55:02.448 --> 04:55:02.458 align:start position:0%
federal rights that are protected under
 
04:55:05.570 --> 04:55:05.580 align:start position:0%
federal law so in in statute
 
04:55:09.590 --> 04:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:13.490 --> 04:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:16.070 --> 04:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much
 
04:55:19.390 --> 04:55:19.400 align:start position:0%
um I guess next we have uh Danielle
 
04:55:22.670 --> 04:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
emmentel and then next after that will
 
04:55:25.490 --> 04:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
be representative sellers
 
04:55:25.500 --> 04:55:27.070 align:start position:0%
be representative sellers
foreign

04:55:27.070 --> 04:55:27.080 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:55:29.570 --> 04:55:29.580 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman the members of the committee
 
04:55:31.970 --> 04:55:31.980 align:start position:0%
my name is Danielle Pimentel and I serve
 
04:55:33.350 --> 04:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
as policy Council on Americans United
 
04:55:35.390 --> 04:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
for life um thank you again for allowing
 
04:55:36.650 --> 04:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
me to testify
 
04:55:38.090 --> 04:55:38.100 align:start position:0%
um this is my third time hopefully third
 
04:55:41.090 --> 04:55:41.100 align:start position:0%
time's the charm this legislation has
 
04:55:42.830 --> 04:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
Grave implications similar to the
 
04:55:44.330 --> 04:55:44.340 align:start position:0%
amendment that we heard earlier today
 
04:55:46.610 --> 04:55:46.620 align:start position:0%
proposed um grave implications on future
 
04:55:48.470 --> 04:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
health and safety protections for women
 
04:55:50.810 --> 04:55:50.820 align:start position:0%
as well as conscious protections for
 
04:55:52.788 --> 04:55:52.798 align:start position:0%
health care providers which is why I
 
04:55:55.270 --> 04:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
urge you to oppose this bill
 
04:55:57.770 --> 04:55:57.780 align:start position:0%
hb88 will prevent New Hampshire from
 
04:55:59.448 --> 04:55:59.458 align:start position:0%
enacting abortion regulations that
 
04:56:01.070 --> 04:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
purportedly interfere with an
 
04:56:02.750 --> 04:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
individual's decision to have an
 
04:56:06.170 --> 04:56:06.180 align:start position:0%
abortion as a result this bill severely
 
04:56:08.208 --> 04:56:08.218 align:start position:0%
limits New Hampshire's ability to enact
 
04:56:10.570 --> 04:56:10.580 align:start position:0%
health and safety protections for women
 
04:56:14.090 --> 04:56:14.100 align:start position:0%
that are being alleged to interfere with
 
04:56:16.010 --> 04:56:16.020 align:start position:0%
someone's right to have an abortion
 
04:56:17.868 --> 04:56:17.878 align:start position:0%
for example as I stated earlier in my
 
04:56:19.550 --> 04:56:19.560 align:start position:0%
earlier testimony New Hampshire does not
 
04:56:21.470 --> 04:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
have an informed consent process for
 
04:56:24.170 --> 04:56:24.180 align:start position:0%
women undergoing abortions an informed
 
04:56:26.390 --> 04:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
consent safeguards provide women with
 
04:56:28.910 --> 04:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
material information to guide them in
 
04:56:32.090 --> 04:56:32.100 align:start position:0%
their abortion decisions which is vital
 
04:56:34.430 --> 04:56:34.440 align:start position:0%
given that many women may be considering
 
04:56:36.110 --> 04:56:36.120 align:start position:0%
abortion because they are being forced
 
04:56:38.448 --> 04:56:38.458 align:start position:0%
either by a partner or family member or
 
04:56:40.910 --> 04:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
sex trafficker so informed consent
 
04:56:43.190 --> 04:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
safeguards provide women with material
 
04:56:45.050 --> 04:56:45.060 align:start position:0%
information that let them know their
 
04:56:46.850 --> 04:56:46.860 align:start position:0%
other resources available to them that
 
04:56:48.890 --> 04:56:48.900 align:start position:0%
they are supported and give them other
 
04:56:50.810 --> 04:56:50.820 align:start position:0%
options such as giving birth or giving
 
04:56:53.628 --> 04:56:53.638 align:start position:0%
up their child up for for adoption
 
04:56:57.230 --> 04:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
Etc however hb88 would prevent likely
 
04:56:59.270 --> 04:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
prevents the state from passing these
 
04:57:02.990 --> 04:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
kinds of safeguards further hb88 races
 
04:57:05.930 --> 04:57:05.940 align:start position:0%
serious concerns for conscience rights
 
04:57:07.670 --> 04:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
as representative greeson mentioned
 
04:57:10.190 --> 04:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
earlier because the bill has no language
 
04:57:12.650 --> 04:57:12.660 align:start position:0%
that would want uh that would probably
 
04:57:15.170 --> 04:57:15.180 align:start position:0%
ensure the protection of Health Care
 
04:57:16.850 --> 04:57:16.860 align:start position:0%
Providers conscience rights so health
 
04:57:18.770 --> 04:57:18.780 align:start position:0%
care providers that have moral or
 
04:57:22.150 --> 04:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
ethical objections to abortions
 
04:57:26.570 --> 04:57:26.580 align:start position:0%
instead the uh hb88 would result in
 
04:57:28.128 --> 04:57:28.138 align:start position:0%
positions being forced to perform
 
04:57:30.730 --> 04:57:30.740 align:start position:0%
abortions regardless of these objections
 
04:57:33.350 --> 04:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
and also prevent States from an act or
 
04:57:34.970 --> 04:57:34.980 align:start position:0%
the state from enacting legislation that
 
04:57:37.190 --> 04:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
would protect Health Care Providers
 
04:57:39.170 --> 04:57:39.180 align:start position:0%
conscience rights in the abortion
 
04:57:39.180 --> 04:57:40.310 align:start position:0%
conscience rights in the abortion
context

04:57:40.310 --> 04:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
context
 
04:57:42.288 --> 04:57:42.298 align:start position:0%
instead of increasing abortion
 
04:57:44.448 --> 04:57:44.458 align:start position:0%
protection as this bill reports to do
 
04:57:46.190 --> 04:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
the focus should be on strengthening
 
04:57:47.930 --> 04:57:47.940 align:start position:0%
informed consent laws and health and
 
04:57:49.970 --> 04:57:49.980 align:start position:0%
safety protections for women especially
 
04:57:52.190 --> 04:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
given that women are increasingly
 
04:57:55.250 --> 04:57:55.260 align:start position:0%
rejecting abortion and choosing life the
 
04:57:57.708 --> 04:57:57.718 align:start position:0%
current abortion rate is nearly half of
 
04:58:00.470 --> 04:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
what it was in the 1980s after Roe B
 
04:58:02.750 --> 04:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
Wade was decided and even prior to the
 
04:58:04.550 --> 04:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
court deciding Roe v Wade women have
 
04:58:06.350 --> 04:58:06.360 align:start position:0%
been steadily gaining access and
 
04:58:08.570 --> 04:58:08.580 align:start position:0%
esteemed in the workforce and have been
 
04:58:11.930 --> 04:58:11.940 align:start position:0%
continued to choose life and carry their
 
04:58:13.730 --> 04:58:13.740 align:start position:0%
pregnancies to term and so for these
 
04:58:15.350 --> 04:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
reasons I urge the committee strong
 
04:58:17.628 --> 04:58:17.638 align:start position:0%
leaders to commit to oppose hb88 thank
 
04:58:18.948 --> 04:58:18.958 align:start position:0%
you any questions I'm happy to answer
 
04:58:22.750 --> 04:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:24.530 --> 04:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
04:58:27.230 --> 04:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
representative Sellers and then next
 
04:58:32.090 --> 04:58:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:34.490 --> 04:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair and thanks again
 
04:58:37.010 --> 04:58:37.020 align:start position:0%
uh committee for hearing what I have to
 
04:58:37.020 --> 04:58:38.750 align:start position:0%
uh committee for hearing what I have to
say

04:58:38.750 --> 04:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:58:40.850 --> 04:58:40.860 align:start position:0%
um I'm just looking up here some I have
 
04:58:42.350 --> 04:58:42.360 align:start position:0%
two things with this bill and I just
 
04:58:44.208 --> 04:58:44.218 align:start position:0%
want to bring it up to you I'm probably
 
04:58:45.770 --> 04:58:45.780 align:start position:0%
actually more but two things that's
 
04:58:47.750 --> 04:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
coming to my eye
 
04:58:50.750 --> 04:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh one is
 
04:58:53.208 --> 04:58:53.218 align:start position:0%
to me this is again we come down to the
 
04:58:55.670 --> 04:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
lawyers or the attorneys I'm saying the
 
04:58:56.930 --> 04:58:56.940 align:start position:0%
attorneys are going to have a blast with
 
04:58:58.610 --> 04:58:58.620 align:start position:0%
this they finally found somebody that
 
04:59:00.770 --> 04:59:00.780 align:start position:0%
has Deep Pockets it's called the state
 
04:59:02.030 --> 04:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
04:59:04.310 --> 04:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
one misstep and they're going to get
 
04:59:06.890 --> 04:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars from us just one so
 
04:59:08.930 --> 04:59:08.940 align:start position:0%
I I you know for that one reason that's
 
04:59:11.390 --> 04:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
one reason I'm opposed to this bill but
 
04:59:13.010 --> 04:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
the other one is you know you look at
 
04:59:15.410 --> 04:59:15.420 align:start position:0%
line ten and nine and ten
 
04:59:17.990 --> 04:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
04:59:20.690 --> 04:59:20.700 align:start position:0%
and it says uh it basically shall not
 
04:59:23.150 --> 04:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
restrict or interfere with an
 
04:59:25.490 --> 04:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
individual's exercise to their private
 
04:59:28.850 --> 04:59:28.860 align:start position:0%
decision to terminate a pregnancy
 
04:59:32.390 --> 04:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
again the word interfere does that mean
 
04:59:35.448 --> 04:59:35.458 align:start position:0%
if we create a bill or that becomes a
 
04:59:39.010 --> 04:59:39.020 align:start position:0%
law eight ten years from now without
 
04:59:42.350 --> 04:59:42.360 align:start position:0%
repealing this law we're indirectly
 
04:59:42.360 --> 04:59:43.970 align:start position:0%
repealing this law we're indirectly
interfering

04:59:43.970 --> 04:59:43.980 align:start position:0%
interfering
 
04:59:46.310 --> 04:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
with that person to have a pregnancy
 
04:59:49.368 --> 04:59:49.378 align:start position:0%
so that this is this is just an accident
 
04:59:50.990 --> 04:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
waiting to happen if this actually
 
04:59:51.000 --> 04:59:52.128 align:start position:0%
waiting to happen if this actually
passes

04:59:52.128 --> 04:59:52.138 align:start position:0%
passes
 
04:59:53.868 --> 04:59:53.878 align:start position:0%
the other part of this
 
04:59:56.030 --> 04:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
and I guess it's the third part is
 
04:59:56.040 --> 04:59:57.050 align:start position:0%
and I guess it's the third part is
terminate

04:59:57.050 --> 04:59:57.060 align:start position:0%
terminate
 
04:59:58.490 --> 04:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
well that's why I was looking up my
 
05:00:00.770 --> 05:00:00.780 align:start position:0%
phone again because I'm not an English
 
05:00:03.830 --> 05:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
major but it does say terminate says
 
05:00:06.830 --> 05:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
bring to an end bring to an end bring to
 
05:00:09.410 --> 05:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
an end is another word bring to an end
 
05:00:11.208 --> 05:00:11.218 align:start position:0%
to what they're talking about a
 
05:00:13.430 --> 05:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
pregnancy that means you must be talking
 
05:00:15.530 --> 05:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
about something that's living
 
05:00:18.170 --> 05:00:18.180 align:start position:0%
all right it's it's not a thing it's not
 
05:00:21.110 --> 05:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
a yeah it's not a fetus it's a leader
 
05:00:23.690 --> 05:00:23.700 align:start position:0%
it's a living being a human being it's
 
05:00:26.448 --> 05:00:26.458 align:start position:0%
also I want to say
 
05:00:29.270 --> 05:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
um an infant now you think an infant is
 
05:00:31.250 --> 05:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
just after birth it is not
 
05:00:33.890 --> 05:00:33.900 align:start position:0%
you look up the word infant and Latin it
 
05:00:36.830 --> 05:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
means infant i-n-f-a-n
 
05:00:39.288 --> 05:00:39.298 align:start position:0%
which means speechless
 
05:00:41.288 --> 05:00:41.298 align:start position:0%
a one that can't speak
 
05:00:44.448 --> 05:00:44.458 align:start position:0%
that is a pre-born that's not born yet
 
05:00:47.690 --> 05:00:47.700 align:start position:0%
all right so someone whoever's writing
 
05:00:51.470 --> 05:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
this bill here I I it's to me I'm sorry
 
05:00:53.868 --> 05:00:53.878 align:start position:0%
and I don't mean any disrespect but
 
05:00:56.810 --> 05:00:56.820 align:start position:0%
plain English it's a joke this is just a
 
05:00:56.820 --> 05:00:58.430 align:start position:0%
plain English it's a joke this is just a
joke

05:00:58.430 --> 05:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
joke
 
05:01:04.910 --> 05:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:06.830 --> 05:01:06.840 align:start position:0%

05:02:57.410 --> 05:02:57.420 align:start position:0%
as a practicing Christian I am pro-faith
 
05:03:01.010 --> 05:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
I am pro-family and I support abortion
 
05:03:04.190 --> 05:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
access I do so not in spite of my faith
 
05:03:06.230 --> 05:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
but because of it
 
05:03:08.510 --> 05:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
my faith compels me to stand with those
 
05:03:10.850 --> 05:03:10.860 align:start position:0%
who seek safe and legal access to this
 
05:03:10.860 --> 05:03:11.868 align:start position:0%
who seek safe and legal access to this
care

05:03:11.868 --> 05:03:11.878 align:start position:0%
care
 
05:03:13.930 --> 05:03:13.940 align:start position:0%
abortion is Health Care
 
05:03:16.730 --> 05:03:16.740 align:start position:0%
abortion can be life-saving
 
05:03:19.850 --> 05:03:19.860 align:start position:0%
what could be more faithful than that I
 
05:03:21.770 --> 05:03:21.780 align:start position:0%
honor the sometimes complex and
 
05:03:23.930 --> 05:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
compassionate choices that pregnant
 
05:03:25.970 --> 05:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
people seek to make
 
05:03:28.430 --> 05:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
moreover I am the Deep supporter of the
 
05:03:30.410 --> 05:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
principles of religious freedom upon
 
05:03:33.050 --> 05:03:33.060 align:start position:0%
which our country was founded each of us
 
05:03:35.810 --> 05:03:35.820 align:start position:0%
is guaranteed the right to make our own
 
05:03:38.390 --> 05:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
choices according to our own religious
 
05:03:40.910 --> 05:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
beliefs and not to be required to
 
05:03:42.410 --> 05:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
conduct our health care by the
 
05:03:44.930 --> 05:03:44.940 align:start position:0%
principles of someone else's ethics
 
05:03:47.270 --> 05:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
my Christian faith encourages me to look
 
05:03:50.150 --> 05:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
out for those who may be left behind by
 
05:03:51.770 --> 05:03:51.780 align:start position:0%
those in power
 
05:03:55.070 --> 05:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
so I come before you today in support of
 
05:03:57.770 --> 05:03:57.780 align:start position:0%
the access to abortion Care Act for
 
05:03:59.810 --> 05:03:59.820 align:start position:0%
these reasons and many more I urge you
 
05:04:03.530 --> 05:04:03.540 align:start position:0%
to vote ought to pass on HB 88 and abide
 
05:04:06.470 --> 05:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
by the values of freedom and choice that
 
05:04:08.750 --> 05:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has claimed as our own for
 
05:04:11.510 --> 05:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
centuries people of faith and people
 
05:04:13.550 --> 05:04:13.560 align:start position:0%
across the granite state are counting on
 
05:04:15.590 --> 05:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
your leadership thank you for hearing my
 
05:04:18.050 --> 05:04:18.060 align:start position:0%
testimony today thank you questions for
 
05:04:20.208 --> 05:04:20.218 align:start position:0%
this Witness
 
05:04:22.430 --> 05:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative greeson
 
05:04:23.868 --> 05:04:23.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:04:26.030 --> 05:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
your testimony are you aware of any
 
05:04:28.368 --> 05:04:28.378 align:start position:0%
other medical procedures to which anyone
 
05:04:30.288 --> 05:04:30.298 align:start position:0%
has a statutory or constitutional right
 
05:04:31.730 --> 05:04:31.740 align:start position:0%
to access
 
05:04:33.830 --> 05:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
I would offer that there are many
 
05:04:35.750 --> 05:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
medical procedures to which folks have a
 
05:04:38.930 --> 05:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
constitutional right and statutory
 
05:04:40.550 --> 05:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
requirement is not the word I use both
 
05:04:42.288 --> 05:04:42.298 align:start position:0%
statutory right to access but I'm not a
 
05:04:43.128 --> 05:04:43.138 align:start position:0%
lawyer and I'm not a medical
 
05:04:44.750 --> 05:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
professional so I can't speak to the
 
05:04:47.448 --> 05:04:47.458 align:start position:0%
details of the law
 
05:04:49.850 --> 05:04:49.860 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
05:04:51.948 --> 05:04:51.958 align:start position:0%
yes representative Staples
 
05:04:53.810 --> 05:04:53.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:04:56.150 --> 05:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question you mentioned that
 
05:04:59.570 --> 05:04:59.580 align:start position:0%
you represent a number of interfaith
 
05:04:59.580 --> 05:05:02.208 align:start position:0%
you represent a number of interfaith
organizations

05:05:02.208 --> 05:05:02.218 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
05:05:02.218 --> 05:05:03.110 align:start position:0%
organizations
um

05:05:03.110 --> 05:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:05:07.010 --> 05:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
is the Catholic church or any of its
 
05:05:10.150 --> 05:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
parishes aligned with that particular
 
05:05:12.708 --> 05:05:12.718 align:start position:0%
organization signed on to the letter
 
05:05:14.030 --> 05:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned
 
05:05:16.490 --> 05:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
sir and we will provide you with a
 
05:05:17.510 --> 05:05:17.520 align:start position:0%

electronically so you have access to all
 
05:05:24.410 --> 05:05:24.420 align:start position:0%

um

05:05:26.628 --> 05:05:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:28.550 --> 05:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
my hearing is not good and I'm having
 
05:05:32.270 --> 05:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
trouble with the reverberation did you
 
05:05:35.030 --> 05:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
say that there were or were not some
 
05:05:39.170 --> 05:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
Catholic churches that were aligned with
 
05:05:41.448 --> 05:05:41.458 align:start position:0%
what you've just spoken about the letter
 
05:05:43.190 --> 05:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
that I that I'm about today which I
 
05:05:46.550 --> 05:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:48.770 --> 05:05:48.780 align:start position:0%
thank you sure
 
05:05:52.788 --> 05:05:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:54.650 --> 05:05:54.660 align:start position:0%

05:06:07.610 --> 05:06:07.620 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:06:09.650 --> 05:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
um my name is Liz Canada I'm the
 
05:06:11.390 --> 05:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
advocacy manager at Planned Parenthood
 
05:06:13.070 --> 05:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
of Northern New England and Planned
 
05:06:14.930 --> 05:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
Parenthood New Hampshire action fund and
 
05:06:16.550 --> 05:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
we're here in strong support of house
 
05:06:19.730 --> 05:06:19.740 align:start position:0%
bill 88. as you've already heard New
 
05:06:21.650 --> 05:06:21.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not have anything in
 
05:06:24.350 --> 05:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
state law protecting or recognizing a
 
05:06:26.628 --> 05:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
right to abortion we are the only state
 
05:06:28.610 --> 05:06:28.620 align:start position:0%
in New England without anything in state
 
05:06:30.830 --> 05:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
law I heard mention earlier of
 
05:06:32.868 --> 05:06:32.878 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts for example they have
 
05:06:35.930 --> 05:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
statutory protections for abortion in
 
05:06:35.940 --> 05:06:36.730 align:start position:0%
statutory protections for abortion in
Massachusetts

05:06:36.730 --> 05:06:36.740 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
05:06:40.010 --> 05:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
Vermont has statutory protections as
 
05:06:42.170 --> 05:06:42.180 align:start position:0%
well and they recently passed the
 
05:06:43.670 --> 05:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment so now they
 
05:06:46.070 --> 05:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
have both statutory and constitutional
 
05:06:47.868 --> 05:06:47.878 align:start position:0%
Protections in Vermont
 
05:06:50.990 --> 05:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
across the country there are only three
 
05:06:53.570 --> 05:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
states where abortion is legal but not
 
05:06:55.368 --> 05:06:55.378 align:start position:0%
protected and New Hampshire is one of
 
05:06:55.378 --> 05:06:56.030 align:start position:0%
protected and New Hampshire is one of
them

05:06:56.030 --> 05:06:56.040 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:06:56.040 --> 05:06:57.110 align:start position:0%
them
foreign

05:06:57.110 --> 05:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:06:59.448 --> 05:06:59.458 align:start position:0%
this bill before you would put into
 
05:07:01.670 --> 05:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
state law the recognition
 
05:07:04.610 --> 05:07:04.620 align:start position:0%
this bill does not amend the 24-week
 
05:07:07.250 --> 05:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
abortion ban it does not amend parental
 
05:07:10.310 --> 05:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
notification it simply addresses the
 
05:07:12.708 --> 05:07:12.718 align:start position:0%
void in our state laws which is
 
05:07:14.510 --> 05:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
particularly critical now that Roe v
 
05:07:16.970 --> 05:07:16.980 align:start position:0%
Wade has been overturned and there is no
 
05:07:18.770 --> 05:07:18.780 align:start position:0%
longer a federally constitutionally
 
05:07:21.288 --> 05:07:21.298 align:start position:0%
protected right to abortion passage of
 
05:07:24.170 --> 05:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
this law would provide legal clarity
 
05:07:26.208 --> 05:07:26.218 align:start position:0%
as you've already heard since Roe v Wade
 
05:07:29.208 --> 05:07:29.218 align:start position:0%
was overturned over 25 million people
 
05:07:31.368 --> 05:07:31.378 align:start position:0%
across the country have lost access to
 
05:07:34.128 --> 05:07:34.138 align:start position:0%
abortion in their home state including
 
05:07:36.890 --> 05:07:36.900 align:start position:0%
one in three women of reproductive age
 
05:07:39.230 --> 05:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
abortion bans have created a domino
 
05:07:41.990 --> 05:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
effect in our country patients have had
 
05:07:45.050 --> 05:07:45.060 align:start position:0%
to travel out of their own state but
 
05:07:47.150 --> 05:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
only if they can find child care if they
 
05:07:48.708 --> 05:07:48.718 align:start position:0%
can take time off of work and if they
 
05:07:50.510 --> 05:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
can afford it and then they have to
 
05:07:53.868 --> 05:07:53.878 align:start position:0%
travel farther as bans take effect they
 
05:07:55.368 --> 05:07:55.378 align:start position:0%
have to travel later in their
 
05:07:55.378 --> 05:07:56.570 align:start position:0%
have to travel later in their
pregnancies

05:07:56.570 --> 05:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
pregnancies
 
05:07:58.670 --> 05:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
and they travel to States like here in
 
05:08:00.050 --> 05:08:00.060 align:start position:0%
Northern New England because they see
 
05:08:01.970 --> 05:08:01.980 align:start position:0%
this area of the country as safe for
 
05:08:01.980 --> 05:08:02.868 align:start position:0%
this area of the country as safe for
them

05:08:02.868 --> 05:08:02.878 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:08:04.490 --> 05:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
so this bill in front of you is an
 
05:08:06.530 --> 05:08:06.540 align:start position:0%
opportunity to show granted Staters that
 
05:08:09.170 --> 05:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
abortion will remain safe and legal
 
05:08:11.930 --> 05:08:11.940 align:start position:0%
until 24 weeks in our home state
 
05:08:14.810 --> 05:08:14.820 align:start position:0%
this bill again doesn't change any of
 
05:08:17.990 --> 05:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
the current laws they remain intact this
 
05:08:20.030 --> 05:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
only changes the fact that we do not
 
05:08:22.310 --> 05:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
have a statute recognizing the right to
 
05:08:23.510 --> 05:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
an abortion
 
05:08:25.190 --> 05:08:25.200 align:start position:0%
we know that the majority of people in
 
05:08:26.448 --> 05:08:26.458 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire support the right to
 
05:08:28.190 --> 05:08:28.200 align:start position:0%
access abortion free of government
 
05:08:30.890 --> 05:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
interference we also know that no one in
 
05:08:32.270 --> 05:08:32.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire wants the government of
 
05:08:34.190 --> 05:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
another state to interfere with what
 
05:08:35.930 --> 05:08:35.940 align:start position:0%
happens here in New Hampshire
 
05:08:38.570 --> 05:08:38.580 align:start position:0%
other states are attempting to pass laws
 
05:08:40.490 --> 05:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
that would reach beyond their own
 
05:08:42.590 --> 05:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
borders and into New Hampshire
 
05:08:44.750 --> 05:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
again we're only one of three states
 
05:08:46.490 --> 05:08:46.500 align:start position:0%
that has an abortion ban but no
 
05:08:48.770 --> 05:08:48.780 align:start position:0%
protections on the books you can change
 
05:08:52.730 --> 05:08:52.740 align:start position:0%
that House Bill 88 is a win-win
 
05:08:55.070 --> 05:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
it provides critical assurances that our
 
05:08:57.110 --> 05:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
state will not alter course now that Roe
 
05:08:58.190 --> 05:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
v Wade is gone
 
05:09:00.530 --> 05:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
but instead will enshrine into state law
 
05:09:02.270 --> 05:09:02.280 align:start position:0%
that we value and support an
 
05:09:04.010 --> 05:09:04.020 align:start position:0%
individual's personal and private
 
05:09:06.050 --> 05:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
decision making in accessing the health
 
05:09:07.730 --> 05:09:07.740 align:start position:0%
care that they need and we urge you to
 
05:09:10.550 --> 05:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
vote off to pass on House Bill 88.
 
05:09:13.070 --> 05:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
05:09:15.770 --> 05:09:15.780 align:start position:0%
representative Perez
 
05:09:19.010 --> 05:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
thank you I have a question for you I do
 
05:09:21.708 --> 05:09:21.718 align:start position:0%
again I'm not legal so I apologize by
 
05:09:24.230 --> 05:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
05:09:26.990 --> 05:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
if the state decided
 
05:09:29.150 --> 05:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
let me back up a little it's my
 
05:09:31.550 --> 05:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
understanding that when
 
05:09:33.708 --> 05:09:33.718 align:start position:0%
um abortion was made legal it was
 
05:09:35.930 --> 05:09:35.940 align:start position:0%
initially the first trimester I believe
 
05:09:38.448 --> 05:09:38.458 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong and then I
 
05:09:40.970 --> 05:09:40.980 align:start position:0%
believe it was in the 1990s that it was
 
05:09:44.570 --> 05:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
changed to a quote of viable fetus
 
05:09:46.730 --> 05:09:46.740 align:start position:0%
um which at that time was approximately
 
05:09:49.250 --> 05:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
24 weeks and that's where the 24 weeks
 
05:09:50.868 --> 05:09:50.878 align:start position:0%
has come from again correct me if I'm
 
05:09:50.878 --> 05:09:51.948 align:start position:0%
has come from again correct me if I'm
wrong

05:09:51.948 --> 05:09:51.958 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
05:09:54.650 --> 05:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
if we do this with this bill
 
05:09:58.250 --> 05:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
does that mean if
 
05:10:01.670 --> 05:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
things change dramatically and say a
 
05:10:04.250 --> 05:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
viable fetus is at
 
05:10:08.208 --> 05:10:08.218 align:start position:0%
15 weeks and the people
 
05:10:10.070 --> 05:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
okay because I believe in the people
 
05:10:14.448 --> 05:10:14.458 align:start position:0%
wanted to change the present
 
05:10:17.270 --> 05:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
statute they would not be able to change
 
05:10:17.280 --> 05:10:18.170 align:start position:0%
statute they would not be able to change
it

05:10:18.170 --> 05:10:18.180 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:10:20.330 --> 05:10:20.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question so two
 
05:10:21.708 --> 05:10:21.718 align:start position:0%
pieces that I want to address and what
 
05:10:24.470 --> 05:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
you said so 24 weeks is not the same of
 
05:10:26.690 --> 05:10:26.700 align:start position:0%
as the viability standard that we have
 
05:10:28.670 --> 05:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
seen so it's a fixed Mark in the
 
05:10:31.270 --> 05:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
calendar 24 weeks is that hard firm line
 
05:10:34.070 --> 05:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
now the question about can a future
 
05:10:35.930 --> 05:10:35.940 align:start position:0%
legislature what I think is what you're
 
05:10:37.910 --> 05:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
asking can a future legislature amend it
 
05:10:40.070 --> 05:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
that's true for any Bill any bill can be
 
05:10:41.930 --> 05:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
changed in the future as you know A
 
05:10:45.650 --> 05:10:45.660 align:start position:0%
legislature dictates what we know in
 
05:10:47.390 --> 05:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
every state in the country even where
 
05:10:49.850 --> 05:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
abortion is outright banned it is
 
05:10:51.890 --> 05:10:51.900 align:start position:0%
unpopular to have abortion bans in those
 
05:10:54.470 --> 05:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
States and so a future legislature would
 
05:10:58.670 --> 05:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
have to come to terms with how the
 
05:11:00.050 --> 05:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
people of the Granite State of New
 
05:11:01.910 --> 05:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would want them to change any
 
05:11:04.190 --> 05:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
abortion ban so
 
05:11:07.070 --> 05:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
that that is the that is the uh response
 
05:11:08.930 --> 05:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
for sure
 
05:11:08.940 --> 05:11:10.070 align:start position:0%
for sure
yes

05:11:10.070 --> 05:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:11:10.080 --> 05:11:11.090 align:start position:0%
yes
so

05:11:11.090 --> 05:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:11:13.788 --> 05:11:13.798 align:start position:0%
again not legal you're kind of black and
 
05:11:17.868 --> 05:11:17.878 align:start position:0%
white would this prohibit in any way
 
05:11:22.310 --> 05:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
the state changing the present law or
 
05:11:25.550 --> 05:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
any part of the present law at any time
 
05:11:28.610 --> 05:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
it's a yes or no please
 
05:11:31.550 --> 05:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
the legislature can do can pass laws and
 
05:11:34.310 --> 05:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
amend laws as they wish we do know that
 
05:11:36.350 --> 05:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
states like Missouri are trying to pass
 
05:11:38.150 --> 05:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
laws that would reach into other states
 
05:11:39.830 --> 05:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
like New Hampshire and try to affect
 
05:11:42.110 --> 05:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
patients here and providers here and so
 
05:11:44.208 --> 05:11:44.218 align:start position:0%
this type of legal Clarity would be
 
05:11:45.288 --> 05:11:45.298 align:start position:0%
really helpful in that type of
 
05:11:45.298 --> 05:11:47.990 align:start position:0%
really helpful in that type of
circumstance

05:11:47.990 --> 05:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
circumstance
 
05:11:51.110 --> 05:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton
 
05:11:53.390 --> 05:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:11:56.448 --> 05:11:56.458 align:start position:0%
my question in the same vein of the
 
05:11:57.890 --> 05:11:57.900 align:start position:0%
prior question
 
05:12:00.770 --> 05:12:00.780 align:start position:0%
but with a little variance
 
05:12:04.310 --> 05:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
the bill does provide exception
 
05:12:10.490 --> 05:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
under RSA 329 colon 43 to 329 colon 50.
 
05:12:16.610 --> 05:12:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:20.150 --> 05:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
if the law were to change
 
05:12:24.590 --> 05:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
by addition of additional rsas in a
 
05:12:29.270 --> 05:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:31.850 --> 05:12:31.860 align:start position:0%
does that not represent a problem for
 
05:12:34.550 --> 05:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
this bill in a conflict of law
 
05:12:37.850 --> 05:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
and therefore this really should be a
 
05:12:40.128 --> 05:12:40.138 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue rather than a
 
05:12:42.230 --> 05:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
statutory one
 
05:12:44.570 --> 05:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so to that
 
05:12:46.310 --> 05:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
last point the good news is you have a
 
05:12:47.690 --> 05:12:47.700 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment to vote on
 
05:12:50.690 --> 05:12:50.700 align:start position:0%
cacr-2 which we also support the
 
05:12:52.310 --> 05:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment would go to the
 
05:12:54.830 --> 05:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
voters in November of 2024 this would
 
05:12:56.570 --> 05:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
take effect immediately so that would be
 
05:12:58.550 --> 05:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
you know a major value for granite
 
05:13:00.470 --> 05:13:00.480 align:start position:0%
saters to know that that has been in uh
 
05:13:02.930 --> 05:13:02.940 align:start position:0%
in effect affected immediately but both
 
05:13:04.610 --> 05:13:04.620 align:start position:0%
things are really important to have in
 
05:13:06.288 --> 05:13:06.298 align:start position:0%
place like we see in Vermont both
 
05:13:08.990 --> 05:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
statutory protections and constitutional
 
05:13:13.128 --> 05:13:13.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:18.170 --> 05:13:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:20.330 --> 05:13:20.340 align:start position:0%
Courtney Courtney Reed I'm sorry
 
05:13:25.610 --> 05:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
Courtney Reed and then next uh will be
 
05:13:31.430 --> 05:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:33.170 --> 05:13:33.180 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman sorry I don't have
 
05:13:35.270 --> 05:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
the best handwriting okay no problem
 
05:13:37.850 --> 05:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
neither do I yeah thank you I'll try to
 
05:13:40.368 --> 05:13:40.378 align:start position:0%
keep my my testimony uh short as we've
 
05:13:41.830 --> 05:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
already heard some pretty robust
 
05:13:46.128 --> 05:13:46.138 align:start position:0%
statements from supporters of hb88 my
 
05:13:47.868 --> 05:13:47.878 align:start position:0%
name is Courtney Reed and I'm here with
 
05:13:50.868 --> 05:13:50.878 align:start position:0%
the ACLU of New Hampshire and I just
 
05:13:53.570 --> 05:13:53.580 align:start position:0%
want to reiterate that last last month
 
05:13:55.190 --> 05:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
we should have been celebrating what
 
05:13:57.650 --> 05:13:57.660 align:start position:0%
would have been the 50th anniversary of
 
05:14:00.650 --> 05:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
Roe v Wade and unfortunately we're in a
 
05:14:03.110 --> 05:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
cloud of legal uncertainty about what
 
05:14:04.910 --> 05:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
Reproductive Rights are protected
 
05:14:06.470 --> 05:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
especially in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:14:08.810 --> 05:14:08.820 align:start position:0%
where we don't have a constitutional
 
05:14:11.270 --> 05:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
protection for the right of abortion and
 
05:14:12.948 --> 05:14:12.958 align:start position:0%
we don't have anything in statute that
 
05:14:14.810 --> 05:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
protects protects reproductive freedoms
 
05:14:14.820 --> 05:14:15.590 align:start position:0%
protects protects reproductive freedoms
either

05:14:15.590 --> 05:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
either
 
05:14:17.570 --> 05:14:17.580 align:start position:0%
and just to kind of put this in a
 
05:14:20.208 --> 05:14:20.218 align:start position:0%
context of the national scale we've seen
 
05:14:23.208 --> 05:14:23.218 align:start position:0%
66 clinics across 15 states stop
 
05:14:25.550 --> 05:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
offering reproductive care 12 states
 
05:14:27.410 --> 05:14:27.420 align:start position:0%
have banned abortion outright since Rose
 
05:14:29.990 --> 05:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
overturned and as many as one in three
 
05:14:32.090 --> 05:14:32.100 align:start position:0%
women of reproductive age have lost
 
05:14:34.850 --> 05:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
access to abortion in their home state
 
05:14:36.708 --> 05:14:36.718 align:start position:0%
and we've seen a lot of these attacks on
 
05:14:39.110 --> 05:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
reproductive Liberties take place
 
05:14:41.868 --> 05:14:41.878 align:start position:0%
through incrementalism in Texas for
 
05:14:44.448 --> 05:14:44.458 align:start position:0%
example a 24-week abortion ban was
 
05:14:48.830 --> 05:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
issued in 2005. since then in 2013 the
 
05:14:50.810 --> 05:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
state issued a 20-week ban with few
 
05:14:53.510 --> 05:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
exceptions in 2017 the state placed
 
05:14:55.910 --> 05:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
burdensome and targeted restrictions on
 
05:14:58.868 --> 05:14:58.878 align:start position:0%
reproductive Health Centers and in 2019
 
05:15:01.970 --> 05:15:01.980 align:start position:0%
the state issued more restrictive
 
05:15:05.208 --> 05:15:05.218 align:start position:0%
policies in 2021 the state finally
 
05:15:07.490 --> 05:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
issued a six-week near total ban on
 
05:15:07.500 --> 05:15:08.930 align:start position:0%
issued a six-week near total ban on
abortion

05:15:08.930 --> 05:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
05:15:11.150 --> 05:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
so where the granite state is now is
 
05:15:14.510 --> 05:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
where Texas was in 2005. we currently
 
05:15:17.330 --> 05:15:17.340 align:start position:0%
have a 24-week abortion ban with limited
 
05:15:18.890 --> 05:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
restrictions that was passed two years
 
05:15:21.288 --> 05:15:21.298 align:start position:0%
ago and there will always be politicians
 
05:15:23.030 --> 05:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
eager to chip away at abortion access
 
05:15:25.010 --> 05:15:25.020 align:start position:0%
like we've seen in Texas
 
05:15:28.970 --> 05:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
yet by passing a legislation like HB 88
 
05:15:31.310 --> 05:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
we would act in favor of what we already
 
05:15:33.830 --> 05:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
know where Granite Staters who have been
 
05:15:37.270 --> 05:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
pulled show overwhelming support for
 
05:15:40.310 --> 05:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
abortion protections and every ballot
 
05:15:42.110 --> 05:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
initiative even in deeply red States
 
05:15:44.150 --> 05:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
this past November strongly went in
 
05:15:46.910 --> 05:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
support toward protecting abortion
 
05:15:49.788 --> 05:15:49.798 align:start position:0%
rights so Granite Staters right now are
 
05:15:51.170 --> 05:15:51.180 align:start position:0%
concerned and worried about their
 
05:15:53.448 --> 05:15:53.458 align:start position:0%
continued access to abortion which
 
05:15:55.850 --> 05:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
according to the American Medical
 
05:15:58.128 --> 05:15:58.138 align:start position:0%
Association and other medical
 
05:16:00.770 --> 05:16:00.780 align:start position:0%
communities is an essential part of
 
05:16:02.510 --> 05:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
reproductive Health Care
 
05:16:04.490 --> 05:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
so it's time to make explicit that
 
05:16:06.770 --> 05:16:06.780 align:start position:0%
abortion is protected and by this uh
 
05:16:08.570 --> 05:16:08.580 align:start position:0%
while we would be affirming that there
 
05:16:10.910 --> 05:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
could be no more uh incremental attacks
 
05:16:13.628 --> 05:16:13.638 align:start position:0%
on abortion as it stands through Statute
 
05:16:16.010 --> 05:16:16.020 align:start position:0%
in this this legislation is an
 
05:16:17.930 --> 05:16:17.940 align:start position:0%
affirmative protection of abortion that
 
05:16:20.090 --> 05:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
doesn't change uh anything under state
 
05:16:20.100 --> 05:16:21.230 align:start position:0%
doesn't change uh anything under state
law

05:16:21.230 --> 05:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:16:23.750 --> 05:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh where we are now so
 
05:16:25.310 --> 05:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to urge the committee to
 
05:16:28.250 --> 05:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
pass hb88 thank you
 
05:16:30.410 --> 05:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
05:16:32.930 --> 05:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
yes representative breesa thank you Mr
 
05:16:34.190 --> 05:16:34.200 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking our
 
05:16:36.948 --> 05:16:36.958 align:start position:0%
questions since you represent the ACLU
 
05:16:38.750 --> 05:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps you will have a little bit more
 
05:16:41.330 --> 05:16:41.340 align:start position:0%
information are you aware of any medical
 
05:16:43.070 --> 05:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
procedures to which anyone has a
 
05:16:44.930 --> 05:16:44.940 align:start position:0%
statutory or constitutional right to
 
05:16:44.940 --> 05:16:46.070 align:start position:0%
statutory or constitutional right to
access

05:16:46.070 --> 05:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
access
 
05:16:48.650 --> 05:16:48.660 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your question
 
05:16:50.750 --> 05:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
um I would also like to leave uh the
 
05:16:53.390 --> 05:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
answer to that to Medical experts
 
05:16:54.890 --> 05:16:54.900 align:start position:0%
um that might be more familiar with it
 
05:16:57.948 --> 05:16:57.958 align:start position:0%
but I I can say I'm fairly certain that
 
05:17:00.530 --> 05:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
there are not any medical procedures
 
05:17:02.868 --> 05:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
that have restricted access to them in
 
05:17:07.128 --> 05:17:07.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:08.390 --> 05:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
any other question
 
05:17:10.670 --> 05:17:10.680 align:start position:0%
one question that I have is you you say
 
05:17:12.830 --> 05:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
that this would offer
 
05:17:15.110 --> 05:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
some protection
 
05:17:19.490 --> 05:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
from from politicians basically change
 
05:17:22.310 --> 05:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
but is it if this is just a statute
 
05:17:24.708 --> 05:17:24.718 align:start position:0%
isn't it this only offers protection
 
05:17:27.708 --> 05:17:27.718 align:start position:0%
until until unless and until the statute
 
05:17:29.510 --> 05:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
is changed and a future legislature
 
05:17:31.070 --> 05:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
would have the ability to change it at
 
05:17:32.390 --> 05:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
will would it not
 
05:17:34.910 --> 05:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
yeah that's correct representative uh
 
05:17:37.610 --> 05:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question uh I I just
 
05:17:38.990 --> 05:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
want to speak a little bit more to that
 
05:17:42.350 --> 05:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
in that um uh by by passing this bill we
 
05:17:44.030 --> 05:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
would be honoring what
 
05:17:46.368 --> 05:17:46.378 align:start position:0%
um an overwhelming number of um Granite
 
05:17:48.890 --> 05:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
Staters have supported through polling
 
05:17:50.690 --> 05:17:50.700 align:start position:0%
um which is a protected
 
05:17:52.910 --> 05:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
um access to abortion and other
 
05:17:55.310 --> 05:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
reproductive Health Care the ACLU has
 
05:17:57.410 --> 05:17:57.420 align:start position:0%
also testified in support of the
 
05:17:59.390 --> 05:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment which
 
05:17:59.400 --> 05:18:00.010 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment which
um

05:18:00.010 --> 05:18:00.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:03.170 --> 05:18:03.180 align:start position:0%
protects that right to a greater extent
 
05:18:05.690 --> 05:18:05.700 align:start position:0%
um but like we've seen in States like
 
05:18:05.700 --> 05:18:06.610 align:start position:0%
um but like we've seen in States like
Massachusetts

05:18:06.610 --> 05:18:06.620 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
05:18:09.050 --> 05:18:09.060 align:start position:0%
there are a multitude of ways to make
 
05:18:10.250 --> 05:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
sure that Reproductive Rights are
 
05:18:12.288 --> 05:18:12.298 align:start position:0%
protected and through statute is just
 
05:18:14.208 --> 05:18:14.218 align:start position:0%
one of them thank you thank you other
 
05:18:14.218 --> 05:18:16.670 align:start position:0%
one of them thank you thank you other
questions

05:18:16.670 --> 05:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:19.190 --> 05:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
yes representative Stapleton
 
05:18:21.050 --> 05:18:21.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:18:22.250 --> 05:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:18:24.590 --> 05:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
on your very nice handout here with a
 
05:18:26.990 --> 05:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
lot of facts and figures
 
05:18:30.110 --> 05:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
on the back page you have one particular
 
05:18:33.708 --> 05:18:33.718 align:start position:0%
item protecting abortion access is part
 
05:18:36.288 --> 05:18:36.298 align:start position:0%
of the battle for racial
 
05:18:38.750 --> 05:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
equality can you explain
 
05:18:42.110 --> 05:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
how that is uh even though we know that
 
05:18:46.690 --> 05:18:46.700 align:start position:0%
the black population is uh a large
 
05:18:50.330 --> 05:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
proportion a larger proportion of
 
05:18:52.970 --> 05:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
abortions elective abortions than in
 
05:18:55.670 --> 05:18:55.680 align:start position:0%
other racial segments
 
05:18:58.430 --> 05:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for your question
 
05:18:58.440 --> 05:18:59.030 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for your question
um

05:18:59.030 --> 05:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:01.250 --> 05:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
one thing that comes to mind with that
 
05:19:03.230 --> 05:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
is that there's been some research that
 
05:19:03.240 --> 05:19:04.850 align:start position:0%
is that there's been some research that
demonstrates

05:19:04.850 --> 05:19:04.860 align:start position:0%
demonstrates
 
05:19:07.430 --> 05:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
um disparities in maternal mortality
 
05:19:09.890 --> 05:19:09.900 align:start position:0%
rates should abortion be restricted
 
05:19:13.990 --> 05:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
Nationwide for example I believe 21
 
05:19:18.170 --> 05:19:18.180 align:start position:0%
or 24 will be the increase in maternal
 
05:19:21.530 --> 05:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
mortality rates in general but when we
 
05:19:23.150 --> 05:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
look at the increase of maternal
 
05:19:25.690 --> 05:19:25.700 align:start position:0%
mortality rates among black women after
 
05:19:27.770 --> 05:19:27.780 align:start position:0%
abortion access is Stripped Away that
 
05:19:30.830 --> 05:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
balances up to 33 percent in general
 
05:19:34.670 --> 05:19:34.680 align:start position:0%
there are racial disparities in maternal
 
05:19:37.670 --> 05:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
mortality and health risks when it comes
 
05:19:39.850 --> 05:19:39.860 align:start position:0%
to carrying out a pregnancy
 
05:19:42.350 --> 05:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
and there's also a lot of research that
 
05:19:42.360 --> 05:19:44.330 align:start position:0%
and there's also a lot of research that
shows

05:19:44.330 --> 05:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
shows
 
05:19:46.490 --> 05:19:46.500 align:start position:0%
it's more difficult to escape poverty
 
05:19:49.368 --> 05:19:49.378 align:start position:0%
which is something that's racialized and
 
05:19:50.868 --> 05:19:50.878 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to to give you some more
 
05:19:52.550 --> 05:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
information that can speak to to that
 
05:19:55.010 --> 05:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
bullet um if you'd like to communicate
 
05:19:56.690 --> 05:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
um further about that
 
05:19:58.430 --> 05:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions to this
 
05:19:58.440 --> 05:20:01.190 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions to this
Witness

Megan Murray
 
05:20:22.310 --> 05:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
I come before you in support of House
 
05:20:25.250 --> 05:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
Bill 88 as a co-sponsor woman and mother
 
05:20:27.230 --> 05:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
who represents the towns of Amherst and
 
05:20:27.240 --> 05:20:28.850 align:start position:0%
who represents the towns of Amherst and
Milford

05:20:28.850 --> 05:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
Milford
 
05:20:30.770 --> 05:20:30.780 align:start position:0%
for the first time in my lifetime last
 
05:20:32.868 --> 05:20:32.878 align:start position:0%
year a federally and constitutionally
 
05:20:34.610 --> 05:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
enshrined right was taken from me and
 
05:20:37.368 --> 05:20:37.378 align:start position:0%
many others Across the Nation
 
05:20:40.128 --> 05:20:40.138 align:start position:0%
so many worked for decades to make sure
 
05:20:41.868 --> 05:20:41.878 align:start position:0%
that Equitable access to Safe Care
 
05:20:44.330 --> 05:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
existed as women work to gain equal
 
05:20:46.368 --> 05:20:46.378 align:start position:0%
rights on so many fronts including
 
05:20:48.050 --> 05:20:48.060 align:start position:0%
access to abortion care
 
05:20:50.510 --> 05:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
this is not a partisan issue so many
 
05:20:52.310 --> 05:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters support the position of
 
05:20:54.410 --> 05:20:54.420 align:start position:0%
protecting access to abortion care and
 
05:20:56.330 --> 05:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
have doggedly work towards that for many
 
05:20:56.340 --> 05:20:57.788 align:start position:0%
have doggedly work towards that for many
generations

05:20:57.788 --> 05:20:57.798 align:start position:0%
generations
 
05:20:59.628 --> 05:20:59.638 align:start position:0%
you know what could you just get a
 
05:21:01.190 --> 05:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
little closer to the microphone thank
 
05:21:03.948 --> 05:21:03.958 align:start position:0%
you thanks regulatively the fall of row
 
05:21:06.530 --> 05:21:06.540 align:start position:0%
via the Jackson V dabs case has set up a
 
05:21:08.090 --> 05:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
patchwork of state-by-state policy
 
05:21:10.190 --> 05:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
positions that vary widely leaving
 
05:21:12.170 --> 05:21:12.180 align:start position:0%
equity and access to abortion care in
 
05:21:14.750 --> 05:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
the balance it is now up to us
 
05:21:17.448 --> 05:21:17.458 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire to make the
 
05:21:19.850 --> 05:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
make the promise we must that access to
 
05:21:21.530 --> 05:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
abortion care is a right
 
05:21:24.110 --> 05:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
the bill would provide legal strengths
 
05:21:25.910 --> 05:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
to the right to an abortion it changes
 
05:21:27.830 --> 05:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
none of the statues already set forth in
 
05:21:27.840 --> 05:21:28.730 align:start position:0%
none of the statues already set forth in
law

05:21:28.730 --> 05:21:28.740 align:start position:0%
law
 
05:21:31.670 --> 05:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
and HB 88 is at a minimum the least we
 
05:21:33.288 --> 05:21:33.298 align:start position:0%
can do to provide Assurance to those
 
05:21:34.850 --> 05:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
seeking abortion care here in New
 
05:21:36.830 --> 05:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire my constituents want high
 
05:21:39.650 --> 05:21:39.660 align:start position:0%
quality OB GYN doctors and services
 
05:21:41.570 --> 05:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
leave an abortion care unprotected here
 
05:21:43.368 --> 05:21:43.378 align:start position:0%
means that providers may leave and
 
05:21:44.690 --> 05:21:44.700 align:start position:0%
practice elsewhere
 
05:21:46.550 --> 05:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
it could leave a void in reproductive
 
05:21:48.410 --> 05:21:48.420 align:start position:0%
health care options if we do not send a
 
05:21:50.330 --> 05:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
clear message that abortion care is
 
05:21:52.128 --> 05:21:52.138 align:start position:0%
protected in law and stated in the
 
05:21:54.890 --> 05:21:54.900 align:start position:0%
statute hb88 ensures that access to
 
05:21:56.868 --> 05:21:56.878 align:start position:0%
abortion care is so vitally important
 
05:21:59.090 --> 05:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
and remains a private decision that
 
05:22:00.770 --> 05:22:00.780 align:start position:0%
families with their medical providers
 
05:22:03.470 --> 05:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
make together
 
05:22:05.948 --> 05:22:05.958 align:start position:0%
the reasons for an abortion and an
 
05:22:07.610 --> 05:22:07.620 align:start position:0%
individual's medical and personal
 
05:22:10.310 --> 05:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
circumstances are many and unique
 
05:22:12.708 --> 05:22:12.718 align:start position:0%
no two circumstances are the same
 
05:22:14.690 --> 05:22:14.700 align:start position:0%
we as a community must ensure that we
 
05:22:16.070 --> 05:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
are not creating environments where
 
05:22:17.810 --> 05:22:17.820 align:start position:0%
practitioners are hesitant to provide
 
05:22:20.090 --> 05:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
critical care and that from an equity
 
05:22:21.530 --> 05:22:21.540 align:start position:0%
standpoint we are allowing the most
 
05:22:23.810 --> 05:22:23.820 align:start position:0%
vulnerable populations to access their
 
05:22:26.510 --> 05:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
care safely affordably and privately
 
05:22:28.550 --> 05:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
with the protection of the law firmly
 
05:22:30.470 --> 05:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
alongside of them they are taught to
 
05:22:33.708 --> 05:22:33.718 align:start position:0%
pass on hb88 thank you questions for
 
05:22:36.050 --> 05:22:36.060 align:start position:0%
this week
 
05:22:38.390 --> 05:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
yes I guess I just have one question I
 
05:22:40.250 --> 05:22:40.260 align:start position:0%
want to I mean could you
 
05:22:43.430 --> 05:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
it's a little unclear to me candidly the
 
05:22:45.170 --> 05:22:45.180 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill so I guess what I'm
 
05:22:47.030 --> 05:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
wondering is could you
 
05:22:49.430 --> 05:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
let's assume that
 
05:22:52.070 --> 05:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
we the the fetal Life protection act as
 
05:22:54.590 --> 05:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
it exists right now remains in effect
 
05:22:56.448 --> 05:22:56.458 align:start position:0%
because as I understand that this bill
 
05:22:58.850 --> 05:22:58.860 align:start position:0%
doesn't purport to change to change that
 
05:23:01.010 --> 05:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
so could you give
 
05:23:02.990 --> 05:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
us an example
 
05:23:05.510 --> 05:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
of of what you're in other words if the
 
05:23:07.490 --> 05:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
fetal Life protection act remains in
 
05:23:11.330 --> 05:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
effect and is not to be changed by this
 
05:23:14.868 --> 05:23:14.878 align:start position:0%
can you give us an example of what would
 
05:23:18.050 --> 05:23:18.060 align:start position:0%
what would change If This Were enacted
 
05:23:20.810 --> 05:23:20.820 align:start position:0%
or not enacted what what are you what's
 
05:23:23.150 --> 05:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
the risk that you're worried about
 
05:23:25.610 --> 05:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
if you have this bill or don't have this
 
05:23:28.250 --> 05:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
bill uh thank you representative for the
 
05:23:31.190 --> 05:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
question my concern is that we do not
 
05:23:34.128 --> 05:23:34.138 align:start position:0%
have anything currently in state statute
 
05:23:37.490 --> 05:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
like hb88 that sends the message that
 
05:23:40.610 --> 05:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
acts access to reproductive care is a
 
05:23:43.368 --> 05:23:43.378 align:start position:0%
state right clearly and defined as
 
05:23:46.788 --> 05:23:46.798 align:start position:0%

all right hello again legislators
 
05:24:05.448 --> 05:24:05.458 align:start position:0%
um my name is Josie Pinto I'm here as a
 
05:24:07.250 --> 05:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
lobbyist and the executive director of
 
05:24:08.868 --> 05:24:08.878 align:start position:0%
the reproductive Freedom fund of New
 
05:24:12.050 --> 05:24:12.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm here to express my
 
05:24:15.350 --> 05:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
strong support for HB 88 relative to
 
05:24:17.448 --> 05:24:17.458 align:start position:0%
access to abortion care
 
05:24:19.670 --> 05:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
as our organization deals with the
 
05:24:21.708 --> 05:24:21.718 align:start position:0%
Fallout of half of our country Banning
 
05:24:23.810 --> 05:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
abortion there has never been a more
 
05:24:25.670 --> 05:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
important time for us to proactively
 
05:24:27.590 --> 05:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
protect the right to abortion here in
 
05:24:29.570 --> 05:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and prevent our rights
 
05:24:32.510 --> 05:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
from being chipped away at over time
 
05:24:35.090 --> 05:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
despite personal opinions on the topic
 
05:24:37.368 --> 05:24:37.378 align:start position:0%
abortion is an incredibly safe medical
 
05:24:37.378 --> 05:24:38.868 align:start position:0%
abortion is an incredibly safe medical
procedure

05:24:38.868 --> 05:24:38.878 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
05:24:40.970 --> 05:24:40.980 align:start position:0%
the residents of our state deserve to
 
05:24:43.190 --> 05:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
know that despite what the Supreme Court
 
05:24:45.830 --> 05:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
has decided or what other states decide
 
05:24:48.288 --> 05:24:48.298 align:start position:0%
in these coming months and years they
 
05:24:50.570 --> 05:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
will be guaranteed access to abortion up
 
05:24:52.730 --> 05:24:52.740 align:start position:0%
until the 24-week ban that has already
 
05:24:54.410 --> 05:24:54.420 align:start position:0%
been put in place
 
05:24:57.650 --> 05:24:57.660 align:start position:0%
to be clear as we've discussed HB 88
 
05:24:59.510 --> 05:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't change anything about the
 
05:25:01.190 --> 05:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
existing law that is currently on the
 
05:25:04.128 --> 05:25:04.138 align:start position:0%
books but it would solidify it giving
 
05:25:06.590 --> 05:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters a clear answer to where
 
05:25:09.530 --> 05:25:09.540 align:start position:0%
our laws stand and easing our fears that
 
05:25:12.230 --> 05:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
we will not see a 24-week ban turn into
 
05:25:14.930 --> 05:25:14.940 align:start position:0%
a 20-week ban then a 15-week ban and so
 
05:25:14.940 --> 05:25:16.250 align:start position:0%
a 20-week ban then a 15-week ban and so
on

05:25:16.250 --> 05:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:25:18.948 --> 05:25:18.958 align:start position:0%
if we as Granite seders truly believe in
 
05:25:21.830 --> 05:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
bodily autonomy medical privacy and the
 
05:25:23.690 --> 05:25:23.700 align:start position:0%
rights of all Granite Staters to pursue
 
05:25:26.510 --> 05:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
Liberty we must codify the rights of all
 
05:25:28.850 --> 05:25:28.860 align:start position:0%
into law so that we can then begin the
 
05:25:30.948 --> 05:25:30.958 align:start position:0%
true work of ensuring equal access and
 
05:25:33.350 --> 05:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
true reproductive and maternal Justice
 
05:25:35.750 --> 05:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
I urge you all to vote in favor with the
 
05:25:37.610 --> 05:25:37.620 align:start position:0%
majority of granite Staters saying that
 
05:25:39.410 --> 05:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
they want the right to abortion to be
 
05:25:41.090 --> 05:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
affirmed and protected here in New
 
05:25:43.490 --> 05:25:43.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I urge you all to support this
 
05:25:45.288 --> 05:25:45.298 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you
 
05:25:48.830 --> 05:25:48.840 align:start position:0%

of HB 88 the access to abortion act Care
 
05:26:28.070 --> 05:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
Act Care Act
 
05:26:30.170 --> 05:26:30.180 align:start position:0%
a year ago I told my daughter Kayla's
 
05:26:31.910 --> 05:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
story our abortion story for the first
 
05:26:33.830 --> 05:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
time in public In This Very Room in
 
05:26:37.250 --> 05:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
support of HB 1609 to add a fatal fetal
 
05:26:38.930 --> 05:26:38.940 align:start position:0%
diagnosis exception to our state's
 
05:26:41.208 --> 05:26:41.218 align:start position:0%
abortion ban I spoke of being a mother
 
05:26:42.830 --> 05:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
of seven children including my daughter
 
05:26:45.890 --> 05:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
Kayla who I lost 18 years ago due to a
 
05:26:48.410 --> 05:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
fatal fetal anomaly our abortion was at
 
05:26:49.910 --> 05:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
22 weeks
 
05:26:53.150 --> 05:26:53.160 align:start position:0%
December 10 2005 Kayla was delivered
 
05:26:55.190 --> 05:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
stillborn after our termination the day
 
05:26:55.200 --> 05:26:55.970 align:start position:0%
stillborn after our termination the day
before

05:26:55.970 --> 05:26:55.980 align:start position:0%
before
 
05:26:57.948 --> 05:26:57.958 align:start position:0%
as we held her in our arms for several
 
05:26:59.930 --> 05:26:59.940 align:start position:0%
hours we said goodbye to the little girl
 
05:27:01.550 --> 05:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
that we continue to love with all of our
 
05:27:01.560 --> 05:27:02.448 align:start position:0%
that we continue to love with all of our
hearts

05:27:02.448 --> 05:27:02.458 align:start position:0%
hearts
 
05:27:04.190 --> 05:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
Kayla was found to have a deletion in
 
05:27:05.990 --> 05:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
her 15th chromosome that was not
 
05:27:08.270 --> 05:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
detected until after our abortion
 
05:27:10.970 --> 05:27:10.980 align:start position:0%
our amniocentesis results returned a
 
05:27:12.948 --> 05:27:12.958 align:start position:0%
month after our termination when I would
 
05:27:15.530 --> 05:27:15.540 align:start position:0%
have been 26 weeks pregnant this
 
05:27:17.390 --> 05:27:17.400 align:start position:0%
timeline is the reason that I began to
 
05:27:19.190 --> 05:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
tell our story in support of the Fatal
 
05:27:21.110 --> 05:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
fetal anomaly Amendment added to the
 
05:27:23.448 --> 05:27:23.458 align:start position:0%
abortion ban instituted last year
 
05:27:25.490 --> 05:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
it is clear that in these incredible
 
05:27:28.190 --> 05:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
complex situations decisions should be
 
05:27:29.930 --> 05:27:29.940 align:start position:0%
left to a pregnant person and their
 
05:27:29.940 --> 05:27:31.730 align:start position:0%
left to a pregnant person and their
doctor

05:27:31.730 --> 05:27:31.740 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
05:27:33.708 --> 05:27:33.718 align:start position:0%
I am here today to urge you to protect
 
05:27:35.990 --> 05:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
the right to an abortion before 21 24
 
05:27:38.270 --> 05:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
weeks in state law
 
05:27:40.250 --> 05:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
since Roe v Wade was overturned last
 
05:27:42.410 --> 05:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
summer our country's reproductive Health
 
05:27:45.110 --> 05:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
Care landscape has been in disarray one
 
05:27:46.970 --> 05:27:46.980 align:start position:0%
in three American women have lost the
 
05:27:49.430 --> 05:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
right to abortion in their home state
 
05:27:51.590 --> 05:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
while abortion remains safe and legal in
 
05:27:54.170 --> 05:27:54.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire before 24 weeks we are the
 
05:27:55.970 --> 05:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
only state in New England without a
 
05:27:57.890 --> 05:27:57.900 align:start position:0%
proactive protection for our abortion
 
05:28:00.288 --> 05:28:00.298 align:start position:0%
rights Granite Staters are now
 
05:28:02.390 --> 05:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
susceptible to out-of-state attacks and
 
05:28:03.890 --> 05:28:03.900 align:start position:0%
on their health care
 
05:28:05.868 --> 05:28:05.878 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we don't let other
 
05:28:07.970 --> 05:28:07.980 align:start position:0%
states dictate our rights
 
05:28:09.890 --> 05:28:09.900 align:start position:0%
I did not make the decision to have an
 
05:28:12.590 --> 05:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
abortion with ease nor uninformed though
 
05:28:14.448 --> 05:28:14.458 align:start position:0%
we had only hours to make our decision
 
05:28:16.310 --> 05:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
those hours were filled with gathering
 
05:28:19.190 --> 05:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
information and asking many questions in
 
05:28:21.050 --> 05:28:21.060 align:start position:0%
the days that followed I continued to
 
05:28:23.030 --> 05:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
ask questions along the way and together
 
05:28:24.830 --> 05:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
with my Physicians we made the best
 
05:28:27.650 --> 05:28:27.660 align:start position:0%
decision for our family not once did I
 
05:28:29.628 --> 05:28:29.638 align:start position:0%
look to my state legislators for advice
 
05:28:32.628 --> 05:28:32.638 align:start position:0%
opinions or medical knowledge I trusted
 
05:28:34.490 --> 05:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
in my Physicians expertise and the
 
05:28:36.288 --> 05:28:36.298 align:start position:0%
information that we had
 
05:28:38.448 --> 05:28:38.458 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents are capable of
 
05:28:40.550 --> 05:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
making thoughtful decisions about their
 
05:28:42.470 --> 05:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
own health care and consultation with
 
05:28:44.030 --> 05:28:44.040 align:start position:0%
their loved ones faith and medical
 
05:28:47.030 --> 05:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
providers as they see fit New
 
05:28:48.890 --> 05:28:48.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's elected officials should not
 
05:28:50.448 --> 05:28:50.458 align:start position:0%
turn their backs on our state's
 
05:28:53.090 --> 05:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
tradition of trusting the people of New
 
05:28:55.788 --> 05:28:55.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to make these decisions in the
 
05:28:57.770 --> 05:28:57.780 align:start position:0%
face of national uncertainty you have
 
05:29:00.410 --> 05:29:00.420 align:start position:0%
the ability to take proactive action to
 
05:29:02.330 --> 05:29:02.340 align:start position:0%
ensure abortion remains safe and legal
 
05:29:04.850 --> 05:29:04.860 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire before 24 weeks
 
05:29:08.090 --> 05:29:08.100 align:start position:0%

I urge the committee to oppose house
 
05:29:30.170 --> 05:29:30.180 align:start position:0%
bill 88.
 
05:29:35.330 --> 05:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
quite simply I believe House Bill 88
 
05:29:40.128 --> 05:29:40.138 align:start position:0%
will put chilling effects on what little
 
05:29:43.730 --> 05:29:43.740 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire can do to
 
05:29:46.788 --> 05:29:46.798 align:start position:0%
protect human life
 
05:29:51.590 --> 05:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
it must not become law in New Hampshire
 
05:29:55.070 --> 05:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
because we're we want to protect human
 
05:29:55.080 --> 05:29:57.110 align:start position:0%
because we're we want to protect human
life

05:29:57.110 --> 05:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
life
 
05:30:01.310 --> 05:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
and also New Hampshire it's part of a
 
05:30:04.690 --> 05:30:04.700 align:start position:0%
republic that is based upon judeo
 
05:30:08.750 --> 05:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
principles judeo-christian principles
 
05:30:12.890 --> 05:30:12.900 align:start position:0%

05:30:39.530 --> 05:30:39.540 align:start position:0%
director of public policy for the Roman
 
05:30:42.110 --> 05:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
Catholic Diocese of Manchester and on
 
05:30:44.208 --> 05:30:44.218 align:start position:0%
behalf of Bishop Peter labashi I'm here
 
05:30:46.750 --> 05:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
today to respectfully oppose
 
05:30:49.788 --> 05:30:49.798 align:start position:0%
hb88 I won't repeat everything I said
 
05:30:52.190 --> 05:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
this morning and I've provided written
 
05:30:55.070 --> 05:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
testimony here today uh that explains
 
05:30:57.890 --> 05:30:57.900 align:start position:0%
why we oppose the policy and I think
 
05:31:00.890 --> 05:31:00.900 align:start position:0%
also today both in your questions and in
 
05:31:03.470 --> 05:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
the answers it's become abundantly clear
 
05:31:05.930 --> 05:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
of what the sort of procedural issue
 
05:31:08.690 --> 05:31:08.700 align:start position:0%
with this is that this is
 
05:31:11.930 --> 05:31:11.940 align:start position:0%
what I would respectfully say is an HB
 
05:31:15.830 --> 05:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
that wants to be a cacr
 
05:31:18.470 --> 05:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
um and so with that I would urge you to
 
05:31:21.350 --> 05:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
vote this down thank you
 
05:31:24.890 --> 05:31:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:27.050 --> 05:31:27.060 align:start position:0%
I I take it Mr dry I think am I
 
05:31:28.550 --> 05:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
corrected what are you what you sort of
 
05:31:30.830 --> 05:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
mean by what you just said is that if we
 
05:31:34.190 --> 05:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
pass this bill it's good only until
 
05:31:36.410 --> 05:31:36.420 align:start position:0%
somebody decides to some Legends until
 
05:31:38.270 --> 05:31:38.280 align:start position:0%
some legislature in the future decides
 
05:31:40.490 --> 05:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
to change the law exactly it's it's
 
05:31:44.150 --> 05:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
trying to sort of enshrine policy into
 
05:31:47.030 --> 05:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
perpetuity but it can't do that because
 
05:31:49.430 --> 05:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
the legislature is always free to do it
 
05:31:51.890 --> 05:31:51.900 align:start position:0%
so if the legislature decided to do
 
05:31:54.470 --> 05:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
something in the future which is what
 
05:31:56.330 --> 05:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
the folks who sponsored this are trying
 
05:31:58.670 --> 05:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
to prevent from happening it would have
 
05:32:00.708 --> 05:32:00.718 align:start position:0%
no impact because the legislature would
 
05:32:03.350 --> 05:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
simply repeal this and replace it with
 
05:32:05.090 --> 05:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
the new legislation
 
05:32:07.850 --> 05:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for the switch
 
05:32:10.250 --> 05:32:10.260 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you sir Sandra de
 
05:32:13.670 --> 05:32:13.680 align:start position:0%

05:32:18.610 --> 05:32:18.620 align:start position:0%

after Roe v Wade was decided 50 years
 
05:33:21.410 --> 05:33:21.420 align:start position:0%
ago New Hampshire citizens were afforded
 
05:33:23.868 --> 05:33:23.878 align:start position:0%
affirmative legal protection that
 
05:33:26.448 --> 05:33:26.458 align:start position:0%
allowed Advocates medical providers and
 
05:33:28.970 --> 05:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
Health Care Centers like ours to develop
 
05:33:32.050 --> 05:33:32.060 align:start position:0%
a safe effective accessible
 
05:33:34.610 --> 05:33:34.620 align:start position:0%
patient-centered and evidence-based
 
05:33:36.890 --> 05:33:36.900 align:start position:0%
system of abortion care that has
 
05:33:38.750 --> 05:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
compassionately and professionally
 
05:33:40.730 --> 05:33:40.740 align:start position:0%
served your constituents for over 45
 
05:33:43.310 --> 05:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
years as they make important personal
 
05:33:45.050 --> 05:33:45.060 align:start position:0%
medical decisions
 
05:33:47.750 --> 05:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
I wanted to focus my testimony today on
 
05:33:51.050 --> 05:33:51.060 align:start position:0%
two considerations the first is that RSA
 
05:33:55.610 --> 05:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
329 sections 43-50 explicitly do not
 
05:33:57.770 --> 05:33:57.780 align:start position:0%
protect the right to abortion as you've
 
05:34:01.670 --> 05:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
already heard RSA 329 section 49 makes
 
05:34:04.670 --> 05:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
that clear in its very specific one
 
05:34:07.430 --> 05:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
sentence text nothing in this
 
05:34:09.050 --> 05:34:09.060 align:start position:0%
subdivision shall be construed as
 
05:34:10.970 --> 05:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
creating or recognizing a right to
 
05:34:10.980 --> 05:34:12.590 align:start position:0%
creating or recognizing a right to
abortion

05:34:12.590 --> 05:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
05:34:15.050 --> 05:34:15.060 align:start position:0%
I believe it's inaccurate and misleading
 
05:34:18.288 --> 05:34:18.298 align:start position:0%
for any person lawmaker or politician to
 
05:34:20.628 --> 05:34:20.638 align:start position:0%
say or imply that abortion before 24
 
05:34:23.150 --> 05:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
weeks gestation is protected in New
 
05:34:26.150 --> 05:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it is not with the lack of
 
05:34:29.150 --> 05:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
federal protections as of June 2022 the
 
05:34:31.850 --> 05:34:31.860 align:start position:0%
time to provide protection is now
 
05:34:34.550 --> 05:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
it is not inappropriate in our opinion
 
05:34:37.910 --> 05:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
to do this now as a House Bill while
 
05:34:40.010 --> 05:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
considering the possibility of a
 
05:34:42.170 --> 05:34:42.180 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment in the future
 
05:34:44.448 --> 05:34:44.458 align:start position:0%
the second consideration is about the
 
05:34:47.090 --> 05:34:47.100 align:start position:0%
precedent that sets that is set by RSA
 
05:34:51.230 --> 05:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
329 sections 43-50 if lawmakers have
 
05:34:53.628 --> 05:34:53.638 align:start position:0%
determined that access to this medical
 
05:34:56.510 --> 05:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
procedure an access to an abortion is
 
05:34:57.890 --> 05:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
important enough to legislate with
 
05:35:00.110 --> 05:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
restrictions then it must be important
 
05:35:01.850 --> 05:35:01.860 align:start position:0%
enough to recognize with legislative
 
05:35:01.860 --> 05:35:03.170 align:start position:0%
enough to recognize with legislative
protection

05:35:03.170 --> 05:35:03.180 align:start position:0%
protection
 
05:35:06.470 --> 05:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
I've heard lawmakers and other folks in
 
05:35:08.090 --> 05:35:08.100 align:start position:0%
this state insist that there is no
 
05:35:10.070 --> 05:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
intention to restrict abortion further
 
05:35:12.230 --> 05:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire intentions and
 
05:35:13.970 --> 05:35:13.980 align:start position:0%
reassurances are not the legal
 
05:35:15.830 --> 05:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
protection that your constituents need
 
05:35:17.270 --> 05:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
and deserve
 
05:35:19.610 --> 05:35:19.620 align:start position:0%
the access to abortion Care Act upholds
 
05:35:21.470 --> 05:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire values by putting into law
 
05:35:23.270 --> 05:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
that the state cannot further interfere
 
05:35:26.030 --> 05:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
in the right to access abortion House
 
05:35:27.948 --> 05:35:27.958 align:start position:0%
Bill 88 also provides an enforcement
 
05:35:30.770 --> 05:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
remedy if that freedom is violated this
 
05:35:32.690 --> 05:35:32.700 align:start position:0%
levels the legislative landscape by
 
05:35:34.430 --> 05:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
making it clear that New Hampshire
 
05:35:37.610 --> 05:35:37.620 align:start position:0%
protects abortion access up to 24 weeks
 
05:35:40.730 --> 05:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
the June 2022 U.S Supreme Court Dobbs
 
05:35:42.650 --> 05:35:42.660 align:start position:0%
decision makes it critical that New
 
05:35:44.990 --> 05:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire actively protects the right of
 
05:35:47.570 --> 05:35:47.580 align:start position:0%
to abortion for all citizens millions of
 
05:35:49.430 --> 05:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
Americans are already impacted by
 
05:35:51.410 --> 05:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
increased restrictions or bans since
 
05:35:53.448 --> 05:35:53.458 align:start position:0%
this decision and there are bills
 
05:35:55.910 --> 05:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
proposed annually in New Hampshire that
 
05:35:57.830 --> 05:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
seek to further restrict abortion access
 
05:35:59.750 --> 05:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
and bills that seek additional
 
05:36:01.610 --> 05:36:01.620 align:start position:0%
interference in this private medical
 
05:36:03.830 --> 05:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
decision being made by your constituents
 
05:36:06.170 --> 05:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
and their health care providers we ask
 
05:36:08.090 --> 05:36:08.100 align:start position:0%

88. thank you thank you questions to

05:36:45.900 --> 05:36:47.690 align:start position:0%
 
this

05:37:49.730 --> 05:37:49.740 align:start position:0%
high point in my life feeling as I do
 
05:37:52.190 --> 05:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
that I'm saving women's lives by doing

05:41:09.470 --> 05:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
of HB 88 the access to abortion Care Act
 
05:41:12.050 --> 05:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
as a Unitarian Universalist Minister I
 
05:41:14.208 --> 05:41:14.218 align:start position:0%
firmly believe in the inherent worth and
 
05:41:16.970 --> 05:41:16.980 align:start position:0%
dignity of every person and that each
 
05:41:19.250 --> 05:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
individual has a right to make decisions
 
05:41:22.070 --> 05:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
about their own body and their own life
 
05:41:25.490 --> 05:41:25.500 align:start position:0%
this belief extends to the issue of
 
05:41:27.470 --> 05:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
abortion access
 
05:41:30.350 --> 05:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
people who seek abortions as you've
 
05:41:32.810 --> 05:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
already heard today are often faced with
 
05:41:35.230 --> 05:41:35.240 align:start position:0%
difficult and complex situations
 
05:41:38.270 --> 05:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
including Financial hardships health
 
05:41:40.448 --> 05:41:40.458 align:start position:0%
concerns or unwanted pregnancies
 
05:41:43.430 --> 05:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
resulting from sexual assault or a
 
05:41:43.440 --> 05:41:44.628 align:start position:0%
resulting from sexual assault or a
coercion

05:41:44.628 --> 05:41:44.638 align:start position:0%
coercion
 
05:41:47.030 --> 05:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
no matter what the situation all
 
05:41:50.090 --> 05:41:50.100 align:start position:0%
pregnant people deserve access to Safe
 
05:41:53.208 --> 05:41:53.218 align:start position:0%
Medical Care without fear of shame or
 
05:41:56.448 --> 05:41:56.458 align:start position:0%
reprisal my faith tells me that
 
05:41:59.390 --> 05:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
everybody is sacred including and
 
05:42:01.490 --> 05:42:01.500 align:start position:0%
especially those bodies that can carry
 
05:42:04.610 --> 05:42:04.620 align:start position:0%
pregnancies and every person has a right
 
05:42:08.830 --> 05:42:08.840 align:start position:0%
to Holy agency over their bodies
 
05:42:11.990 --> 05:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
we are in a crisis moment when it comes
 
05:42:14.750 --> 05:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
to abortion access in this country since
 
05:42:17.330 --> 05:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
Roe versus Wade was overturned in June
 
05:42:20.868 --> 05:42:20.878 align:start position:0%
abortion access has been chaotic and
 
05:42:24.170 --> 05:42:24.180 align:start position:0%
confusing in this post-row world Granite
 
05:42:27.230 --> 05:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
Staters deserve a law on the books that
 
05:42:30.530 --> 05:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
affirms their right to access abortion
 
05:42:32.330 --> 05:42:32.340 align:start position:0%
care and prohibits the state from
 
05:42:35.090 --> 05:42:35.100 align:start position:0%
further interfering with that right
 
05:42:38.448 --> 05:42:38.458 align:start position:0%
my faith compels me to support bodily
 
05:42:41.208 --> 05:42:41.218 align:start position:0%
autonomy and freedom of conscience and
 
05:42:43.850 --> 05:42:43.860 align:start position:0%
access to safe and legal abortion is
 
05:42:46.910 --> 05:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
essential to upholding those values
 
05:42:49.490 --> 05:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
as a faith leader who cares deeply about
 
05:42:51.650 --> 05:42:51.660 align:start position:0%

05:44:36.590 --> 05:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
children throughout their lifetimes
 
05:44:39.048 --> 05:44:39.058 align:start position:0%
in some in summary abortion is a needed
 
05:44:41.090 --> 05:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
part of Health Care no doctor or medical
 
05:44:42.650 --> 05:44:42.660 align:start position:0%
professional should be fined or
 
05:44:44.390 --> 05:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
penalized for providing these procedures
 
05:44:46.610 --> 05:44:46.620 align:start position:0%
in women and families across our state
 
05:44:48.470 --> 05:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
should be able to rest assured that we
 
05:44:50.030 --> 05:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
are not looking to further restrict
 
05:44:51.850 --> 05:44:51.860 align:start position:0%
access to abortion in the years to come
 
05:44:53.990 --> 05:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
for these reasons we ask that you
 
05:44:58.010 --> 05:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
support HP 88 and as well as HP 224 and
 
05:45:00.948 --> 05:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
both them both ought to pass and with
 
05:45:02.390 --> 05:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to take questions thank

05:45:25.070 --> 05:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Sherman Lynn and
 
05:45:26.690 --> 05:45:26.700 align:start position:0%
honorable committee members
 
05:45:28.910 --> 05:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
my name is Emily zagrano and I ask you
 
05:45:30.948 --> 05:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
to support hb88
 
05:45:32.690 --> 05:45:32.700 align:start position:0%
I am a pediatric emergency medicine
 
05:45:35.030 --> 05:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
physician my adult life has been
 
05:45:37.490 --> 05:45:37.500 align:start position:0%
dedicated to saving children's lives but
 
05:45:39.590 --> 05:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
I could not save my own daughters
 
05:45:41.570 --> 05:45:41.580 align:start position:0%
I had two abortions
 
05:45:44.030 --> 05:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
my stories of my love and my heartbreak
 
05:45:46.610 --> 05:45:46.620 align:start position:0%
but the value is in my body and my
 
05:45:46.620 --> 05:45:47.868 align:start position:0%
but the value is in my body and my
choices

05:45:47.868 --> 05:45:47.878 align:start position:0%
choices
 
05:45:49.970 --> 05:45:49.980 align:start position:0%
this was my first pregnancy and very
 
05:45:52.548 --> 05:45:52.558 align:start position:0%
much wanted by my husband and I we were
 
05:45:54.110 --> 05:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
shocked and thrilled when our first scan
 
05:45:56.510 --> 05:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
at 12 weeks showed two babies
 
05:45:58.610 --> 05:45:58.620 align:start position:0%
however the ultrasound also showed I had
 
05:46:00.708 --> 05:46:00.718 align:start position:0%
a uterine anomaly a potentially
 
05:46:02.510 --> 05:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
life-threatening condition
 
05:46:04.788 --> 05:46:04.798 align:start position:0%
the Twins were in two different areas of
 
05:46:06.288 --> 05:46:06.298 align:start position:0%
my uterus
 
05:46:08.930 --> 05:46:08.940 align:start position:0%
more studies suggested I was safe and we
 
05:46:11.208 --> 05:46:11.218 align:start position:0%
would have our baby girls we chose names
 
05:46:13.310 --> 05:46:13.320 align:start position:0%
I marked the date on my calendar when
 
05:46:15.350 --> 05:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
they would be 29 weeks and very likely
 
05:46:16.910 --> 05:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
to survive
 
05:46:19.368 --> 05:46:19.378 align:start position:0%
at 16 weeks and four days pregnant I
 
05:46:21.590 --> 05:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
woke up with pain that became sharp
 
05:46:24.350 --> 05:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
severe it hurt to breathe
 
05:46:25.970 --> 05:46:25.980 align:start position:0%
I was ultimately sent to a Boston
 
05:46:28.788 --> 05:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
hospital my husband and I sat in a dark
 
05:46:30.590 --> 05:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
room where monitors show the ultrasound
 
05:46:33.010 --> 05:46:33.020 align:start position:0%
images turned on during happy scans
 
05:46:36.470 --> 05:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
turned turned off during the sad ones
 
05:46:38.690 --> 05:46:38.700 align:start position:0%
they were off for ours
 
05:46:41.208 --> 05:46:41.218 align:start position:0%
the news was worse than we could imagine
 
05:46:43.190 --> 05:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
the left side was a previously
 
05:46:45.890 --> 05:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
unrecognized rudimentary horn and the
 
05:46:48.530 --> 05:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
uterine wall had ruptured in two places
 
05:46:50.930 --> 05:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
this fetus had no chance
 
05:46:54.410 --> 05:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
my room was literally broken
 
05:46:56.390 --> 05:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
on the right side the baby had a
 
05:46:58.190 --> 05:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
congenital heart defect which would
 
05:47:00.230 --> 05:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
require surgery and functioning lungs to
 
05:47:02.750 --> 05:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
survive if she could make it to
 
05:47:05.628 --> 05:47:05.638 align:start position:0%
viability in my broken womb
 
05:47:08.390 --> 05:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
these findings changed everything
 
05:47:11.090 --> 05:47:11.100 align:start position:0%
to save my life I needed surgery and one
 
05:47:12.650 --> 05:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
of my daughters inside needed to be
 
05:47:12.660 --> 05:47:13.788 align:start position:0%
of my daughters inside needed to be
removed

05:47:13.788 --> 05:47:13.798 align:start position:0%
removed
 
05:47:16.010 --> 05:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
in surgery they saved the unicornate
 
05:47:17.750 --> 05:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
uterus and the fetus on the right was
 
05:47:18.830 --> 05:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
still there
 
05:47:20.690 --> 05:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
but it was clear that allowing the
 
05:47:23.090 --> 05:47:23.100 align:start position:0%
pregnancy to continue would put me at a
 
05:47:24.708 --> 05:47:24.718 align:start position:0%
huge risk
 
05:47:27.530 --> 05:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
for two weeks I sat on the couch tried
 
05:47:29.810 --> 05:47:29.820 align:start position:0%
to heal from surgery and loved my baby
 
05:47:33.410 --> 05:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
as hard as I could I grieved
 
05:47:34.850 --> 05:47:34.860 align:start position:0%
we went to Boston for the appointment
 
05:47:37.548 --> 05:47:37.558 align:start position:0%
the next day or the day before the DNC
 
05:47:40.070 --> 05:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
the abortion we were there for medical
 
05:47:40.080 --> 05:47:41.090 align:start position:0%
the abortion we were there for medical
care

05:47:41.090 --> 05:47:41.100 align:start position:0%
care
 
05:47:43.730 --> 05:47:43.740 align:start position:0%
we were there to save my life
 
05:47:45.770 --> 05:47:45.780 align:start position:0%
we were there because this was the most
 
05:47:48.770 --> 05:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
appropriate decision for our family
 
05:47:50.570 --> 05:47:50.580 align:start position:0%
we were there because we needed to be
 
05:47:50.580 --> 05:47:51.770 align:start position:0%
we were there because we needed to be
there

05:47:51.770 --> 05:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:47:54.948 --> 05:47:54.958 align:start position:0%
my abortion saved my life my abortions
 
05:47:57.170 --> 05:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
allowed me to have more children
 
05:47:59.330 --> 05:47:59.340 align:start position:0%
my abortions allowed me to continue my
 
05:48:02.990 --> 05:48:03.000 align:start position:0%
work to save your children's lives
 
05:48:05.270 --> 05:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that the legislature acted
 
05:48:07.490 --> 05:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
last year to add a fatal fetal diagnosis
 
05:48:09.048 --> 05:48:09.058 align:start position:0%
exception to the New Hampshire abortion
 
05:48:09.058 --> 05:48:10.070 align:start position:0%
exception to the New Hampshire abortion
ban

05:48:10.070 --> 05:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
ban
 
05:48:11.930 --> 05:48:11.940 align:start position:0%
however we also need to protect access
 
05:48:13.910 --> 05:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
to safe and legal abortion in New
 
05:48:15.650 --> 05:48:15.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state law
 
05:48:18.650 --> 05:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
as a doctor and as a patient I
 
05:48:20.150 --> 05:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
understand just how different every
 
05:48:21.590 --> 05:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
pregnancy is
 
05:48:23.150 --> 05:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
Uranus theaters and their medical
 
05:48:25.250 --> 05:48:25.260 align:start position:0%
providers need all options available to
 
05:48:25.260 --> 05:48:26.510 align:start position:0%
providers need all options available to
them

05:48:26.510 --> 05:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:48:29.448 --> 05:48:29.458 align:start position:0%
please pass HB 88 and protect access to
 
05:48:31.548 --> 05:48:31.558 align:start position:0%
safe and legal abortion
 
05:48:35.208 --> 05:48:35.218 align:start position:0%

I'm here testifying
 
05:49:49.190 --> 05:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Medical Society
 
05:49:52.010 --> 05:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
the majority of my colleagues

my past patients and the majority of New

05:50:06.590 --> 05:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
politics obviously crept
 
05:50:09.708 --> 05:50:09.718 align:start position:0%
into our judicial
 
05:50:13.490 --> 05:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
branch of our democracy in June
 
05:50:17.890 --> 05:50:17.900 align:start position:0%
when the Dobbs Jackson decision
 
05:50:17.900 --> 05:50:19.610 align:start position:0%
when the Dobbs Jackson decision
overturned

05:50:19.610 --> 05:50:19.620 align:start position:0%
overturned
 
05:50:22.788 --> 05:50:22.798 align:start position:0%
Roe v Wade taking away the right of

Roe v Wade taking away the right of
privacy

05:50:25.128 --> 05:50:25.138 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
05:50:28.430 --> 05:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
in deciding about a woman's health her
 
05:50:31.910 --> 05:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
fertility and her future
 
05:50:35.110 --> 05:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
the result is that now one in three
 
05:50:37.970 --> 05:50:37.980 align:start position:0%
reproductive age women
 
05:50:41.990 --> 05:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
do not have access to abortion in their
 
05:50:44.690 --> 05:50:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:48.530 --> 05:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
the inevitable result is that affluent
 
05:50:52.190 --> 05:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
women will continue to have
 
05:50:54.948 --> 05:50:54.958 align:start position:0%
safe abortions
 
05:50:59.868 --> 05:50:59.878 align:start position:0%
crossing state lines if necessary
 
05:51:03.010 --> 05:51:03.020 align:start position:0%
but marginalized and less affluent women
 
05:51:06.110 --> 05:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
will not have access to preventive
 
05:51:11.628 --> 05:51:11.638 align:start position:0%
services and they will resort to unsafe
 
05:51:11.638 --> 05:51:13.850 align:start position:0%
services and they will resort to unsafe
abortion

05:51:13.850 --> 05:51:13.860 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
05:51:16.070 --> 05:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
I'm old enough
 
05:51:19.490 --> 05:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
who have seen the consequences
 
05:51:21.350 --> 05:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
of unsafe
 
05:51:25.310 --> 05:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
illegal abortion
 
05:51:29.090 --> 05:51:29.100 align:start position:0%
performed by unskilled
 
05:51:33.350 --> 05:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
providers in non-sterile
 
05:51:33.360 --> 05:51:36.288 align:start position:0%
providers in non-sterile

Service as an intern
 
05:51:46.310 --> 05:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
almost 50 years ago was a young woman
 
05:51:49.670 --> 05:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
with a septic abortion
 
05:51:54.170 --> 05:51:54.180 align:start position:0%
we gave her fluids IV antibiotics
 
05:51:56.570 --> 05:51:56.580 align:start position:0%
through the operating room
 
05:52:00.048 --> 05:52:00.058 align:start position:0%
removed a foul smelling uterus filled

05:52:20.650 --> 05:52:20.660 align:start position:0%
if my feelings about legalized abortion
 
05:52:25.208 --> 05:52:25.218 align:start position:0%
were ambivalent at that time
 
05:52:31.310 --> 05:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:33.350 --> 05:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
historic reality
 
05:52:35.570 --> 05:52:35.580 align:start position:0%
is that abortions

are gonna happen

05:52:46.490 --> 05:52:46.500 align:start position:0%

05:53:04.788 --> 05:53:04.798 align:start position:0%
to give them control over their bodies

05:53:18.110 --> 05:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
we must protect the privacy of a woman
 
05:53:21.470 --> 05:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
and her care provider when it comes to
 
05:53:21.480 --> 05:53:22.730 align:start position:0%
and her care provider when it comes to
pregnancy

05:53:22.730 --> 05:53:22.740 align:start position:0%
pregnancy
 
05:53:26.990 --> 05:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
this decision is deeply personal and
 
05:53:28.788 --> 05:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
very difficult
 
05:53:32.090 --> 05:53:32.100 align:start position:0%
one that should remain the prerogative
 
05:53:33.770 --> 05:53:33.780 align:start position:0%
of a woman
 
05:53:39.110 --> 05:53:39.120 align:start position:0%

05:54:24.110 --> 05:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you questions for this
 
05:54:24.120 --> 05:54:26.090 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you questions for this
awareness

05:54:26.090 --> 05:54:26.100 align:start position:0%

05:54:30.470 --> 05:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:32.570 --> 05:54:32.580 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you Mr chair and thank
 
05:54:34.910 --> 05:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question doctor we
 
05:54:37.730 --> 05:54:37.740 align:start position:0%
heard testimony earlier today that the
 
05:54:41.530 --> 05:54:41.540 align:start position:0%
provisions in current law that
 
05:54:44.650 --> 05:54:44.660 align:start position:0%
penalized doctors and punished doctors
 
05:54:47.570 --> 05:54:47.580 align:start position:0%
are discouraging Physicians from
 
05:54:50.470 --> 05:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
learning and becoming proficient in
 
05:54:53.810 --> 05:54:53.820 align:start position:0%
abortion and reproductive Health Care in
 
05:54:55.190 --> 05:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
05:54:57.048 --> 05:54:57.058 align:start position:0%
and I was wondering if the medical
 
05:54:58.730 --> 05:54:58.740 align:start position:0%
society the New Hampshire Medical
 
05:55:01.070 --> 05:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
Society had a position on that or
 
05:55:03.650 --> 05:55:03.660 align:start position:0%
whether what you've what you've observed
 
05:55:07.970 --> 05:55:07.980 align:start position:0%
in your long years of practice
 
05:55:11.090 --> 05:55:11.100 align:start position:0%
well first of all emphasize that I can't
 
05:55:13.788 --> 05:55:13.798 align:start position:0%
speak for all members of the society
 
05:55:18.530 --> 05:55:18.540 align:start position:0%
there are some positions who are not in
 
05:55:20.510 --> 05:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
favor of abortion
 
05:55:22.788 --> 05:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
but as a society
 
05:55:26.270 --> 05:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
and remember Roe v Wade was passed on
 
05:55:27.830 --> 05:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
this principle
 
05:55:31.610 --> 05:55:31.620 align:start position:0%
all Physicians respect the privacy
 
05:55:34.310 --> 05:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
the private relationship between
 
05:55:37.150 --> 05:55:37.160 align:start position:0%
a patient and a physician
 
05:55:40.970 --> 05:55:40.980 align:start position:0%
and so the society is
 
05:55:40.980 --> 05:55:42.830 align:start position:0%
and so the society is
supporting

05:55:42.830 --> 05:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
05:55:45.350 --> 05:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
this particular bill
 
05:55:47.990 --> 05:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
now you mentioned that we have fewer and
 
05:55:48.000 --> 05:55:49.510 align:start position:0%
now you mentioned that we have fewer and
fewer

05:55:49.510 --> 05:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
fewer
 
05:55:52.310 --> 05:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
residents trained in termination and
 
05:55:55.670 --> 05:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and you're absolutely right
 
05:55:57.230 --> 05:55:57.240 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
05:55:58.788 --> 05:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
it's a problem
 
05:56:02.350 --> 05:56:02.360 align:start position:0%
and we're trying to address that problem
 
05:56:05.690 --> 05:56:05.700 align:start position:0%
we don't ever make anyone perform an
 
05:56:07.670 --> 05:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
abortion who doesn't want to perform an
 
05:56:10.490 --> 05:56:10.500 align:start position:0%
abortion or even train to perform an
 
05:56:10.500 --> 05:56:12.110 align:start position:0%
abortion or even train to perform an
abortion

05:56:12.110 --> 05:56:12.120 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
05:56:14.150 --> 05:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
um but we're trying to address that
 
05:56:14.160 --> 05:56:15.230 align:start position:0%
um but we're trying to address that
particular

05:56:15.230 --> 05:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
particular
 
05:56:15.240 --> 05:56:17.270 align:start position:0%
particular
issue

05:56:17.270 --> 05:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
issue
 
05:56:21.288 --> 05:56:21.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:23.330 --> 05:56:23.340 align:start position:0%
yes representative Turk
 
05:56:25.490 --> 05:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
thanks chairman thank you thank you Dr
 
05:56:25.500 --> 05:56:26.810 align:start position:0%
thanks chairman thank you thank you Dr
Young

05:56:26.810 --> 05:56:26.820 align:start position:0%
Young
 
05:56:29.090 --> 05:56:29.100 align:start position:0%
um given that all the other New England
 
05:56:33.230 --> 05:56:33.240 align:start position:0%
states have protections like this in
 
05:56:36.670 --> 05:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
place and given your history
 
05:56:38.990 --> 05:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
running and participating in a medical
 
05:56:41.690 --> 05:56:41.700 align:start position:0%
OB GYN practice as well as as your your
 
05:56:43.548 --> 05:56:43.558 align:start position:0%
role on the medical society
 
05:56:46.670 --> 05:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
uh what are your thoughts in terms of uh
 
05:56:49.628 --> 05:56:49.638 align:start position:0%
whether or not not having this provision
 
05:56:52.548 --> 05:56:52.558 align:start position:0%
uh in law puts New Hampshire at a
 
05:56:55.010 --> 05:56:55.020 align:start position:0%
difficult uh I'll call it competitive
 
05:56:57.230 --> 05:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
Advantage for attracting
 
05:57:01.368 --> 05:57:01.378 align:start position:0%
um the necessary Workforce yeah
 
05:57:04.190 --> 05:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
well as I understand it abortion is
 
05:57:06.770 --> 05:57:06.780 align:start position:0%
legal in New Hampshire right now but we
 
05:57:08.270 --> 05:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
don't have a law
 
05:57:11.030 --> 05:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
that says it's legal
 
05:57:14.510 --> 05:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry as I understand it abortion is
 
05:57:16.548 --> 05:57:16.558 align:start position:0%
legal in New Hampshire but we don't have
 
05:57:18.048 --> 05:57:18.058 align:start position:0%
a law
 
05:57:20.150 --> 05:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
it codifies that
 
05:57:24.770 --> 05:57:24.780 align:start position:0%
it uh would be like making a law making
 
05:57:28.010 --> 05:57:28.020 align:start position:0%
walking legal we don't need a law to do
 
05:57:30.830 --> 05:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
that but our feeling is with abortion
 
05:57:33.708 --> 05:57:33.718 align:start position:0%
it's a very controversial issue and we
 
05:57:35.570 --> 05:57:35.580 align:start position:0%
do need a law
 
05:57:38.270 --> 05:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
to declare that it's legal for women to
 
05:57:40.250 --> 05:57:40.260 align:start position:0%
know that it's legal for Physicians to
 
05:57:42.650 --> 05:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
know that it's legal
 
05:57:42.660 --> 05:57:44.330 align:start position:0%
know that it's legal
that's

05:57:44.330 --> 05:57:44.340 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:57:46.788 --> 05:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
that's really why I think we have this
 
05:57:48.350 --> 05:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
protection act
 
05:57:51.230 --> 05:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
05:57:53.270 --> 05:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
yes representative greeson
 
05:57:54.650 --> 05:57:54.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you doctor
 
05:57:58.548 --> 05:57:58.558 align:start position:0%
for your testimony you had mentioned a
 
05:58:02.390 --> 05:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
concern that we might go back to I think
 
05:58:04.850 --> 05:58:04.860 align:start position:0%
you referred them as dirty abortions I
 
05:58:06.470 --> 05:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
may be wrong with attorneys but the idea
 
05:58:09.708 --> 05:58:09.718 align:start position:0%
being back alley abortions unsafe coat
 
05:58:14.628 --> 05:58:14.638 align:start position:0%
hangers illegal non-sterile yeah exactly
 
05:58:17.570 --> 05:58:17.580 align:start position:0%
um are you aware that in the Years
 
05:58:20.030 --> 05:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
immediately preceding Roe versus Wade
 
05:58:21.948 --> 05:58:21.958 align:start position:0%
that the same number of women died
 
05:58:24.170 --> 05:58:24.180 align:start position:0%
during abortion procedures by licensed
 
05:58:26.270 --> 05:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
medical professionals as unlicensed
 
05:58:29.390 --> 05:58:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:31.250 --> 05:58:31.260 align:start position:0%
well I can tell you that the World
 
05:58:34.430 --> 05:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
Health Organization reports that there
 
05:58:39.910 --> 05:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
are 22 million unsafe abortions per year
 
05:58:43.368 --> 05:58:43.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:46.190 --> 05:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
that's probably underreported and I can
 
05:58:50.150 --> 05:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
tell you that there are hundreds of
 
05:58:52.548 --> 05:58:52.558 align:start position:0%
thousands of injuries because of these
 
05:58:55.548 --> 05:58:55.558 align:start position:0%
unsafe abortions and tens of thousands
 
05:58:55.558 --> 05:58:56.810 align:start position:0%
unsafe abortions and tens of thousands
deaths

05:58:56.810 --> 05:58:56.820 align:start position:0%
deaths
 
05:58:59.868 --> 05:58:59.878 align:start position:0%
because of unsafe abortion
 
05:58:59.878 --> 05:59:01.010 align:start position:0%
because of unsafe abortion
um

05:59:01.010 --> 05:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:03.948 --> 05:59:03.958 align:start position:0%
you've ever performed abortion you you
 
05:59:07.970 --> 05:59:07.980 align:start position:0%
know it's not a simple procedure and uh
 
05:59:09.650 --> 05:59:09.660 align:start position:0%
having a sterile environment it's
 
05:59:12.350 --> 05:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
extremely important
 
05:59:12.360 --> 05:59:13.490 align:start position:0%
extremely important
um

05:59:13.490 --> 05:59:13.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:59:16.490 --> 05:59:16.500 align:start position:0%
I I can't imagine
 
05:59:18.470 --> 05:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
that there wouldn't be a much higher
 
05:59:22.310 --> 05:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
rate of complication and mortality if we
 
05:59:26.990 --> 05:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:31.128 --> 05:59:31.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:33.230 --> 05:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
representative Perez
 
05:59:36.530 --> 05:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
thank you I have a question since
 
05:59:39.548 --> 05:59:39.558 align:start position:0%
um this is your expertise
 
05:59:43.910 --> 05:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
what do Obstetricians now consider
 
05:59:46.548 --> 05:59:46.558 align:start position:0%
perhaps a viable
 
05:59:50.570 --> 05:59:50.580 align:start position:0%
fetus at what age is a B I know it
 
05:59:53.208 --> 05:59:53.218 align:start position:0%
depends there's a lot of things I was in
 
05:59:54.830 --> 05:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
the medical field
 
05:59:58.910 --> 05:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
but I know in 19 in the in the 1990s
 
06:00:02.030 --> 06:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
when the law was changed it was 24 weeks
 
06:00:04.610 --> 06:00:04.620 align:start position:0%
and that's where all the 24 weeks have
 
06:00:07.610 --> 06:00:07.620 align:start position:0%
come from but that was a long time ago
 
06:00:11.150 --> 06:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
what is considered perhaps a viable
 
06:00:15.110 --> 06:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
fetus in today's medical world
 
06:00:18.470 --> 06:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
it's a moving Target when I was a
 
06:00:22.610 --> 06:00:22.620 align:start position:0%
resident we saved a few 28 weekers
 
06:00:26.750 --> 06:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
now we're actually saving a few 24 to 25
 
06:00:26.760 --> 06:00:28.570 align:start position:0%
now we're actually saving a few 24 to 25
weekers

06:00:28.570 --> 06:00:28.580 align:start position:0%
weekers
 
06:00:28.580 --> 06:00:30.470 align:start position:0%
weekers
before

06:00:30.470 --> 06:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
before
 
06:00:33.530 --> 06:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
24 weeks we're certainly not saving a
 
06:00:33.540 --> 06:00:34.430 align:start position:0%
24 weeks we're certainly not saving a
baby

06:00:34.430 --> 06:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
baby
 
06:00:36.650 --> 06:00:36.660 align:start position:0%
all right other other questions for this
 
06:00:36.660 --> 06:00:38.868 align:start position:0%
all right other other questions for this
Witness

06:00:38.868 --> 06:00:38.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:41.150 --> 06:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much
 
06:00:43.788 --> 06:00:43.798 align:start position:0%
next I'm going to call on Patricia

06:01:39.410 --> 06:01:39.420 align:start position:0%
my name is Patty Mullen I'm a resident
 
06:01:41.510 --> 06:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
of Santa Pino Hampshire
 
06:01:46.730 --> 06:01:46.740 align:start position:0%
and I am here to support house spell 88
 
06:01:46.740 --> 06:01:47.330 align:start position:0%
and I am here to support house spell 88
[Music]

06:01:47.330 --> 06:01:47.340 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:01:47.340 --> 06:01:48.288 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

06:01:48.288 --> 06:01:48.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:50.750 --> 06:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ad-lib a little bit I guess
 
06:01:54.288 --> 06:01:54.298 align:start position:0%
the for me personally as a woman
 
06:01:56.570 --> 06:01:56.580 align:start position:0%
who is obviously past the age of having
 
06:01:58.730 --> 06:01:58.740 align:start position:0%
to deal with pregnancy
 
06:02:01.010 --> 06:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
I think about my daughter and other
 
06:02:01.020 --> 06:02:02.030 align:start position:0%
I think about my daughter and other
women

06:02:02.030 --> 06:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
women
 
06:02:06.650 --> 06:02:06.660 align:start position:0%
and as I see this nation chipping away
 
06:02:09.110 --> 06:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
day by day by day
 
06:02:11.690 --> 06:02:11.700 align:start position:0%
the rights of women
 
06:02:14.448 --> 06:02:14.458 align:start position:0%
I am more and more aware of how
 
06:02:16.070 --> 06:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
important it is
 
06:02:19.610 --> 06:02:19.620 align:start position:0%
that we do everything we can to enshrine
 
06:02:22.850 --> 06:02:22.860 align:start position:0%
whatever rights we have left
 
06:02:27.048 --> 06:02:27.058 align:start position:0%
so although my story isn't exactly
 
06:02:30.048 --> 06:02:30.058 align:start position:0%
in relationship to this house spell
 
06:02:33.650 --> 06:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
the reason why I'm here is because of my
 
06:02:35.330 --> 06:02:35.340 align:start position:0%
own feeling
 
06:02:39.350 --> 06:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
of the necessity to make sure that women
 
06:02:43.070 --> 06:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
in this state feel safe
 
06:02:46.190 --> 06:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
and that they know that there is a
 
06:02:46.200 --> 06:02:47.150 align:start position:0%
and that they know that there is a
statute

06:02:47.150 --> 06:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:02:50.510 --> 06:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
that will take legislation to chip away
 
06:02:53.750 --> 06:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
at it rather than to continue to chip
 
06:02:56.330 --> 06:02:56.340 align:start position:0%
so this is my story
 
06:02:59.510 --> 06:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
my mother had four daughters my sister
 
06:03:03.170 --> 06:03:03.180 align:start position:0%
Deirdre 18 months later I arrived
 
06:03:05.750 --> 06:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
considered an Irish twin
 
06:03:09.590 --> 06:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
seven years later came the twin girls
 
06:03:12.948 --> 06:03:12.958 align:start position:0%
my father was an alcoholic abuser and a
 
06:03:15.110 --> 06:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
traveling salesman
 
06:03:17.288 --> 06:03:17.298 align:start position:0%
three months after the Twins were born
 
06:03:20.448 --> 06:03:20.458 align:start position:0%
my mom discovered my father had two
 
06:03:22.310 --> 06:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
other wives
 
06:03:25.250 --> 06:03:25.260 align:start position:0%
the next few years found us on welfare
 
06:03:28.730 --> 06:03:28.740 align:start position:0%
living in the projects and once the five
 
06:03:30.890 --> 06:03:30.900 align:start position:0%
of us were homeless
 
06:03:35.208 --> 06:03:35.218 align:start position:0%
mom remarried when I was 11. she married
 
06:03:39.110 --> 06:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
a New York City fireman with a shield
 
06:03:41.510 --> 06:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
not a badge
 
06:03:43.970 --> 06:03:43.980 align:start position:0%
in New York it's his shield
 
06:03:46.850 --> 06:03:46.860 align:start position:0%
and I expressed that so that you
 
06:03:50.150 --> 06:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
understand how little I was protected
 
06:03:52.970 --> 06:03:52.980 align:start position:0%
because this New York City fireman had a
 
06:03:52.980 --> 06:03:54.470 align:start position:0%
because this New York City fireman had a
shield

06:03:54.470 --> 06:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
shield
 
06:03:57.230 --> 06:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
I do not say his name
 
06:03:59.690 --> 06:03:59.700 align:start position:0%
I call him the evil one
 
06:04:02.868 --> 06:04:02.878 align:start position:0%
the evil one bought a nice home and
 
06:04:05.510 --> 06:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
moved the five of us in
 
06:04:08.448 --> 06:04:08.458 align:start position:0%
the four girls spent the rest of our
 
06:04:12.670 --> 06:04:12.680 align:start position:0%
childhoods being raped beaten
 
06:04:17.330 --> 06:04:17.340 align:start position:0%
emotionally mentally spiritually and
 
06:04:19.730 --> 06:04:19.740 align:start position:0%
intellectually tortured
 
06:04:22.548 --> 06:04:22.558 align:start position:0%
we would call the police
 
06:04:27.310 --> 06:04:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:32.150 --> 06:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
my sister died from suicide this past
 
06:04:35.090 --> 06:04:35.100 align:start position:0%
July my Irish twin
 
06:04:37.430 --> 06:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
she was a brilliant woman
 
06:04:40.910 --> 06:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
graduated from Fordham as an adult with
 
06:04:45.288 --> 06:04:45.298 align:start position:0%
her MSW and a 4.0 average after raising
 
06:04:47.770 --> 06:04:47.780 align:start position:0%
three brilliant children
 
06:04:51.770 --> 06:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
started having memory issues at 62.
 
06:04:53.930 --> 06:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
it turned out Deirdre had multiple
 
06:04:57.230 --> 06:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
traumatic brain injuries the dementia
 
06:04:58.970 --> 06:04:58.980 align:start position:0%
was rapid
 
06:05:01.730 --> 06:05:01.740 align:start position:0%
she hated losing her mind
 
06:05:05.090 --> 06:05:05.100 align:start position:0%
the evil one used to grab us by our hair
 
06:05:07.730 --> 06:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
and bang our heads against the walls of
 
06:05:08.868 --> 06:05:08.878 align:start position:0%
the floor
 
06:05:11.390 --> 06:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
if we were on the floor he would kick us
 
06:05:14.570 --> 06:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
with his steel-toed firemen boots
 
06:05:17.690 --> 06:05:17.700 align:start position:0%
I have had a baseline MRI to check my
 
06:05:17.700 --> 06:05:19.250 align:start position:0%
I have had a baseline MRI to check my
brain

06:05:19.250 --> 06:05:19.260 align:start position:0%
brain
 
06:05:22.548 --> 06:05:22.558 align:start position:0%
Deirdre died from the beatings
 
06:05:25.128 --> 06:05:25.138 align:start position:0%
my sister Deirdre tried to protect the
 
06:05:27.048 --> 06:05:27.058 align:start position:0%
three of us
 
06:05:31.128 --> 06:05:31.138 align:start position:0%
she saved my life when I was 16.
 
06:05:34.190 --> 06:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
my period was two weeks late
 
06:05:36.948 --> 06:05:36.958 align:start position:0%
I was terrified
 
06:05:40.010 --> 06:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
I was always terrified
 
06:05:42.590 --> 06:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
I told Pietra and she took me for a
 
06:05:44.208 --> 06:05:44.218 align:start position:0%
urine test
 
06:05:47.570 --> 06:05:47.580 align:start position:0%
by now I was three weeks late
 
06:05:50.150 --> 06:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
in New York abortions were legal prior
 
06:05:52.430 --> 06:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
to Roe v Wade
 
06:05:54.948 --> 06:05:54.958 align:start position:0%
I found out I was pregnant at eight
 
06:05:54.958 --> 06:05:56.448 align:start position:0%
I found out I was pregnant at eight
weeks

06:05:56.448 --> 06:05:56.458 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
06:06:00.110 --> 06:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
her first words to me were
 
06:06:03.048 --> 06:06:03.058 align:start position:0%
Jesus Christ Patty if he finds out you
 
06:06:05.330 --> 06:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
were pregnant he's going to beat you to
 
06:06:05.340 --> 06:06:06.770 align:start position:0%
were pregnant he's going to beat you to
death

06:06:06.770 --> 06:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
death
 
06:06:10.070 --> 06:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
I knew this was literally the truth
 
06:06:12.890 --> 06:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
we scheduled an abortion it would be two
 
06:06:12.900 --> 06:06:14.330 align:start position:0%
we scheduled an abortion it would be two
weeks

06:06:14.330 --> 06:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
06:06:16.670 --> 06:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
those two weeks were the longest weeks
 
06:06:18.170 --> 06:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
of my life
 
06:06:20.810 --> 06:06:20.820 align:start position:0%
by the time I had my abortion I was 10
 
06:06:22.970 --> 06:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
weeks pregnant
 
06:06:26.150 --> 06:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
everyone in this world has their own
 
06:06:29.330 --> 06:06:29.340 align:start position:0%
personal reason to choose abortion
 
06:06:32.208 --> 06:06:32.218 align:start position:0%
my reason was abject fear of being
 
06:06:34.430 --> 06:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
beaten to death
 
06:06:37.730 --> 06:06:37.740 align:start position:0%
the freedom to choose saved me
 
06:06:40.670 --> 06:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
one of my therapists once told me in 30
 
06:06:43.670 --> 06:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
years of practice my childhood was the
 
06:06:45.350 --> 06:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
worst she ever heard
 
06:06:49.548 --> 06:06:49.558 align:start position:0%
I am here today speaking to you
 
06:06:56.150 --> 06:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:58.970 --> 06:06:58.980 align:start position:0%
if you think I am overly dramatic for
 
06:07:00.530 --> 06:07:00.540 align:start position:0%
any reason
 
06:07:02.990 --> 06:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
just think of my sister
 
06:07:05.510 --> 06:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
who died from multiple brain injuries
 
06:07:07.310 --> 06:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
this summer
 
06:07:10.810 --> 06:07:10.820 align:start position:0%
I have a daughter now a beautiful
 
06:07:14.750 --> 06:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
educated kind and generous young woman
 
06:07:17.510 --> 06:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
I cannot fathom why she should be denied
 
06:07:19.670 --> 06:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
access to the reproductive health care
 
06:07:22.850 --> 06:07:22.860 align:start position:0%
that literally saved my life
 
06:07:26.750 --> 06:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
I knew what was best for me at 16.
 
06:07:30.230 --> 06:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
no one was protecting me
 
06:07:33.410 --> 06:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
the choice I made was the first time in
 
06:07:35.150 --> 06:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
16 years
 
06:07:37.788 --> 06:07:37.798 align:start position:0%
that I was actually able to protect
 
06:07:37.798 --> 06:07:39.890 align:start position:0%
that I was actually able to protect
myself

06:07:39.890 --> 06:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
myself
 
06:07:43.070 --> 06:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
access to abortion must be available to
 
06:07:43.080 --> 06:07:44.030 align:start position:0%
access to abortion must be available to
women

06:07:44.030 --> 06:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
women
 
06:07:47.090 --> 06:07:47.100 align:start position:0%
each of our lives and circumstances are
 
06:07:49.970 --> 06:07:49.980 align:start position:0%
different but no matter our reason each
 
06:07:52.190 --> 06:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
of us must have access to abortion
 
06:07:55.970 --> 06:07:55.980 align:start position:0%
personally behind closed doors free from
 
06:07:59.330 --> 06:07:59.340 align:start position:0%
government intrusion and interference no
 
06:08:02.750 --> 06:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
one else knows our stories none of you
 
06:08:03.948 --> 06:08:03.958 align:start position:0%
knew me
 
06:08:06.850 --> 06:08:06.860 align:start position:0%
or what was best for my life
 
06:08:10.930 --> 06:08:10.940 align:start position:0%
Reproductive Rights saved my life
 
06:08:16.190 --> 06:08:16.200 align:start position:0%
abortion saved my life and if this spill
 
06:08:19.310 --> 06:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
is not passed we run the risk of
 
06:08:21.948 --> 06:08:21.958 align:start position:0%
continuing to Chisel and chisel and
 
06:08:21.958 --> 06:08:23.150 align:start position:0%
continuing to Chisel and chisel and
chisel

06:08:23.150 --> 06:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
chisel
 
06:08:26.448 --> 06:08:26.458 align:start position:0%
and maybe someday some woman will get
 
06:08:28.010 --> 06:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
beat to death
 
06:08:31.070 --> 06:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing my testimony thank
 
06:08:34.910 --> 06:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:36.890 --> 06:08:36.900 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
06:08:39.890 --> 06:08:39.900 align:start position:0%
um Anya Morehouse and next will be Jason
 
06:08:39.900 --> 06:08:52.190 align:start position:0%
um Anya Morehouse and next will be Jason

06:08:52.190 --> 06:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:54.590 --> 06:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Anya Morehouse
 
06:08:57.708 --> 06:08:57.718 align:start position:0%
and I'm a student in Sullivan County
 
06:09:00.110 --> 06:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
the proposed House Bill 88 States
 
06:09:02.810 --> 06:09:02.820 align:start position:0%
because it is vital to the equality and
 
06:09:05.448 --> 06:09:05.458 align:start position:0%
Liberty of all individuals the state
 
06:09:07.670 --> 06:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
shall not restrict or interfere with an
 
06:09:09.590 --> 06:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
individual's exercise of their private
 
06:09:12.590 --> 06:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
decision to terminate a pregnancy
 
06:09:16.930 --> 06:09:16.940 align:start position:0%
except as in provided in RSA
 
06:09:22.368 --> 06:09:22.378 align:start position:0%
32943-329.50 and RSA 13236
 
06:09:24.230 --> 06:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
I would like to focus on the blatant
 
06:09:26.590 --> 06:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
hypocrisy and disparagement toward women
 
06:09:29.570 --> 06:09:29.580 align:start position:0%
implied in the phrase vital to the
 
06:09:33.288 --> 06:09:33.298 align:start position:0%
equality and Liberty of all individuals
 
06:09:35.930 --> 06:09:35.940 align:start position:0%
the very wording used here implies that
 
06:09:38.628 --> 06:09:38.638 align:start position:0%
abortion is necessary for women to be
 
06:09:41.810 --> 06:09:41.820 align:start position:0%
free and equal to men nothing could be
 
06:09:43.368 --> 06:09:43.378 align:start position:0%
more belittling
 
06:09:45.170 --> 06:09:45.180 align:start position:0%
there is an assumption behind this way
 
06:09:47.690 --> 06:09:47.700 align:start position:0%
of thinking that equality lies in what
 
06:09:50.930 --> 06:09:50.940 align:start position:0%
we do rather than Who We Are
 
06:09:53.150 --> 06:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
women are equal to men and that they are
 
06:09:57.350 --> 06:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
endowed with intrinsic dignity and worth
 
06:09:59.330 --> 06:09:59.340 align:start position:0%
pre-born babies are equal to already
 
06:10:01.730 --> 06:10:01.740 align:start position:0%
born men and women in that they are
 
06:10:04.970 --> 06:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
endowed with intrinsic dignity and worth
 
06:10:07.788 --> 06:10:07.798 align:start position:0%
women cannot be viewed as equal on the
 
06:10:09.650 --> 06:10:09.660 align:start position:0%
condition that they have the option to
 
06:10:11.448 --> 06:10:11.458 align:start position:0%
kill their pre-born child
 
06:10:13.368 --> 06:10:13.378 align:start position:0%
pre-born children cannot be viewed as
 
06:10:15.770 --> 06:10:15.780 align:start position:0%
equal on the condition that they are
 
06:10:18.530 --> 06:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
wanted or convenient
 
06:10:21.048 --> 06:10:21.058 align:start position:0%
if House Bill 88 is passed New Hampshire
 
06:10:23.150 --> 06:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
will not only promote the violence and
 
06:10:26.270 --> 06:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
barbarity that is abortion but promote a
 
06:10:28.610 --> 06:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
misogynistic and discriminatory agenda
 
06:10:30.650 --> 06:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
that tells women the only way they can
 
06:10:32.990 --> 06:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
succeed is through ending the life of
 
06:10:34.788 --> 06:10:34.798 align:start position:0%
their child
 
06:10:36.890 --> 06:10:36.900 align:start position:0%
rather than make this a reality in our
 
06:10:39.288 --> 06:10:39.298 align:start position:0%
state I urge you to focus your efforts
 
06:10:42.048 --> 06:10:42.058 align:start position:0%
on creating an environment here where
 
06:10:44.510 --> 06:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
women facing unplanned pregnancies are
 
06:10:46.788 --> 06:10:46.798 align:start position:0%
supported and given the means necessary
 
06:10:49.190 --> 06:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
to lead successful and fulfilling lives
 
06:10:51.048 --> 06:10:51.058 align:start position:0%
without abortion
 
06:10:53.690 --> 06:10:53.700 align:start position:0%
reject this bill and promote bills that
 
06:10:55.850 --> 06:10:55.860 align:start position:0%
truly uphold the Dignity of all the
 
06:10:58.070 --> 06:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
equality of all and the liberty of all
 
06:11:01.010 --> 06:11:01.020 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you questions for this
 
06:11:01.020 --> 06:11:04.010 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you questions for this
Witness

06:11:04.010 --> 06:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:06.830 --> 06:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you uh Jason Hennessey
 
06:11:18.128 --> 06:11:18.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:20.930 --> 06:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Jason Hennessey and I'm
 
06:11:22.430 --> 06:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
here again as the president of New
 
06:11:25.190 --> 06:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right to life uh we're here we
 
06:11:28.310 --> 06:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill HB 88 uh two for two
 
06:11:31.128 --> 06:11:31.138 align:start position:0%
main reasons the first one is that in
 
06:11:34.310 --> 06:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
our analysis this is essentially a
 
06:11:37.850 --> 06:11:37.860 align:start position:0%
meaningless virtue signal uh so I'm
 
06:11:40.128 --> 06:11:40.138 align:start position:0%
humbled to be surrounded by accomplished
 
06:11:42.230 --> 06:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
lawyers here I I only took undergrad
 
06:11:44.448 --> 06:11:44.458 align:start position:0%
Civics but in my undergrad civics class
 
06:11:47.330 --> 06:11:47.340 align:start position:0%
we were told that A legislature cannot
 
06:11:49.548 --> 06:11:49.558 align:start position:0%
find a future legislature other than
 
06:11:51.170 --> 06:11:51.180 align:start position:0%
through the Constitution
 
06:11:55.448 --> 06:11:55.458 align:start position:0%
and so if you pass HB 88 any future
 
06:11:57.948 --> 06:11:57.958 align:start position:0%
legislature can just repeal it
 
06:12:01.010 --> 06:12:01.020 align:start position:0%
alternatively you'll if the legislature
 
06:12:02.690 --> 06:12:02.700 align:start position:0%
decides to keep it what it will mean is
 
06:12:05.448 --> 06:12:05.458 align:start position:0%
that all the pro-life bills will then be
 
06:12:07.250 --> 06:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
more difficult we'll be more longer
 
06:12:09.288 --> 06:12:09.298 align:start position:0%
because they'll all contain a clause
 
06:12:11.270 --> 06:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
that amends the exceptions to add itself
 
06:12:14.208 --> 06:12:14.218 align:start position:0%
into there so in terms of protections
 
06:12:18.110 --> 06:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
for abortion rights this doesn't do that
 
06:12:20.208 --> 06:12:20.218 align:start position:0%
as far as we can tell
 
06:12:22.310 --> 06:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh from the second
 
06:12:24.590 --> 06:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
from the second point
 
06:12:27.410 --> 06:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
uh well it's I guess just to just to
 
06:12:27.420 --> 06:12:28.250 align:start position:0%
uh well it's I guess just to just to
um

06:12:28.250 --> 06:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:30.830 --> 06:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
bring that back a little bit more I I
 
06:12:32.930 --> 06:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
actually didn't hear any examples from
 
06:12:35.150 --> 06:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
anybody of cases that they would think
 
06:12:36.948 --> 06:12:36.958 align:start position:0%
that this would
 
06:12:38.510 --> 06:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
get you anything
 
06:12:40.548 --> 06:12:40.558 align:start position:0%
um whether it's lawsuits against the
 
06:12:42.410 --> 06:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
government or something like that I
 
06:12:44.570 --> 06:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
didn't hear any uh strong examples
 
06:12:47.150 --> 06:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
second one is that is the subject matter
 
06:12:49.730 --> 06:12:49.740 align:start position:0%
itself of abortion it throughout most of
 
06:12:49.740 --> 06:12:50.810 align:start position:0%
itself of abortion it throughout most of
History

06:12:50.810 --> 06:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
History
 
06:12:53.030 --> 06:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
abortion has been seen as being
 
06:12:54.410 --> 06:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
something bad
 
06:12:55.850 --> 06:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
um you know it's in the Hippocratic Oath
 
06:12:57.470 --> 06:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
it's in almost every major religion
 
06:13:00.770 --> 06:13:00.780 align:start position:0%
throughout history and so at this point
 
06:13:02.810 --> 06:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
in stage what we'd be saying is we want
 
06:13:04.310 --> 06:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
to enshrine something that most of
 
06:13:07.190 --> 06:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
history and most religions say is evil
 
06:13:09.650 --> 06:13:09.660 align:start position:0%
the killing of an unborn child
 
06:13:11.270 --> 06:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
so is that the thing that we want to
 
06:13:13.310 --> 06:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
leave is that the Legacy that we want to
 
06:13:16.310 --> 06:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
leave to the people who come later
 
06:13:19.010 --> 06:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
uh so you know as I mentioned before in
 
06:13:21.530 --> 06:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
the testimony 70 over 70 percent of New
 
06:13:23.208 --> 06:13:23.218 align:start position:0%
Hampshire agrees with abortion
 
06:13:24.708 --> 06:13:24.718 align:start position:0%
restrictions at some point this
 
06:13:27.170 --> 06:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
legislation does not reflect that
 
06:13:29.510 --> 06:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
consensus here
 
06:13:32.628 --> 06:13:32.638 align:start position:0%
one thing one thing I wanted to one of
 
06:13:34.128 --> 06:13:34.138 align:start position:0%
the things I wanted to address is that I
 
06:13:37.310 --> 06:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
if there's any confusion of Rights of
 
06:13:40.368 --> 06:13:40.378 align:start position:0%
where where abortion rights are
 
06:13:42.590 --> 06:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
um where when abortion's legal when it's
 
06:13:45.470 --> 06:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
not legal I would suggest a web search
 
06:13:46.730 --> 06:13:46.740 align:start position:0%
um while I was sitting over there I just
 
06:13:48.650 --> 06:13:48.660 align:start position:0%
did I just did a search of abortion laws
 
06:13:51.530 --> 06:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and some of the top uh
 
06:13:53.390 --> 06:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
hits like Planned Parenthood and
 
06:13:55.250 --> 06:13:55.260 align:start position:0%
Wikipedia's website
 
06:13:58.190 --> 06:13:58.200 align:start position:0%
say things like abortion remains safe
 
06:13:59.690 --> 06:13:59.700 align:start position:0%
and legal in New Hampshire
 
06:14:02.690 --> 06:14:02.700 align:start position:0%
or abortion in New Hampshire is legal up
 
06:14:04.190 --> 06:14:04.200 align:start position:0%
to the 24th week so if there's any
 
06:14:04.200 --> 06:14:05.448 align:start position:0%
to the 24th week so if there's any
confusion

06:14:05.448 --> 06:14:05.458 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
06:14:07.850 --> 06:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
Google's your front and that is the rest
 
06:14:09.708 --> 06:14:09.718 align:start position:0%
of my testimony thank you Mr chair
 
06:14:11.510 --> 06:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions for this
 
06:14:11.520 --> 06:14:13.070 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions for this
Witness

06:14:13.070 --> 06:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
Witness
 
06:14:16.490 --> 06:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:19.070 --> 06:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
it's very quickly I mean I'm not a
 
06:14:21.110 --> 06:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
lawyer either but I'm
 
06:14:23.990 --> 06:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
I mean your point about I've the point
 
06:14:25.788 --> 06:14:25.798 align:start position:0%
about not finding a future legislature
 
06:14:30.470 --> 06:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
but doesn't this also apply to acts by
 
06:14:32.090 --> 06:14:32.100 align:start position:0%
um state government that aren't
 
06:14:35.930 --> 06:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
specifically authorized by a
 
06:14:40.730 --> 06:14:40.740 align:start position:0%
by one of those two by an RSA and uh
 
06:14:42.110 --> 06:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know whether or not you think
 
06:14:44.690 --> 06:14:44.700 align:start position:0%
that's implausible but I think it's am I
 
06:14:46.128 --> 06:14:46.138 align:start position:0%
wrong at thinking that it's plausible
 
06:14:48.410 --> 06:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
that the state might do something to
 
06:14:51.410 --> 06:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
restrict rights um even if they even uh
 
06:14:54.350 --> 06:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
even it's not specifically uh authorized
 
06:14:56.448 --> 06:14:56.458 align:start position:0%
by either of those two rsas that might
 
06:14:56.458 --> 06:14:57.410 align:start position:0%
by either of those two rsas that might
go

06:14:57.410 --> 06:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
go
 
06:14:57.420 --> 06:14:58.270 align:start position:0%
go
Beyond

06:14:58.270 --> 06:14:58.280 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
06:15:01.670 --> 06:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
so is your experience in the state never
 
06:15:03.410 --> 06:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
go like beyond what appears to be
 
06:15:05.150 --> 06:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
specifically authorized by the law or
 
06:15:07.730 --> 06:15:07.740 align:start position:0%
they always like stay colored like stay
 
06:15:10.128 --> 06:15:10.138 align:start position:0%
totally within the lines of the law
 
06:15:12.948 --> 06:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative uh I'm not
 
06:15:14.208 --> 06:15:14.218 align:start position:0%
completely sure I understand your
 
06:15:16.310 --> 06:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
question it was it is it along the lines
 
06:15:18.230 --> 06:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
of could an agency through rulemaking or
 
06:15:20.628 --> 06:15:20.638 align:start position:0%
something uh restrict rights or
 
06:15:22.190 --> 06:15:22.200 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
06:15:24.530 --> 06:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
I think so but I think
 
06:15:27.170 --> 06:15:27.180 align:start position:0%
is it possible is it do you think it's
 
06:15:28.670 --> 06:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
so you're saying it's unlikely the state
 
06:15:30.890 --> 06:15:30.900 align:start position:0%
would ever take any action restrict the
 
06:15:32.868 --> 06:15:32.878 align:start position:0%
laws unless we specifically passed an
 
06:15:34.548 --> 06:15:34.558 align:start position:0%
artist saying authoring two of them or
 
06:15:37.548 --> 06:15:37.558 align:start position:0%
is it conceivable to State might uh you
 
06:15:37.558 --> 06:15:38.510 align:start position:0%
is it conceivable to State might uh you
know

06:15:38.510 --> 06:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:15:40.670 --> 06:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
do things that aren't specifically uh
 
06:15:44.410 --> 06:15:44.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:47.930 --> 06:15:47.940 align:start position:0%
uh so I I I I'm not a lawyer
 
06:15:49.490 --> 06:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
representative so I'd have to defer on
 
06:15:51.708 --> 06:15:51.718 align:start position:0%
that all right other questions for this
 
06:15:51.718 --> 06:15:54.970 align:start position:0%
that all right other questions for this
Witness

06:15:54.970 --> 06:15:54.980 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:58.850 --> 06:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
yes representative Perez
 
06:16:03.110 --> 06:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you now I'm completely confused so
 
06:16:05.448 --> 06:16:05.458 align:start position:0%
when this bill was presented to us I
 
06:16:08.750 --> 06:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
specifically asked if this bill would
 
06:16:12.410 --> 06:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
prohibit us at a later time
 
06:16:14.750 --> 06:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
from changing
 
06:16:18.048 --> 06:16:18.058 align:start position:0%
the RSA and I was told
 
06:16:20.930 --> 06:16:20.940 align:start position:0%
blatantly no it would not
 
06:16:23.570 --> 06:16:23.580 align:start position:0%
but then I have heard testimony after
 
06:16:26.570 --> 06:16:26.580 align:start position:0%
testimony saying
 
06:16:30.048 --> 06:16:30.058 align:start position:0%
or at least what I'm hearing is that if
 
06:16:34.190 --> 06:16:34.200 align:start position:0%
at any time we wanted to lower the
 
06:16:36.590 --> 06:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
um limit of 24
 
06:16:38.690 --> 06:16:38.700 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be able to do this so now
 
06:16:40.670 --> 06:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
I'm confused and I want to hear the
 
06:16:42.708 --> 06:16:42.718 align:start position:0%
other side of the story
 
06:16:45.410 --> 06:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
I do not want anything that'll I'm
 
06:16:49.250 --> 06:16:49.260 align:start position:0%
asking if doing this is going to legally
 
06:16:54.948 --> 06:16:54.958 align:start position:0%
or uh protectedly going to limit
 
06:16:58.548 --> 06:16:58.558 align:start position:0%
the legislature from changing the
 
06:17:01.430 --> 06:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
present bill without having to
 
06:17:04.010 --> 06:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
completely eliminate it and start all
 
06:17:05.570 --> 06:17:05.580 align:start position:0%
over again
 
06:17:07.128 --> 06:17:07.138 align:start position:0%
thank you representative my
 
06:17:09.890 --> 06:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
understanding is that you can't find a
 
06:17:12.770 --> 06:17:12.780 align:start position:0%
future legislature without a cacr
 
06:17:14.868 --> 06:17:14.878 align:start position:0%
ific that you can't prohibit a future
 
06:17:17.510 --> 06:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
legislature from amending any law
 
06:17:19.070 --> 06:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
without without a constitutional
 
06:17:19.080 --> 06:17:20.868 align:start position:0%

06:17:55.970 --> 06:17:55.980 align:start position:0%
invest in equality and opportunity for
 
06:17:57.230 --> 06:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
the women and girls of New Hampshire

Grant making and the women's Foundation
 
06:18:05.810 --> 06:18:05.820 align:start position:0%
uh very much supports HB 88 because
 
06:18:08.030 --> 06:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
access to a full range of reproductive
 
06:18:11.030 --> 06:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
health care including abortion is
 
06:18:13.190 --> 06:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
crucial for Women's Health Economic
 
06:18:15.350 --> 06:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
Security and long-term impacts on women
 
06:18:17.030 --> 06:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
and their families
 
06:18:20.510 --> 06:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
deciding whether and when to have a
 
06:18:22.930 --> 06:18:22.940 align:start position:0%
child is the most consequential decision
 
06:18:25.850 --> 06:18:25.860 align:start position:0%
relative to women's lifetime economic
 
06:18:25.860 --> 06:18:27.470 align:start position:0%
relative to women's lifetime economic
well-being

06:18:27.470 --> 06:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
well-being
 
06:18:30.230 --> 06:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
women who have access to abortion have
 
06:18:32.628 --> 06:18:32.638 align:start position:0%
higher rates of high school and college
 
06:18:35.690 --> 06:18:35.700 align:start position:0%
graduation they can invest in school and
 
06:18:38.090 --> 06:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
job training increasing their long-term
 
06:18:39.770 --> 06:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
earning potential
 
06:18:42.830 --> 06:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
and the intergenerational impacts of
 
06:18:44.810 --> 06:18:44.820 align:start position:0%
um to previously born children or
 
06:18:46.850 --> 06:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
subsequently born children
 
06:18:49.010 --> 06:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
um lower their rate of poverty increase
 
06:18:50.750 --> 06:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
their High School graduation rate and
 
06:18:52.250 --> 06:18:52.260 align:start position:0%
college attendance rate
 
06:18:55.310 --> 06:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
and they and access to care to abortion
 
06:18:58.070 --> 06:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
care is critical to disrupt the cycle of
 
06:19:00.650 --> 06:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
poverty between Generations
 
06:19:03.110 --> 06:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
so I also sent around I sent around my
 
06:19:07.010 --> 06:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
testimony but also a colorful sheet that
 
06:19:08.690 --> 06:19:08.700 align:start position:0%
we put out this past summer
 
06:19:11.868 --> 06:19:11.878 align:start position:0%
uh that goes around uh that covers the
 
06:19:14.030 --> 06:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
background on New Hampshire's
 
06:19:17.030 --> 06:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
legislative actions on abortion it goes
 
06:19:18.830 --> 06:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
over information on care in the state
 
06:19:20.868 --> 06:19:20.878 align:start position:0%
and comparative policies of New England
 
06:19:22.970 --> 06:19:22.980 align:start position:0%
I hope it's useful to you
 
06:19:25.310 --> 06:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
um for any um abortion related
 
06:19:28.010 --> 06:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
legislation you see this session
 
06:19:31.730 --> 06:19:31.740 align:start position:0%
um but I also presented this uh hand out
 
06:19:33.948 --> 06:19:33.958 align:start position:0%
to Providers over the summer right after
 
06:19:35.990 --> 06:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
the Dobbs decision
 
06:19:37.788 --> 06:19:37.798 align:start position:0%
um and they found it very helpful
 
06:19:39.770 --> 06:19:39.780 align:start position:0%
because they were sharing stories with
 
06:19:41.270 --> 06:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
me that they right after the job
 
06:19:42.650 --> 06:19:42.660 align:start position:0%
decision they had a lot of questions
 
06:19:44.750 --> 06:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
from their patients
 
06:19:46.190 --> 06:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
um they shared that they had patients
 
06:19:47.868 --> 06:19:47.878 align:start position:0%
asking if they would have to remove
 
06:19:50.750 --> 06:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
their iuds and they said of course not
 
06:19:52.070 --> 06:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
um I would use our long-acting
 
06:19:54.770 --> 06:19:54.780 align:start position:0%
reversible contraception but there was a
 
06:19:57.288 --> 06:19:57.298 align:start position:0%
lot of patient confusion particularly
 
06:19:59.990 --> 06:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
last summer and they also had questions
 
06:20:02.570 --> 06:20:02.580 align:start position:0%
of course about their access about
 
06:20:05.030 --> 06:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
patients access to abortion and so I was
 
06:20:06.708 --> 06:20:06.718 align:start position:0%
hearing a lot from providers that they
 
06:20:08.570 --> 06:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
were doing a lot of education on what
 
06:20:10.250 --> 06:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
their rights their patients rights were
 
06:20:12.230 --> 06:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and I think that
 
06:20:15.530 --> 06:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
providers and patients and everyone in
 
06:20:17.090 --> 06:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would appreciate and
 
06:20:19.490 --> 06:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
deserve to know that New Hampshire will
 
06:20:21.410 --> 06:20:21.420 align:start position:0%
protect the right to safe and legal
 
06:20:23.448 --> 06:20:23.458 align:start position:0%
abortion amid a rapidly changing
 
06:20:26.330 --> 06:20:26.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:28.430 --> 06:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
um I know there has been there have been
 
06:20:30.410 --> 06:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
questions for an example
 
06:20:34.490 --> 06:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
um when our situation that would occur
 
06:20:36.770 --> 06:20:36.780 align:start position:0%
when this affirmative right that we're
 
06:20:39.230 --> 06:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
seeking to establish an hb88 would be
 
06:20:40.970 --> 06:20:40.980 align:start position:0%
theoretically enforced and of course
 
06:20:44.330 --> 06:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
these are theoretical ideas but
 
06:20:47.330 --> 06:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
uh one example that we had discussed
 
06:20:50.330 --> 06:20:50.340 align:start position:0%
previously might have been if a State
 
06:20:53.628 --> 06:20:53.638 align:start position:0%
Trooper sees someone driving into a
 
06:20:56.208 --> 06:20:56.218 align:start position:0%
clinic an abortion provider it sees that
 
06:20:58.128 --> 06:20:58.138 align:start position:0%
they have floor um Texas plates or
 
06:21:00.110 --> 06:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
Florida plates or any other plates and
 
06:21:02.208 --> 06:21:02.218 align:start position:0%
they are confused because other states
 
06:21:03.910 --> 06:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
have different laws
 
06:21:06.170 --> 06:21:06.180 align:start position:0%
and they prevented that person from
 
06:21:07.788 --> 06:21:07.798 align:start position:0%
entering the clinic
 
06:21:09.890 --> 06:21:09.900 align:start position:0%
um that might be an example this is
 
06:21:11.990 --> 06:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
theoretical but what we're saying is
 
06:21:14.930 --> 06:21:14.940 align:start position:0%
that it is so important to be clear
 
06:21:17.628 --> 06:21:17.638 align:start position:0%
about our own laws because other because
 
06:21:19.910 --> 06:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
there really is no federal framework
 
06:21:19.920 --> 06:21:21.410 align:start position:0%
there really is no federal framework
anymore

06:21:21.410 --> 06:21:21.420 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
06:21:22.970 --> 06:21:22.980 align:start position:0%
um it's up to the states to decide and
 
06:21:25.010 --> 06:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
we should be very clear with New
 
06:21:26.990 --> 06:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire about where we stand on
 
06:21:30.288 --> 06:21:30.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:32.208 --> 06:21:32.218 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions for this
 
06:21:32.218 --> 06:21:34.910 align:start position:0%

06:21:37.548 --> 06:21:37.558 align:start position:0%
seeing them thank you there's one more

that's representative Potenza
 
06:21:57.230 --> 06:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:59.270 --> 06:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you chair
 
06:22:01.368 --> 06:22:01.378 align:start position:0%
representative Potenza Stratford
 
06:22:03.890 --> 06:22:03.900 align:start position:0%
District 19 Rochester's Awards one
 
06:22:05.930 --> 06:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
through four and six
 
06:22:07.910 --> 06:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
listening to the testimony I'd just like
 
06:22:10.310 --> 06:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
to clarify a couple of things
 
06:22:12.590 --> 06:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
the laws of the land are founded upon
 
06:22:14.810 --> 06:22:14.820 align:start position:0%
the Constitution of the United States in
 
06:22:17.030 --> 06:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire our constitution came
 
06:22:20.330 --> 06:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
first so our New Hampshire laws come
 
06:22:22.910 --> 06:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
first and the federal comes second
 
06:22:25.250 --> 06:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
in regard to overturning Roe versus Wade
 
06:22:26.690 --> 06:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
just because so there was so much
 
06:22:28.670 --> 06:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
testimony on that
 
06:22:31.368 --> 06:22:31.378 align:start position:0%
this is following the Constitution and
 
06:22:32.990 --> 06:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
giving rights back to where they should
 
06:22:35.390 --> 06:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
have always been where those rights
 
06:22:38.090 --> 06:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
originated from the Constitution does
 
06:22:40.310 --> 06:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
not prohibit the citizens of each state
 
06:22:43.548 --> 06:22:43.558 align:start position:0%
from regulating or prohibiting abortion
 
06:22:47.090 --> 06:22:47.100 align:start position:0%
Roe and Casey seized that Authority
 
06:22:49.850 --> 06:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
we now overrule those decisions and
 
06:22:51.948 --> 06:22:51.958 align:start position:0%
return the authority to the people and
 
06:22:55.430 --> 06:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:58.670 --> 06:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
abortion is not Health Care abortion is
 
06:23:01.610 --> 06:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
an elective procedure abortion is a
 
06:23:01.620 --> 06:23:02.750 align:start position:0%
an elective procedure abortion is a
choice

06:23:02.750 --> 06:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
choice
 
06:23:05.390 --> 06:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
if a woman decides to take the life of
 
06:23:07.788 --> 06:23:07.798 align:start position:0%
her one to six month old baby that is
 
06:23:11.750 --> 06:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
her choice and that choice is legal in
 
06:23:13.610 --> 06:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because that is our New
 
06:23:16.128 --> 06:23:16.138 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law and what our constituents
 
06:23:17.810 --> 06:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
have accepted
 
06:23:20.510 --> 06:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
what are their represented body have
 
06:23:20.520 --> 06:23:22.368 align:start position:0%
what are their represented body have
passed

06:23:22.368 --> 06:23:22.378 align:start position:0%
passed
 
06:23:23.990 --> 06:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
listening to the heart-wrenching
 
06:23:26.570 --> 06:23:26.580 align:start position:0%
testimony here I want to be clear
 
06:23:29.448 --> 06:23:29.458 align:start position:0%
terminating a presidency based upon rape
 
06:23:32.208 --> 06:23:32.218 align:start position:0%
or incest or any other horrific reason
 
06:23:34.430 --> 06:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
would never be against the law in New
 
06:23:38.810 --> 06:23:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:40.670 --> 06:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
terminating a pregnancy if a woman's
 
06:23:42.830 --> 06:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
life is in danger the life of the baby
 
06:23:46.190 --> 06:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
baby or a fetal fatal homily is
 
06:23:48.470 --> 06:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
considered health care that's the
 
06:23:48.480 --> 06:23:50.390 align:start position:0%
considered health care that's the
difference

06:23:50.390 --> 06:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
difference
 
06:23:52.190 --> 06:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
based upon the most recent information
 
06:23:54.350 --> 06:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
gathered from the Center for
 
06:23:56.690 --> 06:23:56.700 align:start position:0%
Reproductive Rights there are only 10
 
06:23:58.910 --> 06:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
states 10.
 
06:24:00.830 --> 06:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
that have state laws that protect
 
06:24:00.840 --> 06:24:01.970 align:start position:0%
that have state laws that protect
abortion

06:24:01.970 --> 06:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
06:24:05.868 --> 06:24:05.878 align:start position:0%
if we want anything codified into law do
 
06:24:11.150 --> 06:24:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:13.730 --> 06:24:13.740 align:start position:0%
on a side note I was actually a patient
 
06:24:16.310 --> 06:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
of a doctor that testified here today
 
06:24:18.590 --> 06:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
when we lived in Concord
 
06:24:20.690 --> 06:24:20.700 align:start position:0%
he used to wear a button
 
06:24:23.090 --> 06:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
that said I love women
 
06:24:26.030 --> 06:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
he was a fantastic OB GYN
 
06:24:27.890 --> 06:24:27.900 align:start position:0%
I loved him
 
06:24:30.170 --> 06:24:30.180 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to correct one thing that
 
06:24:32.628 --> 06:24:32.638 align:start position:0%
he stated when he was in his testimony
 
06:24:35.030 --> 06:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
he said he represent represents women in
 
06:24:36.110 --> 06:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
06:24:38.270 --> 06:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
we need to be clear that he only
 
06:24:40.490 --> 06:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
represents a portion of women in New
 
06:24:42.830 --> 06:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you
 
06:24:47.448 --> 06:24:47.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:50.270 --> 06:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you is there anyone
 
06:24:56.390 --> 06:24:56.400 align:start position:0%

seeing none I'm going to close the
 
06:25:00.110 --> 06:25:00.120 align:start position:0%

um

06:25:32.650 --> 06:25:32.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:25:35.990 --> 06:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
two two four
 
06:25:50.150 --> 06:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:56.990 --> 06:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:57.000 --> 06:25:59.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:25:59.230 --> 06:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:02.270 --> 06:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I didn't know I
 
06:26:04.070 --> 06:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
could screw it up before I even started
 
06:26:06.110 --> 06:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
oh don't worry
 
06:26:08.330 --> 06:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
06:26:12.110 --> 06:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
members of the Judiciary Committee
 
06:26:14.868 --> 06:26:14.878 align:start position:0%
House Bill 224
 
06:26:17.868 --> 06:26:17.878 align:start position:0%
this bill does nothing to make abortion
 
06:26:19.990 --> 06:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
any easier in the state of New Hampshire
 
06:26:23.090 --> 06:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
it may clarify the law only
 
06:26:27.170 --> 06:26:27.180 align:start position:0%
the 24-week time frame still stands
 
06:26:31.368 --> 06:26:31.378 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2224 repeals only the
 
06:26:34.250 --> 06:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties that were inserted in
 
06:26:36.410 --> 06:26:36.420 align:start position:0%
the fetal protection act as part of the
 
06:26:39.230 --> 06:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
budget pass in 2021.
 
06:26:41.390 --> 06:26:41.400 align:start position:0%
these penalties include a possible
 
06:26:44.448 --> 06:26:44.458 align:start position:0%
felony conviction with a jail time of up
 
06:26:47.150 --> 06:26:47.160 align:start position:0%
to seven years as well as a fine of a
 
06:26:49.490 --> 06:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars
 
06:26:52.788 --> 06:26:52.798 align:start position:0%
these are charges which no other medical
 
06:26:55.850 --> 06:26:55.860 align:start position:0%
procedure inflicts on a doctor
 
06:26:58.610 --> 06:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
a doctor acting in good faith and
 
06:27:01.190 --> 06:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
following the Hippocratic Oath would
 
06:27:03.590 --> 06:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
constantly be second guessing his or
 
06:27:03.600 --> 06:27:04.970 align:start position:0%
constantly be second guessing his or
herself

06:27:04.970 --> 06:27:04.980 align:start position:0%
herself
 
06:27:08.690 --> 06:27:08.700 align:start position:0%
could this uncertainty cause a doctor to
 
06:27:12.410 --> 06:27:12.420 align:start position:0%
not act immediately as would be prudent
 
06:27:14.510 --> 06:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
saving the life of a pregnant woman
 
06:27:17.628 --> 06:27:17.638 align:start position:0%
should be able to be done without any
 
06:27:21.230 --> 06:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
other thoughts clouding one's mind
 
06:27:24.288 --> 06:27:24.298 align:start position:0%
and I want to point out a recent case in
 
06:27:26.810 --> 06:27:26.820 align:start position:0%
Texas that highlights the uncertainty
 
06:27:29.750 --> 06:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
that makes treating a pregnancy that has
 
06:27:32.690 --> 06:27:32.700 align:start position:0%
gone awry in the potentially fatal
 
06:27:34.850 --> 06:27:34.860 align:start position:0%
consequences that can follow
 
06:27:37.910 --> 06:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
in Texas a young woman's water broke
 
06:27:40.730 --> 06:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
and she and the doctors knew that the
 
06:27:42.530 --> 06:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
baby would not survive
 
06:27:45.170 --> 06:27:45.180 align:start position:0%
yet as the baby still had a heartbeat
 
06:27:47.208 --> 06:27:47.218 align:start position:0%
they were unwilling to perform an
 
06:27:47.218 --> 06:27:48.350 align:start position:0%
they were unwilling to perform an
abortion

06:27:48.350 --> 06:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
06:27:51.048 --> 06:27:51.058 align:start position:0%
three days later the woman had chills
 
06:27:55.310 --> 06:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
her temperature Rose to 103. finally the
 
06:27:57.770 --> 06:27:57.780 align:start position:0%
doctors agreed and felt safe that they
 
06:28:00.470 --> 06:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
could legally perform an abortion
 
06:28:02.628 --> 06:28:02.638 align:start position:0%
12 hours after the pregnancy was
 
06:28:05.208 --> 06:28:05.218 align:start position:0%
terminated the woman came down with
 
06:28:05.218 --> 06:28:06.288 align:start position:0%
terminated the woman came down with
sepsis

06:28:06.288 --> 06:28:06.298 align:start position:0%
sepsis
 
06:28:09.770 --> 06:28:09.780 align:start position:0%
intense medical intervention barely
 
06:28:11.330 --> 06:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
saved the mother
 
06:28:13.430 --> 06:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
and I ask you
 
06:28:16.850 --> 06:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
would you want this to happen to you oh
 
06:28:19.730 --> 06:28:19.740 align:start position:0%
would you want your doctor to do what he
 
06:28:22.670 --> 06:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
or she is trained to do and to protect
 
06:28:24.230 --> 06:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
the mother's life
 
06:28:27.650 --> 06:28:27.660 align:start position:0%
very simply for these reasons I urge
 
06:28:31.730 --> 06:28:31.740 align:start position:0%
this committee to recommend that HB 224
 
06:28:34.730 --> 06:28:34.740 align:start position:0%
receive a vote of ought to pass
 
06:28:37.310 --> 06:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions for this
 
06:28:37.320 --> 06:28:39.410 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions for this

thank you Mr chair and thank you
representative

06:28:44.510 --> 06:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:28:48.410 --> 06:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
how does current law Define a violation
 
06:28:51.230 --> 06:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
of the law that could be prosecuted and
 
06:28:53.570 --> 06:28:53.580 align:start position:0%
how does one prove that a violation has
 
06:28:55.670 --> 06:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
occurred when there's no way of proving
 
06:28:57.470 --> 06:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
the age of the baby and how many
 
06:28:59.030 --> 06:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
prosecutions have actually occurred
 
06:29:02.868 --> 06:29:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:05.510 --> 06:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
I think those were three questions it
 
06:29:07.368 --> 06:29:07.378 align:start position:0%
sounds like three questions but we'll
 
06:29:10.190 --> 06:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
allow it roll out go ahead
 
06:29:10.200 --> 06:29:11.510 align:start position:0%
allow it roll out go ahead
um

06:29:11.510 --> 06:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:29:14.390 --> 06:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure about prosecutions I
 
06:29:17.150 --> 06:29:17.160 align:start position:0%
haven't gone into that all I know is
 
06:29:20.150 --> 06:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
what I've been told by doctors in the
 
06:29:23.868 --> 06:29:23.878 align:start position:0%
field I know follow me is going to be
 
06:29:27.470 --> 06:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
Matthew Hood from Dartmouth and Dr Cass
 
06:29:30.530 --> 06:29:30.540 align:start position:0%
who said of OB GYN up there who can tell
 
06:29:32.628 --> 06:29:32.638 align:start position:0%
you about some of those things I know
 
06:29:32.638 --> 06:29:33.590 align:start position:0%
you about some of those things I know
that

06:29:33.590 --> 06:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:29:35.990 --> 06:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
at one time we wanted to have some
 
06:29:36.000 --> 06:29:37.128 align:start position:0%
at one time we wanted to have some
statistics

06:29:37.128 --> 06:29:37.138 align:start position:0%
statistics
 
06:29:37.138 --> 06:29:38.270 align:start position:0%
statistics
and

06:29:38.270 --> 06:29:38.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:29:40.430 --> 06:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
we could never get anybody to agree on
 
06:29:43.190 --> 06:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
that so I can't tell you the answer to
 
06:29:44.208 --> 06:29:44.218 align:start position:0%
your question
 
06:29:47.750 --> 06:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
06:29:49.128 --> 06:29:49.138 align:start position:0%
I guess I I do have a question
 
06:29:51.230 --> 06:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
Representatives I as I think you and I
 
06:29:52.850 --> 06:29:52.860 align:start position:0%
had discussed in the hall yesterday I'm
 
06:29:55.010 --> 06:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
the elevator rides have been too short
 
06:29:57.948 --> 06:29:57.958 align:start position:0%
the the uh
 
06:30:00.350 --> 06:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
the statute for the criminal penalty
 
06:30:04.730 --> 06:30:04.740 align:start position:0%
says that liability for for being guilty
 
06:30:08.570 --> 06:30:08.580 align:start position:0%
of a crime is if you act knowingly and
 
06:30:09.948 --> 06:30:09.958 align:start position:0%
so I'm
 
06:30:12.948 --> 06:30:12.958 align:start position:0%
you know I I guess I have
 
06:30:16.610 --> 06:30:16.620 align:start position:0%
some difficulty understanding if why
 
06:30:18.830 --> 06:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
with that
 
06:30:21.770 --> 06:30:21.780 align:start position:0%
with that caveat in there that limits in
 
06:30:25.010 --> 06:30:25.020 align:start position:0%
other words if if the if there's some
 
06:30:27.230 --> 06:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
question that the doctor has not act
 
06:30:29.448 --> 06:30:29.458 align:start position:0%
acted knowingly
 
06:30:31.910 --> 06:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
um that then there's there's not a basis
 
06:30:34.490 --> 06:30:34.500 align:start position:0%
for prosecution but it's the in other
 
06:30:35.868 --> 06:30:35.878 align:start position:0%
words if the
 
06:30:40.190 --> 06:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
what if if a doctor does act in other
 
06:30:42.170 --> 06:30:42.180 align:start position:0%
words a doctor knows there's no question
 
06:30:45.230 --> 06:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
that the that this fetus is over 24
 
06:30:49.390 --> 06:30:49.400 align:start position:0%
weeks old and there's no there's no
 
06:30:52.190 --> 06:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
justification you know in the terms of
 
06:30:53.750 --> 06:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
life or health of the mother or that
 
06:30:55.788 --> 06:30:55.798 align:start position:0%
kind of thing fetal abnormalities
 
06:30:57.708 --> 06:30:57.718 align:start position:0%
um and the doctor performs the abortion
 
06:31:00.530 --> 06:31:00.540 align:start position:0%
anyway I I'm I guess I am troubled with
 
06:31:02.390 --> 06:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
the idea that the doctor should not be
 
06:31:04.850 --> 06:31:04.860 align:start position:0%
subject to criminal penalties in that
 
06:31:04.860 --> 06:31:07.190 align:start position:0%
subject to criminal penalties in that
circumstance

06:31:07.190 --> 06:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
circumstance
 
06:31:10.070 --> 06:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
I think the issue that you raised Mr
 
06:31:14.090 --> 06:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
chairman is that it raises a cloud
 
06:31:16.610 --> 06:31:16.620 align:start position:0%
and there's a cloud out there that may
 
06:31:20.868 --> 06:31:20.878 align:start position:0%
occur and as I stated in the Texas case
 
06:31:22.788 --> 06:31:22.798 align:start position:0%
it may delay
 
06:31:25.670 --> 06:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
proper Medical Care
 
06:31:28.788 --> 06:31:28.798 align:start position:0%
if it can be proven that it's knowingly
 
06:31:30.708 --> 06:31:30.718 align:start position:0%
in violation
 
06:31:33.170 --> 06:31:33.180 align:start position:0%
I don't have a problem with that
 
06:31:36.128 --> 06:31:36.138 align:start position:0%
but let's have the medical procedure
 
06:31:38.990 --> 06:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
proceed without knowing
 
06:31:41.570 --> 06:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
that situation
 
06:31:44.930 --> 06:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
does that make any sense to you well I
 
06:31:46.548 --> 06:31:46.558 align:start position:0%
mean I I guess I I guess what I would
 
06:31:48.350 --> 06:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
say is I understand that this that
 
06:31:51.048 --> 06:31:51.058 align:start position:0%
obviously this could this there could be
 
06:31:53.628 --> 06:31:53.638 align:start position:0%
circumstances where this could become
 
06:31:56.270 --> 06:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
a question did the doctor really know
 
06:31:58.128 --> 06:31:58.138 align:start position:0%
what were the sir I I completely
 
06:31:59.510 --> 06:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
06:32:02.270 --> 06:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
but this I guess the thing I have
 
06:32:04.730 --> 06:32:04.740 align:start position:0%
trying to distinguish this from the
 
06:32:06.410 --> 06:32:06.420 align:start position:0%
example that I gave you when we did when
 
06:32:10.368 --> 06:32:10.378 align:start position:0%
we talked it is it's perfectly legal for
 
06:32:13.788 --> 06:32:13.798 align:start position:0%
doctors to prescribe narcotics for you
 
06:32:17.150 --> 06:32:17.160 align:start position:0%
know for for for appropriate use but
 
06:32:20.150 --> 06:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
it's not legal for doctors to do that if
 
06:32:22.128 --> 06:32:22.138 align:start position:0%
they're actually acting as drug dealers
 
06:32:24.830 --> 06:32:24.840 align:start position:0%
and there have been you know many many
 
06:32:27.890 --> 06:32:27.900 align:start position:0%
cases in which doctors have been
 
06:32:31.670 --> 06:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
prosecuted for that and it is often the
 
06:32:34.548 --> 06:32:34.558 align:start position:0%
situation in those kind of cases uh but
 
06:32:35.868 --> 06:32:35.878 align:start position:0%
I know because I've had some of them
 
06:32:37.430 --> 06:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
myself some of them myself many many
 
06:32:39.410 --> 06:32:39.420 align:start position:0%
years ago that that there will be a
 
06:32:40.910 --> 06:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
question the doctor will say well you
 
06:32:43.128 --> 06:32:43.138 align:start position:0%
know there'll be an issue was the doctor
 
06:32:45.110 --> 06:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
really acting within the scope of his
 
06:32:48.530 --> 06:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
practice or was he being a drug dealer
 
06:32:51.530 --> 06:32:51.540 align:start position:0%
and those can be complicated
 
06:32:51.540 --> 06:32:52.128 align:start position:0%
and those can be complicated
um

06:32:52.128 --> 06:32:52.138 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:32:54.948 --> 06:32:54.958 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure how they are
 
06:32:57.170 --> 06:32:57.180 align:start position:0%
all that much complicated from the
 
06:33:01.190 --> 06:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:02.868 --> 06:33:02.878 align:start position:0%
you've raised an interesting question
 
06:33:05.628 --> 06:33:05.638 align:start position:0%
which I don't have an answer for except
 
06:33:08.090 --> 06:33:08.100 align:start position:0%
to say that I think a doctor acting in
 
06:33:10.250 --> 06:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
good faith wouldn't
 
06:33:12.770 --> 06:33:12.780 align:start position:0%
not want to have that sword hanging over
 
06:33:14.090 --> 06:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
his head
 
06:33:16.490 --> 06:33:16.500 align:start position:0%
thank you other other questions for yes
 
06:33:18.708 --> 06:33:18.718 align:start position:0%
uh representative Stapleton
 
06:33:20.628 --> 06:33:20.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
06:33:22.548 --> 06:33:22.558 align:start position:0%
my question
 
06:33:27.110 --> 06:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
may I assume from the tenor of this bill
 
06:33:30.230 --> 06:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
that you or co-sponsors are not opposed
 
06:33:33.410 --> 06:33:33.420 align:start position:0%
to the six-month restriction but only
 
06:33:35.510 --> 06:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
the penalty
 
06:33:38.810 --> 06:33:38.820 align:start position:0%
yes or I don't know whether that's a yes
 
06:33:41.510 --> 06:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
or no but uh I'm willing to live with a
 
06:33:43.490 --> 06:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
six-month restriction I think it's a
 
06:33:46.310 --> 06:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
reasonable restriction I know some of my
 
06:33:48.288 --> 06:33:48.298 align:start position:0%
people including my wife disagree with
 
06:33:52.570 --> 06:33:52.580 align:start position:0%
me but I think we've found a compromise
 
06:33:56.090 --> 06:33:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:59.030 --> 06:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
then may I ask
 
06:34:01.670 --> 06:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
how do you enforce
 
06:34:05.150 --> 06:34:05.160 align:start position:0%
the the intent of the fetal Life
 
06:34:08.330 --> 06:34:08.340 align:start position:0%
protection act by withdrawing penalties
 
06:34:12.350 --> 06:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
and making an open choice to observe or
 
06:34:12.360 --> 06:34:18.350 align:start position:0%
and making an open choice to observe or
not

06:34:18.350 --> 06:34:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:21.110 --> 06:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
you have a law on the books that says
 
06:34:22.128 --> 06:34:22.138 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
06:34:24.830 --> 06:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
do something there are other ways to
 
06:34:27.948 --> 06:34:27.958 align:start position:0%
enforce the penalty whether it be a loss
 
06:34:29.448 --> 06:34:29.458 align:start position:0%
of medical license or something like
 
06:34:32.330 --> 06:34:32.340 align:start position:0%
that but I think they
 
06:34:35.930 --> 06:34:35.940 align:start position:0%
jail term for a doctor the fine of a
 
06:34:37.430 --> 06:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars
 
06:34:39.948 --> 06:34:39.958 align:start position:0%
for a person that is acting in their
 
06:34:42.110 --> 06:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
best interest in the best interest of
 
06:34:43.430 --> 06:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
the mother
 
06:34:45.470 --> 06:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
is enough of a penalty enough of a
 
06:34:45.480 --> 06:34:48.288 align:start position:0%
is enough of a penalty enough of a
threat

06:34:48.288 --> 06:34:48.298 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:50.090 --> 06:34:50.100 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you other questions for
 
06:34:52.730 --> 06:34:52.740 align:start position:0%

thank you chair Lynn good to see you

this afternoon and members of house
 
06:35:09.170 --> 06:35:09.180 align:start position:0%
Judiciary I know it's been a long day so
 
06:35:12.048 --> 06:35:12.058 align:start position:0%
I will um my comments will be brief and
 
06:35:13.910 --> 06:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully to the point I'm going to
 
06:35:18.830 --> 06:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
frame my uh my testimony in or focus it
 
06:35:21.890 --> 06:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
around really access the gaps in
 
06:35:25.010 --> 06:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
maternal care that already exist in New
 
06:35:26.930 --> 06:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire other than that are growing in
 
06:35:29.270 --> 06:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and want a law like this
 
06:35:32.868 --> 06:35:32.878 align:start position:0%
on the books could continue to do to
 
06:35:35.448 --> 06:35:35.458 align:start position:0%
harm that situation so for the record my
 
06:35:36.948 --> 06:35:36.958 align:start position:0%
name is Sue Prentice I'm a state senator
 
06:35:39.170 --> 06:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
from District Five I represent 15
 
06:35:41.690 --> 06:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
communities large part of Grafton County
 
06:35:45.350 --> 06:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
part of Sullivan County and one town in
 
06:35:46.788 --> 06:35:46.798 align:start position:0%
Merrimack County
 
06:35:49.310 --> 06:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
and I am here today speaking in support
 
06:35:53.510 --> 06:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 224 and I I appreciate
 
06:35:55.548 --> 06:35:55.558 align:start position:0%
that representative wolf has filed this
 
06:35:57.470 --> 06:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
legislation so as you know and he has
 
06:35:58.730 --> 06:35:58.740 align:start position:0%
already said but it's worth repeating
 
06:36:00.170 --> 06:36:00.180 align:start position:0%
that this bill
 
06:36:02.750 --> 06:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
would this bill would remove the
 
06:36:05.448 --> 06:36:05.458 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties that are now in place
 
06:36:09.288 --> 06:36:09.298 align:start position:0%
for performing an abortion after 24
 
06:36:09.298 --> 06:36:10.548 align:start position:0%
for performing an abortion after 24
weeks

06:36:10.548 --> 06:36:10.558 align:start position:0%
weeks
 
06:36:15.110 --> 06:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
and those those penalties are it's a
 
06:36:17.810 --> 06:36:17.820 align:start position:0%
felony it's a hundred thousand dollar
 
06:36:21.410 --> 06:36:21.420 align:start position:0%
fine and a prison sentence and as
 
06:36:23.470 --> 06:36:23.480 align:start position:0%
representative wolf said this is the
 
06:36:26.930 --> 06:36:26.940 align:start position:0%
only medical care practice or medical
 
06:36:28.910 --> 06:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
part of the medical profession that
 
06:36:31.610 --> 06:36:31.620 align:start position:0%
actually is subject to these kinds of
 
06:36:34.368 --> 06:36:34.378 align:start position:0%
provisions and penalties so when we were
 
06:36:37.548 --> 06:36:37.558 align:start position:0%
debating this in 2021
 
06:36:39.948 --> 06:36:39.958 align:start position:0%
I heard from a number of healthcare
 
06:36:41.448 --> 06:36:41.458 align:start position:0%
professionals and I actually took a
 
06:36:43.128 --> 06:36:43.138 align:start position:0%
quote out of a letter that we received
 
06:36:45.770 --> 06:36:45.780 align:start position:0%
that were signed by 200 New Hampshire
 
06:36:47.330 --> 06:36:47.340 align:start position:0%
health care providers that I want to
 
06:36:49.548 --> 06:36:49.558 align:start position:0%
share with you New Hampshire already
 
06:36:51.890 --> 06:36:51.900 align:start position:0%
struggles to retain Medical Care
 
06:36:53.930 --> 06:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
Professionals and we are deeply
 
06:36:56.090 --> 06:36:56.100 align:start position:0%
concerned that these criminal penalties
 
06:36:58.670 --> 06:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
will undermine the state's effort to
 
06:37:03.410 --> 06:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:06.230 --> 06:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
so you know New Hampshire already has a
 
06:37:08.030 --> 06:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
shrinking population of obstetrical care
 
06:37:10.548 --> 06:37:10.558 align:start position:0%
providers and I had the honor of serving
 
06:37:12.470 --> 06:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire as the chief
 
06:37:14.390 --> 06:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
of Emergency Medical Services at your
 
06:37:16.128 --> 06:37:16.138 align:start position:0%
department of safety for close to 10
 
06:37:19.070 --> 06:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
years and during that period of time we
 
06:37:21.650 --> 06:37:21.660 align:start position:0%
started to see this shrinking population
 
06:37:23.810 --> 06:37:23.820 align:start position:0%
of obstetrical care providers which was
 
06:37:26.448 --> 06:37:26.458 align:start position:0%
predominantly at that time in the North
 
06:37:30.350 --> 06:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
Country so I teamed up with
 
06:37:32.990 --> 06:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
I teamed up with nurse midwives and
 
06:37:34.910 --> 06:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
Obstetricians and other Emergency
 
06:37:37.190 --> 06:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
Medical Service professionals and we
 
06:37:40.010 --> 06:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
went into these areas and what we did is
 
06:37:42.350 --> 06:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
we picked the areas that had there was
 
06:37:44.930 --> 06:37:44.940 align:start position:0%
there was no maternity care unit present
 
06:37:46.548 --> 06:37:46.558 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't mean that there aren't
 
06:37:48.410 --> 06:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
pregnant women in those communities and
 
06:37:51.170 --> 06:37:51.180 align:start position:0%
an obstetrical emergency could actually
 
06:37:54.650 --> 06:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
take place so we went up there and we
 
06:37:57.850 --> 06:37:57.860 align:start position:0%
trained them to manage the situation
 
06:38:00.410 --> 06:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
that was before them without the
 
06:38:02.208 --> 06:38:02.218 align:start position:0%
adequate type of backup that they really
 
06:38:05.150 --> 06:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
need because again this population has
 
06:38:07.490 --> 06:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
shrunk at that time I thought it was
 
06:38:09.650 --> 06:38:09.660 align:start position:0%
only a rural problem but what I can tell
 
06:38:12.288 --> 06:38:12.298 align:start position:0%
you now is that this is not just a rural
 
06:38:14.990 --> 06:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
problem that this is impacting Suburban
 
06:38:17.448 --> 06:38:17.458 align:start position:0%
areas in New Hampshire as well we have
 
06:38:20.510 --> 06:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
26 acute care hospitals in the state in
 
06:38:24.708 --> 06:38:24.718 align:start position:0%
the last 20 years 10 of them have closed
 
06:38:27.530 --> 06:38:27.540 align:start position:0%
their birthing units the 10th is
 
06:38:29.330 --> 06:38:29.340 align:start position:0%
actually in Derry New Hampshire good
 
06:38:31.190 --> 06:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
afternoon representative good to see you
 
06:38:34.310 --> 06:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
and we have an 11th that is planning to
 
06:38:37.310 --> 06:38:37.320 align:start position:0%
close its doors over in the Seacoast so
 
06:38:40.128 --> 06:38:40.138 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty significant number in
 
06:38:42.830 --> 06:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
shift of obstetrical Care Professionals
 
06:38:45.948 --> 06:38:45.958 align:start position:0%
and services that are available and
 
06:38:48.650 --> 06:38:48.660 align:start position:0%
again my concern is our pipeline in
 
06:38:50.990 --> 06:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
terms of the workforce and bringing more
 
06:38:53.390 --> 06:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
obstetrical care providers to take care
 
06:38:55.788 --> 06:38:55.798 align:start position:0%
of our moms and our babies and their
 
06:38:59.868 --> 06:38:59.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:02.868 --> 06:39:02.878 align:start position:0%
so and I just a few other points I
 
06:39:05.628 --> 06:39:05.638 align:start position:0%
learned from a an obstetrician a
 
06:39:07.368 --> 06:39:07.378 align:start position:0%
horoscope obstetrician at Dartmouth
 
06:39:10.190 --> 06:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
health during this first the first time
 
06:39:13.670 --> 06:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
we were debating this in in 2021 that
 
06:39:16.310 --> 06:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
they had a high risk practice in Bedford
 
06:39:18.948 --> 06:39:18.958 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire again a more like not
 
06:39:20.510 --> 06:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
considered a rural area of this state
 
06:39:23.030 --> 06:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
and that it took them close to two years
 
06:39:26.510 --> 06:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
to recruit a high risk obstetrician a
 
06:39:29.690 --> 06:39:29.700 align:start position:0%
neonatologist who would be taking care
 
06:39:31.310 --> 06:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
of Moms
 
06:39:32.690 --> 06:39:32.700 align:start position:0%
um and you know you know while they were
 
06:39:35.448 --> 06:39:35.458 align:start position:0%
pregnant and that women from where I
 
06:39:37.190 --> 06:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
live which is in Lebanon Lebanon and
 
06:39:39.048 --> 06:39:39.058 align:start position:0%
Hanover and other parts of the Upper
 
06:39:42.110 --> 06:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
Valley were rotating and covering that
 
06:39:44.570 --> 06:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
practice so that these women could still
 
06:39:44.580 --> 06:39:45.830 align:start position:0%
practice so that these women could still
receive

06:39:45.830 --> 06:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
receive
 
06:39:48.470 --> 06:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
could still receive care so I know that
 
06:39:49.850 --> 06:39:49.860 align:start position:0%
that particular situation has been
 
06:39:51.770 --> 06:39:51.780 align:start position:0%
remedied but it doesn't mean it isn't
 
06:39:53.390 --> 06:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
going to continue in the future
 
06:39:55.850 --> 06:39:55.860 align:start position:0%
I know that New Hampshire trains at a
 
06:39:58.448 --> 06:39:58.458 align:start position:0%
minimum for OB GYN residents per year
 
06:40:01.070 --> 06:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
and certainly we'd like the folks that
 
06:40:04.490 --> 06:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
we train to stay here and take care of
 
06:40:07.430 --> 06:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
our New Hampshire patients so the big
 
06:40:10.128 --> 06:40:10.138 align:start position:0%
question is will they think twice about
 
06:40:12.770 --> 06:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
this now will they seek positions
 
06:40:15.770 --> 06:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
elsewhere because of these criminal
 
06:40:18.590 --> 06:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
penalties that are going to come in
 
06:40:21.230 --> 06:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
between them and doing their job
 
06:40:25.128 --> 06:40:25.138 align:start position:0%
so that's certainly a conversation that
 
06:40:27.230 --> 06:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
is happening and I can't tell you that
 
06:40:29.390 --> 06:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
is it impacted this recruitment already
 
06:40:32.390 --> 06:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
but this is not even what are we two
 
06:40:33.948 --> 06:40:33.958 align:start position:0%
years old this happened in my first term
 
06:40:35.330 --> 06:40:35.340 align:start position:0%
in the Senate
 
06:40:37.970 --> 06:40:37.980 align:start position:0%
my greatest fear could become a reality
 
06:40:39.948 --> 06:40:39.958 align:start position:0%
and that's that we won't as I've said be
 
06:40:42.590 --> 06:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
able to fill these important roles and
 
06:40:44.868 --> 06:40:44.878 align:start position:0%
provide access to obstetrical care in
 
06:40:47.208 --> 06:40:47.218 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire why would why would you
 
06:40:49.070 --> 06:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
want to work in a state that would
 
06:40:51.590 --> 06:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
prosecute you for caring for a woman in
 
06:40:53.750 --> 06:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
that most and her family in that most
 
06:40:55.090 --> 06:40:55.100 align:start position:0%
critical time
 
06:40:57.770 --> 06:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
criminalizing health care providers for
 
06:40:59.510 --> 06:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
providing Compassionate Care that's in
 
06:41:01.730 --> 06:41:01.740 align:start position:0%
line with their medical expertise their
 
06:41:04.010 --> 06:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
medical expertise and the best interests
 
06:41:05.810 --> 06:41:05.820 align:start position:0%
of their patients is why I could
 
06:41:07.548 --> 06:41:07.558 align:start position:0%
consider to be cruel and to be
 
06:41:10.070 --> 06:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
regressive and could have chilling
 
06:41:13.010 --> 06:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
effects in the long term up here in New
 
06:41:15.770 --> 06:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we critically need to have
 
06:41:18.530 --> 06:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
a solid framework in infrastructure for
 
06:41:20.930 --> 06:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
obstetrical care providers that's what's
 
06:41:23.330 --> 06:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
at Jeopardy here so I urge you to
 
06:41:25.910 --> 06:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
support HP 224 and to do the right
 
06:41:28.430 --> 06:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
things do the right thing for our health
 
06:41:30.410 --> 06:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
care providers and for the families the
 
06:41:34.730 --> 06:41:34.740 align:start position:0%
women that they take care of I again I
 
06:41:37.430 --> 06:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
support ought to pass I'm happy to
 
06:41:39.170 --> 06:41:39.180 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that I can and if
 
06:41:41.570 --> 06:41:41.580 align:start position:0%
not I know that representative wolf has
 
06:41:43.690 --> 06:41:43.700 align:start position:0%
answered some and we do have some other
 
06:41:46.548 --> 06:41:46.558 align:start position:0%
we do have some other professionals and
 
06:41:49.128 --> 06:41:49.138 align:start position:0%
experts here that might be better suited
 
06:41:52.970 --> 06:41:52.980 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Lynn
 
06:41:56.208 --> 06:41:56.218 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for this Witness
 
06:41:58.390 --> 06:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
06:42:02.330 --> 06:42:02.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh thank you
 
06:42:04.490 --> 06:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
Senator Apprentice for for um your
 
06:42:04.500 --> 06:42:05.510 align:start position:0%
Senator Apprentice for for um your
testimony

06:42:05.510 --> 06:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
06:42:08.570 --> 06:42:08.580 align:start position:0%
um as as a as a former uh head of uh
 
06:42:10.548 --> 06:42:10.558 align:start position:0%
States EMT
 
06:42:13.970 --> 06:42:13.980 align:start position:0%
um in situations late term pregnancy if
 
06:42:16.010 --> 06:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
it were to arise I know there's been
 
06:42:17.930 --> 06:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
testimony that this from a practical
 
06:42:19.910 --> 06:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
standpoint doesn't happen at least on a
 
06:42:23.150 --> 06:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
on a routine basis
 
06:42:25.910 --> 06:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
um how much time would be available to a
 
06:42:28.850 --> 06:42:28.860 align:start position:0%
provider in certain circumstances uh to
 
06:42:31.070 --> 06:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
make that decision about what needs to
 
06:42:32.750 --> 06:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
be done
 
06:42:35.868 --> 06:42:35.878 align:start position:0%
in in the later stages of of pregnancy
 
06:42:35.878 --> 06:42:37.548 align:start position:0%
in in the later stages of of pregnancy
if

06:42:37.548 --> 06:42:37.558 align:start position:0%
if
 
06:42:39.890 --> 06:42:39.900 align:start position:0%
um situations arise and and how clear
 
06:42:41.570 --> 06:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
would it always be
 
06:42:43.910 --> 06:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
06:42:46.128 --> 06:42:46.138 align:start position:0%
that's that's hard to answer I mean it
 
06:42:48.890 --> 06:42:48.900 align:start position:0%
could be moments to minutes to more but
 
06:42:51.350 --> 06:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
what we are putting in between them and
 
06:42:53.030 --> 06:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
their decision making
 
06:42:55.548 --> 06:42:55.558 align:start position:0%
um is a is a risk manager or you know
 
06:42:57.650 --> 06:42:57.660 align:start position:0%
the again the thought of what they might
 
06:43:00.170 --> 06:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
have to do what what criminal penalties
 
06:43:02.030 --> 06:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
they might suffer for doing their job so
 
06:43:04.368 --> 06:43:04.378 align:start position:0%
I can't answer direct exactly but thank
 
06:43:05.810 --> 06:43:05.820 align:start position:0%
you for the question
 
06:43:09.708 --> 06:43:09.718 align:start position:0%
yes other questions for this Witness
 
06:43:11.868 --> 06:43:11.878 align:start position:0%
yes representative Perez
 
06:43:13.310 --> 06:43:13.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:43:16.010 --> 06:43:16.020 align:start position:0%
I have a concern in the fact that this
 
06:43:18.650 --> 06:43:18.660 align:start position:0%
not only repeals Criminal
 
06:43:23.448 --> 06:43:23.458 align:start position:0%
penalties but it also repeals any civil
 
06:43:25.250 --> 06:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
uh penalties
 
06:43:28.730 --> 06:43:28.740 align:start position:0%
for example if
 
06:43:31.628 --> 06:43:31.638 align:start position:0%
um if a doctor
 
06:43:35.868 --> 06:43:35.878 align:start position:0%
performed an abortion on a minor
 
06:43:37.910 --> 06:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
um and the mother didn't give permission
 
06:43:40.970 --> 06:43:40.980 align:start position:0%
or if something happened
 
06:43:44.690 --> 06:43:44.700 align:start position:0%
during the abortion that the mother
 
06:43:47.390 --> 06:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
would not the person having the abortion
 
06:43:50.390 --> 06:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
would not have the opportunity to
 
06:43:53.330 --> 06:43:53.340 align:start position:0%
provide any civil suit so taking away
 
06:43:57.708 --> 06:43:57.718 align:start position:0%
criminal and civil penalties I think is
 
06:44:01.430 --> 06:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
in makes this kind of a red flag for me
 
06:44:04.670 --> 06:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
can you tell me why the Civil is in
 
06:44:07.368 --> 06:44:07.378 align:start position:0%
there and if that civil
 
06:44:07.378 --> 06:44:08.090 align:start position:0%
there and if that civil
um

06:44:08.090 --> 06:44:08.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:44:10.368 --> 06:44:10.378 align:start position:0%
are my fears
 
06:44:12.530 --> 06:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
are my fears right that it could take
 
06:44:14.930 --> 06:44:14.940 align:start position:0%
away the right for civil suit
 
06:44:16.368 --> 06:44:16.378 align:start position:0%
I'm actually going to defer that
 
06:44:19.610 --> 06:44:19.620 align:start position:0%
question to Matthew Hood a former state
 
06:44:21.590 --> 06:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
senator the the government relations
 
06:44:25.190 --> 06:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
director for Dartmouth Health okay
 
06:44:26.750 --> 06:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
thanks Matthew all right other questions
 
06:44:29.750 --> 06:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
for this one thank you
 
06:44:32.690 --> 06:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
yes representative Stapleton
 
06:44:35.330 --> 06:44:35.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you senator
 
06:44:38.270 --> 06:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
for the detailed uh rationale and
 
06:44:41.690 --> 06:44:41.700 align:start position:0%
itemization of your argument
 
06:44:45.170 --> 06:44:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:47.930 --> 06:44:47.940 align:start position:0%
if the intent of the fetal Life
 
06:44:49.310 --> 06:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
protection act
 
06:44:52.490 --> 06:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
is to protect that viable life
 
06:44:54.890 --> 06:44:54.900 align:start position:0%
at a certain point going forward from
 
06:44:57.948 --> 06:44:57.958 align:start position:0%
the 24 weeks
 
06:45:01.010 --> 06:45:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:01.020 --> 06:45:01.850 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:45:01.850 --> 06:45:01.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:45:03.650 --> 06:45:03.660 align:start position:0%
of life
 
06:45:08.390 --> 06:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
is violated by taking that life
 
06:45:11.390 --> 06:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
should there not be a penalty
 
06:45:15.350 --> 06:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
to prevent or caution
 
06:45:18.530 --> 06:45:18.540 align:start position:0%
people from stepping over the line and
 
06:45:20.990 --> 06:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
taking that life which the law intends
 
06:45:23.510 --> 06:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
to protect
 
06:45:24.770 --> 06:45:24.780 align:start position:0%
um good to see you representative
 
06:45:26.208 --> 06:45:26.218 align:start position:0%
Stapleton and thank you for the question
 
06:45:28.610 --> 06:45:28.620 align:start position:0%
so here's what I know less than
 
06:45:30.170 --> 06:45:30.180 align:start position:0%
according to the Centers for Disease
 
06:45:33.288 --> 06:45:33.298 align:start position:0%
Control less than one percent of
 
06:45:36.170 --> 06:45:36.180 align:start position:0%
pregnancies are terminated after 24
 
06:45:39.048 --> 06:45:39.058 align:start position:0%
weeks these are
 
06:45:42.288 --> 06:45:42.298 align:start position:0%
mothers and families that have named
 
06:45:45.110 --> 06:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
their children that have painted their
 
06:45:47.868 --> 06:45:47.878 align:start position:0%
nurseries and are preparing for to bring
 
06:45:49.490 --> 06:45:49.500 align:start position:0%
this life into the world but they are
 
06:45:53.810 --> 06:45:53.820 align:start position:0%
met with a circumstance an unforeseen
 
06:45:56.570 --> 06:45:56.580 align:start position:0%
you know critical devastating
 
06:45:58.610 --> 06:45:58.620 align:start position:0%
circumstances put them in that position
 
06:45:58.620 --> 06:46:00.048 align:start position:0%
circumstances put them in that position
so

06:46:00.048 --> 06:46:00.058 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:46:03.048 --> 06:46:03.058 align:start position:0%
I just want to frame it in it's not that
 
06:46:05.750 --> 06:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
this is not taken lightly and it's not a
 
06:46:08.448 --> 06:46:08.458 align:start position:0%
matter of uh you know I'm gonna proceed
 
06:46:10.548 --> 06:46:10.558 align:start position:0%
forward because I can I'm going to
 
06:46:12.410 --> 06:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
proceed forward because there's a
 
06:46:14.810 --> 06:46:14.820 align:start position:0%
situation that my medical care provider
 
06:46:17.330 --> 06:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
and I are talking about and need to make
 
06:46:20.150 --> 06:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
a decision on because my life the
 
06:46:23.270 --> 06:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
child's the child's life are in Jeopardy
 
06:46:25.070 --> 06:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
and I think it's important to keep in
 
06:46:28.128 --> 06:46:28.138 align:start position:0%
mind in the whole conversation what if
 
06:46:30.530 --> 06:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
you know this is a very small percentage
 
06:46:33.468 --> 06:46:33.478 align:start position:0%
which tells you how seriously not just
 
06:46:36.468 --> 06:46:36.478 align:start position:0%
providers but the women and the families
 
06:46:39.048 --> 06:46:39.058 align:start position:0%
take these situations
 
06:46:40.850 --> 06:46:40.860 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
06:46:42.708 --> 06:46:42.718 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
 
06:46:42.718 --> 06:46:45.708 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
Witness

06:46:45.708 --> 06:46:45.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:48.288 --> 06:46:48.298 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much uh next I'm
 
06:46:51.230 --> 06:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
going to call on uh Dr Tom Sherman
 
06:46:55.430 --> 06:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:59.510 --> 06:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
had had you had to leave okay all right
 
06:47:00.830 --> 06:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
I was going to submit all right great
 
06:47:03.048 --> 06:47:03.058 align:start position:0%
all right the next I'm going to go on to
 
06:47:05.990 --> 06:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh Daniel uh Danielle Pimentel and the
 
06:47:07.910 --> 06:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
next uh witness after that will be
 
06:47:13.730 --> 06:47:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:15.590 --> 06:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
this trim himself
 
06:47:17.810 --> 06:47:17.820 align:start position:0%
good afternoon once again Mr chairman
 
06:47:19.548 --> 06:47:19.558 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee my name is
 
06:47:21.048 --> 06:47:21.058 align:start position:0%
Danielle Pimentel and I'm with Americans
 
06:47:23.628 --> 06:47:23.638 align:start position:0%
United for life and today
 
06:47:25.670 --> 06:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
um in my last testimony that I'm
 
06:47:26.868 --> 06:47:26.878 align:start position:0%
presenting to the committee today I urge
 
06:47:29.690 --> 06:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
the committee to oppose this bill
 
06:47:31.610 --> 06:47:31.620 align:start position:0%
um because it will allow abortion
 
06:47:33.650 --> 06:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
providers to escape legal culpability
 
06:47:35.868 --> 06:47:35.878 align:start position:0%
for their illegal abortions that result
 
06:47:38.150 --> 06:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
in the life-threatening complications to
 
06:47:38.160 --> 06:47:39.170 align:start position:0%
in the life-threatening complications to
women

06:47:39.170 --> 06:47:39.180 align:start position:0%
women
 
06:47:40.968 --> 06:47:40.978 align:start position:0%
repealing the civil and criminal
 
06:47:44.090 --> 06:47:44.100 align:start position:0%
penalties prevent New Hampshire women
 
06:47:46.070 --> 06:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
from Seeking Justice under the fetal
 
06:47:48.110 --> 06:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
Life protection act if they've been
 
06:47:50.208 --> 06:47:50.218 align:start position:0%
harmed during an abortion
 
06:47:52.128 --> 06:47:52.138 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a legitimate interest
 
06:47:54.708 --> 06:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
in protecting maternal health and safety
 
06:47:57.350 --> 06:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
as noted by the Supreme Court in Dobbs
 
06:48:00.890 --> 06:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
yet hb224 directly contradicts with the
 
06:48:02.690 --> 06:48:02.700 align:start position:0%
state's interests to safeguard pregnant
 
06:48:05.270 --> 06:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
women because it removes Common Sense
 
06:48:07.968 --> 06:48:07.978 align:start position:0%
protections for their health and life
 
06:48:09.948 --> 06:48:09.958 align:start position:0%
for example the bill removes criminal
 
06:48:12.670 --> 06:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
and civil liability for abortions and
 
06:48:14.868 --> 06:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
violation of the fetal Life protection
 
06:48:17.030 --> 06:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
act that result in harm or death of
 
06:48:19.368 --> 06:48:19.378 align:start position:0%
pregnant women and as I said in earlier
 
06:48:20.990 --> 06:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
testimony we know abortions carry a
 
06:48:23.930 --> 06:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
higher risk of of or higher medical risk
 
06:48:26.150 --> 06:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
when done later in pregnancies and that
 
06:48:28.430 --> 06:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
many women suffer complications
 
06:48:31.310 --> 06:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
so if a health care provider performs an
 
06:48:33.890 --> 06:48:33.900 align:start position:0%
abortion after 24 weeks gestation or
 
06:48:35.448 --> 06:48:35.458 align:start position:0%
fails to perform an ultrasound in
 
06:48:36.770 --> 06:48:36.780 align:start position:0%
violation of the fetal Life protection
 
06:48:38.990 --> 06:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
act that provider is subjecting a
 
06:48:40.730 --> 06:48:40.740 align:start position:0%
pregnant woman to numerous
 
06:48:42.468 --> 06:48:42.478 align:start position:0%
life-threatening Health complications
 
06:48:44.090 --> 06:48:44.100 align:start position:0%
and potentially death
 
06:48:46.910 --> 06:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
however if hb224 is passed women cannot
 
06:48:48.830 --> 06:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
maintain a lawsuit under the fetal Life
 
06:48:50.628 --> 06:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
protection act against abortion
 
06:48:52.128 --> 06:48:52.138 align:start position:0%
providers who performed an illegal
 
06:48:54.230 --> 06:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
abortion and again potentially caused
 
06:48:57.048 --> 06:48:57.058 align:start position:0%
them harm physical harm or resulted in
 
06:48:59.090 --> 06:48:59.100 align:start position:0%
their death
 
06:49:01.250 --> 06:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
um the bill also eliminates
 
06:49:02.570 --> 06:49:02.580 align:start position:0%
um women's protections against
 
06:49:04.368 --> 06:49:04.378 align:start position:0%
psychological injuries from abortion
 
06:49:06.650 --> 06:49:06.660 align:start position:0%
under the fetal Life protection act a
 
06:49:08.750 --> 06:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
woman can seek monetary damages for both
 
06:49:10.310 --> 06:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
their physical and psychological
 
06:49:12.708 --> 06:49:12.718 align:start position:0%
injuries and this is an important remedy
 
06:49:15.830 --> 06:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
given that pregnancy loss whether that
 
06:49:17.810 --> 06:49:17.820 align:start position:0%
it's natural or induced through it by an
 
06:49:20.330 --> 06:49:20.340 align:start position:0%
abortion is associated with an increased
 
06:49:22.548 --> 06:49:22.558 align:start position:0%
risk of mental health problems and
 
06:49:25.010 --> 06:49:25.020 align:start position:0%
scholarship shows that the emotional
 
06:49:28.850 --> 06:49:28.860 align:start position:0%
reaction or grief from losing a
 
06:49:31.610 --> 06:49:31.620 align:start position:0%
pregnancy or experiencing a pregnancy
 
06:49:33.770 --> 06:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
lawsuit to an abortion can be prolonged
 
06:49:35.750 --> 06:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
afflict mental health and impact
 
06:49:38.750 --> 06:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
intimate or parental relationships
 
06:49:41.448 --> 06:49:41.458 align:start position:0%
so abortion causes grave harm to women's
 
06:49:45.048 --> 06:49:45.058 align:start position:0%
mental health however hb224 incentivizes
 
06:49:47.868 --> 06:49:47.878 align:start position:0%
abortionists to completely disregard the
 
06:49:49.968 --> 06:49:49.978 align:start position:0%
impact that an abortion may have on a
 
06:49:52.310 --> 06:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
woman's mental health being what mental
 
06:49:54.110 --> 06:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
part of me well-being by eliminating
 
06:49:55.788 --> 06:49:55.798 align:start position:0%
civil liability for psychological
 
06:49:58.610 --> 06:49:58.620 align:start position:0%
injuries arising from again illegal
 
06:50:00.410 --> 06:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
abortions under the fetal Life
 
06:50:02.750 --> 06:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
protection act or from failing to
 
06:50:05.390 --> 06:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
provide an ultrasound in accordance with
 
06:50:07.128 --> 06:50:07.138 align:start position:0%
the law
 
06:50:08.990 --> 06:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
the criminal and civil penalties under
 
06:50:11.448 --> 06:50:11.458 align:start position:0%
the fetal Life protection act are some
 
06:50:13.070 --> 06:50:13.080 align:start position:0%
of the last remaining regulations in
 
06:50:15.410 --> 06:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
place to protect the life health and
 
06:50:17.868 --> 06:50:17.878 align:start position:0%
safety of women who choose to have an
 
06:50:19.910 --> 06:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
abortion in New Hampshire and the fetal
 
06:50:21.770 --> 06:50:21.780 align:start position:0%
Life protection act does not penalize
 
06:50:23.690 --> 06:50:23.700 align:start position:0%
doctors from Compassionate Care as you
 
06:50:25.850 --> 06:50:25.860 align:start position:0%
may have heard earlier it penalized them
 
06:50:28.368 --> 06:50:28.378 align:start position:0%
for performing illegal abortions after
 
06:50:31.368 --> 06:50:31.378 align:start position:0%
24 weeks that result in life-threatening
 
06:50:34.128 --> 06:50:34.138 align:start position:0%
complications to women if this bill is
 
06:50:36.770 --> 06:50:36.780 align:start position:0%
passed New Hampshire may become a safe
 
06:50:39.048 --> 06:50:39.058 align:start position:0%
haven for abortion doctors to take
 
06:50:40.850 --> 06:50:40.860 align:start position:0%
advantage of that and for these reasons
 
06:50:44.208 --> 06:50:44.218 align:start position:0%
I urge the committee to oppose hb224
 
06:50:48.170 --> 06:50:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:50.150 --> 06:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
06:50:53.330 --> 06:50:53.340 align:start position:0%
um Allison Bedell and next will be uh
 
06:50:56.230 --> 06:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
Courtney Reed
 
06:50:59.390 --> 06:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
Captain good afternoon nice to see you
 
06:51:02.208 --> 06:51:02.218 align:start position:0%
all back up to lunch right
 
06:51:03.890 --> 06:51:03.900 align:start position:0%
um I I'm
 
06:51:07.128 --> 06:51:07.138 align:start position:0%
um asking you to please don't repeal the
 
06:51:09.948 --> 06:51:09.958 align:start position:0%
um criminal penalties act
 
06:51:11.628 --> 06:51:11.638 align:start position:0%
um one thing that I didn't mention this
 
06:51:13.910 --> 06:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
morning is uh in my morning's
 
06:51:15.650 --> 06:51:15.660 align:start position:0%
presentation is that a baby's heart
 
06:51:19.128 --> 06:51:19.138 align:start position:0%
begins to beat at five weeks by 18 days
 
06:51:21.350 --> 06:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
that is five weeks before the mother's
 
06:51:23.030 --> 06:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
after the mother's first menstrual
 
06:51:25.070 --> 06:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
period the mother doesn't even know
 
06:51:26.510 --> 06:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
she's pregnant
 
06:51:29.448 --> 06:51:29.458 align:start position:0%
now correct me if I'm wrong if one
 
06:51:32.150 --> 06:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
person uses an instrument to stop the
 
06:51:34.968 --> 06:51:34.978 align:start position:0%
Beating Heart of another what do we call
 
06:51:34.978 --> 06:51:36.288 align:start position:0%
Beating Heart of another what do we call
that

06:51:36.288 --> 06:51:36.298 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:51:36.298 --> 06:51:39.110 align:start position:0%
that
anybody

06:51:39.110 --> 06:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:42.110 --> 06:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
I think we'd call that murder
 
06:51:44.750 --> 06:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
so now I ask you how different is this
 
06:51:46.968 --> 06:51:46.978 align:start position:0%
from abortion especially in late germ
 
06:51:49.788 --> 06:51:49.798 align:start position:0%
abortions so I ask you please don't
 
06:51:52.850 --> 06:51:52.860 align:start position:0%
repeal the criminal and civil penalties
 
06:51:55.430 --> 06:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
from the federal fetal protection act
 
06:51:57.350 --> 06:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions for this
 
06:51:57.360 --> 06:51:59.750 align:start position:0%
thank you very much questions for this
Witness

06:51:59.750 --> 06:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:02.270 --> 06:52:02.280 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
06:52:04.730 --> 06:52:04.740 align:start position:0%
um uh Courtney Reed
 
06:52:21.368 --> 06:52:21.378 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:23.868 --> 06:52:23.878 align:start position:0%
thank you again chairman and members of
 
06:52:26.510 --> 06:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
the committee I just wanted to provide a
 
06:52:28.490 --> 06:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
brief statement of support on behalf of
 
06:52:30.708 --> 06:52:30.718 align:start position:0%
the American civil liberties Union for
 
06:52:33.948 --> 06:52:33.958 align:start position:0%
HB 224 which we've heard would repeal
 
06:52:35.690 --> 06:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
the criminal penalties from New
 
06:52:37.910 --> 06:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's current abortion ban
 
06:52:41.810 --> 06:52:41.820 align:start position:0%
I want to start off by making clear that
 
06:52:43.788 --> 06:52:43.798 align:start position:0%
abortion is health care and not a
 
06:52:45.410 --> 06:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
criminal activity and that
 
06:52:47.750 --> 06:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
criminalization of abortion result
 
06:52:51.770 --> 06:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
results in poor health outcomes abortion
 
06:52:53.510 --> 06:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
is an extremely safe component of
 
06:52:55.448 --> 06:52:55.458 align:start position:0%
comprehensive reproductive health care
 
06:52:59.270 --> 06:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
and medical societies like the American
 
06:53:01.490 --> 06:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
College of Obstetricians and
 
06:53:03.590 --> 06:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
gynecologists has expressed that
 
06:53:05.810 --> 06:53:05.820 align:start position:0%
abortion is an essential component of
 
06:53:07.150 --> 06:53:07.160 align:start position:0%
women's health care
 
06:53:10.310 --> 06:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
but moreover physician Advocates and
 
06:53:14.570 --> 06:53:14.580 align:start position:0%
medical ethics experts have noted that
 
06:53:17.208 --> 06:53:17.218 align:start position:0%
uh laws similar to the existing criminal
 
06:53:19.910 --> 06:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
penalties in New Hampshire often require
 
06:53:21.788 --> 06:53:21.798 align:start position:0%
Health Care Professionals to
 
06:53:24.890 --> 06:53:24.900 align:start position:0%
de-prioritize the pregnant individual or
 
06:53:26.150 --> 06:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
act in ways that might be medical
 
06:53:28.910 --> 06:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
medically harmful because instances
 
06:53:31.010 --> 06:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
where criminalization of abortion is
 
06:53:33.288 --> 06:53:33.298 align:start position:0%
only lifted for medical emergencies or
 
06:53:35.570 --> 06:53:35.580 align:start position:0%
risk of death these narrow definitions
 
06:53:37.730 --> 06:53:37.740 align:start position:0%
that are in current statute have been
 
06:53:40.010 --> 06:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
described as vague for Reproductive
 
06:53:42.650 --> 06:53:42.660 align:start position:0%
Health Care Providers to interpret which
 
06:53:44.150 --> 06:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
is often left Physicians feeling
 
06:53:47.030 --> 06:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
cornered into limiting care or requiring
 
06:53:49.968 --> 06:53:49.978 align:start position:0%
a continued deterioration of a mother's
 
06:53:52.490 --> 06:53:52.500 align:start position:0%
health before an abortion is deemed as
 
06:53:54.350 --> 06:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
medically necessary
 
06:53:56.690 --> 06:53:56.700 align:start position:0%
moreover imposing criminal penalties
 
06:53:58.910 --> 06:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
creates an unnecessary barrier to
 
06:54:01.490 --> 06:54:01.500 align:start position:0%
abortion access according to the Journal
 
06:54:03.770 --> 06:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
of Family Medicine laws that directly
 
06:54:05.330 --> 06:54:05.340 align:start position:0%
criminalize abortion providers
 
06:54:07.730 --> 06:54:07.740 align:start position:0%
discourages both capable providers and
 
06:54:10.070 --> 06:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
future clinicians from pursuing the
 
06:54:11.628 --> 06:54:11.638 align:start position:0%
practice of abortion care which we've
 
06:54:13.788 --> 06:54:13.798 align:start position:0%
heard in statements earlier today
 
06:54:16.810 --> 06:54:16.820 align:start position:0%
in fact in 2021 when the abortion care
 
06:54:19.128 --> 06:54:19.138 align:start position:0%
abortion ban was introduced we heard
 
06:54:21.948 --> 06:54:21.958 align:start position:0%
Physicians and medical doctors expressed
 
06:54:24.948 --> 06:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
that these criminal penalties evoke fear
 
06:54:26.510 --> 06:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
that they might not be able to offer the
 
06:54:29.750 --> 06:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
best care to their patients and it's
 
06:54:31.670 --> 06:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
already difficult to recruit Physicians
 
06:54:33.708 --> 06:54:33.718 align:start position:0%
and other practitioners in rural States
 
06:54:36.708 --> 06:54:36.718 align:start position:0%
like New Hampshire and in fact a recent
 
06:54:38.750 --> 06:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
study of pre-med students found that how
 
06:54:41.270 --> 06:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
States respond to rows overturn will
 
06:54:43.250 --> 06:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
significantly impact where they choose
 
06:54:44.990 --> 06:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
to attend medical school
 
06:54:47.030 --> 06:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
after the pandemic New Hampshire's
 
06:54:48.708 --> 06:54:48.718 align:start position:0%
primary care and health professional
 
06:54:50.208 --> 06:54:50.218 align:start position:0%
shortage has been deemed as
 
06:54:53.330 --> 06:54:53.340 align:start position:0%
catastrophically staffed and legislators
 
06:54:55.070 --> 06:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
should affect policy that attracts
 
06:54:56.510 --> 06:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
Health Care Providers to the Granite
 
06:54:58.670 --> 06:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
State not Inspire fear through
 
06:55:00.468 --> 06:55:00.478 align:start position:0%
criminalizing Health Care Services like
 
06:55:00.478 --> 06:55:02.030 align:start position:0%
criminalizing Health Care Services like
abortion

06:55:02.030 --> 06:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
06:55:03.948 --> 06:55:03.958 align:start position:0%
moreover the current law singles out
 
06:55:06.010 --> 06:55:06.020 align:start position:0%
qualified providers capable of
 
06:55:08.288 --> 06:55:08.298 align:start position:0%
Performing abortions later in pregnancy
 
06:55:10.548 --> 06:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
the criminalization of abortion
 
06:55:12.468 --> 06:55:12.478 align:start position:0%
providers represents one of many
 
06:55:14.750 --> 06:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
politically motivated tactics to further
 
06:55:17.030 --> 06:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
restrict access to abortion and these
 
06:55:19.128 --> 06:55:19.138 align:start position:0%
current penalties embolden individuals
 
06:55:20.990 --> 06:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
that seek to intimidate abortion
 
06:55:22.368 --> 06:55:22.378 align:start position:0%
providers further
 
06:55:24.770 --> 06:55:24.780 align:start position:0%
our law is a slippery slope and is an
 
06:55:26.690 --> 06:55:26.700 align:start position:0%
invitation for further harassment
 
06:55:28.490 --> 06:55:28.500 align:start position:0%
against these medical professionals and
 
06:55:30.948 --> 06:55:30.958 align:start position:0%
should be removed and lastly I'll leave
 
06:55:33.350 --> 06:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
it with uh polling data that's expressed
 
06:55:37.610 --> 06:55:37.620 align:start position:0%
in 2021 that 66 of granite Staters have
 
06:55:39.590 --> 06:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
shown support for keeping abortion legal
 
06:55:42.468 --> 06:55:42.478 align:start position:0%
in all or most cases so I encourage the
 
06:55:45.530 --> 06:55:45.540 align:start position:0%
committee to pass HB 224 and get rid of
 
06:55:48.770 --> 06:55:48.780 align:start position:0%
this ambiguity that obstructs quality
 
06:55:51.048 --> 06:55:51.058 align:start position:0%
Care thank you questions but excuse me
 
06:55:54.530 --> 06:55:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:58.910 --> 06:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:01.910 --> 06:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh are
 
06:56:03.770 --> 06:56:03.780 align:start position:0%
you aware that New Hampshire is a
 
06:56:05.208 --> 06:56:05.218 align:start position:0%
Dylan's real estate
 
06:56:07.368 --> 06:56:07.378 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry could you repeat that I said
 
06:56:09.288 --> 06:56:09.298 align:start position:0%
are you aware that New Hampshire is a
 
06:56:11.030 --> 06:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
Dylan's rule state
 
06:56:14.628 --> 06:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
uh no thank you oh you're not a lawyer
 
06:56:16.610 --> 06:56:16.620 align:start position:0%
I'm not a practicing attorney now all
 
06:56:19.310 --> 06:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
right well anyhow uh in a Dylan's real
 
06:56:21.590 --> 06:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
estate uh typically what is not
 
06:56:24.230 --> 06:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
permitted is prohibited
 
06:56:27.048 --> 06:56:27.058 align:start position:0%
which would mean that since uh
 
06:56:29.990 --> 06:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh you need to help I'm on the wrong
 
06:56:33.948 --> 06:56:33.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:36.650 --> 06:56:36.660 align:start position:0%
yes representative Stapleton
 
06:56:38.628 --> 06:56:38.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
06:56:40.968 --> 06:56:40.978 align:start position:0%
my question
 
06:56:43.250 --> 06:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
we back out the penalty
 
06:56:45.890 --> 06:56:45.900 align:start position:0%
in this law
 
06:56:50.510 --> 06:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
what kind of precedent does that set
 
06:56:54.110 --> 06:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
losing the penalty deterrent
 
06:56:56.390 --> 06:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
to other laws
 
06:56:59.090 --> 06:56:59.100 align:start position:0%
that protect some of the many people
 
06:57:01.610 --> 06:57:01.620 align:start position:0%
that your organization defends and
 
06:57:01.620 --> 06:57:04.430 align:start position:0%
that your organization defends and
supports

06:57:04.430 --> 06:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:06.708 --> 06:57:06.718 align:start position:0%
sorry I think I only got half of that
 
06:57:10.330 --> 06:57:10.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:13.310 --> 06:57:13.320 align:start position:0%
the question focuses on the precedent
 
06:57:17.690 --> 06:57:17.700 align:start position:0%
that we set by backing out penalty civil
 
06:57:20.570 --> 06:57:20.580 align:start position:0%
and criminal but especially Criminal
 
06:57:23.690 --> 06:57:23.700 align:start position:0%
from laws that we have widespread in our
 
06:57:25.070 --> 06:57:25.080 align:start position:0%
body of law
 
06:57:29.570 --> 06:57:29.580 align:start position:0%
that are enforced and protected by and a
 
06:57:32.390 --> 06:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
deterrent by by virtue of the penalties
 
06:57:34.730 --> 06:57:34.740 align:start position:0%
that are listed
 
06:57:37.368 --> 06:57:37.378 align:start position:0%
and thank you for your question uh the
 
06:57:39.948 --> 06:57:39.958 align:start position:0%
ACLU has taken a stance of supporting
 
06:57:41.868 --> 06:57:41.878 align:start position:0%
this law as the the medical community
 
06:57:44.270 --> 06:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
has noted that it's
 
06:57:46.850 --> 06:57:46.860 align:start position:0%
um its vagueness has often led to tough
 
06:57:48.830 --> 06:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
decisions that obstruct
 
06:57:51.468 --> 06:57:51.478 align:start position:0%
um their ability to best provide quality
 
06:57:52.968 --> 06:57:52.978 align:start position:0%
of care
 
06:57:54.650 --> 06:57:54.660 align:start position:0%
um and since I'm not a practicing
 
06:57:57.590 --> 06:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
attorney I'd love to correspond with you
 
06:57:59.150 --> 06:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
further and get the advice from our
 
06:58:00.830 --> 06:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
legal counsel that we do have
 
06:58:03.288 --> 06:58:03.298 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you other questions for
 
06:58:05.510 --> 06:58:05.520 align:start position:0%

06:58:18.770 --> 06:58:18.780 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Julia Stout
 
06:58:21.048 --> 06:58:21.058 align:start position:0%
I'm a resident and student from Sullivan
 
06:58:21.058 --> 06:58:22.190 align:start position:0%
I'm a resident and student from Sullivan
County

06:58:22.190 --> 06:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
County
 
06:58:24.830 --> 06:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill 224 which would repeal the
 
06:58:27.110 --> 06:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
Seminole criminal and civil penalties
 
06:58:29.448 --> 06:58:29.458 align:start position:0%
from the fetal Life protection act as a
 
06:58:32.090 --> 06:58:32.100 align:start position:0%
senseless bill which I strongly oppose
 
06:58:35.390 --> 06:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
section 329 46 of the fetal Life
 
06:58:37.070 --> 06:58:37.080 align:start position:0%
protection act which would be repealed
 
06:58:39.110 --> 06:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
by this bill says that any health care
 
06:58:41.150 --> 06:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
provider who knowingly performs an
 
06:58:43.548 --> 06:58:43.558 align:start position:0%
abortion after 24 weeks would be guilty
 
06:58:45.230 --> 06:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
of a class B felony
 
06:58:47.330 --> 06:58:47.340 align:start position:0%
what is the point of a law that is not
 
06:58:49.430 --> 06:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
upheld and the criminal penalty not
 
06:58:51.650 --> 06:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
enforced by our judicial system
 
06:58:53.570 --> 06:58:53.580 align:start position:0%
these so-called Health Care Providers
 
06:58:55.190 --> 06:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
which should more honestly be referred
 
06:58:57.530 --> 06:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
to as abortionists are not providing
 
06:58:59.330 --> 06:58:59.340 align:start position:0%
necessary and life-saving treatments to
 
06:59:01.610 --> 06:59:01.620 align:start position:0%
pregnant women rather they are taking
 
06:59:03.288 --> 06:59:03.298 align:start position:0%
innocent lives and putting pregnant
 
06:59:04.968 --> 06:59:04.978 align:start position:0%
women at risk of serious health
 
06:59:04.978 --> 06:59:06.530 align:start position:0%
women at risk of serious health
complications

06:59:06.530 --> 06:59:06.540 align:start position:0%
complications
 
06:59:08.750 --> 06:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
these abortionists many of whom are
 
06:59:10.490 --> 06:59:10.500 align:start position:0%
working in facilities with a specific
 
06:59:12.770 --> 06:59:12.780 align:start position:0%
purpose of Performing abortions should
 
06:59:14.570 --> 06:59:14.580 align:start position:0%
be held to the same standards of the law
 
06:59:16.730 --> 06:59:16.740 align:start position:0%
and its penalties as any other criminal
 
06:59:16.740 --> 06:59:17.990 align:start position:0%
and its penalties as any other criminal
would

06:59:17.990 --> 06:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:59:20.270 --> 06:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
not only do these abortionists totally
 
06:59:22.368 --> 06:59:22.378 align:start position:0%
violate a human being's dignity and
 
06:59:24.590 --> 06:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
unalienable right to life by performing
 
06:59:27.230 --> 06:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
an abortion but by doing So after 24
 
06:59:29.750 --> 06:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
weeks gestation they are also in
 
06:59:31.430 --> 06:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
violation of the fetal Life protection
 
06:59:31.440 --> 06:59:32.448 align:start position:0%
violation of the fetal Life protection
act

06:59:32.448 --> 06:59:32.458 align:start position:0%
act
 
06:59:34.490 --> 06:59:34.500 align:start position:0%
these abortionists should be prosecuted
 
06:59:36.110 --> 06:59:36.120 align:start position:0%
to the full extent of the law and in
 
06:59:38.750 --> 06:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
order for that to happen House Bill 224
 
06:59:40.968 --> 06:59:40.978 align:start position:0%
must be voted down
 
06:59:44.930 --> 06:59:44.940 align:start position:0%

of the question

of the question
Michael

07:00:18.288 --> 07:00:18.298 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:20.090 --> 07:00:20.100 align:start position:0%
it's issue right here
 
07:00:20.100 --> 07:00:31.910 align:start position:0%
it's issue right here
foreign

07:00:31.910 --> 07:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:31.920 --> 07:00:35.208 align:start position:0%
 
okay

07:00:35.208 --> 07:00:35.218 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:37.930 --> 07:00:37.940 align:start position:0%
you you stated some relatively strong
 
07:00:40.810 --> 07:00:40.820 align:start position:0%
reasons for for getting rid of the bill
 
07:00:44.510 --> 07:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh particularly in its current form see
 
07:00:46.730 --> 07:00:46.740 align:start position:0%
a lot of those are based on the fact
 
07:00:51.230 --> 07:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
that many of the of the penalties or the
 
07:00:55.250 --> 07:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
injuries done were done in in the
 
07:00:59.030 --> 07:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
background or wherever uh but they were
 
07:01:01.368 --> 07:01:01.378 align:start position:0%
done by the the
 
07:01:01.378 --> 07:01:02.690 align:start position:0%
done by the the
well

07:01:02.690 --> 07:01:02.700 align:start position:0%
well
 
07:01:06.170 --> 07:01:06.180 align:start position:0%
very good doctors but they seem to be
 
07:01:09.048 --> 07:01:09.058 align:start position:0%
all the general kinds of things do you
 
07:01:11.270 --> 07:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
have the facts on those you know some
 
07:01:13.670 --> 07:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
written facts of of how many of each of
 
07:01:15.650 --> 07:01:15.660 align:start position:0%
those and what you're basing your
 
07:01:17.810 --> 07:01:17.820 align:start position:0%
argument on
 
07:01:19.190 --> 07:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if I'm understanding it
 
07:01:21.288 --> 07:01:21.298 align:start position:0%
correctly but I don't have any data
 
07:01:23.510 --> 07:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
statistics with me today to present to
 
07:01:24.830 --> 07:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
you all
 
07:01:28.310 --> 07:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
um I do know that any abortion that
 
07:01:30.890 --> 07:01:30.900 align:start position:0%
takes place after 24 weeks or that is in
 
07:01:32.868 --> 07:01:32.878 align:start position:0%
violation of the fetal Life protection
 
07:01:35.930 --> 07:01:35.940 align:start position:0%
act which would go against
 
07:01:35.940 --> 07:01:36.468 align:start position:0%
act which would go against
um

07:01:36.468 --> 07:01:36.478 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:01:39.410 --> 07:01:39.420 align:start position:0%
the life of the mother or uh fetal
 
07:01:41.930 --> 07:01:41.940 align:start position:0%
abnormalities I believe
 
07:01:44.810 --> 07:01:44.820 align:start position:0%
any abortion that takes place against
 
07:01:49.190 --> 07:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
those protections is wrong but do you
 
07:01:52.190 --> 07:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
have any exact cases of it do you uh
 
07:01:54.708 --> 07:01:54.718 align:start position:0%
yeah I I hear that the wording and so on
 
07:01:57.530 --> 07:01:57.540 align:start position:0%
the generalities but I I'm not sure if
 
07:02:00.110 --> 07:02:00.120 align:start position:0%
those are those are facts taken from
 
07:02:02.750 --> 07:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
cases that you read about or if they're
 
07:02:05.690 --> 07:02:05.700 align:start position:0%
just generalities
 
07:02:07.788 --> 07:02:07.798 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure which specific part you're
 
07:02:10.730 --> 07:02:10.740 align:start position:0%
referring to I know that
 
07:02:10.740 --> 07:02:12.890 align:start position:0%
referring to I know that
um

07:02:12.890 --> 07:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:16.250 --> 07:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
07:02:20.090 --> 07:02:20.100 align:start position:0%
any uh any abortion that is like I said
 
07:02:22.850 --> 07:02:22.860 align:start position:0%
performed against after the 24 weeks
 
07:02:25.670 --> 07:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
gestation would be
 
07:02:28.070 --> 07:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
and against the um
 
07:02:31.788 --> 07:02:31.798 align:start position:0%
life of the mother I know that would be
 
07:02:34.788 --> 07:02:34.798 align:start position:0%
yeah against the criminals do you have a
 
07:02:38.270 --> 07:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
case about an abortion that took place
 
07:02:41.510 --> 07:02:41.520 align:start position:0%

07:03:03.830 --> 07:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
I do not believe that
 
07:03:07.070 --> 07:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
the intentional killing of a pre-born
 
07:03:11.570 --> 07:03:11.580 align:start position:0%
child uh is Healthcare no

07:04:50.390 --> 07:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
so having said that and I'm just
 
07:04:53.570 --> 07:04:53.580 align:start position:0%
speaking now in general terms of why we
 
07:04:55.788 --> 07:04:55.798 align:start position:0%
in our society
 
07:04:58.310 --> 07:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
as as individuals
 
07:05:01.030 --> 07:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
we can't we do we have a responsibility
 
07:05:03.288 --> 07:05:03.298 align:start position:0%
to act
 
07:05:05.930 --> 07:05:05.940 align:start position:0%
you know with common sense
 
07:05:05.940 --> 07:05:07.310 align:start position:0%
you know with common sense
so

07:05:07.310 --> 07:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:05:09.410 --> 07:05:09.420 align:start position:0%
and and
 
07:05:11.628 --> 07:05:11.638 align:start position:0%
all men are they be treated equally
 
07:05:15.048 --> 07:05:15.058 align:start position:0%
under our Law And Men include men and
 
07:05:15.058 --> 07:05:16.730 align:start position:0%
under our Law And Men include men and
women

07:05:16.730 --> 07:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
women
 
07:05:20.330 --> 07:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
but there but these laws and penalties
 
07:05:22.490 --> 07:05:22.500 align:start position:0%
on the book but there are laws and
 
07:05:25.368 --> 07:05:25.378 align:start position:0%
penalties on the books now
 
07:05:27.410 --> 07:05:27.420 align:start position:0%
that we're not there
 
07:05:31.448 --> 07:05:31.458 align:start position:0%
20 years ago 30 years ago
 
07:05:31.458 --> 07:05:33.170 align:start position:0%
20 years ago 30 years ago
unfortunately

07:05:33.170 --> 07:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
07:05:36.530 --> 07:05:36.540 align:start position:0%
because some people in our society
 
07:05:41.270 --> 07:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
do not know how to act with common sense
 
07:05:45.230 --> 07:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
and try to do what is right
 
07:05:48.948 --> 07:05:48.958 align:start position:0%
so there are penalties that must be
 
07:05:48.958 --> 07:05:50.990 align:start position:0%
so there are penalties that must be
retained

07:05:50.990 --> 07:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
retained
 
07:05:53.990 --> 07:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh in order to remind people
 
07:05:54.000 --> 07:05:56.150 align:start position:0%
uh in order to remind people
uh

07:05:56.150 --> 07:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
07:05:58.850 --> 07:05:58.860 align:start position:0%
who may not believe that what they are
 
07:06:00.530 --> 07:06:00.540 align:start position:0%
doing is wrong
 
07:06:04.190 --> 07:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
so we kind of need to retain these
 
07:06:09.250 --> 07:06:09.260 align:start position:0%
subjects uh under the penalties of Law
 
07:06:13.610 --> 07:06:13.620 align:start position:0%
and criminal and civil I believe are
 
07:06:14.770 --> 07:06:14.780 align:start position:0%
part of that
 
07:06:18.708 --> 07:06:18.718 align:start position:0%
accordingly I oppose and I ask all of
 
07:06:20.690 --> 07:06:20.700 align:start position:0%

a totally unrestrictive abortion law
 
07:11:00.350 --> 07:11:00.360 align:start position:0%

07:11:56.890 --> 07:11:56.900 align:start position:0%
abortion at 23 weeks with my testimony
 
07:11:59.510 --> 07:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
which is just a week before the fetal
 
07:12:02.150 --> 07:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
Life protection act kicks in
 
07:12:02.160 --> 07:12:03.650 align:start position:0%
Life protection act kicks in
and

07:12:03.650 --> 07:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
and
 
07:12:05.990 --> 07:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking again because I fear some
 
07:12:07.910 --> 07:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
members of this committee and of our
 
07:12:09.890 --> 07:12:09.900 align:start position:0%
legislature believe that voting for
 
07:12:12.048 --> 07:12:12.058 align:start position:0%
repealing the legal and civil penalties
 
07:12:14.628 --> 07:12:14.638 align:start position:0%
for performing a gruesome late-term
 
07:12:14.638 --> 07:12:15.890 align:start position:0%
for performing a gruesome late-term
abortion

07:12:15.890 --> 07:12:15.900 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
07:12:18.230 --> 07:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
would give them cover against being
 
07:12:20.570 --> 07:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
accused of supporting abortion up until
 
07:12:22.788 --> 07:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
the moment of birth
 
07:12:25.250 --> 07:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
Governor sununu has made it clear that
 
07:12:27.110 --> 07:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
he believes that if he signs this bill
 
07:12:29.150 --> 07:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
into law that he can use this as a fig
 
07:12:32.090 --> 07:12:32.100 align:start position:0%
leaf in order to not be branded as an
 
07:12:34.128 --> 07:12:34.138 align:start position:0%
abortioned extremist good luck with that
 
07:12:36.650 --> 07:12:36.660 align:start position:0%
in the presidential primary
 
07:12:40.250 --> 07:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
no one's fooled by that
 
07:12:42.890 --> 07:12:42.900 align:start position:0%
if they're no legal penalties then
 
07:12:44.810 --> 07:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
everyone knows there is no protection at
 
07:12:47.090 --> 07:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
all for babies from being killed in a
 
07:12:49.610 --> 07:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
late term abortion it's common sense
 
07:12:51.170 --> 07:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
there would be nothing to protect
 
07:12:53.090 --> 07:12:53.100 align:start position:0%
prevent doctors from performing the
 
07:12:55.670 --> 07:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
procedure and I'm even more suspicious
 
07:12:57.730 --> 07:12:57.740 align:start position:0%
now that I've heard that they're
 
07:13:00.170 --> 07:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
representative Wills proposed this
 
07:13:03.250 --> 07:13:03.260 align:start position:0%
saying that we could put in other other
 
07:13:05.570 --> 07:13:05.580 align:start position:0%
penalties but they didn't he didn't
 
07:13:07.548 --> 07:13:07.558 align:start position:0%
include them in the bill the bill was
 
07:13:09.410 --> 07:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
fatally flawed right off the bat remove
 
07:13:11.930 --> 07:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
all the penalties but nothing in its
 
07:13:11.940 --> 07:13:13.850 align:start position:0%
all the penalties but nothing in its
place

07:13:13.850 --> 07:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
place
 
07:13:16.070 --> 07:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
moms and babies and abortion workers
 
07:13:17.510 --> 07:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
would continue to suffer from this
 
07:13:20.090 --> 07:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
gruesome multi-day procedure which
 
07:13:22.490 --> 07:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
cannot be used to save the life of a
 
07:13:24.650 --> 07:13:24.660 align:start position:0%
mother or save the health of a mother in
 
07:13:27.110 --> 07:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
an emergency medical situation because
 
07:13:31.070 --> 07:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
it takes multiple days to complete
 
07:13:33.048 --> 07:13:33.058 align:start position:0%
and it's traumatic for the abortion
 
07:13:35.208 --> 07:13:35.218 align:start position:0%
workers as I detailed in my testimony
 
07:13:37.250 --> 07:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
07:13:39.590 --> 07:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
I'll end with a quote from Frederica
 
07:13:41.810 --> 07:13:41.820 align:start position:0%
Matthews Green the problem is that it's
 
07:13:44.090 --> 07:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
a baby winds up in dead like deadlock
 
07:13:45.890 --> 07:13:45.900 align:start position:0%
with it's a woman's right
 
07:13:47.868 --> 07:13:47.878 align:start position:0%
the two statements do not refute each
 
07:13:49.968 --> 07:13:49.978 align:start position:0%
other so no resolution is possible
 
07:13:52.788 --> 07:13:52.798 align:start position:0%
what's more they continue a pernicious
 
07:13:55.430 --> 07:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
fallacy that deadly conflict between
 
07:13:57.650 --> 07:13:57.660 align:start position:0%
women and children is a normal State of
 
07:13:57.660 --> 07:13:58.670 align:start position:0%
women and children is a normal State of
Affairs

07:13:58.670 --> 07:13:58.680 align:start position:0%

07:14:01.490 --> 07:14:01.500 align:start position:0%
in no seen country are women and their
 
07:14:03.288 --> 07:14:03.298 align:start position:0%
own children assumed to be mortal
 
07:14:03.298 --> 07:14:04.250 align:start position:0%

07:14:06.770 --> 07:14:06.780 align:start position:0%
any culture that does so is slowly
 
07:14:08.510 --> 07:14:08.520 align:start position:0%
committing suicide
 
07:14:11.090 --> 07:14:11.100 align:start position:0%
when we accept as normal The Ripping of
 
07:14:13.610 --> 07:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
a child from her mother's womb we
 
07:14:16.310 --> 07:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
violate something disturbingly close to
 
07:14:19.010 --> 07:14:19.020 align:start position:0%
the heart of the human story in the land
 
07:14:21.048 --> 07:14:21.058 align:start position:0%
where women kill their unborn children
 
07:14:24.288 --> 07:14:24.298 align:start position:0%
every lesser love grows for you
 
07:14:27.048 --> 07:14:27.058 align:start position:0%
please vote itia in expedient to
 
07:14:30.830 --> 07:14:30.840 align:start position:0%

babies from a gruesome death and their
 
07:14:35.030 --> 07:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
mothers from physical harm and the
 
07:14:36.770 --> 07:14:36.780 align:start position:0%
abortion workers from the serious mental
 
07:14:39.170 --> 07:14:39.180 align:start position:0%
health repercussions of participating in
 
07:14:41.750 --> 07:14:41.760 align:start position:0%

Stuart
 
07:15:01.250 --> 07:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
07:15:03.530 --> 07:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
committee again I'm Ian Hewitt general
 
07:15:06.650 --> 07:15:06.660 align:start position:0%
counsel at Cornerstone in opposition to
 
07:15:10.070 --> 07:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
house bill 224. I will not repeat myself
 
07:15:12.110 --> 07:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
unless there are any questions which
 
07:15:13.910 --> 07:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
overlap with anything I spoke about
 
07:15:16.910 --> 07:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
before which I would welcome I will just
 
07:15:20.868 --> 07:15:20.878 align:start position:0%
raise two points one is that because our
 
07:15:23.510 --> 07:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
law in New Hampshire already allows the
 
07:15:25.968 --> 07:15:25.978 align:start position:0%
killing of viable children before six
 
07:15:28.548 --> 07:15:28.558 align:start position:0%
months and because there's an exception
 
07:15:31.010 --> 07:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
after six months for fatal fetal
 
07:15:34.250 --> 07:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
anomalies the only children whose deaths
 
07:15:36.410 --> 07:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
would be authorized by this bill are
 
07:15:38.690 --> 07:15:38.700 align:start position:0%
children older than six months who are
 
07:15:41.570 --> 07:15:41.580 align:start position:0%
viable that is children who could have
 
07:15:44.150 --> 07:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
been induced and delivered on the day
 
07:15:46.610 --> 07:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
that they were aborted instead of being
 
07:15:49.850 --> 07:15:49.860 align:start position:0%
killed and would have lived children a
 
07:15:52.730 --> 07:15:52.740 align:start position:0%
lot like the children whose five corpses
 
07:15:55.670 --> 07:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
were discovered in Washington D.C last
 
07:15:59.330 --> 07:15:59.340 align:start position:0%
year where five star upscale abortion
 
07:16:02.468 --> 07:16:02.478 align:start position:0%
clinic like the DuPont Clinic advertise
 
07:16:05.208 --> 07:16:05.218 align:start position:0%
explicitly on their website that they
 
07:16:08.150 --> 07:16:08.160 align:start position:0%
will perform abortions after 26 weeks
 
07:16:11.628 --> 07:16:11.638 align:start position:0%
when there are no fetal anomalies
 
07:16:13.610 --> 07:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
the second point that I'll raise is that
 
07:16:16.490 --> 07:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
I have seen a number of statutes that
 
07:16:18.110 --> 07:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
have no penalties and are purely
 
07:16:20.628 --> 07:16:20.638 align:start position:0%
symbolic that refer to what the general
 
07:16:24.230 --> 07:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
court will do or what an agency will do
 
07:16:26.990 --> 07:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
but I have never seen in New Hampshire a
 
07:16:29.330 --> 07:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
statute that falsely purports to
 
07:16:32.270 --> 07:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
prescribe what citizens will do and I
 
07:16:33.708 --> 07:16:33.718 align:start position:0%
think I haven't seen that because a
 
07:16:35.448 --> 07:16:35.458 align:start position:0%
statute like the one that this bill
 
07:16:38.448 --> 07:16:38.458 align:start position:0%
would create would be alien to the idea
 
07:16:40.968 --> 07:16:40.978 align:start position:0%
of the rule of law we have always said
 
07:16:43.610 --> 07:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
that we and our supporters prefer a bill
 
07:16:47.208 --> 07:16:47.218 align:start position:0%
like House Bill 271 to a bill like this
 
07:16:49.490 --> 07:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
one for reasons of clarity of
 
07:16:51.708 --> 07:16:51.718 align:start position:0%
transparency and ultimately for reasons
 
07:16:53.570 --> 07:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
of life because of the deceptive effect
 
07:16:56.330 --> 07:16:56.340 align:start position:0%
that a bill like this would have
 
07:16:58.310 --> 07:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
relatedly I think there might be a
 
07:17:01.250 --> 07:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
drafting error in this bill it does not
 
07:17:04.788 --> 07:17:04.798 align:start position:0%
remove the class B felony penalties from
 
07:17:04.798 --> 07:17:06.010 align:start position:0%
remove the class B felony penalties from
RSA

07:17:06.010 --> 07:17:06.020 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
07:17:09.230 --> 07:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
329-36 so under the bill in front of you
 
07:17:11.990 --> 07:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
a provider if he removed a child child
 
07:17:14.570 --> 07:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
six months or older in pieces he would
 
07:17:16.730 --> 07:17:16.740 align:start position:0%
face not so much as a parking ticket but
 
07:17:19.010 --> 07:17:19.020 align:start position:0%
if he opted to move remove it more
 
07:17:21.410 --> 07:17:21.420 align:start position:0%
quickly as intact as possible than under
 
07:17:24.590 --> 07:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
section 36 he would be a Class B felon
 
07:17:26.570 --> 07:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
in which I think in which case I think
 
07:17:28.430 --> 07:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
some abortion providers might be in for
 
07:17:30.948 --> 07:17:30.958 align:start position:0%
a surprise thank you and I'd be happy to
 
07:17:33.708 --> 07:17:33.718 align:start position:0%
answer any legal questions about our law
 
07:17:35.990 --> 07:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
or abortion law generally yes
 
07:17:38.390 --> 07:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
07:17:40.850 --> 07:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
thank you good afternoon I wonder if you
 
07:17:44.090 --> 07:17:44.100 align:start position:0%
could help the committee by providing us
 
07:17:47.270 --> 07:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
with written documentation of the ad
 
07:17:49.628 --> 07:17:49.638 align:start position:0%
that you
 
07:17:53.030 --> 07:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
described about New Hampshire
 
07:17:53.040 --> 07:17:54.070 align:start position:0%
described about New Hampshire
um

07:17:54.070 --> 07:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:17:56.810 --> 07:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
offices that offer
 
07:17:56.820 --> 07:17:58.010 align:start position:0%
offices that offer
um

07:17:58.010 --> 07:17:58.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:17:58.020 --> 07:17:59.810 align:start position:0%
um
abortions

07:17:59.810 --> 07:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
abortions
 
07:18:01.610 --> 07:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
I believe you're referring to the part
 
07:18:03.730 --> 07:18:03.740 align:start position:0%
of my testimony where I talked about
 
07:18:06.288 --> 07:18:06.298 align:start position:0%
corpses of full-term children being
 
07:18:08.448 --> 07:18:08.458 align:start position:0%
recovered in Washington DC and then I
 
07:18:10.250 --> 07:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
referred to the fact that abortion
 
07:18:12.590 --> 07:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
clinics there where there are no limits
 
07:18:15.350 --> 07:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
on abortion explicitly say that even if
 
07:18:17.030 --> 07:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
there are no fetal anomalies on their
 
07:18:19.548 --> 07:18:19.558 align:start position:0%
own websites they will perform abortions
 
07:18:24.110 --> 07:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
after 26 weeks I described Washington DC
 
07:18:26.330 --> 07:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
as an as an example of what we might
 
07:18:28.910 --> 07:18:28.920 align:start position:0%
look like if we explicitly allowed a
 
07:18:30.948 --> 07:18:30.958 align:start position:0%
legal abortion thank you for clarifying
 
07:18:33.468 --> 07:18:33.478 align:start position:0%
so none of that refers at all to what
 
07:18:36.288 --> 07:18:36.298 align:start position:0%
happens in our state none of that refers
 
07:18:38.510 --> 07:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
to thank you very much that has happened
 
07:18:40.250 --> 07:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
in our state where no statistics are
 
07:18:41.690 --> 07:18:41.700 align:start position:0%
collected on what abortions are
 
07:18:43.730 --> 07:18:43.740 align:start position:0%
performed all right thank you any other
 
07:18:46.910 --> 07:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
questions oops uh representative correct
 
07:18:48.890 --> 07:18:48.900 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
07:18:53.750 --> 07:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
if we eliminate civil penalties from
 
07:18:57.890 --> 07:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
this statue will that eliminate section
 
07:18:57.900 --> 07:18:59.990 align:start position:0%
this statue will that eliminate section
329

07:18:59.990 --> 07:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
329
 
07:19:04.430 --> 07:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
47 which states simult civil remedies
 
07:19:07.730 --> 07:19:07.740 align:start position:0%
the woman comma the father of the fetus
 
07:19:09.708 --> 07:19:09.718 align:start position:0%
if married to the mother at the time she
 
07:19:11.690 --> 07:19:11.700 align:start position:0%
receives an abortion in violation of
 
07:19:14.930 --> 07:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
this subdivision comma and or if the
 
07:19:17.810 --> 07:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
mother has not attained the age of 18 at
 
07:19:20.448 --> 07:19:20.458 align:start position:0%
the time of the abortion comma the
 
07:19:23.570 --> 07:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
maternal grandparents of the fetus May
 
07:19:26.570 --> 07:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
in civil action obtain appropriate
 
07:19:29.510 --> 07:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
relief relief unless the pregnancy
 
07:19:31.968 --> 07:19:31.978 align:start position:0%
resulted from the plaintiff's criminal
 
07:19:35.830 --> 07:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
conduct or if brought by the maternal
 
07:19:38.330 --> 07:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
grandparents and maternal grandparents
 
07:19:40.190 --> 07:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
consent to the abortion
 
07:19:42.830 --> 07:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
such relief shall include monetary
 
07:19:44.930 --> 07:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
damages for all physical
 
07:19:47.570 --> 07:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
psychological and physical causes by the
 
07:19:50.750 --> 07:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
violation of this substitution
 
07:19:52.850 --> 07:19:52.860 align:start position:0%
would this
 
07:19:56.448 --> 07:19:56.458 align:start position:0%
new house bill eliminate that
 
07:19:58.968 --> 07:19:58.978 align:start position:0%
possibility if it because it's con
 
07:20:01.628 --> 07:20:01.638 align:start position:0%
because it has the word civil penalties
 
07:20:04.190 --> 07:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
well not only does it say that it
 
07:20:05.810 --> 07:20:05.820 align:start position:0%
removes civil and criminal penalties but
 
07:20:07.190 --> 07:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
if you look at the text of the bill it
 
07:20:08.868 --> 07:20:08.878 align:start position:0%
removes that section you're referring to
 
07:20:11.330 --> 07:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
47 so it removes the class B felony
 
07:20:14.930 --> 07:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
penalties in 46 the Civil penalties in
 
07:20:18.170 --> 07:20:18.180 align:start position:0%
47 it does not remove the class B felony
 
07:20:21.048 --> 07:20:21.058 align:start position:0%
penalties in 36 which is the section I
 
07:20:23.750 --> 07:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
referred to a moment ago okay so there
 
07:20:27.670 --> 07:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
would be no ability for a civil penalty
 
07:20:30.948 --> 07:20:30.958 align:start position:0%
for them the mother the Father the
 
07:20:32.810 --> 07:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
whatever the grandparents okay thank you
 
07:20:34.788 --> 07:20:34.798 align:start position:0%
it would entirely nullify our current
 
07:20:37.250 --> 07:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
law and allow abortion at any time for
 
07:20:39.170 --> 07:20:39.180 align:start position:0%
any or no reason okay
 
07:20:41.090 --> 07:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:20:45.110 --> 07:20:45.120 align:start position:0%

my husband's life yet their lives were

nearly destroyed by their birth mom at
 
07:21:34.250 --> 07:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
some time after 20 weeks I don't know
 
07:21:37.490 --> 07:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
exactly what um what week she went in
 
07:21:38.810 --> 07:21:38.820 align:start position:0%
um when she walked into Planned
 
07:21:40.548 --> 07:21:40.558 align:start position:0%
Parenthood with the intent to end their
 
07:21:42.708 --> 07:21:42.718 align:start position:0%
lives once at her appointment by the
 
07:21:45.830 --> 07:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
grace of God she decided that she could
 
07:21:49.070 --> 07:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
not murder these little guys and our
 
07:21:52.250 --> 07:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
family is so blessed because of that she
 
07:21:54.350 --> 07:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
stood there in that in that Planned
 
07:21:54.360 --> 07:21:55.548 align:start position:0%
stood there in that in that Planned
Parenthood

07:21:55.548 --> 07:21:55.558 align:start position:0%
Parenthood
 
07:21:58.430 --> 07:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
um room recognizing that these lives
 
07:22:00.410 --> 07:22:00.420 align:start position:0%
were inside of her these lies that at
 
07:22:02.868 --> 07:22:02.878 align:start position:0%
Beyond 20 weeks already had fully
 
07:22:04.610 --> 07:22:04.620 align:start position:0%
developed bones
 
07:22:07.070 --> 07:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
um eyes eyelids a heart that was pumping
 
07:22:10.610 --> 07:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
blood kidneys and other organs that were
 
07:22:13.070 --> 07:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
pumping urine through their bodies teeth
 
07:22:15.948 --> 07:22:15.958 align:start position:0%
buds beginning to develop and stuff like
 
07:22:15.958 --> 07:22:17.208 align:start position:0%
buds beginning to develop and stuff like
that

07:22:17.208 --> 07:22:17.218 align:start position:0%
that
 
07:22:19.368 --> 07:22:19.378 align:start position:0%
um they also knew that they that these
 
07:22:21.288 --> 07:22:21.298 align:start position:0%
that they had gender that they were boys
 
07:22:23.750 --> 07:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
that they were identical boys and these
 
07:22:25.850 --> 07:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
are our boys now
 
07:22:25.860 --> 07:22:26.868 align:start position:0%
are our boys now
um

07:22:26.868 --> 07:22:26.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:22:29.208 --> 07:22:29.218 align:start position:0%
our boys who lit whose lives would have
 
07:22:30.770 --> 07:22:30.780 align:start position:0%
otherwise been ended by the state's
 
07:22:32.990 --> 07:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
abhorrent laws that at that time allowed
 
07:22:34.788 --> 07:22:34.798 align:start position:0%
for the legal murder of babies human
 
07:22:37.070 --> 07:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
lives inside the wombs
 
07:22:37.080 --> 07:22:37.730 align:start position:0%
lives inside the wombs
um

07:22:37.730 --> 07:22:37.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:22:41.030 --> 07:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
not by worse their lives were saved not
 
07:22:43.128 --> 07:22:43.138 align:start position:0%
only not by moral consciousness of those
 
07:22:44.628 --> 07:22:44.638 align:start position:0%
who were elected to protect those babies
 
07:22:46.490 --> 07:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
but by the birth mom who intuitively
 
07:22:48.288 --> 07:22:48.298 align:start position:0%
knew that those lives growing inside of
 
07:22:51.170 --> 07:22:51.180 align:start position:0%
her were in fact human lives listen I've
 
07:22:52.968 --> 07:22:52.978 align:start position:0%
been here and I've listened to some of
 
07:22:56.510 --> 07:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
the testimony and I I have sympathy I
 
07:22:59.810 --> 07:22:59.820 align:start position:0%
was gang raped at 13. I can stand behind
 
07:23:04.010 --> 07:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
still at rape I went through my first
 
07:23:05.990 --> 07:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
pregnancy and got preeclampsia I heard
 
07:23:07.968 --> 07:23:07.978 align:start position:0%
an earlier testimony and I was extremely
 
07:23:10.548 --> 07:23:10.558 align:start position:0%
sick delivering my first child my liver
 
07:23:13.190 --> 07:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
and kidneys started to fail but all
 
07:23:14.628 --> 07:23:14.638 align:start position:0%
along the line
 
07:23:17.690 --> 07:23:17.700 align:start position:0%
these are human lives we have to
 
07:23:20.448 --> 07:23:20.458 align:start position:0%
understand what abortion is it isn't
 
07:23:23.030 --> 07:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
just a health care issue it is a life
 
07:23:25.368 --> 07:23:25.378 align:start position:0%
inside of another human being that is
 
07:23:27.948 --> 07:23:27.958 align:start position:0%
growing it is a life that has its own
 
07:23:30.410 --> 07:23:30.420 align:start position:0%
perfect DNA from the time of conception
 
07:23:32.690 --> 07:23:32.700 align:start position:0%
it is a life that has its own perfect
 
07:23:35.750 --> 07:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
fingerprints unique fingerprints from a
 
07:23:38.570 --> 07:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
very early age gestationally when we
 
07:23:40.490 --> 07:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
understand what abortion truly is we
 
07:23:42.890 --> 07:23:42.900 align:start position:0%
can't just then turn around and say it's
 
07:23:44.948 --> 07:23:44.958 align:start position:0%
okay to just murder those lies because
 
07:23:48.590 --> 07:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
whatever reason like their birth family
 
07:23:51.468 --> 07:23:51.478 align:start position:0%
a married couple they were super
 
07:23:54.128 --> 07:23:54.138 align:start position:0%
financially in in in
 
07:23:57.230 --> 07:23:57.240 align:start position:0%
a very tight spot financially
 
07:23:59.448 --> 07:23:59.458 align:start position:0%
and they understood that and they
 
07:24:01.430 --> 07:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
recognized that the risk to having these
 
07:24:02.990 --> 07:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
little guys would have been you know
 
07:24:05.208 --> 07:24:05.218 align:start position:0%
detrimental to their marriage they made
 
07:24:06.590 --> 07:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
that plan they went into Planned
 
07:24:09.230 --> 07:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
Parenthood but ultimately she knew that
 
07:24:11.510 --> 07:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
that was not okay
 
07:24:11.520 --> 07:24:12.708 align:start position:0%
that was not okay
so

07:24:12.708 --> 07:24:12.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
07:24:15.890 --> 07:24:15.900 align:start position:0%
the the argument that
 
07:24:18.590 --> 07:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
um that there are situations right when
 
07:24:20.810 --> 07:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
I was raped at 13 I could have become
 
07:24:20.820 --> 07:24:21.830 align:start position:0%
I was raped at 13 I could have become
pregnant

07:24:21.830 --> 07:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
pregnant
 
07:24:25.368 --> 07:24:25.378 align:start position:0%
and that would have been horrible at 13.
 
07:24:27.468 --> 07:24:27.478 align:start position:0%
but that still would have been a human
 
07:24:30.350 --> 07:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
being inside of me I've lived through so
 
07:24:32.690 --> 07:24:32.700 align:start position:0%
many of these examples that are given
 
07:24:34.788 --> 07:24:34.798 align:start position:0%
and I still would have chosen light for
 
07:24:36.708 --> 07:24:36.718 align:start position:0%
every single one of them
 
07:24:39.048 --> 07:24:39.058 align:start position:0%
so we as a state must protect these
 
07:24:41.448 --> 07:24:41.458 align:start position:0%
babies from the atrocities and voting in
 
07:24:43.850 --> 07:24:43.860 align:start position:0%
favor of House Bill 224 would gut a bill
 
07:24:45.650 --> 07:24:45.660 align:start position:0%
that finally outlawed these barbaric
 
07:24:47.090 --> 07:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
measures on a baby that can fully
 
07:24:49.490 --> 07:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
survive outside of a mother's womb we
 
07:24:51.830 --> 07:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
must recognize the truth I urge you to
 
07:24:54.468 --> 07:24:54.478 align:start position:0%
vote in opposition of House Bill 224 and
 
07:24:56.868 --> 07:24:56.878 align:start position:0%
vote for the wise and babies children
 
07:24:59.570 --> 07:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
humans that all have a right to live and
 
07:25:01.670 --> 07:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
have a life ready to be lived whether
 
07:25:04.070 --> 07:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
that's through birth moms or an adoptive
 
07:25:06.948 --> 07:25:06.958 align:start position:0%
family like ours there are choices we
 
07:25:09.770 --> 07:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
argue that this is about choice but
 
07:25:12.770 --> 07:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
there are choices the choice can be
 
07:25:16.128 --> 07:25:16.138 align:start position:0%
adoption and we as a family are so
 
07:25:18.650 --> 07:25:18.660 align:start position:0%
blessed because that mother chose life
 
07:25:20.930 --> 07:25:20.940 align:start position:0%
for these two little guys
 
07:25:24.830 --> 07:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
we're so blessed so um their lives
 
07:25:28.128 --> 07:25:28.138 align:start position:0%
matter to us and uh to this planet to
 
07:25:30.170 --> 07:25:30.180 align:start position:0%
the Future their lives matter and so do
 
07:25:31.730 --> 07:25:31.740 align:start position:0%
the thousands of lies that can be saved
 
07:25:33.468 --> 07:25:33.478 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire by your vote in
 
07:25:36.830 --> 07:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
opposition of House Bill 224 I don't
 
07:25:38.448 --> 07:25:38.458 align:start position:0%
envy the job that you have but I would
 
07:25:40.368 --> 07:25:40.378 align:start position:0%
urge you I heard another another
 
07:25:42.530 --> 07:25:42.540 align:start position:0%
representative from Dover earlier say I
 
07:25:46.610 --> 07:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
urge you to not vote with your stance on
 
07:25:48.770 --> 07:25:48.780 align:start position:0%
abortion and I would strongly urge you
 
07:25:50.208 --> 07:25:50.218 align:start position:0%
against that
 
07:25:52.490 --> 07:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
I would really encourage you to vote
 
07:25:52.500 --> 07:25:53.810 align:start position:0%
I would really encourage you to vote
with

07:25:53.810 --> 07:25:53.820 align:start position:0%
with
 
07:25:55.490 --> 07:25:55.500 align:start position:0%
um the knowledge that these are human
 
07:25:57.590 --> 07:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
lives growing inside of every single
 
07:26:00.048 --> 07:26:00.058 align:start position:0%
woman and that is not to take lightly of
 
07:26:02.090 --> 07:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
their situation again I could have been
 
07:26:03.948 --> 07:26:03.958 align:start position:0%
in those situations and I was in some of
 
07:26:06.110 --> 07:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
those situations it isn't taking those
 
07:26:08.510 --> 07:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
things lightly but it is recognizing
 
07:26:10.968 --> 07:26:10.978 align:start position:0%
that these are human lies so I'm happy
 
07:26:12.410 --> 07:26:12.420 align:start position:0%

Lebanon
 
07:27:28.250 --> 07:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
I'm here to speak in support of House
 
07:27:30.830 --> 07:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
Bill 224
 
07:27:33.530 --> 07:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
and good afternoon to all of you and I
 
07:27:35.270 --> 07:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to address
 
07:27:35.280 --> 07:27:37.490 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to address
you

07:27:37.490 --> 07:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
you
 
07:27:37.500 --> 07:27:39.530 align:start position:0%
you
um

07:27:39.530 --> 07:27:39.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:27:41.230 --> 07:27:41.240 align:start position:0%
pregnant people and their doctors
 
07:27:44.330 --> 07:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
sometimes face a terrible dilemma of
 
07:27:46.730 --> 07:27:46.740 align:start position:0%
whether or not to continue a pregnancy
 
07:27:49.250 --> 07:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
in the third trimester these
 
07:27:51.708 --> 07:27:51.718 align:start position:0%
circumstances arise in this in the
 
07:27:55.250 --> 07:27:55.260 align:start position:0%
context of lethal fetal conditions
 
07:27:57.890 --> 07:27:57.900 align:start position:0%
where an abortion will save the fetus
 
07:27:59.690 --> 07:27:59.700 align:start position:0%
from the suffering that would ensue if
 
07:28:01.730 --> 07:28:01.740 align:start position:0%
the pregnancy is continued
 
07:28:03.708 --> 07:28:03.718 align:start position:0%
the pregnant person may have serious
 
07:28:05.750 --> 07:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
medical conditions
 
07:28:07.968 --> 07:28:07.978 align:start position:0%
such that they may face worsening health
 
07:28:10.788 --> 07:28:10.798 align:start position:0%
status and possibly even death if they
 
07:28:12.650 --> 07:28:12.660 align:start position:0%
continue the pregnancy
 
07:28:15.128 --> 07:28:15.138 align:start position:0%
those circumstances might include
 
07:28:18.170 --> 07:28:18.180 align:start position:0%
worsening liver or kidney failure
 
07:28:21.530 --> 07:28:21.540 align:start position:0%
heart failure a new diagnosis of cancer
 
07:28:23.990 --> 07:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
that is more aggressive in the present
 
07:28:27.048 --> 07:28:27.058 align:start position:0%
presence of pregnancy hormones and a
 
07:28:29.150 --> 07:28:29.160 align:start position:0%
variety of other conditions
 
07:28:31.788 --> 07:28:31.798 align:start position:0%
these situations are not easy
 
07:28:34.010 --> 07:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
the painful decision to terminate a
 
07:28:35.930 --> 07:28:35.940 align:start position:0%
pregnancy at these times is undertaken
 
07:28:39.590 --> 07:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
with very careful considerations by both
 
07:28:42.048 --> 07:28:42.058 align:start position:0%
the Physicians involved and the pregnant
 
07:28:44.448 --> 07:28:44.458 align:start position:0%
person and their family
 
07:28:46.548 --> 07:28:46.558 align:start position:0%
the doctors involved at these times
 
07:28:48.890 --> 07:28:48.900 align:start position:0%
carry a heavy burden of responsibility
 
07:28:51.468 --> 07:28:51.478 align:start position:0%
to work with the pregnant person and
 
07:28:54.190 --> 07:28:54.200 align:start position:0%
carry out a difficult procedure
 
07:28:56.628 --> 07:28:56.638 align:start position:0%
penalizing them for doing their
 
07:29:00.110 --> 07:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
difficult job is cruel and inhumane
 
07:29:02.628 --> 07:29:02.638 align:start position:0%
these doctors and their patients deserve
 
07:29:04.010 --> 07:29:04.020 align:start position:0%
our support
 
07:29:07.490 --> 07:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
not our opprobrium and Punishment
 
07:29:09.890 --> 07:29:09.900 align:start position:0%
the repeal of the criminal and civil
 
07:29:11.868 --> 07:29:11.878 align:start position:0%
penalties invoked by the fetal Life
 
07:29:14.990 --> 07:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
protection act will allow our valuable
 
07:29:17.810 --> 07:29:17.820 align:start position:0%
medical practitioners to continue doing
 
07:29:20.930 --> 07:29:20.940 align:start position:0%
their difficult job with compassion and
 
07:29:24.708 --> 07:29:24.718 align:start position:0%
skill not inhibited by the threat threat
 
07:29:27.770 --> 07:29:27.780 align:start position:0%
of State prosecution
 
07:29:30.650 --> 07:29:30.660 align:start position:0%
I'd like to make a side comment on this
 
07:29:32.510 --> 07:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
issue of viability
 
07:29:35.890 --> 07:29:35.900 align:start position:0%
there is no such thing as a
 
07:29:40.610 --> 07:29:40.620 align:start position:0%
one-time definition of viability it is
 
07:29:42.530 --> 07:29:42.540 align:start position:0%
an ark
 
07:29:45.890 --> 07:29:45.900 align:start position:0%
yes there are some 24 weekers who are
 
07:29:48.468 --> 07:29:48.478 align:start position:0%
resuscitated and survive
 
07:29:50.448 --> 07:29:50.458 align:start position:0%
but you have to understand
 
07:29:53.048 --> 07:29:53.058 align:start position:0%
that those are extremely sick infants
 
07:29:56.150 --> 07:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
dependent on life supports and
 
07:30:00.650 --> 07:30:00.660 align:start position:0%
medications and painful procedures
 
07:30:03.048 --> 07:30:03.058 align:start position:0%
to make it to that point and they almost
 
07:30:07.010 --> 07:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
all at that early gestational age end up
 
07:30:09.590 --> 07:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
with physical disabilities of some type
 
07:30:10.730 --> 07:30:10.740 align:start position:0%
or other
 
07:30:12.948 --> 07:30:12.958 align:start position:0%
it might be blindness or visual
 
07:30:15.890 --> 07:30:15.900 align:start position:0%
difficulties it might be intracerebral
 
07:30:17.330 --> 07:30:17.340 align:start position:0%
hemorrhages such that they have
 
07:30:17.340 --> 07:30:19.070 align:start position:0%
hemorrhages such that they have
neurologic

07:30:19.070 --> 07:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
neurologic
 
07:30:20.570 --> 07:30:20.580 align:start position:0%
um limitations
 
07:30:22.788 --> 07:30:22.798 align:start position:0%
they may not be able to hear or speak
 
07:30:24.770 --> 07:30:24.780 align:start position:0%
they may not be able to swallow food
 
07:30:26.570 --> 07:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
because of
 
07:30:29.330 --> 07:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
um death of portions of their gut they
 
07:30:32.030 --> 07:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
may require long-term feeding tubes or
 
07:30:35.208 --> 07:30:35.218 align:start position:0%
ventilators these are not
 
07:30:39.530 --> 07:30:39.540 align:start position:0%
quote healthy viable fetuses
 
07:30:42.530 --> 07:30:42.540 align:start position:0%
right the decision to continue that
 
07:30:45.890 --> 07:30:45.900 align:start position:0%
pregnancy or to end that pregnancy is
 
07:30:47.810 --> 07:30:47.820 align:start position:0%
dependent on those
 
07:30:50.448 --> 07:30:50.458 align:start position:0%
Shades and gradations
 
07:30:53.208 --> 07:30:53.218 align:start position:0%
of risk
 
07:30:55.070 --> 07:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
and should not be penalized with
 
07:30:57.288 --> 07:30:57.298 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties thank you all right
 
07:31:00.410 --> 07:31:00.420 align:start position:0%
yes questions for this Witness
 
07:31:02.868 --> 07:31:02.878 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
07:31:04.730 --> 07:31:04.740 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you thank you Mr chairman and
 
07:31:08.208 --> 07:31:08.218 align:start position:0%
thank you um Dr gloa for your testimony
 
07:31:10.548 --> 07:31:10.558 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to clarify can you can
 
07:31:12.468 --> 07:31:12.478 align:start position:0%
you envision or do you foresee that
 
07:31:14.810 --> 07:31:14.820 align:start position:0%
there's any times when
 
07:31:16.250 --> 07:31:16.260 align:start position:0%
um the provisions of the fetal Life
 
07:31:18.590 --> 07:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
protection act would put you in Conflict
 
07:31:20.868 --> 07:31:20.878 align:start position:0%
either with your Hippocratic oath or
 
07:31:24.128 --> 07:31:24.138 align:start position:0%
 
07:31:26.110 --> 07:31:26.120 align:start position:0%
I will
 
07:31:29.270 --> 07:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
state that I am not in the position of
 
07:31:30.890 --> 07:31:30.900 align:start position:0%
Performing abortions at that late
 
07:31:32.990 --> 07:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
gestational age that is a highly
 
07:31:33.000 --> 07:31:35.090 align:start position:0%
gestational age that is a highly
specialized

07:31:35.090 --> 07:31:35.100 align:start position:0%
specialized
 
07:31:35.100 --> 07:31:36.830 align:start position:0%
specialized
skill

07:31:36.830 --> 07:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
skill
 
07:31:40.788 --> 07:31:40.798 align:start position:0%
I could imagine however that if I were
 
07:31:43.730 --> 07:31:43.740 align:start position:0%
that kind of clinician
 
07:31:46.310 --> 07:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
that I would be constantly worried about
 
07:31:49.368 --> 07:31:49.378 align:start position:0%
every single decision to carry out that
 
07:31:49.378 --> 07:31:50.948 align:start position:0%
every single decision to carry out that
procedure

07:31:50.948 --> 07:31:50.958 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
07:31:53.628 --> 07:31:53.638 align:start position:0%
worrying that
 
07:31:57.230 --> 07:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
some aggressive prosecutor would decide
 
07:31:57.240 --> 07:31:58.850 align:start position:0%
some aggressive prosecutor would decide
to

07:31:58.850 --> 07:31:58.860 align:start position:0%
to
 
07:32:02.330 --> 07:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
pillory me put me in jail deprive me of
 
07:32:04.730 --> 07:32:04.740 align:start position:0%
my livelihood
 
07:32:06.650 --> 07:32:06.660 align:start position:0%
and it would have a distinct chilling
 
07:32:10.190 --> 07:32:10.200 align:start position:0%
effect on my ability to practice
 
07:32:14.330 --> 07:32:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:17.590 --> 07:32:17.600 align:start position:0%

07:32:36.530 --> 07:32:36.540 align:start position:0%
I should also say by the way anybody and
 
07:32:38.448 --> 07:32:38.458 align:start position:0%

electronically to the committee if you

07:32:46.250 --> 07:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
hello again chairman Lynn and committee
 
07:32:48.708 --> 07:32:48.718 align:start position:0%
members my name is Dr Emily zajano and I
 
07:32:52.128 --> 07:32:52.138 align:start position:0%
ask you to support HP 224 repeal the
 
07:32:53.810 --> 07:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
criminal and civil penalties from the
 
07:32:55.730 --> 07:32:55.740 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's current 24-week abortion
 
07:32:55.740 --> 07:32:56.570 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's current 24-week abortion
ban

07:32:56.570 --> 07:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
ban
 
07:32:58.310 --> 07:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
the current law singles out medical
 
07:33:00.230 --> 07:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
providers who have the training and
 
07:33:03.230 --> 07:33:03.240 align:start position:0%
expertise to provide abortion care later
 
07:33:05.448 --> 07:33:05.458 align:start position:0%
in a pregnancy there is no other
 
07:33:06.770 --> 07:33:06.780 align:start position:0%
profession that the state has
 
07:33:09.590 --> 07:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
criminalized this law is an invitation
 
07:33:11.750 --> 07:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
for further intimidation and harassment
 
07:33:13.968 --> 07:33:13.978 align:start position:0%
against these medical professionals and
 
07:33:15.410 --> 07:33:15.420 align:start position:0%
has a chilling effect across the
 
07:33:17.510 --> 07:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
healthcare landscape in New Hampshire
 
07:33:19.368 --> 07:33:19.378 align:start position:0%
we have seen this reality play out
 
07:33:21.350 --> 07:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
across the country
 
07:33:22.910 --> 07:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
there is a significant shortage of
 
07:33:24.890 --> 07:33:24.900 align:start position:0%
Health Care Providers already and
 
07:33:27.530 --> 07:33:27.540 align:start position:0%
specifically in labor and delivery every
 
07:33:29.690 --> 07:33:29.700 align:start position:0%
couple of years for the last 20 years
 
07:33:32.330 --> 07:33:32.340 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's in hospitals in New
 
07:33:34.010 --> 07:33:34.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have been closing down their
 
07:33:36.410 --> 07:33:36.420 align:start position:0%
labor and delivery units there are
 
07:33:39.170 --> 07:33:39.180 align:start position:0%
obstetrical deserts in our state and as
 
07:33:41.208 --> 07:33:41.218 align:start position:0%
nearly 200 providers said when the
 
07:33:42.968 --> 07:33:42.978 align:start position:0%
original abortion ban was adopted
 
07:33:44.930 --> 07:33:44.940 align:start position:0%
criminalizing the profession for
 
07:33:47.208 --> 07:33:47.218 align:start position:0%
providing evidence-based care will
 
07:33:49.490 --> 07:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
exacerbate difficulties in recruiting
 
07:33:53.150 --> 07:33:53.160 align:start position:0%
and retaining critical OB GYN providers
 
07:33:55.128 --> 07:33:55.138 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that last year the
 
07:33:56.750 --> 07:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
legislature directed more money to
 
07:33:58.490 --> 07:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
hospitals so they will continue offering
 
07:34:00.890 --> 07:34:00.900 align:start position:0%
birthing Services however that will not
 
07:34:02.810 --> 07:34:02.820 align:start position:0%
help New Hampshire families if there are
 
07:34:04.730 --> 07:34:04.740 align:start position:0%
not enough Physicians with expertise to
 
07:34:07.128 --> 07:34:07.138 align:start position:0%
provide care in those units
 
07:34:09.048 --> 07:34:09.058 align:start position:0%
those proposing these criminal penalties
 
07:34:11.570 --> 07:34:11.580 align:start position:0%
have likely never been in a room when a
 
07:34:13.310 --> 07:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
woman has to hear her baby won't survive
 
07:34:15.650 --> 07:34:15.660 align:start position:0%
or that continuing a pregnancy could put
 
07:34:16.968 --> 07:34:16.978 align:start position:0%
her life in danger
 
07:34:18.650 --> 07:34:18.660 align:start position:0%
or that there is nothing that can be
 
07:34:20.208 --> 07:34:20.218 align:start position:0%
done to save a baby
 
07:34:22.128 --> 07:34:22.138 align:start position:0%
I have been on both sides of those
 
07:34:22.138 --> 07:34:23.208 align:start position:0%
I have been on both sides of those
discussions

07:34:23.208 --> 07:34:23.218 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
07:34:25.788 --> 07:34:25.798 align:start position:0%
it is devastating for the patient and
 
07:34:27.048 --> 07:34:27.058 align:start position:0%
the medical team
 
07:34:29.448 --> 07:34:29.458 align:start position:0%
the discussion and ultimate decision is
 
07:34:30.948 --> 07:34:30.958 align:start position:0%
not taken lightly
 
07:34:32.750 --> 07:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire trust their
 
07:34:35.448 --> 07:34:35.458 align:start position:0%
doctors to offer sound medical advice
 
07:34:37.368 --> 07:34:37.378 align:start position:0%
the state legislature needs to do the
 
07:34:37.378 --> 07:34:38.090 align:start position:0%
the state legislature needs to do the
same

07:34:38.090 --> 07:34:38.100 align:start position:0%
same
 
07:34:41.448 --> 07:34:41.458 align:start position:0%
I urge you to support HB 224 and end the
 
07:34:42.948 --> 07:34:42.958 align:start position:0%
criminalization of New Hampshire's
 
07:34:45.110 --> 07:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
capable and trusted doctors thank you
 
07:34:48.948 --> 07:34:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:56.810 --> 07:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:34:59.390 --> 07:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
and I know I know I've pronounced it I
 
07:35:01.610 --> 07:35:01.620 align:start position:0%
know it's not open and that's policy oh
 
07:35:03.230 --> 07:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
I apologize
 
07:35:07.368 --> 07:35:07.378 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I apologize Dr Young it's
 
07:35:09.230 --> 07:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
probably it's easier to put it that way
 
07:35:10.910 --> 07:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
Dr Young please
 
07:35:14.030 --> 07:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
and so all right I uh
 
07:35:16.448 --> 07:35:16.458 align:start position:0%
previously introduced myself so we can
 
07:35:18.530 --> 07:35:18.540 align:start position:0%
forego that
 
07:35:21.048 --> 07:35:21.058 align:start position:0%
uh I am I do want to say I'm here
 
07:35:23.930 --> 07:35:23.940 align:start position:0%
testifying on behalf of the New
 
07:35:25.788 --> 07:35:25.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Medical Society
 
07:35:30.410 --> 07:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
and the Obstetricians in our state in
 
07:35:35.930 --> 07:35:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:38.628 --> 07:35:38.638 align:start position:0%
I've long held
 
07:35:41.690 --> 07:35:41.700 align:start position:0%
that there is a sacred
 
07:35:44.690 --> 07:35:44.700 align:start position:0%
social contract
 
07:35:47.570 --> 07:35:47.580 align:start position:0%
between Physicians
 
07:35:50.510 --> 07:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
and Society
 
07:35:53.150 --> 07:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
as Physicians we sacrifice a good
 
07:35:57.490 --> 07:35:57.500 align:start position:0%
portion of Our Youth and Young adulthood
 
07:36:02.150 --> 07:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh to train and learn the skills so that
 
07:36:04.190 --> 07:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
we can devote the rest of our
 
07:36:10.548 --> 07:36:10.558 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:10.558 --> 07:36:15.170 align:start position:0%
 
Society

07:36:15.170 --> 07:36:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:18.170 --> 07:36:18.180 align:start position:0%
is supposed to for that Society is
 
07:36:20.390 --> 07:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
supposed to create
 
07:36:25.490 --> 07:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
uh reasonable fair environment
 
07:36:29.090 --> 07:36:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:32.030 --> 07:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
that the criminalization of physicians
 
07:36:34.310 --> 07:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
in this situation
 
07:36:39.288 --> 07:36:39.298 align:start position:0%
violates that social contract
 
07:36:42.350 --> 07:36:42.360 align:start position:0%
given the complexities
 
07:36:45.350 --> 07:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
of second trimester and early third
 
07:36:49.490 --> 07:36:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:51.708 --> 07:36:51.718 align:start position:0%
this law
 
07:36:53.570 --> 07:36:53.580 align:start position:0%
makes no sense
 
07:36:56.990 --> 07:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
all it does is create a barrier or a
 
07:37:01.128 --> 07:37:01.138 align:start position:0%
burden to the provider who's trying to
 
07:37:03.590 --> 07:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
make the best decision
 
07:37:07.930 --> 07:37:07.940 align:start position:0%
or his or her patient when it comes to
 
07:37:13.190 --> 07:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:14.810 --> 07:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
now let me just
 
07:37:18.830 --> 07:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
give you uh or share with you a story to
 
07:37:20.570 --> 07:37:20.580 align:start position:0%
illustrate what I'm talking about well
 
07:37:22.510 --> 07:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
yeah you know we're trying to limit
 
07:37:24.468 --> 07:37:24.478 align:start position:0%
everyone's testimony to two minutes
 
07:37:27.230 --> 07:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
doctor so I can make it uh pretty quick
 
07:37:27.240 --> 07:37:28.788 align:start position:0%
doctor so I can make it uh pretty quick
please

07:37:28.788 --> 07:37:28.798 align:start position:0%
please
 
07:37:31.670 --> 07:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
well I once I once had a position that's
 
07:37:33.230 --> 07:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
what I present to me
 
07:37:35.090 --> 07:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
she was very healthy
 
07:37:37.490 --> 07:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
uh they achieved pregnancy without any
 
07:37:40.368 --> 07:37:40.378 align:start position:0%
problems at 25 weeks
 
07:37:41.930 --> 07:37:41.940 align:start position:0%
she presented
 
07:37:45.110 --> 07:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
with severe preeclampsia a headache
 
07:37:50.390 --> 07:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
07:37:53.448 --> 07:37:53.458 align:start position:0%
and to save her life I performed an
 
07:37:56.208 --> 07:37:56.218 align:start position:0%
emergency cesarean section the baby died
 
07:37:59.690 --> 07:37:59.700 align:start position:0%
of complications of prematurity
 
07:38:02.690 --> 07:38:02.700 align:start position:0%
this happened two more times by the
 
07:38:05.990 --> 07:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
third pregnancy very unusual story she
 
07:38:09.650 --> 07:38:09.660 align:start position:0%
delivered 26 weeks the baby survived she
 
07:38:09.660 --> 07:38:11.810 align:start position:0%
delivered 26 weeks the baby survived she
survived

07:38:11.810 --> 07:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
survived
 
07:38:14.750 --> 07:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
the baby has severe cerebral palsy but
 
07:38:17.570 --> 07:38:17.580 align:start position:0%
otherwise as well
 
07:38:20.330 --> 07:38:20.340 align:start position:0%
I'm telling the story to point out
 
07:38:24.350 --> 07:38:24.360 align:start position:0%
how complicated the situation was and
 
07:38:25.850 --> 07:38:25.860 align:start position:0%
the thought
 
07:38:29.510 --> 07:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
of of thinking about criminalization in
 
07:38:32.330 --> 07:38:32.340 align:start position:0%
making the decision to deliver her
 
07:38:35.330 --> 07:38:35.340 align:start position:0%
seems unfaluable
 
07:38:37.070 --> 07:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't have done anything different
 
07:38:40.548 --> 07:38:40.558 align:start position:0%
than I did but who knows this might have
 
07:38:48.310 --> 07:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:52.430 --> 07:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:38:58.670 --> 07:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:01.270 --> 07:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
I'm shot as Mike often
 
07:39:05.628 --> 07:39:05.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:06.830 --> 07:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
all right
 
07:39:09.708 --> 07:39:09.718 align:start position:0%
so doctor I you're you're quite a bit
 
07:39:11.570 --> 07:39:11.580 align:start position:0%
over your time and I appreciate your
 
07:39:13.670 --> 07:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
being here but uh we we have a number of
 
07:39:15.230 --> 07:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
other people we need to hear from so
 
07:39:17.150 --> 07:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there questions
 
07:39:18.288 --> 07:39:18.298 align:start position:0%
for this
 
07:39:21.890 --> 07:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
look with me in just
 
07:39:27.368 --> 07:39:27.378 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:29.390 --> 07:39:29.400 align:start position:0%
great I'm gonna thank these questions
 
07:39:30.890 --> 07:39:30.900 align:start position:0%
for the generation of the committee
 
07:39:32.510 --> 07:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
members who have other political
 
07:39:34.750 --> 07:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
commitments this evening
 
07:39:38.930 --> 07:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:40.968 --> 07:39:40.978 align:start position:0%
representative Macbeth thank you Mr
 
07:39:42.708 --> 07:39:42.718 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you Dr Young for my
 
07:39:44.750 --> 07:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
question in the scenario that you were
 
07:39:46.610 --> 07:39:46.620 align:start position:0%
just describing
 
07:39:48.468 --> 07:39:48.478 align:start position:0%
um when you had to do the emergency
 
07:39:50.750 --> 07:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
C-section at the 26 weeks and on the
 
07:39:52.850 --> 07:39:52.860 align:start position:0%
third time the baby did survive but is
 
07:39:55.310 --> 07:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
that a situation where you might have
 
07:39:57.230 --> 07:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
been criminally liable if the baby died
 
07:40:00.590 --> 07:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
but you're not liable and won't get the
 
07:40:02.510 --> 07:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
felony if it lives and that's the so
 
07:40:03.770 --> 07:40:03.780 align:start position:0%

I just wanted to ask the same question
 
07:40:47.650 --> 07:40:47.660 align:start position:0%
that I asked uh roughly of Dr gloa um

um OB GYN uh do you ever Envision that
 
07:40:56.330 --> 07:40:56.340 align:start position:0%
there'd be the possibility of
 
07:40:59.448 --> 07:40:59.458 align:start position:0%
this fetal Protection Law being in
 
07:41:00.890 --> 07:41:00.900 align:start position:0%
conflict with either your your

07:42:05.208 --> 07:42:05.218 align:start position:0%
um so I'm actually here on behalf of an
 
07:42:07.850 --> 07:42:07.860 align:start position:0%
OB GYN in New Hampshire is it okay if I
 
07:42:09.468 --> 07:42:09.478 align:start position:0%
read her testimony or would you prefer
 
07:42:11.690 --> 07:42:11.700 align:start position:0%
if I submit it uh why don't you submit
 
07:42:13.730 --> 07:42:13.740 align:start position:0%
it and if you have you know if you want
 
07:42:15.590 --> 07:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
to just sort of summarize very briefly
 
07:42:18.170 --> 07:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
but you can submit it that's fine all
 
07:42:19.368 --> 07:42:19.378 align:start position:0%
right I'll do that thank you all right
 
07:42:22.730 --> 07:42:22.740 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh Jason Hennessey
 
07:42:25.070 --> 07:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
please and next after that will be Ben
 
07:42:25.080 --> 07:42:26.330 align:start position:0%
please and next after that will be Ben
Safford

07:42:26.330 --> 07:42:26.340 align:start position:0%
Safford
 
07:42:37.128 --> 07:42:37.138 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:38.930 --> 07:42:38.940 align:start position:0%
thank you again Mr chair my name is
 
07:42:40.730 --> 07:42:40.740 align:start position:0%
Jason Hennessey I'm the president of New
 
07:42:42.890 --> 07:42:42.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right to life and I'm here to
 
07:42:45.110 --> 07:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
oppose HB 224
 
07:42:49.190 --> 07:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
on behalf of our our many members uh we
 
07:42:51.170 --> 07:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
already talked about a lot about a lot
 
07:42:52.548 --> 07:42:52.558 align:start position:0%
about the reasons why we want to keep
 
07:42:55.670 --> 07:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
the flpa in the previous uh hearing so I
 
07:42:59.270 --> 07:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
won't dive into that uh but HP 224 is
 
07:43:01.368 --> 07:43:01.378 align:start position:0%
essentially a repeal you know a law
 
07:43:03.530 --> 07:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
without with no penalties carries no
 
07:43:06.590 --> 07:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
weight so the question is is that the
 
07:43:08.150 --> 07:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
direction we want to go
 
07:43:10.070 --> 07:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh as as I said earlier the vast
 
07:43:13.368 --> 07:43:13.378 align:start position:0%
majority of New Hampshire over 70 agrees
 
07:43:15.948 --> 07:43:15.958 align:start position:0%
with abortion limits at some point and
 
07:43:19.010 --> 07:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
six months is the latest
 
07:43:21.770 --> 07:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
point that anybody could think of that
 
07:43:23.150 --> 07:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
and if you look at our national
 
07:43:23.160 --> 07:43:24.468 align:start position:0%
and if you look at our national
landscape

07:43:24.468 --> 07:43:24.478 align:start position:0%
landscape
 
07:43:25.548 --> 07:43:25.558 align:start position:0%
all right
 
07:43:27.230 --> 07:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
so the question is what would be a
 
07:43:31.128 --> 07:43:31.138 align:start position:0%
deterrent then from from doing this and
 
07:43:33.530 --> 07:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
um there wouldn't be one also another
 
07:43:35.150 --> 07:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
another thing I wanted to throw out
 
07:43:37.610 --> 07:43:37.620 align:start position:0%
there is we just heard that uh most of
 
07:43:40.610 --> 07:43:40.620 align:start position:0%
most late term abortions are uh not
 
07:43:42.530 --> 07:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
elective but that disagrees with the few
 
07:43:44.990 --> 07:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
statistics that we have where at least
 
07:43:47.030 --> 07:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
in in one of the states that we have the
 
07:43:48.770 --> 07:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
statistics for it's over it's it's
 
07:43:50.930 --> 07:43:50.940 align:start position:0%
roughly over a little bit over half so
 
07:43:54.288 --> 07:43:54.298 align:start position:0%
over 50 are elective uh and done for the
 
07:43:55.850 --> 07:43:55.860 align:start position:0%
same reasons that early term abortions
 
07:43:56.868 --> 07:43:56.878 align:start position:0%
are done
 
07:43:58.670 --> 07:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
right anything else you want to tell us
 
07:44:02.150 --> 07:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
sir uh I guess I guess one thing I would
 
07:44:04.128 --> 07:44:04.138 align:start position:0%
say I just wanted to address the the
 
07:44:05.690 --> 07:44:05.700 align:start position:0%
point that we would have trouble
 
07:44:08.090 --> 07:44:08.100 align:start position:0%
recruiting uh recruiting Physicians here
 
07:44:11.390 --> 07:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire if 43 states have the
 
07:44:13.610 --> 07:44:13.620 align:start position:0%
same law or even an earlier prohibition
 
07:44:15.890 --> 07:44:15.900 align:start position:0%
and they also presumably have criminal
 
07:44:18.650 --> 07:44:18.660 align:start position:0%
penalties I don't understand how that
 
07:44:20.510 --> 07:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
would affect our our state's recruiting
 
07:44:22.190 --> 07:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
ability thank you all right questions
 
07:44:25.670 --> 07:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:29.690 --> 07:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:35.030 --> 07:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:37.010 --> 07:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
yep no that's fine I think that's I
 
07:44:39.110 --> 07:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
think that's fine just speak speak up if
 
07:44:40.930 --> 07:44:40.940 align:start position:0%
you would please and then after Mr
 
07:44:44.030 --> 07:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
Safford will be Sam Safford
 
07:44:48.468 --> 07:44:48.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:50.390 --> 07:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
honorable house Judiciary Committee
 
07:44:53.510 --> 07:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
members good afternoon I am here today
 
07:44:56.530 --> 07:44:56.540 align:start position:0%
to oppose HP 224
 
07:44:59.990 --> 07:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
how many future doctors teachers firemen
 
07:45:02.030 --> 07:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
legislators and parents have we lost
 
07:45:04.310 --> 07:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
student abortion over the years their
 
07:45:05.930 --> 07:45:05.940 align:start position:0%
dreams and contributions to our society
 
07:45:09.230 --> 07:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:10.850 --> 07:45:10.860 align:start position:0%
in this great land of opportunity
 
07:45:13.010 --> 07:45:13.020 align:start position:0%
someone like me with duchenne muscular
 
07:45:15.468 --> 07:45:15.478 align:start position:0%
dystrophy has been able to live away at
 
07:45:17.690 --> 07:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
college graduate with a degree in social
 
07:45:20.510 --> 07:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
work serve others in my church and work
 
07:45:22.788 --> 07:45:22.798 align:start position:0%
for a non-profit that helps others with
 
07:45:22.798 --> 07:45:24.468 align:start position:0%
for a non-profit that helps others with
disabilities

07:45:24.468 --> 07:45:24.478 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
07:45:27.048 --> 07:45:27.058 align:start position:0%
as a person with duchenne I am living on
 
07:45:28.850 --> 07:45:28.860 align:start position:0%
borrowed time right now my brother
 
07:45:31.190 --> 07:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
Samuel and I have already exceeded our
 
07:45:33.830 --> 07:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
life expectancy someone I know just
 
07:45:36.590 --> 07:45:36.600 align:start position:0%
recently two weeks ago who was 24 years
 
07:45:38.570 --> 07:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
old passed away with my condition and I
 
07:45:41.448 --> 07:45:41.458 align:start position:0%
know some that have not survived their
 
07:45:43.190 --> 07:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
teens and some that have made it maybe
 
07:45:46.548 --> 07:45:46.558 align:start position:0%
to 31 32 but I'm pretty much over my
 
07:45:48.110 --> 07:45:48.120 align:start position:0%
life's expectancy
 
07:45:50.270 --> 07:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
we more than most know how fleeting and
 
07:45:52.990 --> 07:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
frail life can be
 
07:45:56.208 --> 07:45:56.218 align:start position:0%
my condition is you know you get it when
 
07:45:58.250 --> 07:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
you're you can have it at Birth so it
 
07:46:00.468 --> 07:46:00.478 align:start position:0%
can be under fatal phenol anomaly so
 
07:46:02.570 --> 07:46:02.580 align:start position:0%
underneath that I could I could not be
 
07:46:05.690 --> 07:46:05.700 align:start position:0%
here today my mother had elected to you
 
07:46:07.670 --> 07:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
know uh take you know the Fatal
 
07:46:10.010 --> 07:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
phenomenally and abort me I wouldn't be
 
07:46:11.090 --> 07:46:11.100 align:start position:0%
here today
 
07:46:13.548 --> 07:46:13.558 align:start position:0%
I'm thankful that I'm still here I'm
 
07:46:15.170 --> 07:46:15.180 align:start position:0%
asking this committee not to return our
 
07:46:17.030 --> 07:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
state to one that allows abortion on
 
07:46:19.548 --> 07:46:19.558 align:start position:0%
demand up until the moment of birth if
 
07:46:22.788 --> 07:46:22.798 align:start position:0%
this HB 224 goes through it guts the
 
07:46:24.230 --> 07:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
fetal Life protection act from any
 
07:46:26.570 --> 07:46:26.580 align:start position:0%
penalties and then just think about it
 
07:46:28.850 --> 07:46:28.860 align:start position:0%
is it really needed as a law if it has
 
07:46:31.070 --> 07:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
no penalty your might as well repeal it
 
07:46:33.890 --> 07:46:33.900 align:start position:0%
because it won't have any any weight
 
07:46:35.690 --> 07:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
the majority of Granite State or support
 
07:46:38.690 --> 07:46:38.700 align:start position:0%
are modest 24-week abortion ban and do
 
07:46:40.548 --> 07:46:40.558 align:start position:0%
not support unfettered abortion access
 
07:46:42.410 --> 07:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
that's where we're heading if we pass
 
07:46:45.708 --> 07:46:45.718 align:start position:0%
this please vote itl on HB 224 thank you
 
07:46:49.788 --> 07:46:49.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:52.128 --> 07:46:52.138 align:start position:0%
saying none uh next I'm going to call on
 
07:46:57.770 --> 07:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:32.270 --> 07:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
07:47:34.788 --> 07:47:34.798 align:start position:0%
honorable house Judiciary Committee
 
07:47:39.350 --> 07:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
members I am here to oppose HB 224
 
07:47:41.208 --> 07:47:41.218 align:start position:0%
this bill would essentially return our
 
07:47:44.628 --> 07:47:44.638 align:start position:0%
state to abortion on demand until birth
 
07:47:47.090 --> 07:47:47.100 align:start position:0%
I am also here to represent represent
 
07:47:49.610 --> 07:47:49.620 align:start position:0%
those in the disability Community who
 
07:47:51.288 --> 07:47:51.298 align:start position:0%
cannot be here today
 
07:47:53.628 --> 07:47:53.638 align:start position:0%
everyone even a person with a severe
 
07:47:55.968 --> 07:47:55.978 align:start position:0%
disability deserves the right to live
 
07:47:59.810 --> 07:47:59.820 align:start position:0%
and this bill would deny them that right
 
07:48:01.910 --> 07:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
being differently able
 
07:48:04.610 --> 07:48:04.620 align:start position:0%
doesn't make anyone less of a person who
 
07:48:07.010 --> 07:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
is endowed by their creator with an
 
07:48:08.930 --> 07:48:08.940 align:start position:0%
inalienable rights
 
07:48:11.750 --> 07:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
the first of which is the right to life
 
07:48:13.610 --> 07:48:13.620 align:start position:0%
whatever your thoughts on disability or
 
07:48:15.770 --> 07:48:15.780 align:start position:0%
abortion I hope you'll agree that
 
07:48:17.810 --> 07:48:17.820 align:start position:0%
killing a baby would be
 
07:48:19.968 --> 07:48:19.978 align:start position:0%
would who would be viable outside the
 
07:48:22.128 --> 07:48:22.138 align:start position:0%
womb after six months gestation is
 
07:48:26.150 --> 07:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
prevalence please vote itl on HB 224
 
07:48:28.310 --> 07:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you questions to this
 
07:48:28.320 --> 07:48:30.410 align:start position:0%

seeing none thank you uh Lori Safford
please

07:48:41.810 --> 07:48:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:44.330 --> 07:48:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
07:48:44.340 --> 07:48:45.730 align:start position:0%
 
okay

07:48:45.730 --> 07:48:45.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:48:48.730 --> 07:48:48.740 align:start position:0%
it's amazing
 
07:48:51.170 --> 07:48:51.180 align:start position:0%
so I'm here today not actually
 
07:48:54.350 --> 07:48:54.360 align:start position:0%
representing myself but my friend Laura
 
07:48:56.090 --> 07:48:56.100 align:start position:0%
Preston who is a high school science
 
07:48:59.388 --> 07:48:59.398 align:start position:0%
teacher in Salem New Hampshire she
 
07:49:01.610 --> 07:49:01.620 align:start position:0%
couldn't be here today just going to
 
07:49:03.170 --> 07:49:03.180 align:start position:0%
read her testimony
 
07:49:05.810 --> 07:49:05.820 align:start position:0%
as a pro-life woman who made a mistake
 
07:49:09.468 --> 07:49:09.478 align:start position:0%
and had an abortion when I was 18. I am
 
07:49:11.090 --> 07:49:11.100 align:start position:0%
appalled that the state of New Hampshire
 
07:49:13.968 --> 07:49:13.978 align:start position:0%
is even considering going back to
 
07:49:16.850 --> 07:49:16.860 align:start position:0%
allowing abortion of viable babies all
 
07:49:18.530 --> 07:49:18.540 align:start position:0%
the way up to birth
 
07:49:22.128 --> 07:49:22.138 align:start position:0%
when I was 18 my first year in college I
 
07:49:24.230 --> 07:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
was scared ashamed
 
07:49:27.048 --> 07:49:27.058 align:start position:0%
and uncourageous and I didn't want to
 
07:49:29.690 --> 07:49:29.700 align:start position:0%
disappoint my widowed mother
 
07:49:32.810 --> 07:49:32.820 align:start position:0%
I thought I took the easy way out having
 
07:49:35.388 --> 07:49:35.398 align:start position:0%
an abortion at Planned Parenthood
 
07:49:37.910 --> 07:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
but little did I know that I would be
 
07:49:40.670 --> 07:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
haunted by this decision for the rest of
 
07:49:42.288 --> 07:49:42.298 align:start position:0%
my life
 
07:49:44.570 --> 07:49:44.580 align:start position:0%
since that time I have been on the
 
07:49:47.208 --> 07:49:47.218 align:start position:0%
course to help in any way I can to save
 
07:49:50.030 --> 07:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
the babies and to help women facing an
 
07:49:51.948 --> 07:49:51.958 align:start position:0%
unplanned pregnancy
 
07:49:53.868 --> 07:49:53.878 align:start position:0%
children are a blessing
 
07:49:56.030 --> 07:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
there are many choices when having an
 
07:49:58.850 --> 07:49:58.860 align:start position:0%
unplanned pregnancy including adoption
 
07:50:01.670 --> 07:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
and I believe women deserve better than
 
07:50:01.680 --> 07:50:03.110 align:start position:0%
and I believe women deserve better than
abortion

07:50:03.110 --> 07:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
07:50:05.930 --> 07:50:05.940 align:start position:0%
we have two beautiful grandchildren we
 
07:50:08.150 --> 07:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
happen to be raising because our
 
07:50:10.910 --> 07:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
daughter made a couple of wrong choices
 
07:50:13.910 --> 07:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
but she chose to have her babies instead
 
07:50:17.208 --> 07:50:17.218 align:start position:0%
of aborting them I'm so proud of her
 
07:50:20.150 --> 07:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
she was much more courageous than I
 
07:50:22.190 --> 07:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
I feel like God has given me a second
 
07:50:24.770 --> 07:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
chance with our grandchildren I have
 
07:50:27.048 --> 07:50:27.058 align:start position:0%
been blessed beyond measure
 
07:50:28.910 --> 07:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
whatever you think about the issue of
 
07:50:28.920 --> 07:50:30.230 align:start position:0%
whatever you think about the issue of
abortion

07:50:30.230 --> 07:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
abortion
 
07:50:31.850 --> 07:50:31.860 align:start position:0%
I hope we can all agree that
 
07:50:33.888 --> 07:50:33.898 align:start position:0%
purposefully killing a viable child
 
07:50:36.650 --> 07:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
after he or she has already developed in
 
07:50:39.530 --> 07:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
the womb for six entire months is
 
07:50:39.540 --> 07:50:40.968 align:start position:0%
the womb for six entire months is
unconscionable

07:50:40.968 --> 07:50:40.978 align:start position:0%
unconscionable
 
07:50:44.388 --> 07:50:44.398 align:start position:0%
please oppose hb224
 
07:50:46.910 --> 07:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for this week
 
07:50:48.770 --> 07:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
real quickly
 
07:50:50.930 --> 07:50:50.940 align:start position:0%
um just because I have to really rebut
 
07:50:53.868 --> 07:50:53.878 align:start position:0%
the two Physicians
 
07:50:56.150 --> 07:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
um who said that they thought that
 
07:51:00.350 --> 07:51:00.360 align:start position:0%
viability is still at 24 26 weeks I have
 
07:51:02.388 --> 07:51:02.398 align:start position:0%
a very good friend Robin Moore who lives
 
07:51:05.330 --> 07:51:05.340 align:start position:0%
in Framingham Massachusetts and her
 
07:51:08.628 --> 07:51:08.638 align:start position:0%
daughter was born just months after mine
 
07:51:10.548 --> 07:51:10.558 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what her issue was she
 
07:51:12.948 --> 07:51:12.958 align:start position:0%
had a uterus that couldn't hold the baby
 
07:51:15.590 --> 07:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
she was in bed for a couple of weeks
 
07:51:17.810 --> 07:51:17.820 align:start position:0%
while she was pregnant and her daughter
 
07:51:21.350 --> 07:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
Kaylee was born at 19 weeks she was
 
07:51:23.650 --> 07:51:23.660 align:start position:0%
obviously in the NICU for some time
 
07:51:26.208 --> 07:51:26.218 align:start position:0%
there were issues with her lungs and
 
07:51:28.788 --> 07:51:28.798 align:start position:0%
they weren't sure if she would you know
 
07:51:32.510 --> 07:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
be blind or not but she is a totally
 
07:51:35.628 --> 07:51:35.638 align:start position:0%
typical 23 year old today and she
 
07:51:38.388 --> 07:51:38.398 align:start position:0%
competes in dancing competitions if you
 
07:51:40.490 --> 07:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
want to look up Kaylee Moore or Robin
 
07:51:43.010 --> 07:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
Moore on Facebook you'll be able to see
 
07:51:44.530 --> 07:51:44.540 align:start position:0%
her competing
 
07:51:48.708 --> 07:51:48.718 align:start position:0%
so to say that 24 weeks is stretching
 
07:51:48.718 --> 07:51:50.628 align:start position:0%
so to say that 24 weeks is stretching
viability

07:51:50.628 --> 07:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
viability
 
07:51:53.570 --> 07:51:53.580 align:start position:0%

uh sort of estimate we have seven such
 
07:53:14.750 --> 07:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
Maternal Fetal Medicine providers in the
 
07:53:16.490 --> 07:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire
 
07:53:18.350 --> 07:53:18.360 align:start position:0%
um and two I am currently trying to
 
07:53:20.208 --> 07:53:20.218 align:start position:0%
recruit as I'd indicated
 
07:53:22.850 --> 07:53:22.860 align:start position:0%
and I'm urging you to consider
 
07:53:27.310 --> 07:53:27.320 align:start position:0%
um the the benefits of of the uh of
 
07:53:31.250 --> 07:53:31.260 align:start position:0%
hb224 this is become evident already in
 
07:53:33.770 --> 07:53:33.780 align:start position:0%
my efforts to recruit Maternal Fetal
 
07:53:36.770 --> 07:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
Medicine Specialists to care for the
 
07:53:39.410 --> 07:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
women and families of New Hampshire
 
07:53:42.830 --> 07:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
um this is already an issue in making a
 
07:53:46.368 --> 07:53:46.378 align:start position:0%
hospitable and also a reasonable place
 
07:53:48.110 --> 07:53:48.120 align:start position:0%
for them to practice the medicine that
 
07:53:49.788 --> 07:53:49.798 align:start position:0%
they have been specially trained to do
 
07:53:52.548 --> 07:53:52.558 align:start position:0%
to care for I might add pregnant
 
07:53:54.410 --> 07:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
individuals with any range of medical
 
07:53:58.070 --> 07:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
conditions trying to promote healthy and
 
07:54:01.310 --> 07:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
safe deliveries for for our Granite
 
07:54:03.468 --> 07:54:03.478 align:start position:0%
Staters but I'd like to invite you to
 
07:54:06.230 --> 07:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
consider the downstream consequences of
 
07:54:07.850 --> 07:54:07.860 align:start position:0%
the legislation that adds criminal
 
07:54:13.070 --> 07:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
penalties for a provider in in the
 
07:54:14.448 --> 07:54:14.458 align:start position:0%
sanctity of the relationship between
 
07:54:16.250 --> 07:54:16.260 align:start position:0%
that provider and patient
 
07:54:18.288 --> 07:54:18.298 align:start position:0%
the downstream consequences of criminal
 
07:54:21.830 --> 07:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
persecution this has an impact on our
 
07:54:24.590 --> 07:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
residency the only Residency program In
 
07:54:26.330 --> 07:54:26.340 align:start position:0%
Obstetrics and Gynecology in the state
 
07:54:28.368 --> 07:54:28.378 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire this has an implication
 
07:54:30.530 --> 07:54:30.540 align:start position:0%
for our medical students the only
 
07:54:32.448 --> 07:54:32.458 align:start position:0%
medical school in the state of New
 
07:54:35.510 --> 07:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this kind of environment makes
 
07:54:37.610 --> 07:54:37.620 align:start position:0%
providers as you as you've heard from
 
07:54:39.590 --> 07:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
many of my colleagues today more
 
07:54:42.468 --> 07:54:42.478 align:start position:0%
apprehensive about delivering care
 
07:54:44.388 --> 07:54:44.398 align:start position:0%
concerned that they will potentially
 
07:54:48.288 --> 07:54:48.298 align:start position:0%
face criminal criminal consequences as
 
07:54:50.628 --> 07:54:50.638 align:start position:0%
well as Financial consequences making it
 
07:54:52.490 --> 07:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
difficult to impossible for them to go
 
07:54:54.530 --> 07:54:54.540 align:start position:0%
on with their professional careers that
 
07:54:56.690 --> 07:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
they have been trained specially to do
 
07:54:58.610 --> 07:54:58.620 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any of your
 
07:55:01.070 --> 07:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
questions given the hour but I would
 
07:55:03.650 --> 07:55:03.660 align:start position:0%
point out that this has far-reaching
 
07:55:06.190 --> 07:55:06.200 align:start position:0%
implications for the healthcare
 
07:55:08.510 --> 07:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
landscape of the State of New Hampshire
 
07:55:10.010 --> 07:55:10.020 align:start position:0%
in which you've already heard very
 
07:55:12.288 --> 07:55:12.298 align:start position:0%
important testimony about the shrinking
 
07:55:15.468 --> 07:55:15.478 align:start position:0%
number of obstetrical units in our state
 
07:55:18.530 --> 07:55:18.540 align:start position:0%
as indicated we have fewer and fewer
 
07:55:20.868 --> 07:55:20.878 align:start position:0%
places where women can seek obstetric
 
07:55:24.888 --> 07:55:24.898 align:start position:0%
care and to add criminal penalties for
 
07:55:28.850 --> 07:55:28.860 align:start position:0%
providers further carries us along in a
 
07:55:30.830 --> 07:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
Continuum which could grave which could
 
07:55:33.110 --> 07:55:33.120 align:start position:0%
pose great Peril to the women and
 
07:55:34.788 --> 07:55:34.798 align:start position:0%
families of the state
 
07:55:39.110 --> 07:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:55:41.510 --> 07:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
07:55:43.310 --> 07:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair thank you
 
07:55:45.850 --> 07:55:45.860 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I need your help
 
07:55:49.190 --> 07:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
I'm reading and and this in part I think
 
07:55:51.650 --> 07:55:51.660 align:start position:0%
is going to help I think in a
 
07:55:54.410 --> 07:55:54.420 align:start position:0%
translation if you will from the legal
 
07:55:56.270 --> 07:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
World which I'm a little more familiar
 
07:55:57.948 --> 07:55:57.958 align:start position:0%
with to the medical world which I'm
 
07:56:00.048 --> 07:56:00.058 align:start position:0%
completely unfamiliar with but you are
 
07:56:03.110 --> 07:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at 329 colon 46 that's a
 
07:56:03.120 --> 07:56:04.150 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at 329 colon 46 that's a
criminal

07:56:04.150 --> 07:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
07:56:07.190 --> 07:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
penalties and it uses words that are
 
07:56:10.128 --> 07:56:10.138 align:start position:0%
familiar to me by my training knowingly
 
07:56:13.850 --> 07:56:13.860 align:start position:0%
performs or induces an abortion and
 
07:56:15.888 --> 07:56:15.898 align:start position:0%
knows this is this is sort of getting
 
07:56:18.708 --> 07:56:18.718 align:start position:0%
into the mental state of the doctor or
 
07:56:21.048 --> 07:56:21.058 align:start position:0%
consciously disregards the substantial
 
07:56:23.510 --> 07:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
risk those terms are I won't say
 
07:56:26.208 --> 07:56:26.218 align:start position:0%
comforting to me in the statute but as a
 
07:56:28.730 --> 07:56:28.740 align:start position:0%
lawyer they give me some Bedrock to look
 
07:56:32.690 --> 07:56:32.700 align:start position:0%
to so but I'm wondering in the medical
 
07:56:37.190 --> 07:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
room where all this is going on
 
07:56:39.350 --> 07:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
it must be a little bit more complicated
 
07:56:42.230 --> 07:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
than than that there must be scenarios
 
07:56:44.388 --> 07:56:44.398 align:start position:0%
where it's not as linear as the lawyer
 
07:56:47.270 --> 07:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
mind would like it to be for a criminal
 
07:56:49.250 --> 07:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
code and I'm wondering if you could
 
07:56:51.788 --> 07:56:51.798 align:start position:0%
describe that sort of complication
 
07:56:53.628 --> 07:56:53.638 align:start position:0%
complicated kind of nature that I'm
 
07:56:55.850 --> 07:56:55.860 align:start position:0%
guessing is there but I don't know yeah
 
07:56:57.350 --> 07:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that excellent question
 
07:56:58.910 --> 07:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
which I think really highlights the
 
07:57:00.650 --> 07:57:00.660 align:start position:0%
point that many people have shared with
 
07:57:02.628 --> 07:57:02.638 align:start position:0%
you today who are medical professionals
 
07:57:04.430 --> 07:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
there is a tremendous amount of
 
07:57:06.708 --> 07:57:06.718 align:start position:0%
uncertainty uncertainty in the context
 
07:57:09.708 --> 07:57:09.718 align:start position:0%
of a pregnant woman who perhaps is in
 
07:57:11.888 --> 07:57:11.898 align:start position:0%
the situation that the pregnancy
 
07:57:15.770 --> 07:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
poses some concern or life-threatening
 
07:57:18.350 --> 07:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
condition but just proximal to that as
 
07:57:20.150 --> 07:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
things are sort of unfolding the
 
07:57:21.830 --> 07:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
condition of that woman the condition of
 
07:57:23.690 --> 07:57:23.700 align:start position:0%
that pregnancy can literally change by
 
07:57:25.490 --> 07:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
the minute there can be uncertainty
 
07:57:27.170 --> 07:57:27.180 align:start position:0%
about the gestational age of the
 
07:57:29.930 --> 07:57:29.940 align:start position:0%
pregnancy which in and of itself we use
 
07:57:31.930 --> 07:57:31.940 align:start position:0%
as an anchor but can be unpredictable
 
07:57:34.548 --> 07:57:34.558 align:start position:0%
and the circumstance that I would submit
 
07:57:37.548 --> 07:57:37.558 align:start position:0%
to you with with regards to some of the
 
07:57:39.110 --> 07:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
uncertainty and how that plays itself
 
07:57:41.330 --> 07:57:41.340 align:start position:0%
out you know we are seeing situations
 
07:57:43.128 --> 07:57:43.138 align:start position:0%
currently in the United States of
 
07:57:46.968 --> 07:57:46.978 align:start position:0%
America where providers in that space of
 
07:57:49.250 --> 07:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
have things gotten to the point at which
 
07:57:51.410 --> 07:57:51.420 align:start position:0%
and this could happen in the state of
 
07:57:53.448 --> 07:57:53.458 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire can I definitively say
 
07:57:55.250 --> 07:57:55.260 align:start position:0%
that the circumstances that I can see in
 
07:57:57.230 --> 07:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
front of me mean that if I don't act
 
07:57:59.690 --> 07:57:59.700 align:start position:0%
right now the patient will die as a
 
07:58:02.330 --> 07:58:02.340 align:start position:0%
result of the pregnancy that can be very
 
07:58:04.850 --> 07:58:04.860 align:start position:0%
vague territory territory and decision
 
07:58:06.410 --> 07:58:06.420 align:start position:0%
making which can change by the minute
 
07:58:09.288 --> 07:58:09.298 align:start position:0%
can be very ambiguous and can lead to
 
07:58:12.048 --> 07:58:12.058 align:start position:0%
significant delays in care which can
 
07:58:14.090 --> 07:58:14.100 align:start position:0%
make the imperil the condition of the
 
07:58:16.368 --> 07:58:16.378 align:start position:0%
mother as the provider tries to decide
 
07:58:18.770 --> 07:58:18.780 align:start position:0%
what the right thing is to do and to
 
07:58:20.810 --> 07:58:20.820 align:start position:0%
compound that what is that provider to
 
07:58:23.990 --> 07:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
do again in in Far Away places you know
 
07:58:27.048 --> 07:58:27.058 align:start position:0%
where there is perhaps less access to a
 
07:58:29.388 --> 07:58:29.398 align:start position:0%
immediate Maternal Fetal Medicine care
 
07:58:31.190 --> 07:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
where in the middle of the night that
 
07:58:32.930 --> 07:58:32.940 align:start position:0%
provider has to make a decision based on
 
07:58:35.090 --> 07:58:35.100 align:start position:0%
their best evidence and best medical
 
07:58:37.548 --> 07:58:37.558 align:start position:0%
judgment always with the fear that there
 
07:58:40.128 --> 07:58:40.138 align:start position:0%
may be some criminal prosecution if that
 
07:58:41.930 --> 07:58:41.940 align:start position:0%
individual has to second guess
 
07:58:44.208 --> 07:58:44.218 align:start position:0%
themselves if the outcome is not as they
 
07:58:46.310 --> 07:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
project or think it might be based on
 
07:58:48.650 --> 07:58:48.660 align:start position:0%
best practice based on the best data
 
07:58:50.090 --> 07:58:50.100 align:start position:0%
that they have in front of them so
 
07:58:51.350 --> 07:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
there's a tremendous amount of
 
07:58:53.868 --> 07:58:53.878 align:start position:0%
uncertainty and I would add that to
 
07:58:56.570 --> 07:58:56.580 align:start position:0%
criminalize a provider who in
 
07:58:58.610 --> 07:58:58.620 align:start position:0%
consultation with their patient is
 
07:59:01.190 --> 07:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
trying to practice best prep care with
 
07:59:03.888 --> 07:59:03.898 align:start position:0%
the best evidence adds a dimension that
 
07:59:05.388 --> 07:59:05.398 align:start position:0%
is both dangerous to the patient
 
07:59:07.490 --> 07:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
dangerous to The Physician and
 
07:59:09.410 --> 07:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
ultimately can have implications for our
 
07:59:12.230 --> 07:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
state as providers will invariably look
 
07:59:15.048 --> 07:59:15.058 align:start position:0%
to that and decide I'm not going to
 
07:59:17.270 --> 07:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
apply for that job I'm not going to
 
07:59:19.190 --> 07:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
apply to that residency I am not going
 
07:59:22.730 --> 07:59:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:59:24.530 --> 07:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
questions are the questions for this
 
07:59:24.540 --> 07:59:26.270 align:start position:0%
questions are the questions for this

07:59:37.548 --> 07:59:37.558 align:start position:0%
thank you so much chairman and members
 
07:59:40.670 --> 07:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
of the committee I rise in opposition to
 
07:59:42.288 --> 07:59:42.298 align:start position:0%
the repeal
 
07:59:45.590 --> 07:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
that has been placed before us I am
 
07:59:47.510 --> 07:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
Peter Chamberlain I Pastor the granite
 
07:59:49.548 --> 07:59:49.558 align:start position:0%
state Baptist Church here in Concord
 
07:59:53.330 --> 07:59:53.340 align:start position:0%
I'll approach this from a I believe it
 
07:59:55.010 --> 07:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
ought to be an ethical and immoral and
 
07:59:59.270 --> 07:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
also a righteous Duty that there are
 
08:00:01.190 --> 08:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
laws on the books
 
08:00:04.368 --> 08:00:04.378 align:start position:0%
and the Very subject matter of a law is
 
08:00:06.288 --> 08:00:06.298 align:start position:0%
to be enforced in fact if we were to
 
08:00:07.990 --> 08:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
come back and look at the very
 
08:00:11.030 --> 08:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
definitions that are given in in modern
 
08:00:13.490 --> 08:00:13.500 align:start position:0%
dictionaries it is something to be
 
08:00:16.730 --> 08:00:16.740 align:start position:0%
enforced by the body and without it we
 
08:00:20.150 --> 08:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
cannot have law enforcement if there's
 
08:00:22.190 --> 08:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
ever a law that ought to be enforced it
 
08:00:23.570 --> 08:00:23.580 align:start position:0%
ought to be that which protects the
 
08:00:26.208 --> 08:00:26.218 align:start position:0%
heartbeat from the beginning to the end
 
08:00:29.030 --> 08:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
but as we look at laws that are on the
 
08:00:29.040 --> 08:00:30.350 align:start position:0%
but as we look at laws that are on the
book

08:00:30.350 --> 08:00:30.360 align:start position:0%
book
 
08:00:32.690 --> 08:00:32.700 align:start position:0%
if they are to be enforced I would say
 
08:00:35.208 --> 08:00:35.218 align:start position:0%
by the very repeal of this law goes
 
08:00:37.788 --> 08:00:37.798 align:start position:0%
against the very nature of why we would
 
08:00:40.128 --> 08:00:40.138 align:start position:0%
even have a governing body a legislation
 
08:00:44.388 --> 08:00:44.398 align:start position:0%
or a governor in place
 
08:00:47.990 --> 08:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
because there's no other lobbying to be
 
08:00:50.330 --> 08:00:50.340 align:start position:0%
able to take away penalties for breaking
 
08:00:53.570 --> 08:00:53.580 align:start position:0%
the law and so I know abortion has been
 
08:00:57.230 --> 08:00:57.240 align:start position:0%
debated all day long I would think there
 
08:00:59.388 --> 08:00:59.398 align:start position:0%
ought to be a correction on terminology
 
08:01:02.270 --> 08:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
that's being used as person after person
 
08:01:05.030 --> 08:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
stands up and calls it health care I
 
08:01:06.468 --> 08:01:06.478 align:start position:0%
personally believe it's prejudiced
 
08:01:08.690 --> 08:01:08.700 align:start position:0%
health care that's actually looking to
 
08:01:10.128 --> 08:01:10.138 align:start position:0%
take care of the health of one human
 
08:01:12.468 --> 08:01:12.478 align:start position:0%
being and not the life of another human
 
08:01:15.128 --> 08:01:15.138 align:start position:0%
being and to not promoting the moral
 
08:01:18.468 --> 08:01:18.478 align:start position:0%
well-being or the physical well-being of
 
08:01:21.048 --> 08:01:21.058 align:start position:0%
those but then if we allow this to have
 
08:01:22.868 --> 08:01:22.878 align:start position:0%
a law on the books
 
08:01:26.448 --> 08:01:26.458 align:start position:0%
with no consequences no enforcement
 
08:01:29.570 --> 08:01:29.580 align:start position:0%
whatsoever then what precedence it was
 
08:01:32.510 --> 08:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
asked but not answered earlier what
 
08:01:36.530 --> 08:01:36.540 align:start position:0%
precedence and where does this stop
 
08:01:39.410 --> 08:01:39.420 align:start position:0%
does it stop with speed and tickets
 
08:01:41.388 --> 08:01:41.398 align:start position:0%
can I then turn around and sue for
 
08:01:43.448 --> 08:01:43.458 align:start position:0%
president for for
 
08:01:46.850 --> 08:01:46.860 align:start position:0%
prejudiced enforcement of laws that it's
 
08:01:48.590 --> 08:01:48.600 align:start position:0%
not being enforced one way or another
 
08:01:51.048 --> 08:01:51.058 align:start position:0%
and so we look at these things doesn't
 
08:01:53.270 --> 08:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
stop with stealing doesn't stop with
 
08:01:53.280 --> 08:01:54.350 align:start position:0%
stop with stealing doesn't stop with
murder

08:01:54.350 --> 08:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
murder
 
08:01:56.270 --> 08:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
what laws
 
08:01:58.610 --> 08:01:58.620 align:start position:0%
are they're allowed to be on the books
 
08:02:01.788 --> 08:02:01.798 align:start position:0%
that we do not have enforcement of those
 
08:02:03.650 --> 08:02:03.660 align:start position:0%
laws by the very nature it's not a law
 
08:02:06.170 --> 08:02:06.180 align:start position:0%
then and by the very nature we're not
 
08:02:08.530 --> 08:02:08.540 align:start position:0%
lawmakers and there is no law
 
08:02:11.990 --> 08:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement and so saying it's fine for
 
08:02:14.750 --> 08:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
providing Health Care it is selective
 
08:02:18.288 --> 08:02:18.298 align:start position:0%
and to be able to go and I'll just give
 
08:02:19.910 --> 08:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
maybe some common sense to this
 
08:02:19.920 --> 08:02:21.288 align:start position:0%
maybe some common sense to this
recruitment

08:02:21.288 --> 08:02:21.298 align:start position:0%
recruitment
 
08:02:23.270 --> 08:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire we have a speed limit
 
08:02:25.788 --> 08:02:25.798 align:start position:0%
so maybe by us having a speed limit
 
08:02:28.250 --> 08:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
let's follow that through maybe that's
 
08:02:30.288 --> 08:02:30.298 align:start position:0%
going to hinder drivers from coming to
 
08:02:31.368 --> 08:02:31.378 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
08:02:33.468 --> 08:02:33.478 align:start position:0%
well we see every weekend that that
 
08:02:35.930 --> 08:02:35.940 align:start position:0%
doesn't and so I just believe that we
 
08:02:37.910 --> 08:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
ought to enforce the laws that are on
 
08:02:39.888 --> 08:02:39.898 align:start position:0%
the books there are some that have said
 
08:02:42.048 --> 08:02:42.058 align:start position:0%
well maybe we could do this that's not
 
08:02:44.030 --> 08:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
before the committee
 
08:02:45.288 --> 08:02:45.298 align:start position:0%
you're not allowed to look at
 
08:02:47.330 --> 08:02:47.340 align:start position:0%
Alternatives of what could be done until
 
08:02:49.430 --> 08:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
those laws are submitted
 
08:02:51.830 --> 08:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
this is a repeal but it would be a
 
08:02:53.570 --> 08:02:53.580 align:start position:0%
repeal with no enforcement no
 
08:02:55.310 --> 08:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
replacement of it therefore it takes a
 
08:02:57.888 --> 08:02:57.898 align:start position:0%
law completely off the books and so I do
 
08:03:02.090 --> 08:03:02.100 align:start position:0%
urge do not repeal this law
 
08:03:04.788 --> 08:03:04.798 align:start position:0%
and have a law that has no consequences
 
08:03:06.830 --> 08:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
whatsoever thank you for your time thank
 
08:03:10.070 --> 08:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
08:03:13.330 --> 08:03:13.340 align:start position:0%
thank you see none thank you uh Jennifer
 
08:03:28.490 --> 08:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
08:03:30.410 --> 08:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
hello thank you all for your time today
 
08:03:32.750 --> 08:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
I know it's been a long day
 
08:03:34.250 --> 08:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
um and you've heard so many testimonies
 
08:03:36.650 --> 08:03:36.660 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to try to keep mine short
 
08:03:40.070 --> 08:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm here to oppose hb224
 
08:03:42.230 --> 08:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
um as a mother of four children I have
 
08:03:44.030 --> 08:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
carried all those pregnancies to full
 
08:03:46.910 --> 08:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
term and I can tell you honestly that at
 
08:03:48.650 --> 08:03:48.660 align:start position:0%
24 weeks and Beyond
 
08:03:53.448 --> 08:03:53.458 align:start position:0%
there is a real life inside of me and
 
08:03:56.090 --> 08:03:56.100 align:start position:0%
at every point in the pregnancy but I
 
08:03:59.330 --> 08:03:59.340 align:start position:0%
have felt my baby's dance when they're
 
08:04:01.910 --> 08:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
happy I have heard I have
 
08:04:04.850 --> 08:04:04.860 align:start position:0%
um had them give me gentle nudges when
 
08:04:08.930 --> 08:04:08.940 align:start position:0%
I'm sad they're intuitive and real
 
08:04:11.570 --> 08:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the testimonies today
 
08:04:14.030 --> 08:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
um in regards to abortion though I hear
 
08:04:17.030 --> 08:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of people Express concern
 
08:04:17.040 --> 08:04:19.910 align:start position:0%
a lot of people Express concern
um

08:04:19.910 --> 08:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
08:04:23.750 --> 08:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
about women's rights with abortion but
 
08:04:25.850 --> 08:04:25.860 align:start position:0%
the fundamental question I have
 
08:04:29.208 --> 08:04:29.218 align:start position:0%
is that we should be asking is does an
 
08:04:31.610 --> 08:04:31.620 align:start position:0%
onboard child have rights should they
 
08:04:33.590 --> 08:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
have rights
 
08:04:35.448 --> 08:04:35.458 align:start position:0%
and my question for everyone in this
 
08:04:38.208 --> 08:04:38.218 align:start position:0%
room is
 
08:04:40.490 --> 08:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
if your mother had chosen abortion how
 
08:04:43.670 --> 08:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
many rights would you have today
 
08:04:45.650 --> 08:04:45.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time thank you
 
08:04:49.010 --> 08:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
08:04:52.010 --> 08:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you my 11 year old was
 
08:04:54.888 --> 08:04:54.898 align:start position:0%
wishing to speak of his own will is that
 
08:04:54.898 --> 08:04:56.690 align:start position:0%
wishing to speak of his own will is that
okay

08:04:56.690 --> 08:04:56.700 align:start position:0%
okay
 
08:04:59.690 --> 08:04:59.700 align:start position:0%
very briefly very briefly keep it
 
08:04:59.700 --> 08:05:02.510 align:start position:0%
very briefly very briefly keep it
briefly

08:05:02.510 --> 08:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
08:05:05.930 --> 08:05:05.940 align:start position:0%
my name is quintus lento and I am 11
 
08:05:08.690 --> 08:05:08.700 align:start position:0%
years old and I opposed the home bill
 
08:05:08.700 --> 08:05:11.330 align:start position:0%
years old and I opposed the home bill
224.

08:05:11.330 --> 08:05:11.340 align:start position:0%
224.
 
08:05:13.430 --> 08:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
because I believe that all people have a
 
08:05:15.468 --> 08:05:15.478 align:start position:0%
right and a reason to live
 
08:05:19.430 --> 08:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
and to have a family
 
08:05:22.368 --> 08:05:22.378 align:start position:0%
and if all these people proposing this
 
08:05:25.430 --> 08:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
bill want everybody to have freedom that
 
08:05:28.548 --> 08:05:28.558 align:start position:0%
infants should have rights and if
 
08:05:30.708 --> 08:05:30.718 align:start position:0%
somebody can't afford babies
 
08:05:30.718 --> 08:05:32.990 align:start position:0%
somebody can't afford babies
then

08:05:32.990 --> 08:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
then
 
08:05:41.990 --> 08:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
08:05:44.090 --> 08:05:44.100 align:start position:0%
it stops writing there so I'm gonna just
 
08:05:47.510 --> 08:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
go over here sorry thank you oh am I
 
08:05:49.368 --> 08:05:49.378 align:start position:0%
done go ahead okay
 
08:05:51.830 --> 08:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
to those who don't know how your babies
 
08:05:54.468 --> 08:05:54.478 align:start position:0%
are boarded then you should look up the
 
08:05:56.930 --> 08:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
most common abortion method but I will
 
08:05:59.208 --> 08:05:59.218 align:start position:0%
say the most common second trimester
 
08:06:02.830 --> 08:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
motion method is
 
08:06:06.110 --> 08:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
dismembering the baby and taking it out
 
08:06:08.388 --> 08:06:08.398 align:start position:0%
vote now on
 
08:06:12.350 --> 08:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
on home Bill 224. thank you very much
 
08:06:18.230 --> 08:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
08:06:20.150 --> 08:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks to all of you for your
 
08:06:22.070 --> 08:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
patience on this long day
 
08:06:22.080 --> 08:06:22.968 align:start position:0%
patience on this long day
um

08:06:22.968 --> 08:06:22.978 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:06:24.948 --> 08:06:24.958 align:start position:0%
the funeral Life protection act has only
 
08:06:27.650 --> 08:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
been in effect since last January and in
 
08:06:30.230 --> 08:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
those 13 months there's been like dozens
 
08:06:32.388 --> 08:06:32.398 align:start position:0%
of bills it seems maybe only a dozen but
 
08:06:34.490 --> 08:06:34.500 align:start position:0%
just so many bills that seek to gut it
 
08:06:37.670 --> 08:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
and um just neuter it and this is yet
 
08:06:40.310 --> 08:06:40.320 align:start position:0%
another one that will gut it and you
 
08:06:41.750 --> 08:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
might as well just repeal it as several
 
08:06:43.850 --> 08:06:43.860 align:start position:0%
people have said
 
08:06:47.030 --> 08:06:47.040 align:start position:0%
um I am the parent of four children that
 
08:06:49.310 --> 08:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
check every box for affordable according
 
08:06:51.468 --> 08:06:51.478 align:start position:0%
to the stories I heard today
 
08:06:54.468 --> 08:06:54.478 align:start position:0%
um and yet they disagree they are happy
 
08:06:56.448 --> 08:06:56.458 align:start position:0%
healthy thriving young adults at this
 
08:06:56.458 --> 08:06:57.708 align:start position:0%
healthy thriving young adults at this
point

08:06:57.708 --> 08:06:57.718 align:start position:0%
point
 
08:06:59.810 --> 08:06:59.820 align:start position:0%
um and I think that if any of you are
 
08:07:01.490 --> 08:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
still considering this a sort of a
 
08:07:03.230 --> 08:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
feminist issue a women's rights issue
 
08:07:05.150 --> 08:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
then I would encourage you to think
 
08:07:05.160 --> 08:07:06.288 align:start position:0%
then I would encourage you to think
again

08:07:06.288 --> 08:07:06.298 align:start position:0%
again
 
08:07:07.850 --> 08:07:07.860 align:start position:0%
um we listen to these stories today
 
08:07:10.788 --> 08:07:10.798 align:start position:0%
we've come such a long way from the
 
08:07:14.208 --> 08:07:14.218 align:start position:0%
Mantra of safe legal and rare and now
 
08:07:16.850 --> 08:07:16.860 align:start position:0%
it's just legal doesn't need to be safe
 
08:07:19.850 --> 08:07:19.860 align:start position:0%
necessarily doesn't need to be rare it
 
08:07:21.230 --> 08:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be rare as a matter of fact to
 
08:07:22.968 --> 08:07:22.978 align:start position:0%
hear some of these stories just needs to
 
08:07:25.310 --> 08:07:25.320 align:start position:0%
be legal abortion for abortion's sake at
 
08:07:27.650 --> 08:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
any time up until the day of the baby's
 
08:07:27.660 --> 08:07:28.968 align:start position:0%
any time up until the day of the baby's
birth

08:07:28.968 --> 08:07:28.978 align:start position:0%
birth
 
08:07:28.978 --> 08:07:29.810 align:start position:0%
birth
um

08:07:29.810 --> 08:07:29.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
08:07:32.388 --> 08:07:32.398 align:start position:0%
and what's especially not feminist about
 
08:07:34.250 --> 08:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
this is the term that I heard over and
 
08:07:35.868 --> 08:07:35.878 align:start position:0%
over again today
 
08:07:38.448 --> 08:07:38.458 align:start position:0%
they're racing woman and mother from
 
08:07:40.490 --> 08:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
this equation and I find that tragic
 
08:07:42.770 --> 08:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
again and again I heard
 
08:07:45.770 --> 08:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
um pregnant people pregnant individual
 
08:07:48.530 --> 08:07:48.540 align:start position:0%
there is dignity and Worth to Motherhood
 
08:07:51.410 --> 08:07:51.420 align:start position:0%
and and femininity that just can't
 
08:07:54.048 --> 08:07:54.058 align:start position:0%
replace and one of the cruxes of
 
08:07:57.048 --> 08:07:57.058 align:start position:0%
femininity was we recognized that we
 
08:07:59.090 --> 08:07:59.100 align:start position:0%
needed to protect the life in our womb
 
08:08:01.730 --> 08:08:01.740 align:start position:0%
in fact womb was a synonym for a safe
 
08:08:03.590 --> 08:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
place for for as long as I can remember
 
08:08:04.910 --> 08:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
as long as the English language has been
 
08:08:04.920 --> 08:08:06.170 align:start position:0%
as long as the English language has been
around

08:08:06.170 --> 08:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
around
 
08:08:08.330 --> 08:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
but for some reason and I don't
 
08:08:09.830 --> 08:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
understand that women have just
 
08:08:11.990 --> 08:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
abdicated their role as Protectors of
 
08:08:14.208 --> 08:08:14.218 align:start position:0%
life in their womb and so unfortunately
 
08:08:16.430 --> 08:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
that means it falls to you
 
08:08:19.490 --> 08:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
and I encourage you to just vote itl on
 
08:08:22.128 --> 08:08:22.138 align:start position:0%
this it will essentially got and repeal
 
08:08:25.250 --> 08:08:25.260 align:start position:0%
the FPL fpla and leave us with abortion
 
08:08:27.230 --> 08:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
up until the moment of birth in the
 
08:08:29.930 --> 08:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
company of some very bad
 
08:08:31.850 --> 08:08:31.860 align:start position:0%
actors in the world that do not respect
 
08:08:33.708 --> 08:08:33.718 align:start position:0%
human lives at all and it has a terrible
 
08:08:35.690 --> 08:08:35.700 align:start position:0%
effect bleeding across all of society
 
08:08:37.730 --> 08:08:37.740 align:start position:0%
when you don't respect human life thank
 
08:08:41.750 --> 08:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
08:08:44.208 --> 08:08:44.218 align:start position:0%
seeing none I have actually have two
 
08:08:46.128 --> 08:08:46.138 align:start position:0%

it was the yellow flag signaling a
penalty

08:12:34.610 --> 08:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
penalty
 
08:12:37.430 --> 08:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
not just any penalty but one that
 
08:12:39.830 --> 08:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
changed the outcome of a game that names

hold or a small hold that call was made
 
08:13:00.650 --> 08:13:00.660 align:start position:0%
to maintain the Integrity of the game a
 
08:13:03.410 --> 08:13:03.420 align:start position:0%

08:13:07.430 --> 08:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
message on my phone and it says oops it
 
08:13:09.468 --> 08:13:09.478 align:start position:0%
says I only have five more minutes

controversial topic and all the emotion
 
08:13:30.250 --> 08:13:30.260 align:start position:0%

08:13:37.788 --> 08:13:37.798 align:start position:0%
worthy of acknowledgment
 
08:13:41.690 --> 08:13:41.700 align:start position:0%
and protection and why not the penalty
 
08:13:45.170 --> 08:13:45.180 align:start position:0%
