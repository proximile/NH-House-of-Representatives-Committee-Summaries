offshore wind industry
 
00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:45.759 align:start position:0%

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 align:start position:0%

on may 19th and uh so this is a
 
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.909 align:start position:0%
on may 19th and uh so this is a
particularly

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 align:start position:0%
timely legislation to make sure new
 
00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:28.950 align:start position:0%
timely legislation to make sure new
hampshire

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh appropriately takes actions that it
 
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
can take to protect our interests in the
 
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
development of
 
00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
gulf of maine
 
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
offshore wind and there has been
 
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
acceleration in development of the
 
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
industry up and down the east coast and
 
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
so they're beginning to take shape of a
 
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
schedule that we might see
 
00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
lease areas identified in 2024
 
00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:51.350 align:start position:0%
lease areas identified in 2024
and

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
there already has been area identified
 
00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
by the state of maine and it's
 
00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
unsolicited and separate proposal for an
 
00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
offshore wind research site which could
 
00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
also impact our fishermen and
 
00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:02.469 align:start position:0%
also impact our fishermen and
environmental

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
environmental
 
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
interests so there's a lot going on and
 
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
it seemed that we needed to take some
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
some actions and we really need to
 
00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
consider the energy economic and
 
00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
environmental concerns that will come
 
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
with offshore wind and what kind of
 
00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
regulatory authority we want to have
 
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
over those issues and then also over
 
00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:22.950 align:start position:0%
over those issues and then also over
how

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
these contracts come in and the criteria
 
00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
by which they are judged by the puc so
 
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
we are protecting our new hampshire
 
00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
interests um and i will say that you
 
00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
know governor sununu while expressing
 
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
his support for
 
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
offshore wind development has always
 
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
made it uh absolutely clear that he
 
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
wants to make sure particularly that our
 
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
fisheries but also other environmental
 
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
issues and also issues of transit for
 
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
getting in and out of our our ports
 
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:51.749 align:start position:0%
getting in and out of our our ports
are

00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:51.759 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
protected and this is appropriate what
 
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
for us to do
 
00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
now the heart of this bill gets at the
 
00:07:59.430 --> 00:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
fact that
 
00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
we have authority for regulation
 
00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
over state waters out to three miles but
 
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
then the federal zone
 
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.710 align:start position:0%
then the federal zone
begins

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
begins
 
00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:11.919 align:start position:0%
but under a process called consistency
 
00:08:13.670 --> 00:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
states can declare
 
00:08:15.909 --> 00:08:15.919 align:start position:0%
an economic and environmental interest
 
00:08:18.309 --> 00:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
in federal waters out to 200 miles and
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
then assert its regulatory authority
 
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
over those waters
 
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
you'll see the reference to federal
 
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.309 align:start position:0%
you'll see the reference to federal
statutes

00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
15 cfr 930 53 and 15 cfr
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
923 84. and i think we're going to hear
 
00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
from later testimony these are very
 
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:39.760 align:start position:0%
specific criteria by which you can do
 
00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.029 align:start position:0%
specific criteria by which you can do
this

00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:41.039 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
and what impacts that you can have in
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
that process but it does give the state
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
really an extraordinary power to make
 
00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
sure that its interests are protected
 
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
even out into
 
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
into federal waters
 
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
and um so this bill results from a lot
 
00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
of discussions with assistant
 
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner sanborn who's really taken
 
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
the lead on an offshore win for
 
00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
for the governor and uh has been working
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
tirelessly to make sure that the
 
00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
fisheries and other
 
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
environmental interests are protected as
 
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
we move forward uh potentially on
 
00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.590 align:start position:0%
we move forward uh potentially on
offshore

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
offshore
 
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
wind so um we met with um
 
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519 align:start position:0%
sheree patterson and uh of of um
 
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
of the um fish and game eric chapman of
 
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
um the sea grant program and other folks
 
00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.030 align:start position:0%
um the sea grant program and other folks
in

00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
des of course and uh in the department
 
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
of energy to see what what kind of bill
 
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
could we develop that would see to these
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
interests and this is the approach that
 
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
we came up
 
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
up with um first so the pieces of the
 
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.269 align:start position:0%
up with um first so the pieces of the
bill

00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
that you will see here first that we
 
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
created an existing um
 
00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
coastal fund and coastal program in
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
statute and it seemed this is the
 
00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate place to exercise that
 
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
authority um we have a coastal fund and
 
00:09:57.269 --> 00:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
if there are
 
00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
funds for mitigation and for
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
environmental concerns that come from
 
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
the industry or from the federal
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
government we need a place to put those
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
and so therefore we also need a an
 
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
advisory group which decides how those
 
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
funds should be used to help mitigate
 
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
impacts and help our fisheries and so
 
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
forth so that's what you see in the
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
first part of um of the of the bill on
 
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.069 align:start position:0%
first part of um of the of the bill on
page

00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:10:20.079 --> 00:10:21.509 align:start position:0%
page
one

00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:21.519 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
and then secondly uh gets into this part
 
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
about the declaring consistency so
 
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
starting at the bottom of page one line
 
00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.750 align:start position:0%
starting at the bottom of page one line
26

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
26
 
00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
notes the geographic location
 
00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
description the gld which is the term
 
00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
that is used in declaring consistency
 
00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
and so the top of page two
 
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
it says that we will use the power that
 
00:10:50.069 --> 00:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
we do have to declare consistency
 
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
related to the development of offshore
 
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
wind energy in the gulf
 
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
of of maine
 
00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
um and so how we're going to determine
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
what our interests are so that's what
 
00:11:02.069 --> 00:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
you see on page two
 
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
this list of uh questions that is
 
00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.350 align:start position:0%
this list of uh questions that is
conditioned

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
conditioned
 
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
in part by what we're allowed to do
 
00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:12.079 align:start position:0%
under consistency and also attempts to
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
identify those particular areas that we
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
need to look at in terms of fish fish
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
marine mammals reptiles birds habitats
 
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
and landmarks
 
00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
what where they are what our specific
 
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
interests are
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
what are the activities that we have
 
00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:31.839 align:start position:0%
that overlap with potential activities
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
of offshore
 
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh when what those impacts um
 
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh will be and uh why
 
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.150 align:start position:0%
uh will be and uh why
um

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
we may need some mitigation
 
00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
there and what again the data analysis
 
00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
is going to be need needed to track
 
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
fisheries and other
 
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
effects out out there
 
00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
so that's the body that will be
 
00:11:56.629 --> 00:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
empowered to do
 
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
this work and then some definition of
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
mitigation and impacted communities and
 
00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:05.839 align:start position:0%
and so on towards the end there
 
00:12:08.629 --> 00:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
so just to say in conclusion um you know
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
why we need to do this well
 
00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
we will then have this tool these tools
 
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
in our tool chest we will know what the
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
situation is and then the tie-in
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh to the puc and with the previous bill
 
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
that you have heard senate bill 440.
 
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire and the legislature i
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
think needs to be have the capacity here
 
00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
to determine okay if this is what we say
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
we want for new hampshire interests then
 
00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
the puc in reviewing contracts for
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
offshore wind
 
00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
needs to respect these criteria
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
we do this in other areas and
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
it's an essential tie-in i think between
 
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
senate bill 268 and senate bill 240
 
00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:52.720 align:start position:0%
because between those two
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
um with the department of energy and 440
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
developing criteria
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
and then the consistency criteria
 
00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:01.839 align:start position:0%
environmental control in this bill that
 
00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
they come together to represent our
 
00:13:05.829 --> 00:13:05.839 align:start position:0%
positions and i think frankly the
 
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
governor's positions on offshore wind
 
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
as well so um with that mr chairman we
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
got to take any questions that the
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
committee may have
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
senator for introducing this bill i'm
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
sure representative harrington has a
 
00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:21.519 align:start position:0%
question or two
 
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my uh question
 
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh to me the the intent of the the big
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
part of this bill is in their page one
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
lines three through six
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
and it says prior to approving purchase
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
power agreements for offshore energy and
 
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
wind now as you're well aware where new
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
england is now uh merchant uh
 
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
power producers in that the public
 
00:13:46.310 --> 00:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
utilities commission doesn't say go
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
build a plant and we'll make sure you
 
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
get your money uh someone goes builds a
 
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
plant and they try to sell it to the
 
00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.670 align:start position:0%
plant and they try to sell it to the
utilities

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
how would this change that
 
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:56.949 align:start position:0%
how would this change that
and

00:13:56.949 --> 00:13:56.959 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:59.750 --> 00:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
why is it necessary uh if people are
 
00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:01.519 align:start position:0%
willing to spend their own money to
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
build solar wind natural gas plants why
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
do we need special provisions for
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
offshore wind if it's a good deal then
 
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
people will invest their money
 
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
and they won't have to be forced to do
 
00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.150 align:start position:0%
and they won't have to be forced to do
it

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative for your
 
00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.590 align:start position:0%
well thank you representative for your
question

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:19.519 align:start position:0%
over here okay peter you got a big head
 
00:14:21.509 --> 00:14:21.519 align:start position:0%
yeah i see yeah but um
 
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:25.519 align:start position:0%
uh but but thanks for the question and
 
00:14:25.519 --> 00:14:26.470 align:start position:0%
uh but but thanks for the question and
um

00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
let me know that of course you're right
 
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
that developers develop and they try to
 
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.870 align:start position:0%
that developers develop and they try to
find

00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
find
 
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
contract for power to be sold from the
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
power power source that they've
 
00:14:37.199 --> 00:14:38.550 align:start position:0%
power power source that they've
developed

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
developed
 
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
but we already provide direction to the
 
00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.430 align:start position:0%
but we already provide direction to the
poc

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
poc
 
00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.629 align:start position:0%
poc
for

00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:14:46.629 --> 00:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
for these for contracts
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
um you know we do that and so what's
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
different here
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
is because this is offshore wind energy
 
00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
and there are new issues around it
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
that are environmental in a different
 
00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.710 align:start position:0%
that are environmental in a different
way

00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
and in particular in this case you know
 
00:15:02.629 --> 00:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
somebody who's going to build a you know
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
a new gas-fired plant or you know
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
something on land we have all that
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
regulation right
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
um but if it's out
 
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
well these are going to be what 30 40 50
 
00:15:15.269 --> 00:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
miles out maybe 100 miles out when you
 
00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
think about the
 
00:15:16.639 --> 00:15:17.990 align:start position:0%
think about the
research

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
array that um you know in terms of
 
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
not out from the shore necessarily but
 
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh that the research array is
 
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
down east of ways but we have people
 
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
will fish out there so why this is
 
00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
needed then is to say okay we have these
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
interests in these areas
 
00:15:35.519 --> 00:15:36.550 align:start position:0%
interests in these areas
that

00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
can only be regulated under
 
00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
this consistency provision
 
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
and if we define those interests then we
 
00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:46.720 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that the puc
 
00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
takes consideration of them when it
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
proves this kind of contract so it's
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
representative it's kind of it is kind
 
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
of business as usual
 
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
but with this
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
provision now for something that's
 
00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519 align:start position:0%
different because we can do consistency
 
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah just so okay that's
 
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
that's very helpful thank you very much
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
so what you're basically saying then if
 
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
i've got it correct
 
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
um the it's business as usual as far as
 
00:16:15.189 --> 00:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
the utility would come to the puc and
 
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
say here's a purchase power agreement
 
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
that we've signed you have to look at it
 
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
to make sure it's in the best interest
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
of the ratepayers of new hampshire
 
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
but there's certain provisions that are
 
00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
different because it's offshore wind
 
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
which is kind of obviously a new
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
phenomenon but you're not
 
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't intent like in
 
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
massachusetts where the utilities were
 
00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
basically told in other states as well
 
00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:39.759 align:start position:0%
you must buy the output of these there's
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
there's no must buy in this
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
no thanks for your question no there's
 
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
no there's no this is not a procurement
 
00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:46.389 align:start position:0%
no there's no this is not a procurement
mandate

00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and i'll just add as
 
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
as well that um you know it's also
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
important here too that
 
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
we r we recognize and we do this in
 
00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:55.839 align:start position:0%
other places as well that lines five and
 
00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
six where you know there are some
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
studies that have to be done and uh the
 
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
poc often asks for you know in terms of
 
00:17:03.749 --> 00:17:03.759 align:start position:0%
reviewing contracts asked for certain
 
00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
information and studies and this says
 
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
yeah you know the utilities ought to in
 
00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:10.640 align:start position:0%
in their contracts bear the costs that
 
00:17:12.789 --> 00:17:12.799 align:start position:0%
might fall in the state of new hampshire
 
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
um to do this kind of regulatory
 
00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
activity so
 
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative callie pitts is
 
00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:23.919 align:start position:0%
i'm hiding
 
00:17:27.909 --> 00:17:27.919 align:start position:0%
um thank you senator waters uh two
 
00:17:30.789 --> 00:17:30.799 align:start position:0%
two points that i i didn't understand is
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
why do we need a special board
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
to collect
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
monies or grants when monies and grants
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
already come in
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
and the other is to
 
00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
with fisheries i would think that 200
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
miles out
 
00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
and i have fishermen in my family the
 
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.230 align:start position:0%
federal government
uh

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
regulates fisheries and fishermen
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
pretty strictly so they're looking at
 
00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
now at the same types of what impact is
 
00:18:03.909 --> 00:18:03.919 align:start position:0%
this going to have on
 
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
fishing and quotas and so do we really
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
need to re-regulate that or put that
 
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
in statute at this time
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
for your questions um representative um
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
first place is we have
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
coastal fund
 
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
but the question is if there are
 
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
substantial funds coming in
 
00:18:31.029 --> 00:18:31.039 align:start position:0%
to that fund from offshore wind
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
for mitigation or for other purposes
 
00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:33.909 align:start position:0%
for mitigation or for other purposes
then

00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:33.919 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:18:36.870 --> 00:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
how do we make sure that voices that
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
need to be heard about how to allocate
 
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
that funding are heard
 
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
and that's that's why the list
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
is is here and it's pretty extensive
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
because it's complicated out there it's
 
00:18:49.990 --> 00:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
not just a fisherman it's marine transit
 
00:18:52.470 --> 00:18:52.480 align:start position:0%
it it it might also be there's a lot of
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
cabling out there already um so you know
 
00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
where where is uh the power going to be
 
00:18:59.830 --> 00:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
on short and what regulation do we have
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
over that as it might impact um marine
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
transit lanes or
 
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
fisheries or other things as well
 
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
and then secondly you know i am on the
 
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
atlantic coast marines fisheries
 
00:19:12.789 --> 00:19:12.799 align:start position:0%
commission which uh manages fisheries
 
00:19:12.799 --> 00:19:13.909 align:start position:0%
commission which uh manages fisheries
from

00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
maine to florida i'm one of the i'm i'm
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
your legislative commissioner on that
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
that body and then we have the other
 
00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:22.549 align:start position:0%
that body and then we have the other
management

00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
management
 
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh groups out there and yes they do a
 
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
lot to regulate fisheries and stocks
 
00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:31.039 align:start position:0%
but this is this is different because
 
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not interested in putting a lot of
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
new regulations on fishermen right
 
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
that's what that this is about this is
 
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
about making sure that the fishing
 
00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.630 align:start position:0%
about making sure that the fishing
bottom

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
is identified and protected to the
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
extent that we can so their economic
 
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.549 align:start position:0%
extent that we can so their economic
livelihood

00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
livelihood
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
is not unduly impacted and that that is
 
00:19:52.630 --> 00:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
just crucial we need that for consistent
 
00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:55.039 align:start position:0%
that's why we do consistency because
 
00:19:55.039 --> 00:19:56.230 align:start position:0%
that's why we do consistency because
otherwise

00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
we have no guarantee that the
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
federal government is going to
 
00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily protect
 
00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
our fishermen and the way we want them
 
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
protected and i think you're going to
 
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
hear from assistant commissioner sanborn
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
as well that you know under the bone
 
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
process he has been working you know
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
tirelessly with other states
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
to um do stakeholder impact studies
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
which is an extensive process but there
 
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.470 align:start position:0%
which is an extensive process but there
again

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
you know we we need a tool that says
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
we have authority to protect new
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire interests so this is a i think
 
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
you need to follow
 
00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
up representative samson is recognized
 
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
waters uh just a clarification in in the
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
talk about a
 
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
coastal program
 
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
and there's talk about an agency
 
00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:55.039 align:start position:0%
advisory board
 
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
can you
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
tell me a little bit about what the
 
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
well we have the coastal program that's
 
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
only in existence yeah which you which
 
00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:09.039 align:start position:0%
maybe you'll hear about from concepts
 
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
when we and we the coastal program has
 
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
been a federal entity which has been set
 
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
up for years to help
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
coastal communities deal with federal
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
regulation and to support the
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
sustainability of their
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
you know their fisheries theirs their
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
uses of the shoreline
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
water waste treatment all those kinds of
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
things it's it's me it gets funding from
 
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
the feds and uh helps communities out
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
with with what they have to do so what
 
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
this is doing is saying yes we have that
 
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
in statute now that's what
 
00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:44.559 align:start position:0%
we did i guess two years ago now
 
00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:46.720 align:start position:0%
but this says okay within that program
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
for this particular purpose we have this
 
00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
board set up
 
00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
for the funds that may come in about
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
offshore win to make to to offer advice
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
for that fund how to
 
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
how to deal with the money
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee is recognized for a
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you mr chairman and thank
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
you senator for taking my question
 
00:22:11.909 --> 00:22:11.919 align:start position:0%
um i you know
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
we often use the term enabling
 
00:22:15.669 --> 00:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
legislation and from the description
 
00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
that you've given it seems to me as
 
00:22:20.149 --> 00:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
though we're taking what we know at this
 
00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
point and putting it into this
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
legislation in order to
 
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
affirm how we're moving forward
 
00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.630 align:start position:0%
affirm how we're moving forward
um

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
by giving definition to the things that
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
are lacking right now in the statute
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
would that be an accurate
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
characterization of what this bill is
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
trying to do thank you representative
 
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
but and i think important to notice here
 
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
is is that this issue of consistency
 
00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
is it is ex it really provides an
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
extraordinary opportunity for us to
 
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
protect our
 
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
our interests so
 
00:22:51.669 --> 00:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
um and i it's not technically enabling
 
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
because there is
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
you know the the coastal program
 
00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
and the des are able
 
00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
under the federal statute the state can
 
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
declare consistency okay
 
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
but how it is done when it is done
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
and what the criteria are
 
00:23:10.310 --> 00:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
is what this becomes powerful it is very
 
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
timely as well as you might imagine our
 
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
our fishermen in the fishing communities
 
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
up and down the coast are shall i say
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
just really freaked you know
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
because they're they're beleaguered in a
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
lot of ways for all kinds of reasons and
 
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
now here comes offshore wind potentially
 
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
so this is important right now before
 
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
this leasing process begins to say we've
 
00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
got your back okay
 
00:23:33.679 --> 00:23:34.830 align:start position:0%
got your back okay
thank

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:36.470 align:start position:0%
thank
you

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
additional questions for the senator
 
00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:43.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
thank you chief
 
00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
thank you senator waters uh
 
00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
in committee was there any
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
um discussion on kinetic wave energy for
 
00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.789 align:start position:0%
um discussion on kinetic wave energy for
um

00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
producing power
 
00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
this is just when it seemed like it was
 
00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
just for wind thank you
 
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
question this is just about wind because
 
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
the context right now is the bureau of
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
ocean energy management governor soon
 
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
who called for the task force we've got
 
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
the task force it's meeting and that's
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
the body that's going to establish for
 
00:24:16.230 --> 00:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
this kind of wind energy i think the the
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
kinetico wave is it boy that's
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
interesting technology there's some
 
00:24:21.269 --> 00:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
experimentation being done now off of
 
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
the coast of scotland with it and uh
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
and other places as well so um but that
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
too when when the time comes that will
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
be have to have to be regulated but this
 
00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
bill actually with consistency
 
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
would also let us i think give us a leg
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh representative partial has a question
 
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
thank you chair for taking my question
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
with consistency
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
would could you see a potential
 
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
situation down the line
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
where the state will be in a situation
 
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
of defending
 
00:24:59.909 --> 00:24:59.919 align:start position:0%
um states rights to our citizens over
 
00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
federal regulations such as migratory
 
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
bird patterns or
 
00:25:05.669 --> 00:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
exhausting the fisheries could you see
 
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
us being at odds with the federal
 
00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
government were we to claim consistency
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
out between miles
 
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
well thanks for the question and i think
 
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
some others may be able to address that
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
more more particularly but you know i
 
00:25:18.390 --> 00:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
mean this is one of the advantages of
 
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
this kind of bill and having consistency
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
that you you can get into court if you
 
00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
rather than just the hammer coming down
 
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
and save my way of the highway
 
00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
and so i think that you know that i mean
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
that's always a negotiation isn't it
 
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
between states and federal regulation
 
00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.310 align:start position:0%
between states and federal regulation
right

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:35.919 align:start position:0%
so i i would hope that the federal
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
government will understand the infinite
 
00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you okay follow-up by the same
 
00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
token i would hope that new hampshire
 
00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
will understand there are issues that
 
00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.190 align:start position:0%
will understand there are issues that
sometimes

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
are better handled on the federal level
 
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
um such as some environmental concerns
 
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so i think that i could see it
 
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
going both ways thank you representative
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
and i think that that's why
 
00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:05.039 align:start position:0%
you know that language on page two is is
 
00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
really um geared to what
 
00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
you know i mean the the consistency
 
00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:12.559 align:start position:0%
under the federal statute wants to make
 
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
sure this is a process that
 
00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
is reasonable and not likely to you know
 
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
lead to
 
00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
controversy and so on and that's why
 
00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
those categories are important because
 
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
it it's kind of these are the guardrails
 
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
these are the kinds of things you can do
 
00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:30.230 align:start position:0%
these are the kinds of things you can do
um

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
i have a question
 
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
on lines
 
00:26:37.269 --> 00:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
eight through eleven
 
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
yep the bill talks about
 
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
funds being deposited in a fund
 
00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
established under paragraph one
 
00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.710 align:start position:0%
established under paragraph one
what

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
legislation establishes that fund
 
00:26:54.430 --> 00:26:54.440 align:start position:0%
because i looked in rsa
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
362h2 didn't find it there
 
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
is it under rsa 485 somewhere yeah yeah
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
no it is okay yeah and that was part of
 
00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:04.549 align:start position:0%
no it is okay yeah and that was part of
the

00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:07.029 --> 00:27:07.039 align:start position:0%
coastal program bill that we passed two
 
00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:08.559 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
so the second question is on lines 23
 
00:27:14.789 --> 00:27:14.799 align:start position:0%
through 25
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
that authorizes the
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services to
 
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
deduct administrative charges from that
 
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.990 align:start position:0%
deduct administrative charges from that
fund

00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
to ensure proper oversight and
 
00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.630 align:start position:0%
to ensure proper oversight and
administration

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
administration
 
00:27:32.070 --> 00:27:32.080 align:start position:0%
what is your assessment of
 
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
how much money is involved would be
 
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.630 align:start position:0%
i don't know
um

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:44.789 --> 00:27:44.799 align:start position:0%
you know we don't i mean i may be
 
00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
corrected later on but i
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
some of the see the funding that has
 
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.029 align:start position:0%
some of the see the funding that has
been

00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:51.039 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
accrued from the offshore wind industry
 
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
by states like massachusetts or
 
00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
connecticut or
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
now new jersey rhode island and
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
then so for new york
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
um have been under
 
00:28:03.909 --> 00:28:03.919 align:start position:0%
um state procurement mandates
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
and they've gotten tens and tens of
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars now we're not doing
 
00:28:08.159 --> 00:28:09.350 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars now we're not doing
that

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
but i would think that
 
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
you know you would have to make a
 
00:28:16.149 --> 00:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
reasonable argument as to okay here's
 
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
the impact
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
and this is what we need is it going to
 
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
be some boat buyback is it going to be
 
00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.549 align:start position:0%
be some boat buyback is it going to be
um

00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:24.559 align:start position:0%
you know what kind of economic aid i
 
00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:27.039 align:start position:0%
mean i i i is it going to be supporting
 
00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
other kinds of fishery programs or
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
transitioning other kinds of fisheries
 
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
beats me so um
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
i think it could be i think it could be
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
relatively substantial
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
and the 10 percent here is a kind of
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
boilerplate that recognizing that you
 
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
know the state should the state be
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
paying to bring on another employee or
 
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
should the industry because you know
 
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with their
 
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
with them and that's why
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
we came here
 
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
with this figure i would imagine that if
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
it became clear later on
 
00:28:59.669 --> 00:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
that the um
 
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that might be
 
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
involved the legislature could always
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
make adjustments to that
 
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
great thank you representative callie
 
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
pitts has another question yeah i do i i
 
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
thank you consistency please correct me
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
because i'm trying to wrap my head
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
around it
 
00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
um will we be declaring
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of all matters to the 200
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
mile limit and that would include
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
anything that the federal government
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
might want to do
 
00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
so i'm thinking in the future not only
 
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
by with wind
 
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:37.039 align:start position:0%
and has any state
 
00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
other than new hampshire
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
use this constit consistency method
 
00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
and does that have to be granted or we
 
00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
just take it
 
00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
well thanks for your question um
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
it's very defined and limited
 
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
over what authority is granted under
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
consistency to the issues that you see
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
basically enumerated it's about
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
fisheries and marine resources
 
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
that we want to say that what happens in
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
federal water is consistent with state
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
authority over those those kinds of
 
00:30:10.559 --> 00:30:11.750 align:start position:0%
authority over those those kinds of
matters

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
matters
 
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
and answer to your so it's not like
 
00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
every single thing out there i mean
 
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
homeland security coast guard you know
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
et cetera et cetera et cetera have
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over a lot of these things
 
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
secondly um
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
rhode island
 
00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:27.919 align:start position:0%
uh has been in this game early
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
and it's had a major impact on what kind
 
00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919 align:start position:0%
of development could take place
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
in vineyard wind and elsewhere down
 
00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:37.029 align:start position:0%
in vineyard wind and elsewhere down
there

00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
um i'm not sure what the current count
 
00:30:41.909 --> 00:30:41.919 align:start position:0%
is but i suspect that all the states one
 
00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
way or another
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
uh will be undertaking this
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
can i follow
 
00:30:51.029 --> 00:30:51.039 align:start position:0%
okay i have okay all the other states
 
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
has any other state officially
 
00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.269 align:start position:0%
has any other state officially
claimed

00:30:55.269 --> 00:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
claimed
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
this consistency privilege and i think
 
00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
rhode island rhode island yeah that's
 
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
right okay and there may be more about i
 
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
but i know about rhode island okay and
 
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
where i was going was drilling because
 
00:31:07.509 --> 00:31:07.519 align:start position:0%
that would have impact on
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
other things so that that was just one
 
00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
of the s the sidebars
 
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
but thank you rhode island has declared
 
00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:15.350 align:start position:0%
but thank you rhode island has declared
it

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
and did they have to be granted it or
 
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
would they just say it
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
well you'll hear from des about this
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
process okay we do have the authority
 
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
but what's important if you're going to
 
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
assert the authority is to do it
 
00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
right and that's what this bill
 
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
does thank you
 
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
representative harrington has another
 
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you mr chairman i think
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
you've taken my question senator is it
 
00:31:39.679 --> 00:31:40.389 align:start position:0%
you've taken my question senator is it
just

00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
a statement saying if i'm right or wrong
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
on this is the consistency basically
 
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
gives us a seat at the table is that the
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
best way to describe it
 
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
thanks for the question i think it does
 
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
a lot more than that yeah okay because
 
00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
we we we come to the table with some
 
00:31:55.909 --> 00:31:55.919 align:start position:0%
power okay great follow-up
 
00:31:57.269 --> 00:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh in
 
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
page one paragraph line eight it says
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
all money is collected by the state to
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
mitigate and it goes on from there
 
00:32:06.149 --> 00:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
collected under who are they collecting
 
00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
from and under what vehicle are we
 
00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:11.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:11.919 --> 00:32:12.830 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
um that
 
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
it could be
 
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
entirely from the industry
 
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
excuse me when you say industry you mean
 
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
offshore yeah the developers
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
it also could be
 
00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:29.519 align:start position:0%
federal funding there has been a lot of
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
talk you may hear more from
 
00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner sanborn about
 
00:32:34.159 --> 00:32:35.909 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner sanborn about
appropriations

00:32:35.909 --> 00:32:35.919 align:start position:0%
appropriations
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
coming from the federal government to
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
help fisheries which has been done in
 
00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
other circumstances previously
 
00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:44.799 align:start position:0%
you may remember the boat buyback from
 
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
what 10 years ago now
 
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
um so that would be another potential
 
00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
source as well so the it hasn't been
 
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
defined yet but what you're saying if
 
00:32:55.509 --> 00:32:55.519 align:start position:0%
and when these monies become available
 
00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
this is what we do yeah
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
okay great senator thank you very much
 
00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:03.519 align:start position:0%
for introducing this bill
 
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
and we have a few more questions i'm
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
sure but we'll get those answered by our
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
next testifier and i'll be back for 269
 
00:33:12.549 --> 00:33:12.559 align:start position:0%
in a few minutes okay great thank you
 
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here
 
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
so with that we'll call now call on the
 
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner of the department
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
of environmental services mark sanborn
 
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
to give us his perspective on this
 
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
legislation good morning commissioner
 
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
good morning chairman uh for the record
 
00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
mark sanborn assistant commissioner des
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
i know you guys have a lot of bills
 
00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
today so i'll
 
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
hone in for my testimony on a couple of
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
the issues that have been brought up and
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
in your conversation with senator waters
 
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
first and foremost i would suggest that
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
whether you think of wind in the gulf of
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
maine is a great idea you're agnostic or
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
you think it's a terrible idea i would
 
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
still suggest that supporting this bill
 
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
is in the best interest of the state
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
because i would call this bill a bill
 
00:33:59.110 --> 00:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
that protects us more than that this is
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
legislation that protects us
 
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
um a couple specific things
 
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
the key with why senator waters bill is
 
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
so important is
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
you can only claim federal consistency
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
if you are relying on existing state law
 
00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
state statute so that is why passing
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
this is so critical
 
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
yes we regulate out to three miles
 
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
but the concept of federal consistency
 
00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
is because
 
00:34:31.270 --> 00:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
um impacts for commercial interests
 
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
either be economic or environmental
 
00:34:37.589 --> 00:34:37.599 align:start position:0%
safety etc extend well beyond those
 
00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
three miles the concept of federal
 
00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
consistency is
 
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
if there is going to be an impact in
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
federal waters to your states on any of
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
those fronts
 
00:34:49.510 --> 00:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
you do have the right to claim federal
 
00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.869 align:start position:0%
you do have the right to claim federal
consistency

00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
consistency
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
you can't claim federal consistency on
 
00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
anything you don't have a state statute
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
defining that so we couldn't right now
 
00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
nothing exists in state statute about
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
protecting commercial interest of
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
commercial fishermen
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
if you put something like offshore or
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
offshore wind a farm
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
so because we don't have that in state
 
00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
statute we couldn't
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
apply for federal consistency with the
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
right now so that's why this is so
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
important because
 
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
there could be gulf of there could be
 
00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
offshore wind in the gulf of maine the
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
federal government and one of the other
 
00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
gulf of maine states could move forward
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
whether we like it or not
 
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
so this allows us to
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
i do like your term
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative harrington have a seat at
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
the table
 
00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
if offshore wind is moved forward with
 
00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
and we're not a part of it
 
00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:50.800 align:start position:0%
we could also be a part of the
 
00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.310 align:start position:0%
we could also be a part of the
conversation

00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
massachusetts could decide to move
 
00:35:56.069 --> 00:35:56.079 align:start position:0%
forward with procurement want our
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
support for that procurement and the
 
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
lease through boem and we could have an
 
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
agreement with massachusetts that our
 
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
commercial fishermen would be part of
 
00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
any mitigation they work out with the
 
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
developer um that's
 
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
there have been many models even though
 
00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
it's been a
 
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
we have a short history here in new in
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
the united states on offshore wind there
 
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
are some examples
 
00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.109 align:start position:0%
are some examples
and

00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
um there are many examples where the
 
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
state procuring it um the energy is
 
00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
going to a different uh it is being
 
00:36:31.349 --> 00:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
transmitted to a different state
 
00:36:32.950 --> 00:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
there's already a number of models that
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
are being worked out there so this
 
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:36.640 align:start position:0%
allows us under
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
any case where offshore wind is moved
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
forward with in the gulf of maine
 
00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
whether we're part of the procurement or
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
not whether we're part of the leasing
 
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
agreement or not to be able to play and
 
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
you actually apply for federal
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
consistency with noaa not boehm noah is
 
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
the federal agency that
 
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
regulates federal consistency to say
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
there's a safety economic
 
00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.390 align:start position:0%
there's a safety economic
um

00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:00.390 --> 00:37:00.400 align:start position:0%
any sort of impact
 
00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
in with something happening in federal
 
00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:05.589 align:start position:0%
in with something happening in federal
waters

00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
the fund's been brought up a number of
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
times the model for what's in this
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
legislation is rhode island rhode island
 
00:37:13.829 --> 00:37:13.839 align:start position:0%
is the only state right now that has in
 
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
the united states that has an active
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
wind farm it's very small by these
 
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
scales but it is active
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
they when the developer
 
00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
came in and and had an agreement this
 
00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
was the way they handled the mitigation
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
for their commercial fishermen they set
 
00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
up a fund the developer put the funds in
 
00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
that fund and then it was regulated
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
based on with the state
 
00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:37.349 align:start position:0%
based on with the state
so

00:37:37.349 --> 00:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:37.359 --> 00:37:38.390 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
to the one of the questions yes we have
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
ways of receiving grants and loans but
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
this would be a mechanism to
 
00:37:45.599 --> 00:37:46.470 align:start position:0%
this would be a mechanism to
um

00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.510 align:start position:0%
um
handle

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
handle
 
00:37:49.829 --> 00:37:49.839 align:start position:0%
monies from private companies and
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
developers that would be set up
 
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
and right now because the federal
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
government actually doesn't regulate
 
00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.069 align:start position:0%
government actually doesn't regulate
commercial

00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
mitigation they're working on guidance
 
00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
but there are no federal statutes or
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
regs on this it is done in the
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
negotiations for every individual
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
the last
 
00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
item i want to touch directly and then
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:23.030 --> 00:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned earlier the key to this
 
00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
legislation is
 
00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
it puts in state statute the items that
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
if impacted in federal waters we would
 
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
want a voice in whether we're part of
 
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
the procurement or not
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
and that is the key to this legislation
 
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
in my opinion that's what we based it on
 
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
all the issues that the senator waters
 
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
included in the draft were based on all
 
00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
of the stakeholder issues that have been
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
brought up to us in the conversation
 
00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
asking our new hampshire stakeholders
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
asking us
 
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
to protect their interests
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
regardless of how the conversation moves
 
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
forward with that i'll answer questions
 
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner do we have
 
00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
questions for the commissioner
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
i would point out that
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not on the bill so i can ask
 
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
questions the the question that i would
 
00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
ask is will this
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
as i envision an offshore wind
 
00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:21.030 align:start position:0%
as i envision an offshore wind
farm

00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
farm
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
would this also
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
give us greater control over
 
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
interconnection points so where this
 
00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
um where out the cables are strung and
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
where this particular
 
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
type of energy would come into
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:41.109 align:start position:0%
the state
well

00:39:41.109 --> 00:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
yes it would would it give us additional
 
00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:44.710 align:start position:0%
yes it would would it give us additional
control

00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
control
 
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
i i want to be careful
 
00:39:49.589 --> 00:39:49.599 align:start position:0%
about usually the term control
 
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:52.640 align:start position:0%
it would give us a seat at the table
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
where those conversations are happening
 
00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
and allow us to at least express
 
00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.790 align:start position:0%
and allow us to at least express
how

00:39:58.790 --> 00:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:40:01.589 --> 00:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
any of the issues again
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
economic energy transmission
 
00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
it would let us be at the table to
 
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
discuss how that would impact new
 
00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.630 align:start position:0%
discuss how that would impact new
hampshire

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:10.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
and put forward our voice if there was a
 
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
negative impact to us on any of those
 
00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:19.270 align:start position:0%
negative impact to us on any of those
fronts

00:40:19.270 --> 00:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative harrington has a question
 
00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:40:25.829 --> 00:40:25.839 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh this is a little
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
bit outside of the scope but i figure
 
00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
while i'll get you here i might as well
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
ask you sure um
 
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
with this with reference to what the
 
00:40:35.589 --> 00:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
previous speaker uh questioned is
 
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
we have we obviously have a site
 
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee in new hampshire as
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
existing statute
 
00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
how would that impact
 
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
offshore wind would that be controlled
 
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
if it was only within three miles of the
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
new hampshire border obviously if the
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
transmission lands in new hampshire i'm
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
assuming that would be going to their
 
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
guys but what about something that's the
 
00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
20 or 40 or 50 miles offshore
 
00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so that that would any of the
 
00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
sighting and leasing in federal waters
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
um this would this would not impact um
 
00:41:07.510 --> 00:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
that is the purview of bone that's
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
that that we are in the sighting and
 
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640 align:start position:0%
leasing in the bone process for an
 
00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
offshore wind development we are in what
 
00:41:17.430 --> 00:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
is their sighting and leasing process so
 
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
on the may 19th the next meeting that's
 
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
what we're going to be discussing is
 
00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
what bone does is
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
they put out
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
an initial
 
00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:27.670 align:start position:0%
an initial
map

00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
map
 
00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
of a body of water
 
00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:31.990 align:start position:0%
of a body of water
and

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
then there is a process to work with the
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
states and the stakeholders
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
where that border that body of water on
 
00:41:41.349 --> 00:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
identifying areas
 
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
they start with the areas that should
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
not be considered for what ultimately
 
00:41:47.589 --> 00:41:47.599 align:start position:0%
will be called an energy area and you
 
00:41:50.069 --> 00:41:50.079 align:start position:0%
work your way to identifying what will
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
be called energy areas um and when boehm
 
00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
holds one of their auctions leasing
 
00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
options that's what they're leasing is
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
the the developer um applies for one of
 
00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
the identifies one or more of the energy
 
00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:06.079 align:start position:0%
areas they would like to lease and the
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
amount they're willing to pay for that
 
00:42:09.359 --> 00:42:10.470 align:start position:0%
amount they're willing to pay for that
lease

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
lease
 
00:42:12.069 --> 00:42:12.079 align:start position:0%
and that's the process we're in right
 
00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
now and right now we are
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
boom in october of last year put out a
 
00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.309 align:start position:0%
boom in october of last year put out a
schedule

00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
um for seven bodies of water for
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
auctions and the gulf of maine is one of
 
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
those uh with a timetable of an auction
 
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh sometime between the second and third
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
quarter of the calendar year in 2024
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
is right now when they're projecting um
 
00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
they would have put out um identified
 
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
energy areas and hold an auction for
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
developers to bid on
 
00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:44.390 align:start position:0%
developers to bid on
follow-up

00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah uh so it sounds like
 
00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:47.829 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah uh so it sounds like
anything

00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
where these uh win projects would
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
probably be built is going to be federal
 
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and they would regulate the
 
00:42:56.069 --> 00:42:56.079 align:start position:0%
uh setting it but eventually that uh
 
00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:58.160 align:start position:0%
power has to get to shore yep so when
 
00:43:00.069 --> 00:43:00.079 align:start position:0%
that transmission line passes within
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
three miles and hooks up to some place
 
00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
on new hampshire would the new hampshire
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
side evaluation committee have
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction yeah once he gets the
 
00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
transmission that part of it would of
 
00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
course sec under current statute would
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions representative
 
00:43:20.309 --> 00:43:20.319 align:start position:0%
lewicky uh thank you mr chairman thank
 
00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
um on the environmental impacts i know
 
00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
that over the past week or so we heard
 
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
about a major energy company being fined
 
00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars for killing golden
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
eagles and bald eagles
 
00:43:35.349 --> 00:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
um i assume that we would expect the
 
00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
same here what other environmental
 
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
impacts might there be and how serious
 
00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
might they be is there any experience
 
00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
with that yeah it was a great question
 
00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
so there is experience mainly overseas
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
not so much here
 
00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
um but what i will tell you is what
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
we're doing to address that
 
00:43:51.839 --> 00:43:52.710 align:start position:0%
we're doing to address that
um

00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
number one from a process standpoint
 
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.670 align:start position:0%
number one from a process standpoint
um

00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
and again this is defined by federal new
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire doesn't have a voice in this
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
part of the process
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
um under federal statute nepa doesn't
 
00:44:09.109 --> 00:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
happen until after the auction
 
00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
because that's when there's an actual
 
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
project an area a plan identified
 
00:44:16.630 --> 00:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
developer who will come forward with a
 
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
plan and that's when full nipple will
 
00:44:21.270 --> 00:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
happen what will happen between now
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
and uh the 24th will be some
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
environmental assessments um as part of
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
boehm's process now in addition um and i
 
00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
think i've mentioned this in front of
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
the committee a couple of times we have
 
00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
moved forward
 
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
we were able to get some arpa funding
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
and we out of the state on our own are
 
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
doing um an
 
00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
assessment study that's going to look at
 
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
offshore wind in the gulf of maine and
 
00:44:49.829 --> 00:44:49.839 align:start position:0%
it's both positive and negative impacts
 
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
in three buckets energy environmental
 
00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
economic um and um
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
and basically look at the potential
 
00:44:59.670 --> 00:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
positive negative impacts in those three
 
00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:01.030 align:start position:0%
positive negative impacts in those three
areas

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
we are in the process of reviewing the
 
00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
proposals we've received for the rfp and
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
should be able to announce an identified
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
contractor um i hope it'll get through
 
00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:12.390 align:start position:0%
contractor um i hope it'll get through
gnc

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
gnc
 
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
by summer and i and i think we'll get
 
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
results um starting next summer from
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
that so we are going to look at
 
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
the gulf of maine specifically um
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
through that and included and that will
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
be potential both positive and negative
 
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up please yes follow up
 
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh is there any experience with this
 
00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any idea whether we're
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
going to essentially be slaughtering
 
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
birds or whether it's just going to be
 
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
minimal sure sure yeah no like i said so
 
00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
um there's a great deal of experience in
 
00:45:44.319 --> 00:45:46.150 align:start position:0%
um there's a great deal of experience in
europe

00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
europe
 
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
we have the experience in rhode island
 
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
um and from a study perspective um a
 
00:45:54.069 --> 00:45:54.079 align:start position:0%
number of states have
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
moved forward with full environmental
 
00:45:58.950 --> 00:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
impact as they start their win farm so
 
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
so yes there have been wind farms in the
 
00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
world um and that'll uh
 
00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
examples i mean obviously we're going to
 
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
be looking at gulf of maine but um there
 
00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
there there is uh some level of evidence
 
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
and and materials to look at in terms of
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
wind farms that have been deployed
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
throughout the world and the impact it
 
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
has had on um
 
00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
different um habitats environmental um
 
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh indigenous species etc including
 
00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:30.390 align:start position:0%
uh indigenous species etc including
birds

00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
birds
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
thank you chair rose
 
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
um hypothetically uh
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
expanding upon um uh john oh
 
00:46:40.950 --> 00:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
representative loki's question
 
00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.390 align:start position:0%
representative loki's question
hypothetically

00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
hypothetically
 
00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:43.750 align:start position:0%
hypothetically
um

00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
suppose we have come up with our study
 
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
here in the state and we decide that
 
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
vertical axis wind generators have less
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
environmental impact on migratory birds
 
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
we asked for that stipulation to be
 
00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:56.630 align:start position:0%
we asked for that stipulation to be
within

00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
within
 
00:46:59.430 --> 00:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
the lease of whatever uh wind farm that
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
uh is going to be auctioned can we
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
insert our authority there do you
 
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
believe or was that because it's a
 
00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
federal auction
 
00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:09.440 align:start position:0%
would our authority be negated
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
let me answer that question this way
 
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned a couple times from this
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
committee i don't view my job as to
 
00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
advocate for a policy outcome i view my
 
00:47:24.549 --> 00:47:24.559 align:start position:0%
job is to gather information
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
for the policy makers and
 
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
residents and constituents and to
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
deliver it and to
 
00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
maintain our participation in the
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
federal and multi-state process so we
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
have a seat at the table
 
00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
i can assure you that right now
 
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has a fantastic
 
00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
relationship with boehm and the other
 
00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
two states involved in gulf of maine
 
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
and i work on a weekly basis
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
make making sure that the perspective
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
and the priorities of our state
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
are voiced in all those conversations
 
00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
um i will say this and you know as you
 
00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
know i've had
 
00:48:08.309 --> 00:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
most of my time has been said in the
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
federal government um this is a very i
 
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
have to give mom credit it's a very
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
collaborative process they want the
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
voices of the other folks in there
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
because the truth of the matter
 
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
bohm doesn't actually have a lot of
 
00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
statutory authority they don't have the
 
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
ability to enforce mitigation
 
00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
compensatory mitigation
 
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
they don't have specific guidelines on
 
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
final development so a lot of this is
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
done in a collaborative way based on
 
00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
negotiation between the states bone and
 
00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:41.750 align:start position:0%
negotiation between the states bone and
developers

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
developers
 
00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:44.150 align:start position:0%
developers
noaa

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
noaa
 
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:48:47.589 --> 00:48:47.599 align:start position:0%
on a safety level u.s coast guard
 
00:48:49.589 --> 00:48:49.599 align:start position:0%
defends some of the safety issues
 
00:48:53.349 --> 00:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
involving our coast and ports
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
you know not even mentioned yet a big
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
reason we're at the table is we want if
 
00:49:00.069 --> 00:49:00.079 align:start position:0%
there is going to be offshore wind we're
 
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
investing all this money in the new
 
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire port right now we want some of
 
00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:04.790 align:start position:0%
hampshire port right now we want some of
that

00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
supply chains operations to go through
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
our port and not just some of the other
 
00:49:11.109 --> 00:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
ports in new england so
 
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
the answer to your question is we are
 
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
maintaining a positive collaborative
 
00:49:20.790 --> 00:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
nature with all the parties involved so
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
all of their their know about our
 
00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
assessment they're very interested in
 
00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
the findings
 
00:49:25.359 --> 00:49:26.390 align:start position:0%
the findings
we've

00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
we've
 
00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
suggested through our delegation and our
 
00:49:28.480 --> 00:49:29.829 align:start position:0%
suggested through our delegation and our
governor

00:49:29.829 --> 00:49:29.839 align:start position:0%
governor
 
00:49:31.750 --> 00:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
boehm is doing some research items we'd
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
like to research so we will be able to
 
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
bring the information we gather to the
 
00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:36.790 align:start position:0%
bring the information we gather to the
table

00:49:36.790 --> 00:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
table
 
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:40.079 align:start position:0%
um as long as we have both the authority
 
00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
that'll be that which will be helped by
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
this legislation being passed um and by
 
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:48.160 align:start position:0%
maintaining our position within the
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:53.829 --> 00:49:53.839 align:start position:0%
one follow-up quickly thank you very
 
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
much for the follow-up so one assuming
 
00:49:57.910 --> 00:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
that if this is legislation that
 
00:49:59.349 --> 00:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
positively impacts the entire
 
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
negotiating um
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
collaboration that we're doing uh
 
00:50:05.349 --> 00:50:05.359 align:start position:0%
are you aware is maine pursuing similar
 
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
legislation or massachusetts so um so
 
00:50:11.829 --> 00:50:11.839 align:start position:0%
one thing about federal consistency um
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
federal consistency has existed before
 
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
offshore wind and like i said it's
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
actually through noah not bone federal
 
00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
consistency is something that has
 
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
existed for a while in terms of
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
a state being able to
 
00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
identify impacts that are happening in
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
federal waters so the federal
 
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
consistency part of that is this is not
 
00:50:35.109 --> 00:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
new and so
 
00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
i bet you almost every coastal state has
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
used federal consistency at one point or
 
00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:40.470 align:start position:0%
used federal consistency at one point or
another

00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:50:44.309 --> 00:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
just not for offshore wind um
 
00:50:44.319 --> 00:50:45.349 align:start position:0%
just not for offshore wind um
so

00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:45.359 --> 00:50:46.230 align:start position:0%
so
uh

00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
but yes but
 
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
this legislation allows us to put on
 
00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh on the books and in our statutes how
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
we would regulate within the three miles
 
00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
which will then allow us
 
00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:00.390 align:start position:0%
which will then allow us
to

00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
invoke federal consistency if it's done
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
outside of those three miles and whether
 
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
we move forward with it or not and i can
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
almost guarantee not only will this
 
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
project not be within three miles i
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
can't imagine it's going to be within 20
 
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
miles of the coast so this was going to
 
00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
be in federal waters
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
but it will still impact our folks and
 
00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
we need
 
00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
i would suggest
 
00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
we it would mean much in our benefit to
 
00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
have on the books the things that allow
 
00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:30.390 align:start position:0%
have on the books the things that allow
us

00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
to in the federal process say
 
00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
what you're doing in those federal
 
00:51:35.670 --> 00:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
waters is going to impact
 
00:51:37.829 --> 00:51:37.839 align:start position:0%
what are our stakeholders and our
 
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
constituents um and we'd like a voice to
 
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
make sure that those impacts are
 
00:51:44.549 --> 00:51:44.559 align:start position:0%
addressed thank you for your excellent
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%

00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
testimony from
 
00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.280 align:start position:0%

the record griffin roberts from the new
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of energy i'm not
 
00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
going to take up too much of the
 
00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
committee's time i think senator waters
 
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:43.750 align:start position:0%
and uh
commissioner

00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:43.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:52:46.069 --> 00:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
uh sanborn spoke to this plenty enough
 
00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
the department is in support
 
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
for many of the reasons as expressed by
 
00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
the previous speakers
 
00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
we just view this as
 
00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:55.430 align:start position:0%
we just view this as
another

00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
tool in the toolbox i guess to make sure
 
00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire's interests are well
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
represented when it comes to offshore
 
00:53:02.549 --> 00:53:02.559 align:start position:0%
wind energy sighting and with that happy
 
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
any questions for the representative
 
00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
from the department of energy
 
00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:15.760 align:start position:0%

00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:23.839 align:start position:0%
would like to do now
 
00:53:23.839 --> 00:53:24.630 align:start position:0%
would like to do now
is

00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%

00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:28.800 align:start position:0%

00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:29.910 align:start position:0%
of everyone on the committee who is here
today

00:53:29.910 --> 00:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
about whether you support this bill or
 
00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.030 align:start position:0%
about whether you support this bill or
not

00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:53:35.109 --> 00:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
so everybody who would support this bill
 
00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you looks like we have near
 
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
unanimous support so i would now ask uh
 
00:53:52.390 --> 00:53:52.400 align:start position:0%
representative samsuch as the ranking
 
00:53:54.069 --> 00:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
member how would you feel about going
 
00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
does anybody have a comment about going
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
into exec session on this bill
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
i feel that this committee has always uh
 
00:54:14.309 --> 00:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
announced executive sessions and if it's
 
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
a 22nd
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
executive session that's fine but i feel
 
00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
it should be announced before
 
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
the bill is
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
i know it says that executive sessions
 
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:26.720 align:start position:0%
may be held throughout the
 
00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:27.510 align:start position:0%
may be held throughout the
but

00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:54:30.549 --> 00:54:30.559 align:start position:0%
this committee has always
 
00:54:32.390 --> 00:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
and in the past
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
announced executive sessions
 
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
okay i will just point out that if we do
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
not execute this bill today we'll have
 
00:54:43.829 --> 00:54:43.839 align:start position:0%
to exec it on another day and that just
 
00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
adds to the workload so representative
 
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
mick williams do you have a comment
 
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
i do um i think that science technology
 
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
and energy has been really solid about
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
letting all of our members know in
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
advance exactly what our schedule would
 
00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
be and that's something that i really
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
really appreciate about this committee
 
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
and so out of respect for the members
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
who couldn't be here today for the
 
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
hearing but would definitely be here for
 
00:55:04.789 --> 00:55:04.799 align:start position:0%
an exec
 
00:55:06.549 --> 00:55:06.559 align:start position:0%
i think it's fair can we put it on the
 
00:55:08.789 --> 00:55:08.799 align:start position:0%
docket for tomorrow
 
00:55:08.799 --> 00:55:09.990 align:start position:0%
docket for tomorrow
certainly

00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:55:11.829 --> 00:55:11.839 align:start position:0%
okay if that's the consensus then we'll
 
00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
wait to do an exact session i was hoping
 
00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
in this in the
 
00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
interest of efficiency to get it out of
 
00:55:21.030 --> 00:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
the way because i think we're all going
 
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
to support it but if the committee wants
 
00:55:25.349 --> 00:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
to wait we'll wait
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
more work to do tomorrow
 
00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
we'll be here later tomorrow so
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative mick williams if you
 
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
could give us the blue sheet data on
 
00:55:33.510 --> 00:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
this bill please
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely um the blue house uh house
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
remote testify sign and had 33 in
 
00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
support one opposition zero neutral
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
it'll be open until midnight tonight
 
00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:55:46.630 --> 00:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
but that will close the public hearing
 
00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
on house chairman question yes
 
00:55:49.599 --> 00:55:51.030 align:start position:0%
on house chairman question yes
representative

00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:55:53.829 --> 00:55:53.839 align:start position:0%
harrington thank you just for expediency
 
00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
maybe we can just announce now to say
 
00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:57.190 align:start position:0%
maybe we can just announce now to say
that

00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:58.950 --> 00:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
when we say that executive sessions
 
00:56:00.789 --> 00:56:00.799 align:start position:0%
could be held at any time that's exactly
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
what we mean because we have a lot of
 
00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
bills so all members of the committee
 
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
should be aware that on any day we could
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
have an executive session and plan
 
00:56:09.599 --> 00:56:11.270 align:start position:0%
have an executive session and plan
accordingly

00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
accordingly
 
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
that is true
 
00:56:15.349 --> 00:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
okay so with that we will we will uh
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
call the executive session on house bill
 
00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
268 fn uh as concluded representative
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
sausage you have a comment uh yes i
 
00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
would like to make a comment i mean i
 
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
agree with the representative harrington
 
00:56:29.349 --> 00:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
that that's what's in the in the
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
in the uh verbiage that we have for
 
00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
these things however i have always
 
00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
appreciated the fact that uh
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
our the chair has given us that uh
 
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
information when he planned to have
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
executive sessions and as you know and
 
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
reminded everyone uh
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
if you are not present for an executive
 
00:56:50.309 --> 00:56:50.319 align:start position:0%
session you might want to get a
 
00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
substitute so calling executive sessions
 
00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
spontaneously doesn't let us do that so
 
00:56:58.630 --> 00:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
i appreciate if that would be followed
 
00:57:00.309 --> 00:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
representative murder
 
00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:04.309 align:start position:0%
representative murder
yes

00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
you're taking it the wrong way he asked
 
00:57:07.589 --> 00:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
for a show of hands i'm sure the
 
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
chairman never would have called for an
 
00:57:10.390 --> 00:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
exec session if he knew there was
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
dissension in the troops he's just
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
trying to clear up a bill so you're
 
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
making you know filling seats on a
 
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:20.789 --> 00:57:20.799 align:start position:0%
i agree
 
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative partial yes thank you
 
00:57:24.789 --> 00:57:24.799 align:start position:0%
chair i would love to exact this now
 
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
i'll be very honest with you i mean
 
00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:27.270 align:start position:0%
i'll be very honest with you i mean
because

00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh it seems like it's really
 
00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:31.430 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh it seems like it's really
however

00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:33.680 align:start position:0%
however um i knew there was at least one
 
00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:35.839 align:start position:0%
person that did not raise their hand
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering if we do put it off
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
for 24 hours if we might be able to get
 
00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
a unanimous consent on it
 
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
which would be twice an advantage
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
i don't know it could explain it's
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
possible representative thomas
 
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair uh in view of
 
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
that last statement perhaps i would
 
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
recommend that perhaps later on this
 
00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
afternoon if there's another low between
 
00:58:00.309 --> 00:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
uh public hearings that we might again
 
00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
attempt to do a exec on this bill and at
 
00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
that time i suppose if if it is
 
00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:06.950 align:start position:0%
that time i suppose if if it is
unanimous

00:58:06.950 --> 00:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
unanimous
 
00:58:08.549 --> 00:58:08.559 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that we do it then we
 
00:58:11.829 --> 00:58:11.839 align:start position:0%
have a tremendous workload and uh to uh
 
00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative murderer's point the
 
00:58:16.549 --> 00:58:16.559 align:start position:0%
speaker has told us in the past if there
 
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
is going to be an executive session
 
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
coming up and it's unanimous then
 
00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:22.710 align:start position:0%
coming up and it's unanimous then
don't

00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
use up our resources by having a
 
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
substitute come in for just that one
 
00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
purpose so i would recommend that we
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
take another look this afternoon another
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity and at that time you will
 
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
have the lunch period to have your
 
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
caucus if you want to to discuss it and
 
00:58:38.789 --> 00:58:38.799 align:start position:0%
this way we can shore up some of the
 
00:58:41.190 --> 00:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
easy bills today instead of extending
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
our day tomorrow
 
00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
representative nutter
 
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and ditto to what
 
00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:48.829 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and ditto to what
um

00:58:48.829 --> 00:58:48.839 align:start position:0%

00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative oh what is his name from
 
00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:52.630 align:start position:0%
representative oh what is his name from
london

00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
london
 
00:58:54.549 --> 00:58:54.559 align:start position:0%
the representative from londonderry i
 
00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
was late i know but still sorry i just
 
00:58:59.349 --> 00:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
forgot your name for a second it happens
 
00:59:01.030 --> 00:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
to my children all the time so you're in
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
good company um i was the representative
 
00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
who didn't raise their hand but i'm not
 
00:59:06.470 --> 00:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
going to go against the committee if the
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
committee wants this bill i'm going to
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
i'll vote with all of you so it'll be
 
00:59:10.079 --> 00:59:12.789 align:start position:0%
i'll vote with all of you so it'll be
unanimous

00:59:12.789 --> 00:59:12.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
so representative callie pitzer you
 
00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
still opposed to doing an exec session
 
00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
yes i am i thought we were meeting on
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
the 19th so we have plenty of time to do
 
00:59:25.599 --> 00:59:26.390 align:start position:0%
the 19th so we have plenty of time to do
this

00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
as far as i can tell
 
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
um it has an fn on it
 
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
does it have to go to our uh
 
00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
finance committee
 
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
i do not believe so so we have and and i
 
00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:42.240 align:start position:0%
and i again i was under the impression
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
we were meeting on the 19th
 
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
and if this is going to take 20 minutes
 
00:59:47.670 --> 00:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
we just took 20 minutes to talk about
 
00:59:49.589 --> 00:59:49.599 align:start position:0%
doing it so
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
to execute tomorrow would take
 
00:59:52.319 --> 00:59:54.470 align:start position:0%
to execute tomorrow would take
what

00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
five minutes
 
00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
if it's if it's we've got unanimous
 
01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:00.640 align:start position:0%
consent and i think that would
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
more acceptable to me so i do
 
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
okay there's one other issue here that i
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
want to make sure everybody understands
 
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
we have 17 senate bills
 
01:00:16.309 --> 01:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
there are going to be two house sessions
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
at which these 17 bills will be
 
01:00:20.870 --> 01:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
presented on the floor of the house
 
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
april 21st
 
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
it is my hope that we can bring half of
 
01:00:30.870 --> 01:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
these bills to the house floor on april
 
01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.230 align:start position:0%
these bills to the house floor on april
21st

01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
21st
 
01:00:34.309 --> 01:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
and the other half to the house floor on
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
may 5th
 
01:00:38.789 --> 01:00:38.799 align:start position:0%
the alternative would debri be to bring
 
01:00:42.549 --> 01:00:42.559 align:start position:0%
them all to the house floor on may 5th
 
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
is that going to be fair to the other
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
members of the house to present 17
 
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
stne bills on one day
 
01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
is that going to be fair to the members
 
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
of this committee who want to engage in
 
01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
floor debates
 
01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's fair i think we
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
should try to break this up
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
and get these bills separated
 
01:01:06.069 --> 01:01:06.079 align:start position:0%
to the house floor on the 21st and the
 
01:01:08.789 --> 01:01:08.799 align:start position:0%
5th and to do that we've got to exec
 
01:01:08.799 --> 01:01:09.589 align:start position:0%
5th and to do that we've got to exec
them

01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:12.079 align:start position:0%
we can't wait till the 19th because all
 
01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
bills exec on the 19th will go to the
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
house floor on may 5th
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
the only bills that will go to the house
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
floor on the 21st are bills that we
 
01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
execute today or tomorrow
 
01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
so i want to make sure everybody
 
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
understands that so that you'll
 
01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
understand what we're trying to
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
accomplish as we go forward
 
01:01:31.589 --> 01:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
representative harrington yeah i would
 
01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
just say mr chairman i totally agree
 
01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
with you uh let's face it we bore the
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
hell out of the house anyways if we give
 
01:01:39.430 --> 01:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
them 17 bills we'll be lucky if anyone's
 
01:01:42.789 --> 01:01:42.799 align:start position:0%
still awake when we get to 12 or 13 so i
 
01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
think definitely want to break them up
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
and get as many as we can in on the
 
01:01:48.069 --> 01:01:48.079 align:start position:0%
first session
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:56.069 --> 01:01:56.079 align:start position:0%
thank you uh i would just agree with uh
 
01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative kelly pitts i think to if
 
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
we executives tomorrow
 
01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
where a lot of people from our side at
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
least know that we are having an
 
01:02:06.549 --> 01:02:06.559 align:start position:0%
executive session it might take as
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
little as two minutes to do it it's a
 
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
quick thing to do it was planned to do
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
that i don't think there's any real hold
 
01:02:14.549 --> 01:02:14.559 align:start position:0%
up if we do it tomorrow so i would
 
01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:16.559 align:start position:0%
support doing it tomorrow
 
01:02:19.029 --> 01:02:19.039 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll do it tomorrow and i want
 
01:02:21.029 --> 01:02:21.039 align:start position:0%
to alert everybody to be prepared to
 
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
exact eight bills tomorrow
 
01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
and if we're here till six or seven or
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
eight o'clock tomorrow night so be it
 
01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:29.829 align:start position:0%
all right
so

01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:29.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:32.069 --> 01:02:32.079 align:start position:0%
it is now time to
 
01:02:35.349 --> 01:02:35.359 align:start position:0%

01:02:35.359 --> 01:02:37.990 align:start position:0%

energy-saving
 
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
weatherization programs
 
01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.270 align:start position:0%
weatherization programs
and

01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
senator waters is going to introduce
 
01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
this bill because the prime sponsor
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
senator a bard is not with us today
 
01:02:53.359 --> 01:02:54.549 align:start position:0%
senator a bard is not with us today
so

01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:54.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:57.270 --> 01:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
senator waters take it away
 
01:02:58.630 --> 01:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman senator david
 
01:03:00.549 --> 01:03:00.559 align:start position:0%
water district 4 introducing
 
01:03:02.789 --> 01:03:02.799 align:start position:0%
senate bill 269 because
 
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
senator avar could not be here
 
01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.390 align:start position:0%
senator avar could not be here
today

01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:03:08.549 --> 01:03:08.559 align:start position:0%
this bill establishes a commission to
 
01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
study energy saving weatherization
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
programs in iran if you've looked at the
 
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
original bill you see what the original
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
intent had been
 
01:03:19.109 --> 01:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
you know fundamentally to try to
 
01:03:19.119 --> 01:03:20.710 align:start position:0%
you know fundamentally to try to
expedite

01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
expedite
 
01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:21.829 align:start position:0%
expedite
the

01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:23.829 --> 01:03:23.839 align:start position:0%
provision of a workforce to do this kind
 
01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
of energy efficiency work to make sure
 
01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
that we had people who could do the do
 
01:03:30.630 --> 01:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
the work with less regulation and then
 
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
secondly it was uh going to see if we
 
01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
can't open up
 
01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
um the possibilities of participation in
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
this this program uh to larger mill
 
01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
building conversion propane and gas
 
01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
folks and
 
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
and so on um
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
the original bill raised some issues
 
01:03:49.109 --> 01:03:49.119 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
you know what workers would be unable to
 
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
do what under this program and um also
 
01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of you know more complicated
 
01:03:58.309 --> 01:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
issues than have been this anticipated
 
01:04:00.069 --> 01:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
about what it would mean to expand the
 
01:04:03.029 --> 01:04:03.039 align:start position:0%
um inclusion of other kinds of of
 
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
building energy sources to it so
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
that's why it seemed like it really
 
01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
would make some sense to
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
take a look at this in the commission
 
01:04:14.069 --> 01:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
and you'll see the issues really uh
 
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
listed starting on
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
line 12 of what came up in the um
 
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
hearing you know what policies do we
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
need to look at
 
01:04:23.589 --> 01:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
for the reservation of building so we
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
could include buildings heated with uh
 
01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%
all these all these fuel sources
 
01:04:28.799 --> 01:04:29.829 align:start position:0%
all these all these fuel sources
um

01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:29.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:31.750 --> 01:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
and then within
 
01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh which programs well we know new
 
01:04:35.589 --> 01:04:35.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire saves we've talked a lot about
 
01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
that over the last year and those funds
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
have come in and get administrated by
 
01:04:39.119 --> 01:04:40.470 align:start position:0%
have come in and get administrated by
our

01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:40.480 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:41.990 align:start position:0%
our
caps

01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
caps
 
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
and how what might we
 
01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
expand the physical participation of
 
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
propane and oil users in new hampshire
 
01:04:48.549 --> 01:04:48.559 align:start position:0%
in the same
 
01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:50.799 align:start position:0%
way that we now include electric and
 
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
national natural gas seem fair i would
 
01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
think but also i think it seemed
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
effective if the point here is to help
 
01:04:59.349 --> 01:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
lower income folks saving energy bills
 
01:05:02.069 --> 01:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
no matter what they're heating
 
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
with and then some particular
 
01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:06.559 align:start position:0%
questions about what could be covered in
 
01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
this i think which sea lions 20 to 22 is
 
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
residual from the original 10 of the
 
01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
bill to look at mill bidding building
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
conversions and other multi-family uh
 
01:05:18.870 --> 01:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
structures as well where these these
 
01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
kinds of things might be part of the
 
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
work that
 
01:05:22.470 --> 01:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
is done
 
01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:23.270 align:start position:0%
is done
so

01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
then of course you got the commission
 
01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:31.190 --> 01:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
so on as as usual after
 
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
after that and uh it is going to
 
01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
get this work done pretty quickly to tee
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
up potential legislation for next
 
01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
session so mr chairman that's it in a
 
01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.390 align:start position:0%
session so mr chairman that's it in a
nutshell

01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
nutshell
 
01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
great thank you for introducing this
 
01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
bill on the behalf of
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
senator avard
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
do we have questions for the senator
 
01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
representative mirner is recognized
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for taking the
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
question um a little
 
01:05:58.230 --> 01:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
the pre-qualifications you have two
 
01:05:58.240 --> 01:05:59.510 align:start position:0%
the pre-qualifications you have two
different

01:05:59.510 --> 01:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:06:01.829 --> 01:06:01.839 align:start position:0%
like method things under methodology for
 
01:06:01.839 --> 01:06:03.750 align:start position:0%
like method things under methodology for
qualifications

01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
qualifications
 
01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
so we'll be creating a new set of
 
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
rules for the
 
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
qualification for the for the work for
 
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
the contractors
 
01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.789 align:start position:0%
the contractors
um

01:06:12.789 --> 01:06:12.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:14.230 --> 01:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
well thanks for your question that was
 
01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
with in the original bill and there are
 
01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions about that so why
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
that's why i got amended to be the study
 
01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
now usda rural development they do the
 
01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
same type of work too you know people
 
01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
apply through them and they have a set
 
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
of guidelines i don't know
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
if there's anything that we could use
 
01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
off of their guidelines or not
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
good thought and i think that's one of
 
01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:33.349 align:start position:0%
good thought and i think that's one of
the

01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:35.109 --> 01:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
other reasons why i thought
 
01:06:37.270 --> 01:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
this this group ought to work on these
 
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
things because it suddenly became a lot
 
01:06:41.349 --> 01:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
more complicated to make it streamlined
 
01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
so everybody's on the same page yeah
 
01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.710 align:start position:0%
so everybody's on the same page yeah
yeah

01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
thank you okay representative mick
 
01:06:49.029 --> 01:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
williams has a question
 
01:06:51.029 --> 01:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
uh thank you senator for bringing this
 
01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm i just had a question about
 
01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:56.069 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm i just had a question about
the

01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
members of the commission
 
01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
so i'm looking through the list here and
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
it looks like you've got good
 
01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
representation from the public
 
01:07:06.870 --> 01:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
electric and natural gas providers
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
the house
 
01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
clean energy new hampshire
 
01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing
 
01:07:14.789 --> 01:07:14.799 align:start position:0%
anyone representing the licensed
 
01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
building trades specifically engineering
 
01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
and architecture which are very focused
 
01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
right now laser focused on updating
 
01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:22.710 align:start position:0%
right now laser focused on updating
energy

01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
and codes related to that i think we
 
01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
have some synergy here between what the
 
01:07:29.109 --> 01:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
building code review board has been
 
01:07:31.109 --> 01:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
doing about amending and updating the
 
01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
building code when it comes out every
 
01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
two years
 
01:07:35.829 --> 01:07:35.839 align:start position:0%
and i'm not seeing an architect or
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
engineer who could provide that same
 
01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
level of accountability and interest
 
01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
between the two groups as a member of
 
01:07:43.270 --> 01:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
the commission so i guess my question is
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
would you be open to an amendment that
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
adds an architect or engineer to the
 
01:07:47.039 --> 01:07:48.390 align:start position:0%
adds an architect or engineer to the
membership

01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
membership
 
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
well that's your question and you know
 
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
um surely uh
 
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
i understand that the house can do
 
01:07:58.630 --> 01:07:58.640 align:start position:0%
amendments as well as the senate can and
 
01:08:01.029 --> 01:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
so if that seems i mean i i i think it's
 
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
a good point um i think that there was
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
some sense that maybe you get that some
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
of the expertise coming
 
01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
from home builders
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
um builders and contractors and building
 
01:08:11.829 --> 01:08:11.839 align:start position:0%
officials association because they
 
01:08:13.829 --> 01:08:13.839 align:start position:0%
obviously work with those folks but that
 
01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
might be helpful but none of them are
 
01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
licensed is the point so they don't have
 
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
to take continuing ed to keep up with
 
01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:21.839 align:start position:0%
transitions in the code okay thank you i
 
01:08:21.839 --> 01:08:22.630 align:start position:0%
transitions in the code okay thank you i
would

01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
i would encourage the committee to
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
consider that and i could whip up an
 
01:08:27.910 --> 01:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
amendment in about an hour with ols if
 
01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
the committee's open to that
 
01:08:31.269 --> 01:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
and thank you and i don't i don't think
 
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
senator evard would object to that okay
 
01:08:34.709 --> 01:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:36.229 --> 01:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
i'd remind the members that we're here
 
01:08:39.669 --> 01:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
to ask questions to gain information
 
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative pimentel
 
01:08:44.550 --> 01:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
waters for taking my question
 
01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:47.590 align:start position:0%
waters for taking my question
um

01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:50.950 --> 01:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
line 17-18 research to explore
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
expanding the fiscal participation of
 
01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
propane and oil users in new hampshire
 
01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
in the same manner as electric and
 
01:09:00.070 --> 01:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
natural gas
 
01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
could you explain to me
 
01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:03.430 align:start position:0%
could you explain to me
what

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
the intent of putting that in is
 
01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
and what its ramifications might be
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
thanks your question i'm not sure i'll
 
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
be able to give a very thorough one but
 
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
i think that senator avartz uh interest
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
here was to make sure that all fuels are
 
01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
treated equally if we're trying to
 
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee has a question
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:09:31.189 --> 01:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
senator for bringing the bill and for
 
01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:09:35.669 --> 01:09:35.679 align:start position:0%
towards the end on page 2 line 27
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%

01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
p colon 7c
 
01:09:43.269 --> 01:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
relative to the commission to study
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
energy saving weatherization programs is
 
01:09:47.669 --> 01:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
repealed so we're creating a commission
 
01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
and repealing a commission is that
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
i'm just if you can clarify
 
01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
how that helps
 
01:09:56.470 --> 01:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question that's kind of
 
01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:57.669 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question that's kind of
boring

01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
boring
 
01:09:59.590 --> 01:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
it you know it has a certain period of
 
01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
time to do its work and then it's then
 
01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
it goes goes bye-bye
 
01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
so so yes so it's a built-in repeal for
 
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
the work of this commission not
 
01:10:10.709 --> 01:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
something prior that's being removed in
 
01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
order to make way for the new it refers
 
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
back to line 10 first page 12p 7c it's
 
01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
this one okay now you see it now you
 
01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
don't yes okay thanks
 
01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
representative harrington thank you mr
 
01:10:23.189 --> 01:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
question senator is a follow-up to the
 
01:10:27.669 --> 01:10:27.679 align:start position:0%
previous question on line 17 talking
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
about participation of propane and oil
 
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
uses in new hampshire in the same manner
 
01:10:33.910 --> 01:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
as electric and natural gas you said all
 
01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
energy sources are going to be treated
 
01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
equally so
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
by that is one to assume that the intent
 
01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
here is to put on something equivalent
 
01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
to the system benefit charge i.e attacks
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
a fee on propane and oil users similar
 
01:10:50.950 --> 01:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
to what electric and natural gas users
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
now pay
 
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
not at all thanks your question not at
 
01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:56.630 align:start position:0%
not at all thanks your question not at
all

01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
the focus here you see the word users
 
01:11:03.669 --> 01:11:03.679 align:start position:0%
and no new funding existing program
 
01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
look at these these other uh
 
01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
other folks that might be included in it
 
01:11:11.110 --> 01:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you i'm a little
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
confused uh
 
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
not says participation of propane in oil
 
01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:18.630 align:start position:0%
not says participation of propane in oil
users

01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
users
 
01:11:20.229 --> 01:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
in the same manner as electric and
 
01:11:22.149 --> 01:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
natural gas and my unders but we
 
01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
obviously know that electric and
 
01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
national gas have what we refer to
 
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
generally as the system benefit charge
 
01:11:31.030 --> 01:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
where all users are paid pay a certain
 
01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
tax if you will or a fee on their
 
01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
electric or gas bill that goes to
 
01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
weatherization programs i'm reading this
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
and maybe i'm misunderstanding it but it
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
seems to me is it saying we want to
 
01:11:44.229 --> 01:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
expand that to now when you buy propane
 
01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
you buy oil there will be some type of a
 
01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
fee that will be collected
 
01:11:50.709 --> 01:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
by the oil company or the propane
 
01:11:53.189 --> 01:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
company and it'll be given to some state
 
01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
entity so they can fund weatherization
 
01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
programs is that correct well thanks for
 
01:11:58.870 --> 01:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
the question i'm not sure whether there
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
is there isn't and notice that we're not
 
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
putting anything in statute other than
 
01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
to study that issue
 
01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
i do think representative if you if you
 
01:12:09.669 --> 01:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
felt that this might
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
you know kind of open a door in a
 
01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
direction you don't want to go you could
 
01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:14.229 align:start position:0%
direction you don't want to go you could
clarify

01:12:14.229 --> 01:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
01:12:15.669 --> 01:12:15.679 align:start position:0%
you could you could fiddle with that
 
01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
language but um it's it's a study it's a
 
01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
study yeah
 
01:12:23.189 --> 01:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
expand on that point it does say explore
 
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
expanding the fiscal participation
 
01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh of propane and oil users which would
 
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
sort of indicate uh as
 
01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
representative harrington suggests
 
01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
that an expansion of the system benefits
 
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
charge my apologies chairman it's not my
 
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
bill and uh i'm not exactly sure what
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
senator avar meant by that um but no no
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's a study
 
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
my my question would be
 
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
isn't there
 
01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:54.229 align:start position:0%
isn't there
every

01:12:54.229 --> 01:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
every
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
day i open my mailbox and there's a
 
01:12:58.390 --> 01:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
flyer in there from somebody who wants
 
01:13:01.590 --> 01:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
to install new windows at my home
 
01:13:03.910 --> 01:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
or sell me
 
01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:05.110 align:start position:0%
or sell me
other

01:13:05.110 --> 01:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
home weatherization products isn't there
 
01:13:09.669 --> 01:13:09.679 align:start position:0%
already a robust market
 
01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
for this
 
01:13:14.630 --> 01:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
kind of economic activity and and why do
 
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
we need to to study it i i'm not quite
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
sure what the purpose of all this is
 
01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:20.310 align:start position:0%
sure what the purpose of all this is
well

01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question i mean the two
 
01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
key things that you bet there's a market
 
01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
this is about new hampshire saves
 
01:13:28.630 --> 01:13:28.640 align:start position:0%
and the particular group that it's
 
01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:29.510 align:start position:0%
and the particular group that it's
served

01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
served
 
01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
and what it's trying to look at is okay
 
01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
can we do something about certification
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
so that we're not putting so much
 
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
so many regulatory hurdles on folks who
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
want to come in and do this work
 
01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
and that would probably help us get the
 
01:13:44.709 --> 01:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
work done and then secondly let's take a
 
01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
look at the program to see if it might
 
01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
include things like mill buildings or
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
multi-family houses and whether those
 
01:13:53.270 --> 01:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
are appropriate
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
ways to use the new hampshire saves
 
01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:58.149 align:start position:0%
ways to use the new hampshire saves
funding

01:13:58.149 --> 01:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:00.640 align:start position:0%
additional questions seeing none we
 
01:14:02.950 --> 01:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you senator oops
 
01:14:04.950 --> 01:14:04.960 align:start position:0%
you got to raise your hands before when
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
i say additional questions you got to
 
01:14:08.630 --> 01:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
raise your hands immediately
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:15.669 --> 01:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh
 
01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
thank you senator waters uh just to
 
01:14:22.229 --> 01:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
clarify uh this study commission is also
 
01:14:22.239 --> 01:14:23.350 align:start position:0%
clarify uh this study commission is also
for

01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh single-family homes i believe and i
 
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
noticed that on um i lost the line
 
01:14:32.709 --> 01:14:32.719 align:start position:0%
but it also mentioned
 
01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
on seven
 
01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
four multi families the duplexes and
 
01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
quad products there's a line in there
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
is the question is
 
01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
is this going to be equal for
 
01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
single-family homes and
 
01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
multi-family thank you
 
01:14:56.310 --> 01:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
you know i i would think that the folks
 
01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
who are on this committee
 
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
commission will have a lot of questions
 
01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
and a lot of things to look at
 
01:15:06.149 --> 01:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
and that's why
 
01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
it made sense to bring it forward
 
01:15:10.630 --> 01:15:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh because there are i mean there have
 
01:15:12.229 --> 01:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
been audit i mean we focused so much
 
01:15:12.239 --> 01:15:13.030 align:start position:0%
been audit i mean we focused so much
with

01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
you know with 549 on stabilizing the
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
program and the funding and and that was
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
really great work thank you committee um
 
01:15:22.229 --> 01:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
and i think that it's just that okay
 
01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
now that we have the program um let's
 
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
see how we can make it work the best for
 
01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
the people
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
and there are a lot of issues if you
 
01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
look at the committee report you'll see
 
01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
that there are quite a few issues that
 
01:15:32.470 --> 01:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
came up
 
01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
under the original bill um
 
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
senator clegg
 
01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
former senator clegg and uh others
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
you know had had some thoughts and
 
01:15:41.990 --> 01:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
concerns about this and that so it
 
01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
seemed to make sense to say let's have a
 
01:15:49.189 --> 01:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:52.950 --> 01:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh representative samsic
 
01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
01:15:54.719 --> 01:15:55.750 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
waters

01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
waters
 
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
online let's see 26 with regard to the
 
01:16:02.550 --> 01:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
composition of this commission
 
01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:03.990 align:start position:0%
composition of this commission
um

01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:06.149 --> 01:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
and i'm saying i'm just asking whether
 
01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
there's any reason
 
01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
you would know of any of the sponsors of
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
would not want to include a member of
 
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
the minority party as well
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
it says three members appointed by the
 
01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:18.390 align:start position:0%
it says three members appointed by the
speaker

01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
and theoretically it could be a member
 
01:16:22.630 --> 01:16:22.640 align:start position:0%
of the minority party but in some of the
 
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
other bills we've been dealing with
 
01:16:27.669 --> 01:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
there was specific language that said
 
01:16:30.630 --> 01:16:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh one member of the minority party
 
01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
appointed by the early party leader
 
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
so is there any reason we couldn't do
 
01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
that here too
 
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
it's a commission
 
01:16:40.149 --> 01:16:40.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative do you think
 
01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
that a senator from the other side of
 
01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
the wall is going to comment upon house
 
01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:46.470 align:start position:0%
the wall is going to comment upon house
procedures

01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:52.640 align:start position:0%
thank you chair i'm looking at the
 
01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:53.750 align:start position:0%
thank you chair i'm looking at the
amendment

01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
coming back to it and i'm wondering if
 
01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:56.229 align:start position:0%
coming back to it and i'm wondering if
it's

01:16:56.229 --> 01:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:16:56.239 --> 01:16:58.550 align:start position:0%
it's
um

01:16:58.550 --> 01:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know maybe i'm misusing the word
 
01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
but it seems like a non-german amendment
 
01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
as it assumes uh if the plan is adopted
 
01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:08.320 align:start position:0%
and while it seems like a fine amendment
 
01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:10.149 align:start position:0%
and while it seems like a fine amendment
um

01:17:10.149 --> 01:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:12.070 --> 01:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really seem to relate
 
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
directly back to this study as far as i
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
can tell unless we're assuming that uh
 
01:17:19.110 --> 01:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
certain things will come up come as a
 
01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
result of the study
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
um i'm just
 
01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
trying to wrap my mind around this a
 
01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
little bit maybe you could help me out
 
01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:29.350 --> 01:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
thanks because i'm um
 
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
it's a bill we passed this bill
 
01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:32.630 align:start position:0%
it's a bill we passed this bill
so

01:17:32.630 --> 01:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:34.709 --> 01:17:34.719 align:start position:0%
it is germain unto itself it's asking
 
01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
for a commission to look at issues that
 
01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
came up
 
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh under the original bill
 
01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:41.830 align:start position:0%
uh under the original bill
but

01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:17:43.270 --> 01:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative mann do you have a
 
01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:45.430 align:start position:0%
representative mann do you have a
question

01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:57.030 --> 01:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
am i mistaken i i i believe there are
 
01:18:03.110 --> 01:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
seven nominees
 
01:18:05.669 --> 01:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
that are not nominated by seven members
 
01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
that are nominated by the governor
 
01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
and there's a quorum of eight for
 
01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:11.669 align:start position:0%
and there's a quorum of eight for
meeting

01:18:11.669 --> 01:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
is this a little
 
01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
lopsided in a sense
 
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
um you know there are members that are
 
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
have no affiliation
 
01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
just a member of the public member this
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
member of that
 
01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
i'm a little surprised that there's some
 
01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
so much
 
01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
power in the hands of the governor on
 
01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
this commission
 
01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
well thanks for your question i i mean i
 
01:18:39.270 --> 01:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
will say that i'm pretty used to when i
 
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
put together commissions assuming that
 
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
the the governor's
 
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
authority and and and the ability of
 
01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
that office to select members of the
 
01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
public i really i generally trust and so
 
01:18:51.189 --> 01:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
okay it seems not out of the ordinary to
 
01:18:52.709 --> 01:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
me but
 
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up follow up
 
01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:59.830 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up follow up
um

01:18:59.830 --> 01:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
i noticed there's no examination uh no
 
01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
no um
 
01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
maybe i'm pushing too far
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
i ask you a question that you can't
 
01:19:11.189 --> 01:19:11.199 align:start position:0%
answer uh but um
 
01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
why there wasn't anything in the
 
01:19:14.719 --> 01:19:15.910 align:start position:0%
why there wasn't anything in the
commission's

01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
commission's
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
tasks related to examining costs and
 
01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:20.630 align:start position:0%
tasks related to examining costs and
benefits

01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
01:19:24.229 --> 01:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
to the economy and to in into households
 
01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
most at the
 
01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:29.440 align:start position:0%

home occupant citizen level on costs and
benefits

01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
01:19:40.390 --> 01:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question and you know i
 
01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
generally strongly support that kind of
 
01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
inclusion of language although i will
 
01:19:46.470 --> 01:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
say here that you know the new hampshire
 
01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
saves program it is what it is and the
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
costs and benefits of that are something
 
01:19:51.030 --> 01:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
have been
 
01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
deeply discussed shall we say over the
 
01:19:55.110 --> 01:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
last year or so
 
01:19:58.149 --> 01:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
and i would imagine that any legislation
 
01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
proposal that might come out of
 
01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
this commission
 
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
would include such a consideration
 
01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:06.950 align:start position:0%
would include such a consideration
but

01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:20:09.669 --> 01:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
for these purposes um i mean maybe as i
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
said if you think that that would be
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
helpful to have that
 
01:20:13.669 --> 01:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
in there why not add it let's just
 
01:20:15.830 --> 01:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
digest it
 
01:20:17.669 --> 01:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:20:20.629 --> 01:20:20.639 align:start position:0%
follow up a second third question okay
 
01:20:22.629 --> 01:20:22.639 align:start position:0%
go ahead one more um
 
01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
there was uh quite an uproar when the um
 
01:20:29.110 --> 01:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
puc canceled the e-irs
 
01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
and there were companies that were um
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
there was event evidently some very
 
01:20:33.679 --> 01:20:34.709 align:start position:0%
there was event evidently some very
competent

01:20:34.709 --> 01:20:34.719 align:start position:0%
competent
 
01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
energy efficiency companies in the state
 
01:20:38.629 --> 01:20:38.639 align:start position:0%
that kind of
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
raised their hand at that time
 
01:20:45.270 --> 01:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
don't be seen none of these seem to be
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
recognized as potential uh uh members of
 
01:20:54.709 --> 01:20:54.719 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
of the commission
 
01:20:58.229 --> 01:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
and i think that they would provide very
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
valuable information thanks for your
 
01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
question and that that's why we have on
 
01:21:03.669 --> 01:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
page two
 
01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
five and six
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
because those folks are the ones who
 
01:21:08.709 --> 01:21:08.719 align:start position:0%
represent those
 
01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
folks and i think we're going to hear
 
01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
from the home builders
 
01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
who have been the vehicle for the voices
 
01:21:14.629 --> 01:21:14.639 align:start position:0%
of those
 
01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you folks thank you
 
01:21:18.870 --> 01:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
and after you finish speaking don't
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
forget to turn your microphone off
 
01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:23.030 align:start position:0%
forget to turn your microphone off
okay

01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:21:24.790 --> 01:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
seeing no additional questions for the
 
01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:26.719 align:start position:0%
senator we thank you for introducing

01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:50.960 align:start position:0%

01:21:52.229 --> 01:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
president
 
01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
of energy marketers association new
 
01:21:55.350 --> 01:21:55.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i also have the pleasure
 
01:21:58.390 --> 01:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
to represent propane gas association new
 
01:21:58.400 --> 01:21:59.750 align:start position:0%
to represent propane gas association new
england

01:21:59.750 --> 01:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
england
 
01:22:03.189 --> 01:22:03.199 align:start position:0%
i come in opposition to
 
01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
senate bill 269 fn i was unable to
 
01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
participate with it in the senate
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
and as i read this bill i don't really
 
01:22:13.189 --> 01:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
believe there's a need to include the
 
01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
propane and oil folks that i represent
 
01:22:17.110 --> 01:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
but just to take you to a couple of
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
sections on this proposed legislation
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
that i think
 
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
does explain its intent
 
01:22:25.990 --> 01:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
i'd like to take you to page one
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
line twelve small a
 
01:22:30.629 --> 01:22:30.639 align:start position:0%
when it talks about the commission's
 
01:22:30.639 --> 01:22:31.910 align:start position:0%
when it talks about the commission's
duties

01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
duties
 
01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
it says the commission shall identify
 
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
policy and funding opportunities
 
01:22:39.189 --> 01:22:39.199 align:start position:0%
to support weatherization and then they
 
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
list the
 
01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
the energy sources you're looking at
 
01:22:44.550 --> 01:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
which includes electricity natural gas
 
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
oil and propane
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
the two groups that i'm here today
 
01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:50.310 align:start position:0%
the two groups that i'm here today
and

01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
just to show you this distinction
 
01:22:53.910 --> 01:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
between the utilities in the private
 
01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:55.030 align:start position:0%
between the utilities in the private
sector

01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
sector
 
01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:55.910 align:start position:0%
sector
um

01:22:55.910 --> 01:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:57.910 --> 01:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
utilities they get their rates they're
 
01:22:57.920 --> 01:22:59.590 align:start position:0%
utilities they get their rates they're
guaranteed

01:22:59.590 --> 01:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
guaranteed
 
01:23:01.430 --> 01:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
the rates get baked into the ratepayers
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
they pay the bills we're private sectors
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
that doesn't happen with us
 
01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure what the funding intent
 
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
is whether it's to
 
01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
have the consumer pay it which in
 
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
today's world with the high prices of
 
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
energy to heat your homes right now
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
would not be a welcome alternative okay
 
01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
we don't have that luxury
 
01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:24.709 align:start position:0%
we don't have that luxury
of

01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:24.719 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:23:26.550 --> 01:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
just taking that race and passing it on
 
01:23:28.709 --> 01:23:28.719 align:start position:0%
to the consumer okay the private sector
 
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
cannot do that
 
01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:32.070 align:start position:0%
cannot do that
so

01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:33.669 --> 01:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
that when we look at this that's what
 
01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
the intent is here as part of this study
 
01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
and then you did discuss line 17
 
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
research to explore expanding the fiscal
 
01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
participation of propane and oil users
 
01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
so once again i mean users i would
 
01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:50.719 align:start position:0%
assume would be the homeowners
 
01:23:50.719 --> 01:23:51.669 align:start position:0%
assume would be the homeowners
um

01:23:51.669 --> 01:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure of that okay
 
01:23:57.990 --> 01:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
so i have concern there um and our
 
01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
industry already participates in
 
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
programs to help those that are less
 
01:24:05.110 --> 01:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
fortunate need assistance
 
01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:10.229 --> 01:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
granite state saves program we supply
 
01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
money to go back to the consumers for
 
01:24:14.950 --> 01:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
for new energy efficient boilers for
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
tanks through the odd fund if there's
 
01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
leaks in tanks then they can get up to
 
01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
2500 dollars for a new tank
 
01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:23.350 align:start position:0%
2500 dollars for a new tank
okay

01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:24:25.030 --> 01:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
now that's not weatherization but it's
 
01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
support for the homeowners and then our
 
01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:28.950 align:start position:0%
support for the homeowners and then our
industry

01:24:28.950 --> 01:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
industry
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
on the oil side participates with the
 
01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
laihi program
 
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
low-income heating assistance program
 
01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
for those people that qualify
 
01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:37.590 align:start position:0%
for those people that qualify
and

01:24:37.590 --> 01:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:41.590 --> 01:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
so this last year 2021 to 2022 over 60
 
01:24:43.910 --> 01:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
million dollars was put aside in that
 
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
light light heap funding program for new
 
01:24:48.070 --> 01:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire folks that need it
 
01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:49.110 align:start position:0%
hampshire folks that need it
so

01:24:49.110 --> 01:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
we are doing an awful lot um right now
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
to assist those that need help and i
 
01:24:56.709 --> 01:24:56.719 align:start position:0%
believe that this study is set up to
 
01:24:58.790 --> 01:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
look at bringing in the folks at least
 
01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
that i represent here today and if it
 
01:25:02.310 --> 01:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
wants to move forward i would ask you
 
01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
one of two things to either take the oil
 
01:25:07.750 --> 01:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
and propane people out of this or to not
 
01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:08.629 align:start position:0%
and propane people out of this or to not
pass

01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
pass
 
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
senate bill 269. thank you mr chairman
 
01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
thank you do you have any uh written
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
testimony that you could submit i do not
 
01:25:17.270 --> 01:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
but i'd be happy to write some up for
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
the committee mr chairman well we'd
 
01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate that i will thank you
 
01:25:23.110 --> 01:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative thomas is recognized
 
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:25:28.229 --> 01:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh just for
 
01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
clarification uh since you brought up uh
 
01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
the oil and propane industry in relation
 
01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:34.709 align:start position:0%
the oil and propane industry in relation
to

01:25:34.709 --> 01:25:34.719 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh programs that you already
 
01:25:40.709 --> 01:25:40.719 align:start position:0%
uh have to support low-income families
 
01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
if this commission uh decides to
 
01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:46.709 align:start position:0%
if this commission uh decides to
attach

01:25:46.709 --> 01:25:46.719 align:start position:0%
attach
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
extra costs onto the oral and protein
 
01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
industry like the study says it it is
 
01:25:52.629 --> 01:25:52.639 align:start position:0%
going to be studying
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
if that were to happen how would that
 
01:25:56.709 --> 01:25:56.719 align:start position:0%
affect your programs that you were
 
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
already supporting for the low-income
 
01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
families would would you have to do away
 
01:26:03.430 --> 01:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
with them or reduce them or
 
01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
i don't um i'm not sure representative
 
01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
the lahey program is a federally funded
 
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
program that comes to the state so i
 
01:26:11.669 --> 01:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
don't believe that that program would be
 
01:26:13.830 --> 01:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
impacted by that um
 
01:26:16.709 --> 01:26:16.719 align:start position:0%
and the the nora funds which is a
 
01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
industry check off program where the
 
01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
money is used to
 
01:26:23.590 --> 01:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
for research for any energy efficient
 
01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
burners and furnaces and to also assist
 
01:26:30.870 --> 01:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
funding that with the homeowners i don't
 
01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
believe that would be impacted either
 
01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:33.910 align:start position:0%
believe that would be impacted either
okay

01:26:33.910 --> 01:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:26:35.430 --> 01:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:26:38.070 --> 01:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative kelly pitts is recognized
 
01:26:42.149 --> 01:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:43.830 --> 01:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
this bill confused me a little bit so
 
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping i can get clarification
 
01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:48.070 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping i can get clarification
the

01:26:48.070 --> 01:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:49.189 align:start position:0%
the
oil

01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
oil
 
01:26:51.510 --> 01:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
and propane users
 
01:26:53.669 --> 01:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
are currently
 
01:26:56.790 --> 01:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
or i believe that they are currently
 
01:26:59.830 --> 01:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
eligible for weatherization programs
 
01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
under the
 
01:27:02.709 --> 01:27:02.719 align:start position:0%
by the fact that they use electricity
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
through the sbc charges collected
 
01:27:06.390 --> 01:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
through the utilities
 
01:27:10.390 --> 01:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
am i wrong in that particular
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to your question
 
01:27:12.239 --> 01:27:13.270 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to your question
sorry

01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:15.189 align:start position:0%
sorry
i

01:27:15.189 --> 01:27:15.199 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
i'll ask that later then follow up well
 
01:27:21.669 --> 01:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
anybody who has an oil
 
01:27:23.350 --> 01:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
heated house
 
01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
for instance
 
01:27:27.709 --> 01:27:27.719 align:start position:0%
they can apply for weather associ
 
01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
weatherization programs now and if they
 
01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:40.629 --> 01:27:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:40.639 --> 01:27:42.310 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
then in what you're saying is that the
 
01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
only reason to put oil and propane in
 
01:27:50.229 --> 01:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
there is to perhaps
 
01:27:52.229 --> 01:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
assess additional funds from these
 
01:27:52.239 --> 01:27:53.669 align:start position:0%
assess additional funds from these
people

01:27:53.669 --> 01:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:27:58.830 --> 01:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:05.990 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
scully

01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
scully
 
01:28:09.189 --> 01:28:09.199 align:start position:0%
um so i don't quite understand your your
 
01:28:12.629 --> 01:28:12.639 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill um because in
 
01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
fact it's just a commission
 
01:28:16.310 --> 01:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
that should look at these things it's
 
01:28:19.189 --> 01:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
not a recommendation to increase charges
 
01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
or store surcharges or anything it's
 
01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
just a commission to evaluate these
 
01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:25.750 align:start position:0%
just a commission to evaluate these
issues

01:28:25.750 --> 01:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
and as representative kelly pitts
 
01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned anyone who already uses
 
01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
natural gas or oil
 
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
for heating purposes
 
01:28:36.629 --> 01:28:36.639 align:start position:0%
is already paying uh
 
01:28:39.430 --> 01:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
into the the utility program that gives
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
the weatherization to anybody who does
 
01:28:44.470 --> 01:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
that so whether you use propane or or
 
01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:45.510 align:start position:0%
that so whether you use propane or or
oil

01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
oil
 
01:28:47.750 --> 01:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
you're getting weatherization already
 
01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
and this bill does not do anything to
 
01:28:52.709 --> 01:28:52.719 align:start position:0%
change any of these charges or put a new
 
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
surcharge it is true that that that
 
01:28:57.990 --> 01:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph that representative sam
 
01:28:59.669 --> 01:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
you're making a speech sorry and i'd
 
01:29:01.270 --> 01:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate it if you'd ask a question
 
01:29:04.629 --> 01:29:04.639 align:start position:0%
instead so okay so so are you
 
01:29:06.310 --> 01:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
principally against
 
01:29:09.270 --> 01:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
a commission to study weatherization or
 
01:29:11.110 --> 01:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
do you just want to remove the reference
 
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
to of for oil and propane out of this
 
01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
bill i'd be happy if you remove the
 
01:29:16.550 --> 01:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
reference to oil and propane out of the
 
01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
okay further questions representative
 
01:29:24.550 --> 01:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
mann has a question
 
01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
don't forget to turn on your mic for
 
01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:33.110 --> 01:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
it occurs to me that
 
01:29:36.149 --> 01:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
especially oil uh and possibly propane
 
01:29:38.229 --> 01:29:38.239 align:start position:0%
and most heating systems use electricity
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
as well you have to you have to spray
 
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
the oil into the boiler you have to
 
01:29:46.629 --> 01:29:46.639 align:start position:0%
start the boiler you have to blow
 
01:29:49.270 --> 01:29:49.280 align:start position:0%
hot air that's created by the by the
 
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
furnace to around the house or circulate
 
01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
hot water so um
 
01:29:57.750 --> 01:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
it would be possible to um
 
01:29:59.830 --> 01:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
finagle this i mean can i could we
 
01:30:03.669 --> 01:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
do you know of any
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
way that i could get numbers in terms of
 
01:30:10.950 --> 01:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
the the amount of electricity
 
01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
used by
 
01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
propane and oil heating systems
 
01:30:19.750 --> 01:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
i mean i could say in general terms
 
01:30:25.110 --> 01:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
there's plenty of electricity used but i
 
01:30:27.270 --> 01:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know i can ask the question i
 
01:30:29.110 --> 01:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
mean i'm not sure i mean your if i
 
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
understand your question you know how
 
01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
much electricity is used to push the
 
01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
propane and oil to heat the home correct
 
01:30:39.189 --> 01:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
yeah given that given that electricity
 
01:30:39.199 --> 01:30:40.070 align:start position:0%
yeah given that given that electricity
uh

01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:41.830 --> 01:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
representative manner of charge on it
 
01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:42.870 align:start position:0%
representative manner of charge on it
yes

01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:44.639 align:start position:0%
you're basically asking a question that
 
01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
the commission would study we don't need
 
01:30:48.629 --> 01:30:48.639 align:start position:0%
to know that information to decide
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not we're going to establish
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
this commission so thank you
 
01:30:54.790 --> 01:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
respectfully i i'd like to confine our
 
01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
questions to the bill itself
 
01:30:58.390 --> 01:30:58.400 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki okay thank you mr
 
01:30:59.750 --> 01:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
chairman and this may be somewhat
 
01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
hypothetical but mr scully um if this we
 
01:31:06.470 --> 01:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
wish to start putting a charge on um oil
 
01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
and propane dealers might we have a
 
01:31:10.950 --> 01:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
problem of people pirating the energy in
 
01:31:12.629 --> 01:31:12.639 align:start position:0%
from out of state we've got the fixed
 
01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
assets for natural gas but all we need
 
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:22.550 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
i would tell you right now that border
 
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
communities use dealers out of state
 
01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know in vermont maine and
 
01:31:30.790 --> 01:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
massachusetts right now
 
01:31:33.430 --> 01:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
so i would like to believe that the
 
01:31:35.669 --> 01:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
industry that i represent is honest
 
01:31:35.679 --> 01:31:36.709 align:start position:0%
industry that i represent is honest
um

01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:36.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
and they would
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
comply with the law but um
 
01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
i guess anything's possible
 
01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:44.629 align:start position:0%
i guess anything's possible
representative

01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
all right let's not let our questions
 
01:31:48.629 --> 01:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
wander into what the commission is going
 
01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
to be studying itself let's just confine
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
our questions to whether or not this
 
01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
commission is needed
 
01:31:58.390 --> 01:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
yes thanks for taking my question i'd
 
01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
like to ask a question uh really
 
01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
um if i understand correctly i think
 
01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:05.510 align:start position:0%
um if i understand correctly i think
that

01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
what this bill may end up doing is
 
01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
taking a hard look at
 
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
bringing uh
 
01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
oil and natural gas and propane in line
 
01:32:16.229 --> 01:32:16.239 align:start position:0%
what we're already doing with the
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
electric industry perhaps
 
01:32:21.110 --> 01:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
um in funding such uh situations with
 
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire saves so to me it seems
 
01:32:26.709 --> 01:32:26.719 align:start position:0%
like a basic question of fairness
 
01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
but i would
 
01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
like to you to parse that out for me if
 
01:32:32.709 --> 01:32:32.719 align:start position:0%
you would and tell me how
 
01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
you believe that the oil industry should
 
01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
be exempted from something we're already
 
01:32:38.790 --> 01:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
doing for the
 
01:32:40.149 --> 01:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
electric sp
 
01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
but we already have an electric bill
 
01:32:43.590 --> 01:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
well representative we're i believe
 
01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
we're already doing what you're trying
 
01:32:49.110 --> 01:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
to discuss here our industry is already
 
01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:50.229 align:start position:0%
to discuss here our industry is already
um

01:32:50.229 --> 01:32:50.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:52.870 --> 01:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
doing research itself with a check off
 
01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
program where they're collecting funds
 
01:32:57.270 --> 01:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
to create more efficient
 
01:32:59.669 --> 01:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
furnaces and burners so when they
 
01:33:01.510 --> 01:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
install them in the homes in the state
 
01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
and helping fund that new equipment okay
 
01:33:08.070 --> 01:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
that goes into the users homes because
 
01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
it's expensive
 
01:33:12.070 --> 01:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
help to offset the cost for the people
 
01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:13.910 align:start position:0%
help to offset the cost for the people
to

01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
improve their energy efficiency in their
 
01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
homes so we're already doing that and
 
01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
then we're doing that also
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
through the odd fund which i think this
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
committee might be familiar with the oil
 
01:33:25.750 --> 01:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
disbursement um
 
01:33:28.709 --> 01:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
program that the state has through des
 
01:33:28.719 --> 01:33:29.669 align:start position:0%
program that the state has through des
where

01:33:29.669 --> 01:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:33:32.229 --> 01:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
we are using those funds to help
 
01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
consumers when they need to replace
 
01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:36.229 align:start position:0%
consumers when they need to replace
tanks

01:33:36.229 --> 01:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
tanks
 
01:33:38.229 --> 01:33:38.239 align:start position:0%
so that exists today and that's existed
 
01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
for probably over 25 years that program
 
01:33:45.270 --> 01:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
um so we are already i'm being fair um
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
our industry is already participating in
 
01:33:50.070 --> 01:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to look at right here
 
01:33:51.510 --> 01:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
we have two more people who would like
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
to testify on this bill and i would like
 
01:33:55.110 --> 01:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
to hear from them both
 
01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:55.830 align:start position:0%
to hear from them both
so

01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:57.430 --> 01:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
i'd like to move on representative
 
01:33:59.350 --> 01:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
pementel do you have a question about
 
01:34:02.229 --> 01:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
the bill itself
 
01:34:04.629 --> 01:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman yes this is about
 
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
the bill itself
 
01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:07.110 align:start position:0%
the bill itself
um

01:34:07.110 --> 01:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:08.550 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:34:08.550 --> 01:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
the bill itself is a bill to ask a bunch
 
01:34:13.110 --> 01:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
of questions
 
01:34:13.120 --> 01:34:14.390 align:start position:0%
of questions
essentially

01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
and would you agree with me
 
01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
that the best way to find an answer is
 
01:34:21.189 --> 01:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
to ask a question
 
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
well representative yes but i believe
 
01:34:24.870 --> 01:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
the premise of the bill as i read it is
 
01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
also to expand to those people to put
 
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
money in a pot that's the way i look at
 
01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
what you're trying to discuss
 
01:34:35.430 --> 01:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
okay mr scully we thank you very much
 
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman your testimony for
 
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
coming forward today
 
01:34:41.750 --> 01:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
and our next speaker on this issue will
 
01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:42.470 align:start position:0%
and our next speaker on this issue will
be

01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:34:44.470 --> 01:34:44.480 align:start position:0%

01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
who's here to represent the new
 
01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire home builders association
 
01:34:50.950 --> 01:34:50.960 align:start position:0%

good morning members
 
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
first thank you so much for helping with
 
01:34:59.830 --> 01:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
the reverse that bad decision with the
 
01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
puc and chairman thank you so much for
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
your leadership on that thank you
 
01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:04.870 align:start position:0%
your leadership on that thank you
um

01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
took lots of notes so i'll try to
 
01:35:08.310 --> 01:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
address some of your concerns as we go
 
01:35:11.669 --> 01:35:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:13.030 --> 01:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
this is a commission to have a
 
01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:14.709 align:start position:0%
this is a commission to have a
conversation

01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:35:16.870 --> 01:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
to have a study
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
because while electricity is used
 
01:35:20.159 --> 01:35:21.030 align:start position:0%
because while electricity is used
to

01:35:21.030 --> 01:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:35:22.870 --> 01:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
you know administer oil and propane
 
01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:23.830 align:start position:0%
you know administer oil and propane
through

01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
the original new hampshire
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire saves program was designed
 
01:35:31.270 --> 01:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
for those homes that heat by electric
 
01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
they get their heating source from
 
01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:34.390 align:start position:0%
they get their heating source from
electric

01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
electric
 
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:35.679 align:start position:0%
that's how new hampshire saves was
 
01:35:37.350 --> 01:35:37.360 align:start position:0%
originally designed
 
01:35:39.430 --> 01:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
currently right now in new hampshire 10
 
01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
percent of homes
 
01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
are heated by electric
 
01:35:44.709 --> 01:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
so we're having a conversation that
 
01:35:47.109 --> 01:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
excludes 90 percent
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
of homes in the state of new hampshire
 
01:35:51.270 --> 01:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
we like to do is we like to have a
 
01:35:51.280 --> 01:35:53.109 align:start position:0%
we like to do is we like to have a
conversation

01:35:53.109 --> 01:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:35:55.189 --> 01:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
about our friends
 
01:35:58.870 --> 01:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
oil propane natural gas electric get all
 
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders together
 
01:36:04.390 --> 01:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
there's 14 members on there of the 14
 
01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:06.159 align:start position:0%
members three are appointed by the
 
01:36:06.159 --> 01:36:08.149 align:start position:0%
members three are appointed by the
governor

01:36:08.149 --> 01:36:08.159 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
the rest
 
01:36:10.470 --> 01:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
come from
 
01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
your constituents
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
it's me it's bob scully it's others in
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
the industry
 
01:36:18.870 --> 01:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
is to have a discussion because luckily
 
01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not a policy
 
01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
decider you folks are
 
01:36:26.310 --> 01:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
what's wrong with having a conversation
 
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
to talk about an issue to completion
 
01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
that we haven't had a real conversation
 
01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.360 align:start position:0%
about in years
 
01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
you folks are the policymakers
 
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
i can tell you my new favorite color is
 
01:36:39.270 --> 01:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
green the new color of the sky
 
01:36:43.030 --> 01:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
if you folks say no that doesn't happen
 
01:36:45.109 --> 01:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
i think the public
 
01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
our constituents this helps the very
 
01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
lowest of income
 
01:36:54.629 --> 01:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
because right now for instance under the
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
current program
 
01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
you can't replace a window
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
because they say the payback isn't fast
 
01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:04.790 align:start position:0%
because they say the payback isn't fast
enough

01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
enough
 
01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
this commission one things they would
 
01:37:07.109 --> 01:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
look at
 
01:37:08.550 --> 01:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
do we change the rate of return on the
 
01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:11.910 align:start position:0%
do we change the rate of return on the
windows

01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
windows
 
01:37:13.990 --> 01:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
because common sense has always said to
 
01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:15.679 align:start position:0%
me if you have a big gaping hole in your
 
01:37:15.679 --> 01:37:16.629 align:start position:0%
me if you have a big gaping hole in your
wall

01:37:16.629 --> 01:37:16.639 align:start position:0%
wall
 
01:37:18.229 --> 01:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
that's probably the big sieve of your
 
01:37:18.239 --> 01:37:20.870 align:start position:0%
that's probably the big sieve of your
energy

01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:37:23.350 --> 01:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
let's have a conversation about it
 
01:37:26.229 --> 01:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
we haven't in years
 
01:37:26.239 --> 01:37:27.910 align:start position:0%
we haven't in years
that

01:37:27.910 --> 01:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
there doesn't need this there does need
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
to be some realignment with the usda
 
01:37:35.270 --> 01:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
programs and the state programs
 
01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
because when we did this bill originally
 
01:37:41.109 --> 01:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
in full disclosure
 
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
when i helped draft it
 
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
we were in
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
conflict with federal regulations
 
01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
and the department of energy said
 
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
please don't do that you're going to
 
01:37:54.310 --> 01:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
hurt our federal program
 
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
this will begin to helpfully if you
 
01:37:59.030 --> 01:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
folks say yes we like these ideas and
 
01:38:01.510 --> 01:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
again it'll be a menu
 
01:38:03.430 --> 01:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
you folks pick and choose what you like
 
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
and don't like
 
01:38:07.430 --> 01:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
it'll get us more in line
 
01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
we have no problem with any of the you
 
01:38:14.950 --> 01:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
know having licensed professionals there
 
01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
architects engineers
 
01:38:19.350 --> 01:38:19.360 align:start position:0%
we want all the stakeholders at the
 
01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:20.629 align:start position:0%
we want all the stakeholders at the
table

01:38:20.629 --> 01:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
table
 
01:38:22.870 --> 01:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
we can't have enough opinions because we
 
01:38:24.870 --> 01:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
all bring life experience from different
 
01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:26.629 align:start position:0%
all bring life experience from different
perspectives

01:38:26.629 --> 01:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
perspectives
 
01:38:29.350 --> 01:38:29.360 align:start position:0%
and so we'll gladly take that
 
01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:35.910 align:start position:0%
and so we'll gladly take that
the

01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:37.350 --> 01:38:37.360 align:start position:0%
i took a lot of notes as you saw i'm
 
01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:38.950 align:start position:0%
i took a lot of notes as you saw i'm
sorry

01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:38:40.149 --> 01:38:40.159 align:start position:0%
when you talk about the fiscal
 
01:38:40.159 --> 01:38:43.669 align:start position:0%
when you talk about the fiscal
participation

01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:46.870 --> 01:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
what we're asking this commission to do
 
01:38:49.109 --> 01:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
is start with a whiteboard a clean
 
01:38:49.119 --> 01:38:50.950 align:start position:0%
is start with a whiteboard a clean
whiteboard

01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
whiteboard
 
01:38:52.870 --> 01:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
put everything on the table
 
01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
have the conversation because again
 
01:39:00.070 --> 01:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
chairman you and the committee
 
01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
you pass the policies
 
01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
then it goes to our friends in the
 
01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:06.470 align:start position:0%
then it goes to our friends in the
senate

01:39:06.470 --> 01:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
senate
 
01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
then it goes to the governor
 
01:39:10.229 --> 01:39:10.239 align:start position:0%
if we don't have a conversation what do
 
01:39:13.590 --> 01:39:13.600 align:start position:0%

but we just want all the stakeholders at
 
01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
the table

01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
conflicts with the federal rules that

you said you bumped into originally and
 
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
how they were resolved

how they were resolved
yes

01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:57.109 --> 01:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at middle space i'm trying
 
01:39:58.950 --> 01:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
to think back to that conversation i
 
01:40:01.270 --> 01:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
think had to do with the administration
 
01:40:03.350 --> 01:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
or the eligibility
 
01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:06.550 align:start position:0%
or the eligibility
of

01:40:06.550 --> 01:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:08.639 align:start position:0%
of the federal energy savings and
 
01:40:10.870 --> 01:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
weatherization dollars
 
01:40:13.430 --> 01:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
back who could use them different income
 
01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:14.709 align:start position:0%
back who could use them different income
um

01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:14.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
different income criteria
 
01:40:19.030 --> 01:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
um what i can do representatives i can
 
01:40:20.229 --> 01:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
get you
 
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
i'll look back at my other notes i can
 
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
follow back with you this afternoon via
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
email and tell you where that those
 
01:40:27.189 --> 01:40:27.199 align:start position:0%
differences were exactly i'm sorry i
 
01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
don't have a complete answer but i will
 
01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:33.760 align:start position:0%

thomas

01:40:38.470 --> 01:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
thomas
 
01:40:40.790 --> 01:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you mr
 
01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
mayberry for taking my question
 
01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
um i just have a
 
01:40:46.470 --> 01:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
question we
 
01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
you talked about having conversations
 
01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
right now i believe the legislature
 
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
house between house and senate we have
 
01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:56.960 align:start position:0%
at least a house anyway we have over 400
 
01:40:59.270 --> 01:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
conversations going on with 400
 
01:41:01.430 --> 01:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
commissions and committees
 
01:41:04.550 --> 01:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
um some have been around forever and
 
01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
but so my question is
 
01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
is it possible that we could fold in the
 
01:41:13.270 --> 01:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
requirements of this commission
 
01:41:15.430 --> 01:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
into an existing
 
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
commission or committee that we already
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
have established
 
01:41:21.590 --> 01:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
instead of forming another one to make
 
01:41:23.590 --> 01:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
it 401
 
01:41:25.030 --> 01:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
commissions uh
 
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
do you think that would you do you think
 
01:41:29.189 --> 01:41:29.199 align:start position:0%
that this is a a real question do you
 
01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
think that could be effective absolutely
 
01:41:33.669 --> 01:41:33.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely we want to have that
 
01:41:35.030 --> 01:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
conversation i have no problem
 
01:41:37.030 --> 01:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
consolidating it into one
 
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
and having a larger conversation we just
 
01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
want to participate in it representative
 
01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
we think it's overdue we all know the
 
01:41:47.189 --> 01:41:47.199 align:start position:0%
cost of heating our homes and it
 
01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
strongly affects those on the lowest
 
01:41:51.590 --> 01:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
income who can't come and spend time
 
01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
with you today
 
01:41:55.270 --> 01:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
so we're we're trying to help those
 
01:41:56.950 --> 01:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
folks up but yes sir we'll gladly
 
01:41:56.960 --> 01:41:58.550 align:start position:0%
folks up but yes sir we'll gladly
consolidate

01:41:58.550 --> 01:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
consolidate
 
01:41:59.669 --> 01:41:59.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:42:02.709 --> 01:42:02.719 align:start position:0%
representative pimentel has a question
 
01:42:04.950 --> 01:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you mr
 
01:42:06.790 --> 01:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
mayberry um
 
01:42:09.430 --> 01:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
on that same line of questioning this
 
01:42:12.709 --> 01:42:12.719 align:start position:0%
bill has a effective date
 
01:42:16.070 --> 01:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
would it make sense to put a sunset date
 
01:42:17.990 --> 01:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
on it it does
 
01:42:22.950 --> 01:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:30.310 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:32.229 --> 01:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
yes the line about uh the committee
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
being repealed is the sunset date
 
01:42:34.800 --> 01:42:35.830 align:start position:0%
being repealed is the sunset date
pardon

01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
pardon
 
01:42:37.669 --> 01:42:37.679 align:start position:0%
the line about the committee being
 
01:42:37.679 --> 01:42:38.870 align:start position:0%
the line about the committee being
repealed

01:42:38.870 --> 01:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
01:42:41.109 --> 01:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
is the sunset
 
01:42:41.119 --> 01:42:42.390 align:start position:0%
is the sunset
provision

01:42:42.390 --> 01:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
provision
 
01:42:45.430 --> 01:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
yep and then it it ends uh december 16
 
01:42:48.070 --> 01:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
2022 so it does have a
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
we're in we're out this is not going to

drag on forever
 
01:42:53.990 --> 01:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative mick williams has a
 
01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:56.070 align:start position:0%
representative mick williams has a
question

01:42:56.070 --> 01:42:56.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:42:57.750 --> 01:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so much mr mayberry for coming
 
01:42:59.990 --> 01:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
and giving us your testimony today i
 
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
just want to get a little bit more into
 
01:43:02.790 --> 01:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
the specifics
 
01:43:04.950 --> 01:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
to representative thomas question about
 
01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
combining with other potential
 
01:43:08.709 --> 01:43:08.719 align:start position:0%
commissions or study committees i know
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of work that's being done
 
01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
by members of the house and senate with
 
01:43:14.709 --> 01:43:14.719 align:start position:0%
the community to try to find solutions
 
01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
to many pressing questions
 
01:43:19.590 --> 01:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
right now i'm seeing a lot of good work
 
01:43:21.189 --> 01:43:21.199 align:start position:0%
coming out of the building code review
 
01:43:21.199 --> 01:43:22.149 align:start position:0%
coming out of the building code review
board

01:43:22.149 --> 01:43:22.159 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:43:24.470 --> 01:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
is that a potential home for some of
 
01:43:26.149 --> 01:43:26.159 align:start position:0%
these issues or do you think that we
 
01:43:27.750 --> 01:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
really do need to have a formal
 
01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:46.790 --> 01:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:49.030 --> 01:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
i think with the building
 
01:43:51.189 --> 01:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
code review board
 
01:43:59.510 --> 01:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:02.629 --> 01:44:02.639 align:start position:0%
there's a home for vote for both
 
01:44:04.149 --> 01:44:04.159 align:start position:0%
but my party
 
01:44:06.870 --> 01:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
my initial thought is that we're looking
 
01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:07.910 align:start position:0%
my initial thought is that we're looking
at

01:44:07.910 --> 01:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:44:10.149 --> 01:44:10.159 align:start position:0%
existing homes right now
 
01:44:12.390 --> 01:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
where a building code review board would
 
01:44:15.189 --> 01:44:15.199 align:start position:0%
deal with those homes moving forward
 
01:44:16.870 --> 01:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
and to certain you know standards at
 
01:44:18.950 --> 01:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
that point in time but where a vast
 
01:44:22.390 --> 01:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
majority of our homes are existing
 
01:44:24.229 --> 01:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
the building code review wouldn't
 
01:44:27.910 --> 01:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily pick up those folks
 
01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
follow up so the building code review
 
01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
board also covers the international
 
01:44:33.990 --> 01:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
existing building code so there is an
 
01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
existing component that our
 
01:44:38.790 --> 01:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
authorities having jurisdiction within
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
the towns
 
01:44:43.109 --> 01:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
look at for existing homes but we don't
 
01:44:45.910 --> 01:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily have a piece to feed back
 
01:44:48.149 --> 01:44:48.159 align:start position:0%
the feedback that we're hearing when
 
01:44:49.510 --> 01:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
someone does a renovation of a three
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
family in nashua and they discover that
 
01:44:52.950 --> 01:44:52.960 align:start position:0%
the insulation is terrible and they
 
01:44:54.310 --> 01:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
should probably bring it up to code but
 
01:44:56.629 --> 01:44:56.639 align:start position:0%
it doesn't trigger the dollar signs
 
01:44:57.990 --> 01:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
questions please
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
low income
 
01:45:00.950 --> 01:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
so i'm looking for a way to create a
 
01:45:02.470 --> 01:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
feedback mechanism and your
 
01:45:04.709 --> 01:45:04.719 align:start position:0%
recommendation for how that feedback
 
01:45:06.629 --> 01:45:06.639 align:start position:0%
mechanism could be implemented as part
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
of this commission either under the bcrb
 
01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:10.320 align:start position:0%
or not and that's what i want to hear
 
01:45:13.030 --> 01:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
from you sure i think on page two line
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
six when it talks about a member of the
 
01:45:16.229 --> 01:45:16.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire building officials
 
01:45:17.910 --> 01:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
association would be there to have that
 
01:45:19.750 --> 01:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
voice going forward
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
because if you're going to replace
 
01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
windows or install more insulation or
 
01:45:26.550 --> 01:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
change out a water heater that wouldn't
 
01:45:28.629 --> 01:45:28.639 align:start position:0%
fall either under the
 
01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
bcrb or the icc
 
01:45:33.669 --> 01:45:33.679 align:start position:0%
but the building officials would have
 
01:45:33.679 --> 01:45:35.109 align:start position:0%
but the building officials would have
that

01:45:35.109 --> 01:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:45:37.350 --> 01:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
that voice at that commission to bring
 
01:45:38.470 --> 01:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
the afford
 
01:45:41.350 --> 01:45:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:42.790 --> 01:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
so to clarify it sounds like you would
 
01:45:45.189 --> 01:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
recommend a commission
 
01:45:47.189 --> 01:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
i recommend passage of this
 
01:45:49.590 --> 01:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
um because on there there is a member
 
01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:50.550 align:start position:0%
um because on there there is a member
again

01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:45:53.590 --> 01:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
we have no problem adding more voices
 
01:45:55.350 --> 01:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
but we did bring in the building
 
01:45:57.990 --> 01:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
officials association that enforces that
 
01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.270 align:start position:0%
officials association that enforces that
code

01:45:59.270 --> 01:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
code
 
01:46:03.430 --> 01:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:05.350 --> 01:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
mr mayberry thank you very much for your
 
01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
testimony chairman thank you so much
 
01:46:09.189 --> 01:46:09.199 align:start position:0%
have a nice day thank you
 
01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
we have one last person who would like
 
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:19.750 --> 01:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
and that is matt menning who represents
 
01:46:21.990 --> 01:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
elm grove companies
 
01:46:27.109 --> 01:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:29.590 --> 01:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
elm grove companies is a
 
01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:31.109 align:start position:0%
elm grove companies is a
developer

01:46:31.109 --> 01:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
developer
 
01:46:33.189 --> 01:46:33.199 align:start position:0%
renovator operator multi-family
 
01:46:34.470 --> 01:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
apartment so
 
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
my experience in this world comes from
 
01:46:40.149 --> 01:46:40.159 align:start position:0%
a user of the new hampshire saves
 
01:46:42.149 --> 01:46:42.159 align:start position:0%
program many times over
 
01:46:43.750 --> 01:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
we've renovated hundreds of
 
01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
single-family homes
 
01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:46.310 align:start position:0%
single-family homes
maybe

01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
01:46:48.390 --> 01:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
over a thousand apartments
 
01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
and i think that our experience in that
 
01:46:53.669 --> 01:46:53.679 align:start position:0%
world of renovating existing housing
 
01:46:55.990 --> 01:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
stock rather than
 
01:46:58.070 --> 01:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
primarily building new homes
 
01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
has shown us the pervasiveness of
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
poor energy management in our structures
 
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:08.390 align:start position:0%
in the state
um

01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:11.990 --> 01:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
if you are a low-income homeowner or
 
01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
a low-income renter an apartment
 
01:47:17.109 --> 01:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
the things that are in your face are
 
01:47:19.510 --> 01:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
roof leaks plumbing issues heating
 
01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:22.229 align:start position:0%
roof leaks plumbing issues heating
equipment

01:47:22.229 --> 01:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
01:47:24.070 --> 01:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
a homeowner that has to replace the roof
 
01:47:25.590 --> 01:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
for ten thousand dollars and doesn't
 
01:47:27.990 --> 01:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
have even a thousand in the bank
 
01:47:29.750 --> 01:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
they have to deal with that problem the
 
01:47:31.189 --> 01:47:31.199 align:start position:0%
fact that their
 
01:47:33.430 --> 01:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
utility bill is two or three x what it
 
01:47:35.990 --> 01:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
should be if it was properly insulated
 
01:47:37.669 --> 01:47:37.679 align:start position:0%
it just can't register they can't spend
 
01:47:39.270 --> 01:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
another ten or fifteen thousand dollars
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
when um
 
01:47:42.629 --> 01:47:42.639 align:start position:0%
improving the weatherization of their
 
01:47:44.229 --> 01:47:44.239 align:start position:0%
home so
 
01:47:45.510 --> 01:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:47:48.550 --> 01:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
mar our interest in this is to look at
 
01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
the program as a whole
 
01:47:54.310 --> 01:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
funding levels where does it come from
 
01:47:56.310 --> 01:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
but also how the program is administered
 
01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:57.830 align:start position:0%
but also how the program is administered
because

01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:47:57.840 --> 01:47:58.870 align:start position:0%
because
it's

01:47:58.870 --> 01:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:48:00.950 --> 01:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
relatively opaque even to a company that
 
01:48:03.189 --> 01:48:03.199 align:start position:0%
specializes in renovation
 
01:48:06.390 --> 01:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
we've been surprised as the whole um puc
 
01:48:07.830 --> 01:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
discussion has evolved over the last few
 
01:48:09.910 --> 01:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
months and we've learned more
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
some of these
 
01:48:13.109 --> 01:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
allocations of funds and what's eligible
 
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
and what's not and whether you're on the
 
01:48:17.189 --> 01:48:17.199 align:start position:0%
electric utility or natural gas utility
 
01:48:18.709 --> 01:48:18.719 align:start position:0%
or you're heated by propane or oil or
 
01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
something else
 
01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
there's different pathways you can go
 
01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
down it can get kind of confusing so
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
it's not just about funding but it's
 
01:48:28.229 --> 01:48:28.239 align:start position:0%
also about how do we spend the dollars
 
01:48:29.590 --> 01:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
we have in the most efficient way and
 
01:48:31.510 --> 01:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
how do we help people
 
01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:32.470 align:start position:0%
how do we help people
understand

01:48:32.470 --> 01:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:48:34.709 --> 01:48:34.719 align:start position:0%
those pathways and make them easier to
 
01:48:37.750 --> 01:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:39.510 --> 01:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
it i don't i don't know the stats on it
 
01:48:41.350 --> 01:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
i'm not an expert but
 
01:48:42.709 --> 01:48:42.719 align:start position:0%
the number of homes that have no
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
insulation in the state is significant
 
01:48:46.470 --> 01:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
because we've been into hundreds of them
 
01:48:48.310 --> 01:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
the first duplex i bought in nashua he
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
brought up a three family in nashua
 
01:48:52.870 --> 01:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
lived there for a few years uh noticed
 
01:48:54.790 --> 01:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
the gas bills really high my my tenant
 
01:48:56.629 --> 01:48:56.639 align:start position:0%
next door same thing
 
01:48:57.750 --> 01:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
put a drill under the wall there was
 
01:48:59.189 --> 01:48:59.199 align:start position:0%
nothing it was just air straight through
 
01:49:00.709 --> 01:49:00.719 align:start position:0%
to the siding so
 
01:49:03.109 --> 01:49:03.119 align:start position:0%
that was a
 
01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
12 000 job that one did qualify for
 
01:49:08.229 --> 01:49:08.239 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire saves program which i
 
01:49:11.109 --> 01:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
think cut that cost by about 40 percent
 
01:49:11.119 --> 01:49:12.149 align:start position:0%
think cut that cost by about 40 percent
and

01:49:12.149 --> 01:49:12.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:13.830 --> 01:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
i think where we want to see this
 
01:49:15.910 --> 01:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
commission look at is how do we how do
 
01:49:18.149 --> 01:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
we help more people
 
01:49:19.830 --> 01:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
make that kind of improvement and make
 
01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
it in a way that's financially feasible
 
01:49:23.189 --> 01:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
for them
 
01:49:25.109 --> 01:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
the other thing i'd say that
 
01:49:26.629 --> 01:49:26.639 align:start position:0%
makes this discussion particularly
 
01:49:28.709 --> 01:49:28.719 align:start position:0%
pertinent is the world economy that warn
 
01:49:30.709 --> 01:49:30.719 align:start position:0%
ukraine the energy prices that have
 
01:49:31.910 --> 01:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
resulted from
 
01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
that instability
 
01:49:35.830 --> 01:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
we don't have any control over that in
 
01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire right but we
 
01:49:39.589 --> 01:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
do have control over what we invest in
 
01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
our energy usage
 
01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:42.470 align:start position:0%
our energy usage
so

01:49:42.470 --> 01:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:49:45.669 --> 01:49:45.679 align:start position:0%
now more than ever when energy prices
 
01:49:46.950 --> 01:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
are high is when we should be really
 
01:49:48.550 --> 01:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
looking hard at making this program as
 
01:49:51.669 --> 01:49:51.679 align:start position:0%
efficient and effective as possible
 
01:49:53.669 --> 01:49:53.679 align:start position:0%
so i'll take any questions you may have
 
01:49:55.189 --> 01:49:55.199 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you for your
 
01:49:57.750 --> 01:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
testimony uh representative mcgee has a
 
01:49:59.750 --> 01:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you mr chairman and thank
 
01:50:01.990 --> 01:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
you mr manning for taking my question
 
01:50:04.709 --> 01:50:04.719 align:start position:0%
um i know i actually had this question
 
01:50:06.629 --> 01:50:06.639 align:start position:0%
for a couple of speakers now and i think
 
01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
maybe you could speak to it as well
 
01:50:12.470 --> 01:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
when mr scully spoke he talked about
 
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
several federal programs that um
 
01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
oil and propane
 
01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:19.189 align:start position:0%
oil and propane
companies

01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
companies
 
01:50:21.510 --> 01:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
leverage to assist their customers and
 
01:50:23.189 --> 01:50:23.199 align:start position:0%
it sounded like most of them were
 
01:50:25.589 --> 01:50:25.599 align:start position:0%
focused more on the equipment upgrades
 
01:50:27.109 --> 01:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
that you were talking about right so if
 
01:50:29.910 --> 01:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
you can get a more efficient boiler
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
you know or
 
01:50:32.629 --> 01:50:32.639 align:start position:0%
make some kind of capital investments
 
01:50:34.149 --> 01:50:34.159 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't otherwise be able to afford
 
01:50:36.870 --> 01:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
as a low income person
 
01:50:38.950 --> 01:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
you would use nora or some of the other
 
01:50:40.950 --> 01:50:40.960 align:start position:0%
programs he mentioned but that's very
 
01:50:43.350 --> 01:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
distinct from the weatherization savings
 
01:50:44.629 --> 01:50:44.639 align:start position:0%
right so
 
01:50:44.639 --> 01:50:45.830 align:start position:0%
right so
um

01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:47.910 --> 01:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
i think that's the question that i have
 
01:50:49.830 --> 01:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
i mean i look at this bill and i say
 
01:50:51.750 --> 01:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
it's looking really at
 
01:50:54.450 --> 01:50:54.460 align:start position:0%
energy saving weatherization
 
01:50:54.460 --> 01:50:56.229 align:start position:0%
energy saving weatherization
[Music]

01:50:56.229 --> 01:50:56.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:50:58.709 --> 01:50:58.719 align:start position:0%
it says energy saving weatherization
 
01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
program so it i think
 
01:51:02.709 --> 01:51:02.719 align:start position:0%
to me the bill looks like a study
 
01:51:05.030 --> 01:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
program specifically around
 
01:51:06.950 --> 01:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
weatherization savings so what is that
 
01:51:08.790 --> 01:51:08.800 align:start position:0%
and not and not
 
01:51:11.109 --> 01:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
not the other programs that he was
 
01:51:13.350 --> 01:51:13.360 align:start position:0%
saying well we do these so you know you
 
01:51:14.790 --> 01:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
don't need this you don't need to look
 
01:51:15.669 --> 01:51:15.679 align:start position:0%
at this
 
01:51:17.510 --> 01:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
um i think
 
01:51:19.669 --> 01:51:19.679 align:start position:0%
the programs that he says
 
01:51:21.750 --> 01:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
are federally funded to help people with
 
01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
their oil burners and that sort of thing
 
01:51:25.669 --> 01:51:25.679 align:start position:0%
that's not the same thing as this study
 
01:51:25.679 --> 01:51:27.430 align:start position:0%
that's not the same thing as this study
committee

01:51:27.430 --> 01:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
is that your understanding as well
 
01:51:30.790 --> 01:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
yes i
 
01:51:33.189 --> 01:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
it's all it to make a home energy
 
01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
efficient it's all the above right to go
 
01:51:37.830 --> 01:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
from a 50 efficiency boiler to a 96
 
01:51:39.350 --> 01:51:39.360 align:start position:0%
efficiency boiler
 
01:51:42.070 --> 01:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
that makes a huge difference but to
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
lose at a rate of you know
 
01:51:46.709 --> 01:51:46.719 align:start position:0%
have the actual envelope that's heating
 
01:51:48.790 --> 01:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
be a sieve right you could have the most
 
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
efficient boiler in the world but you're
 
01:51:51.910 --> 01:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
still going to spend
 
01:51:54.229 --> 01:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of money heating the outdoors
 
01:51:54.239 --> 01:51:55.109 align:start position:0%
a lot of money heating the outdoors
um

01:51:55.109 --> 01:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:55.119 --> 01:51:56.229 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:51:56.229 --> 01:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:57.990 --> 01:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's one of the things that i
 
01:52:00.390 --> 01:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
would look at if i were to be on this
 
01:52:01.510 --> 01:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
commission which i'd like to be and
 
01:52:02.950 --> 01:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
volunteer for but
 
01:52:05.189 --> 01:52:05.199 align:start position:0%
how do you pull these programs together
 
01:52:07.030 --> 01:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
in a way that makes it
 
01:52:08.790 --> 01:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
the full picture for a homeowner or for
 
01:52:10.709 --> 01:52:10.719 align:start position:0%
a renter yeah
 
01:52:12.070 --> 01:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
because it's not just the equipment it
 
01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
is the envelope
 
01:52:15.270 --> 01:52:15.280 align:start position:0%
so yeah
 
01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative harrington has a question
 
01:52:18.709 --> 01:52:18.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:52:22.149 --> 01:52:22.159 align:start position:0%
your introduction was a little brief so
 
01:52:23.990 --> 01:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
could you you
 
01:52:26.310 --> 01:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
own a business work for a business what
 
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
exactly does your business do sure so uh
 
01:52:30.950 --> 01:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
i'm one of four partners at elm grove
 
01:52:32.310 --> 01:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
companies we
 
01:52:32.320 --> 01:52:33.270 align:start position:0%
companies we
own

01:52:33.270 --> 01:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
own
 
01:52:35.830 --> 01:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
and or manage about 1500 apartments in
 
01:52:37.510 --> 01:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:52:41.030 --> 01:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
we have been in business since 2009
 
01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
and historically have focused on
 
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
renovation and redevelopment
 
01:52:48.149 --> 01:52:48.159 align:start position:0%
both of single family homes but also
 
01:52:50.629 --> 01:52:50.639 align:start position:0%
large multi-family
 
01:52:53.109 --> 01:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
if anyone knows manchester on elm street
 
01:52:54.310 --> 01:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
there was the
 
01:52:55.830 --> 01:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
city hall and
 
01:52:57.510 --> 01:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
ted herbert's music school
 
01:52:58.870 --> 01:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
the kind of renovations we do we'll
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
we'll gut a building out we're very
 
01:53:02.709 --> 01:53:02.719 align:start position:0%
familiar with what it takes to retrofit
 
01:53:05.669 --> 01:53:05.679 align:start position:0%
uh weatherization spray foam insulation
 
01:53:06.870 --> 01:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
dense pack
 
01:53:09.030 --> 01:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh weather stripping windows doors you
 
01:53:10.629 --> 01:53:10.639 align:start position:0%
name it we've been through it
 
01:53:13.669 --> 01:53:13.679 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chairman follow up so if uh
 
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
if this commission were to identify
 
01:53:19.030 --> 01:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
funding opportunities and
 
01:53:22.149 --> 01:53:22.159 align:start position:0%
expand fiscal participation of propane
 
01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
oil users in the new hampshire in the
 
01:53:26.229 --> 01:53:26.239 align:start position:0%
same manner as electric and natural gas
 
01:53:28.629 --> 01:53:28.639 align:start position:0%
there would be more funds available
 
01:53:31.589 --> 01:53:31.599 align:start position:0%
for you to sell your service to so you
 
01:53:33.430 --> 01:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
would hence make more money off of this
 
01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
bill if it was to come if those actual
 
01:53:37.910 --> 01:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
funding opportunities became real
 
01:53:39.510 --> 01:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
theoretically yes
 
01:53:41.510 --> 01:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
i won't say anything to the contrary but
 
01:53:43.109 --> 01:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
i think most of our buildings are
 
01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719 align:start position:0%
serviced by natural gas and electric so
 
01:53:48.149 --> 01:53:48.159 align:start position:0%
how we would
 
01:53:49.990 --> 01:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
be affected by this could be relatively
 
01:53:51.270 --> 01:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
minimal but
 
01:53:53.350 --> 01:53:53.360 align:start position:0%
it's actually been in some of the rural
 
01:53:54.870 --> 01:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
communities where we don't have that
 
01:53:59.270 --> 01:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
the funding sources through the electric
 
01:54:03.189 --> 01:54:03.199 align:start position:0%
utility and there's a few questions
 
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
i don't understand the system benefits
 
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
charge very well but i i know just
 
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
enough that
 
01:54:13.270 --> 01:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
if you are not on
 
01:54:16.070 --> 01:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh electric heat through the utility or
 
01:54:17.589 --> 01:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
natural gas heat
 
01:54:19.669 --> 01:54:19.679 align:start position:0%
even though there is funding available
 
01:54:21.910 --> 01:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
for a homeowner who lives in northern
 
01:54:24.629 --> 01:54:24.639 align:start position:0%
new hampshire for instance
 
01:54:27.430 --> 01:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
it's limited significantly because you
 
01:54:29.270 --> 01:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
you that structure is not paying into
 
01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:31.669 align:start position:0%
you that structure is not paying into
the

01:54:31.669 --> 01:54:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:34.229 --> 01:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
utility that actually heats that home
 
01:54:35.669 --> 01:54:35.679 align:start position:0%
i believe there is funding i don't know
 
01:54:37.109 --> 01:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
the exact rules i'm sure someone from
 
01:54:38.470 --> 01:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
liberty or eversource could speak to
 
01:54:40.629 --> 01:54:40.639 align:start position:0%
that further
 
01:54:43.350 --> 01:54:43.360 align:start position:0%
representative samsic has a question
 
01:54:45.830 --> 01:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you mr
 
01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:46.790 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you mr
manning

01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
manning
 
01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh in your experience based on your your
 
01:54:52.470 --> 01:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
rehab work and and redevelopment
 
01:54:55.750 --> 01:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
what do what do you see as the the most
 
01:54:59.189 --> 01:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
uh cost efficient way of reducing energy
 
01:54:59.199 --> 01:55:02.950 align:start position:0%
uh cost efficient way of reducing energy
use

01:55:02.950 --> 01:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
if you every building is different right
 
01:55:08.229 --> 01:55:08.239 align:start position:0%
depending on the existing conditions but
 
01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
generally we have found that stopping
 
01:55:13.270 --> 01:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
air penetration is the number one thing
 
01:55:15.430 --> 01:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
air penetration can be through
 
01:55:18.470 --> 01:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
gaps in doors or windows uh gaps in
 
01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:19.750 align:start position:0%
gaps in doors or windows uh gaps in
walls

01:55:19.750 --> 01:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
walls
 
01:55:21.910 --> 01:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
gaps in basements actually sometimes the
 
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
most cost-effective thing you can do is
 
01:55:26.070 --> 01:55:26.080 align:start position:0%
insulate your basement which seems a
 
01:55:28.149 --> 01:55:28.159 align:start position:0%
little counter-intuitive but the cold
 
01:55:30.229 --> 01:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
air comes in the warm air from the house
 
01:55:31.669 --> 01:55:31.679 align:start position:0%
sucks it up and you create this kind of
 
01:55:33.669 --> 01:55:33.679 align:start position:0%
wind tunnel
 
01:55:33.679 --> 01:55:34.790 align:start position:0%
wind tunnel
beyond

01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
01:55:37.510 --> 01:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
air penetrations then i would say
 
01:55:39.109 --> 01:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
increasing the r value increasing the
 
01:55:41.109 --> 01:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
actual insulation in the attic and the
 
01:55:41.119 --> 01:55:42.629 align:start position:0%
actual insulation in the attic and the
walls

01:55:42.629 --> 01:55:42.639 align:start position:0%
walls
 
01:55:44.629 --> 01:55:44.639 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:55:47.030 --> 01:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you seeing no questions for
 
01:55:49.990 --> 01:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:53.430 --> 01:55:53.440 align:start position:0%
okay representative callie pitts
 
01:55:55.589 --> 01:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
it's one question that's always uh
 
01:55:57.589 --> 01:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
concerned me over the decades about
 
01:55:57.599 --> 01:55:58.830 align:start position:0%
concerned me over the decades about
whether

01:55:58.830 --> 01:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:56:01.750 --> 01:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
weatherization not necessarily complete
 
01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:03.589 align:start position:0%
weatherization not necessarily complete
renovation

01:56:03.589 --> 01:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
renovation
 
01:56:06.790 --> 01:56:06.800 align:start position:0%
who once you complete a weatherization
 
01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:09.189 align:start position:0%
who once you complete a weatherization
program

01:56:09.189 --> 01:56:09.199 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:56:12.390 --> 01:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:14.790 --> 01:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
judged for quality
 
01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:16.229 align:start position:0%
judged for quality
um

01:56:16.229 --> 01:56:16.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:16.239 --> 01:56:17.030 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:19.910 --> 01:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
is that done on a sporadic basis or is
 
01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:25.589 align:start position:0%
 
consistently

01:56:25.589 --> 01:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
consistently
 
01:56:28.390 --> 01:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
so if you put in new windows you put in
 
01:56:31.109 --> 01:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
new blow-in air can you know
 
01:56:31.119 --> 01:56:32.470 align:start position:0%
new blow-in air can you know
insulation

01:56:32.470 --> 01:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
insulation
 
01:56:34.629 --> 01:56:34.639 align:start position:0%
does anyone come back then and say well
 
01:56:36.870 --> 01:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
yes this really
 
01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:38.870 align:start position:0%
yes this really
worked

01:56:38.870 --> 01:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
worked
 
01:56:40.390 --> 01:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a very good question
 
01:56:43.270 --> 01:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
it's it is not consistent in my
 
01:56:45.430 --> 01:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
experience i don't know if others would
 
01:56:47.589 --> 01:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
agree or not but
 
01:56:48.870 --> 01:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
if you go through the new hampshire
 
01:56:51.189 --> 01:56:51.199 align:start position:0%
saves program there generally is
 
01:56:53.109 --> 01:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
engineering oversight in some regard if
 
01:56:55.350 --> 01:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
you do not
 
01:56:57.189 --> 01:56:57.199 align:start position:0%
i think it comes down then to the local
 
01:57:00.070 --> 01:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
building code official and
 
01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:00.950 align:start position:0%
building code official and
uh

01:57:00.950 --> 01:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:57:03.030 --> 01:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
as you know with a state with this many
 
01:57:04.870 --> 01:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
towns of varying populations and
 
01:57:06.870 --> 01:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
staffing that can be
 
01:57:10.470 --> 01:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
that can be hit or miss so
 
01:57:11.990 --> 01:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
i will also say that we have worked with
 
01:57:13.830 --> 01:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
contractors that have done a poor
 
01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
quality job that we found because we
 
01:57:17.109 --> 01:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
know what we're looking for
 
01:57:18.390 --> 01:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
that could be something this commission
 
01:57:20.470 --> 01:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
looks at is ensuring
 
01:57:22.149 --> 01:57:22.159 align:start position:0%
quality oversight so we don't have
 
01:57:24.310 --> 01:57:24.320 align:start position:0%
fly-by-night contractors doing a poor
 
01:57:26.310 --> 01:57:26.320 align:start position:0%
job for folks
 
01:57:27.990 --> 01:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up i'm just going to follow up
 
01:57:29.990 --> 01:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
because i think one of the things that
 
01:57:31.830 --> 01:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
was said was they were looking to ease
 
01:57:33.990 --> 01:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
up the restrictions or to study the
 
01:57:35.669 --> 01:57:35.679 align:start position:0%
restrictions of allowing people to do
 
01:57:37.270 --> 01:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
this kind of work
 
01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:38.550 align:start position:0%
this kind of work
um

01:57:38.550 --> 01:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
do you think there should be something
 
01:57:43.270 --> 01:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
in this commission that would also look
 
01:57:45.589 --> 01:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
at results
 
01:57:47.830 --> 01:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
or at work quality
 
01:57:49.589 --> 01:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
i think that would be a great idea yeah
 
01:57:51.910 --> 01:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
i think not only to ensure that we have
 
01:57:55.030 --> 01:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
good quality work but also to
 
01:57:57.350 --> 01:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
put together a retroactive analysis
 
01:57:59.109 --> 01:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
should something change with the program
 
01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:04.870 --> 01:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions for mr
 
01:58:06.709 --> 01:58:06.719 align:start position:0%
benning we want to thank you for your
 
01:58:09.350 --> 01:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
testimony here today and
 
01:58:11.910 --> 01:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
i would ask representative mick williams
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
to let us know what the blue sheet has
 
01:58:19.430 --> 01:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:21.910 --> 01:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
senate bill 269 we have eight supporting
 
01:58:24.550 --> 01:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
one opposing two neutral and online
 
01:58:27.189 --> 01:58:27.199 align:start position:0%
signup is open until midnight
 
01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay with that we will close the public
 
01:58:32.310 --> 01:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
hearing on senate bill 269
 
01:58:34.390 --> 01:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
and we will take a
 
01:58:37.750 --> 01:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
three-minute bio break before we embark
 
01:59:51.589 --> 01:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:51.599 --> 02:00:23.510 align:start position:0%
 
well

02:00:23.510 --> 02:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:32.790 align:start position:0%
 
that's

02:00:32.790 --> 02:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:52.229 --> 02:00:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:52.239 --> 02:01:03.750 align:start position:0%
 
i

02:01:03.750 --> 02:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:08.790 --> 02:01:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:22.950 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:01:22.950 --> 02:01:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:59.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:01:59.910 --> 02:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:59.920 --> 02:02:42.550 align:start position:0%
 
now

02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:40.950 --> 02:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:59.669 --> 02:03:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:01.669 --> 02:04:01.679 align:start position:0%
please take your seats we're about to
 
02:04:01.679 --> 02:04:03.990 align:start position:0%
please take your seats we're about to
resume

02:04:03.990 --> 02:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
resume
 
02:04:06.149 --> 02:04:06.159 align:start position:0%
i'm going to open a public hearing
 
02:04:08.709 --> 02:04:08.719 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 270
 
02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
establishing a low moderate income
 
02:04:14.069 --> 02:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
community solar program and i'd like to
 
02:04:16.950 --> 02:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
introduce the prime sponsor of the bill
 
02:04:19.109 --> 02:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
senator waters to introduce the bill to
 
02:04:20.950 --> 02:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
us thank you senator thank you mr
 
02:04:22.629 --> 02:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
chairman senator waters district 4
 
02:04:24.589 --> 02:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
introducing senate bill
 
02:04:27.030 --> 02:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
270 and um
 
02:04:28.629 --> 02:04:28.639 align:start position:0%
let me just note as i start here that we
 
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
missed a couple technical corrections
 
02:04:34.390 --> 02:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh in the senate and so this replace all
 
02:04:36.229 --> 02:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
amendment you have why don't we just
 
02:04:37.510 --> 02:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
stick with the
 
02:04:39.750 --> 02:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
what you have before you the version you
 
02:04:41.589 --> 02:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
already have and i'll just point out
 
02:04:42.790 --> 02:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
where the couple of technical
 
02:04:45.510 --> 02:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
corrections that department of energy
 
02:04:47.430 --> 02:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
spotted and um
 
02:04:49.510 --> 02:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
may have called but
 
02:04:51.510 --> 02:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
um so this this um
 
02:04:53.669 --> 02:04:53.679 align:start position:0%
bill was uh brought forward by clean
 
02:04:56.310 --> 02:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
energy new hampshire um which
 
02:04:57.990 --> 02:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
to discuss you know what could we do to
 
02:04:59.669 --> 02:04:59.679 align:start position:0%
help the community solar program which
 
02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
we passed it's in statute
 
02:05:04.229 --> 02:05:04.239 align:start position:0%
what can we do to ensure that people can
 
02:05:06.470 --> 02:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
actually get enrolled in the program
 
02:05:09.109 --> 02:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
and um what was noticed was that they
 
02:05:10.950 --> 02:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
had a mechanism down
 
02:05:12.629 --> 02:05:12.639 align:start position:0%
in connecticut where eversource
 
02:05:14.950 --> 02:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
obviously also has territory that
 
02:05:17.189 --> 02:05:17.199 align:start position:0%
anonymized account numbers of those who
 
02:05:19.109 --> 02:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
might qualify for the program could be
 
02:05:22.149 --> 02:05:22.159 align:start position:0%
provided and then from those anonymized
 
02:05:24.149 --> 02:05:24.159 align:start position:0%
account numbers it would be possible to
 
02:05:24.159 --> 02:05:26.229 align:start position:0%
account numbers it would be possible to
assemble

02:05:26.229 --> 02:05:26.239 align:start position:0%
assemble
 
02:05:28.390 --> 02:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
likely clusters or groups of people who
 
02:05:29.669 --> 02:05:29.679 align:start position:0%
could be served
 
02:05:31.910 --> 02:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
by the program so investors or others
 
02:05:33.910 --> 02:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
would know where they get some bang for
 
02:05:35.350 --> 02:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
their buck and work with the community
 
02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:36.229 align:start position:0%
their buck and work with the community
action

02:05:36.229 --> 02:05:36.239 align:start position:0%
action
 
02:05:38.870 --> 02:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh partners and and so on so um that's
 
02:05:40.950 --> 02:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
what we brought forward in the
 
02:05:44.149 --> 02:05:44.159 align:start position:0%
in the bill and um so what it does is it
 
02:05:46.870 --> 02:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
it has a process um
 
02:05:51.189 --> 02:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
here uh for identifying um
 
02:05:53.589 --> 02:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
projects under the community solar
 
02:05:57.510 --> 02:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh program um and again no real change
 
02:05:59.270 --> 02:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
no real new language there just the way
 
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
the program
 
02:06:03.510 --> 02:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh is run and then what's kind of new
 
02:06:05.189 --> 02:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
here is starting on line
 
02:06:07.109 --> 02:06:07.119 align:start position:0%
uh 16
 
02:06:08.870 --> 02:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
where it says the department of energy
 
02:06:10.229 --> 02:06:10.239 align:start position:0%
will be the
 
02:06:10.239 --> 02:06:11.350 align:start position:0%
will be the
entity

02:06:11.350 --> 02:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
entity
 
02:06:13.830 --> 02:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
that consults with electric distribution
 
02:06:16.470 --> 02:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
utilities and select the means
 
02:06:18.629 --> 02:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
about to enroll households as off takers
 
02:06:21.109 --> 02:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
for these low moderate income community
 
02:06:23.589 --> 02:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
solar projects and department of energy
 
02:06:24.950 --> 02:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
said it's willing to take that on it
 
02:06:27.030 --> 02:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
seemed like an efficient and simple way
 
02:06:29.030 --> 02:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
to go that wouldn't require a lot of new
 
02:06:31.109 --> 02:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
administration a lot of new regulations
 
02:06:33.189 --> 02:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
just say they would get the account
 
02:06:35.669 --> 02:06:35.679 align:start position:0%
numbers and they would figure out a a
 
02:06:38.550 --> 02:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
fair and good means to
 
02:06:41.270 --> 02:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
which householders would be
 
02:06:44.390 --> 02:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
enrolled and as it is now um if you are
 
02:06:45.990 --> 02:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
able to participate in this you're
 
02:06:47.910 --> 02:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
enrolled on an opt-out basis because
 
02:06:49.109 --> 02:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
basically it means you're going to get a
 
02:06:51.990 --> 02:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
lot cheaper electricity coming into your
 
02:06:54.550 --> 02:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
household and save you some
 
02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
uh save you some money
 
02:06:57.119 --> 02:06:58.390 align:start position:0%
uh save you some money
um

02:06:58.390 --> 02:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:01.910 --> 02:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
now let me note the uh
 
02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:03.030 align:start position:0%
now let me note the uh
changes

02:07:03.030 --> 02:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
changes
 
02:07:07.189 --> 02:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:09.030 --> 02:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
we forgot to take out administered by
 
02:07:10.950 --> 02:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
the commission because it's administered
 
02:07:13.189 --> 02:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
by the department so just we're going to
 
02:07:16.229 --> 02:07:16.239 align:start position:0%
strike administered by the commission
 
02:07:17.510 --> 02:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
and then down
 
02:07:19.430 --> 02:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
on line 22
 
02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:20.629 align:start position:0%
on line 22
um

02:07:20.629 --> 02:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:22.310 --> 02:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
something that was recommended by the
 
02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
department and by utilities
 
02:07:26.629 --> 02:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
for g there
 
02:07:28.870 --> 02:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
we should insert have all
 
02:07:30.910 --> 02:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable and
 
02:07:35.109 --> 02:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
prudently incurred costs
 
02:07:37.270 --> 02:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
all reasonably and prudently incurred
 
02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:38.229 align:start position:0%
all reasonably and prudently incurred
cost

02:07:38.229 --> 02:07:38.239 align:start position:0%
cost
 
02:07:39.510 --> 02:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
i mean that's kind of the standard
 
02:07:39.520 --> 02:07:40.390 align:start position:0%
i mean that's kind of the standard
language

02:07:40.390 --> 02:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:07:40.400 --> 02:07:41.270 align:start position:0%
language
um

02:07:41.270 --> 02:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:43.189 --> 02:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
to see how
 
02:07:44.950 --> 02:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
one would judge that there are costs
 
02:07:47.430 --> 02:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
that are reasonably to be associated
 
02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
with the program
 
02:07:52.790 --> 02:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
and then um for the very last uh
 
02:07:55.189 --> 02:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
subsection on page two
 
02:07:55.199 --> 02:07:57.430 align:start position:0%
subsection on page two
um

02:07:57.430 --> 02:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:59.510 --> 02:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
we needed to uh
 
02:08:01.189 --> 02:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
actually just repeat the existing
 
02:08:01.199 --> 02:08:02.629 align:start position:0%
actually just repeat the existing
statute

02:08:02.629 --> 02:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:08:06.229 --> 02:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:09.030 --> 02:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
read what it says
 
02:08:11.030 --> 02:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
the department is authorized to petition
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
02:08:15.350 --> 02:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
to assess fines against revoke the
 
02:08:17.510 --> 02:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
registration of
 
02:08:19.830 --> 02:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
and prohibit from doing business in the
 
02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:20.950 align:start position:0%
and prohibit from doing business in the
state

02:08:20.950 --> 02:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:08:23.510 --> 02:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
any group host which violates the
 
02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:24.870 align:start position:0%
any group host which violates the
requirements

02:08:24.870 --> 02:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
02:08:28.390 --> 02:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
of this paragraph and rules adopted for
 
02:08:31.830 --> 02:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
this paragraph pursuant to paragraph x
 
02:08:33.910 --> 02:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
so minor change but it just thought it
 
02:08:36.229 --> 02:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
would be important to mirror exactly the
 
02:08:38.629 --> 02:08:38.639 align:start position:0%
existing statute on that
 
02:08:40.470 --> 02:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
um so bottom line here mr chairman is
 
02:08:42.550 --> 02:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
that we have a we have a program it's
 
02:08:44.229 --> 02:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
been a little having a little bit slow
 
02:08:45.750 --> 02:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
getting off the ground because we
 
02:08:48.229 --> 02:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
haven't had an efficient way to identify
 
02:08:49.990 --> 02:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
the folks who could benefit from it and
 
02:08:52.870 --> 02:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
this bill will with the cooperation of
 
02:08:54.790 --> 02:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh department of energy will let us do
 
02:08:57.189 --> 02:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
that thank you mr chairman
 
02:08:59.189 --> 02:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for introducing uh
 
02:09:01.510 --> 02:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
senate bill 270 do we have questions for
 
02:09:03.350 --> 02:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
the senator representative harrington is
 
02:09:05.109 --> 02:09:05.119 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you mr chairman thank
 
02:09:06.870 --> 02:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
you senator for taking my question
 
02:09:09.270 --> 02:09:09.280 align:start position:0%
as i read this it seems to me this is a
 
02:09:11.270 --> 02:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
another wealth transfer bill we're going
 
02:09:12.950 --> 02:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
to everyone's going to pay higher
 
02:09:15.189 --> 02:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
electric rates so certain people will
 
02:09:17.589 --> 02:09:17.599 align:start position:0%
get welfare payments or subsidies to
 
02:09:18.870 --> 02:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
lower their electric rate is that
 
02:09:18.880 --> 02:09:21.830 align:start position:0%
lower their electric rate is that
correct

02:09:21.830 --> 02:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:24.550 --> 02:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:26.950 --> 02:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh let me say representative that this
 
02:09:29.750 --> 02:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
is an existing program
 
02:09:32.790 --> 02:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
and it has its funding as it already
 
02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:34.149 align:start position:0%
and it has its funding as it already
exists

02:09:34.149 --> 02:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
exists
 
02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
so it's not increasing funding
 
02:09:38.149 --> 02:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
just saying given this program that
 
02:09:39.669 --> 02:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
we've already passed and is in
 
02:09:42.310 --> 02:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
legislation here's a way to help the
 
02:09:44.310 --> 02:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
folks who qualify for it
 
02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:45.270 align:start position:0%
folks who qualify for it
so

02:09:45.270 --> 02:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:46.950 --> 02:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
you know the philosophy about whether we
 
02:09:47.910 --> 02:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
ought to be doing any of this
 
02:09:50.629 --> 02:09:50.639 align:start position:0%
weatherization stuff or low-income
 
02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
energy stuff i mean part of the point
 
02:09:54.310 --> 02:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
had been that if we're gonna if we're
 
02:09:56.149 --> 02:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
gonna approve community solar which we
 
02:09:56.159 --> 02:09:57.589 align:start position:0%
gonna approve community solar which we
did

02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:57.599 align:start position:0%
did
 
02:10:00.390 --> 02:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
um let's make sure that it's not you
 
02:10:01.830 --> 02:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
know that folks
 
02:10:04.310 --> 02:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
uh who are lower income levels
 
02:10:06.629 --> 02:10:06.639 align:start position:0%
get the benefit from it which is kind of
 
02:10:08.229 --> 02:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
what the whole point of
 
02:10:10.310 --> 02:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
system benefit charge or whatever is all
 
02:10:13.109 --> 02:10:13.119 align:start position:0%
about right so follow-up
 
02:10:14.470 --> 02:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
make it very quick
 
02:10:16.870 --> 02:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
so in effect it is it's it's a way to
 
02:10:19.109 --> 02:10:19.119 align:start position:0%
implement that program such that
 
02:10:20.950 --> 02:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
everyone's going to pay a little higher
 
02:10:23.589 --> 02:10:23.599 align:start position:0%
electric rates so certain people i guess
 
02:10:25.910 --> 02:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
that low income is defined by being on a
 
02:10:28.470 --> 02:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
wait list will get subsidies is that
 
02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:29.430 align:start position:0%
wait list will get subsidies is that
correct

02:10:29.430 --> 02:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:30.310 align:start position:0%
correct
well

02:10:30.310 --> 02:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question i don't want
 
02:10:33.910 --> 02:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
to quibble over words the program is not
 
02:10:35.990 --> 02:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
authorizing expenditures other than
 
02:10:37.830 --> 02:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
we're already there so
 
02:10:39.510 --> 02:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
whatever one may think about whether we
 
02:10:41.350 --> 02:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
ought to be doing any things it's a way
 
02:10:42.790 --> 02:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
for the folks who
 
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
who can qualify under the existing
 
02:10:47.430 --> 02:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
program can more easily be identified
 
02:10:50.550 --> 02:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:52.709 --> 02:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions for the
 
02:10:52.719 --> 02:10:54.390 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions for the
senator

02:10:54.390 --> 02:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
senator
 
02:10:57.189 --> 02:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
representative floggie and thank you mr
 
02:10:59.990 --> 02:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you senator waters
 
02:11:02.629 --> 02:11:02.639 align:start position:0%
uh i have a question is um
 
02:11:05.830 --> 02:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
the potential customers low moderate
 
02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:06.870 align:start position:0%
the potential customers low moderate
income

02:11:06.870 --> 02:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
income
 
02:11:09.669 --> 02:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
is that a sign is that an opt-in or is
 
02:11:11.669 --> 02:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
it the utilities going to take
 
02:11:13.750 --> 02:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
information they have
 
02:11:15.750 --> 02:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
without authorization of the customer
 
02:11:17.189 --> 02:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
and share it with
 
02:11:19.189 --> 02:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's uh
 
02:11:19.199 --> 02:11:20.870 align:start position:0%
new hampshire's uh
departments

02:11:20.870 --> 02:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
departments
 
02:11:23.589 --> 02:11:23.599 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question so um
 
02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
these customers are
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
i mean are in a sense they're already
 
02:11:29.270 --> 02:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
identified because the utility already
 
02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:30.310 align:start position:0%
identified because the utility already
knows

02:11:30.310 --> 02:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
knows
 
02:11:32.470 --> 02:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
which accounts these are
 
02:11:33.750 --> 02:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:11:36.390 --> 02:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
what it says is that if you qualify for
 
02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:37.189 align:start position:0%
what it says is that if you qualify for
that

02:11:37.189 --> 02:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:11:39.830 --> 02:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
you might be selected
 
02:11:41.910 --> 02:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
so that you can benefit
 
02:11:44.229 --> 02:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
from it and get cheaper electricity you
 
02:11:45.750 --> 02:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
don't have enough to go around obviously
 
02:11:47.589 --> 02:11:47.599 align:start position:0%
you know the program is limited to to
 
02:11:49.750 --> 02:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
what it is and the funding that what it
 
02:11:51.669 --> 02:11:51.679 align:start position:0%
what it has
 
02:11:54.390 --> 02:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
and so the anonymized numbers would go
 
02:11:56.870 --> 02:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
out and you would receive
 
02:11:58.310 --> 02:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
notice that hey you're going to get a
 
02:11:59.830 --> 02:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
break in your electricity since you
 
02:12:01.589 --> 02:12:01.599 align:start position:0%
qualify for the program
 
02:12:03.189 --> 02:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
and if you don't want that break you can
 
02:12:07.830 --> 02:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:10.950 --> 02:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
representative samsic has a question
 
02:12:13.030 --> 02:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
02:12:13.040 --> 02:12:14.550 align:start position:0%

waters
 
02:12:17.350 --> 02:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
could you just explain to me how this
 
02:12:20.550 --> 02:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
community solar program works
 
02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:21.990 align:start position:0%
community solar program works
are

02:12:21.990 --> 02:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:12:23.109 --> 02:12:23.119 align:start position:0%
is this
 
02:12:25.990 --> 02:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
a vehicle with which then
 
02:12:28.470 --> 02:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
solar installations are being built or
 
02:12:31.350 --> 02:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
we buy solar energy from other sources
 
02:12:31.360 --> 02:12:32.709 align:start position:0%
we buy solar energy from other sources
or

02:12:32.709 --> 02:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:12:34.629 --> 02:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
what's the solar connection here well
 
02:12:36.470 --> 02:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
thanks for a question um
 
02:12:37.990 --> 02:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative why don't i let sam evans
 
02:12:40.069 --> 02:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
brown talk more about it
 
02:12:40.079 --> 02:12:41.109 align:start position:0%
brown talk more about it
okay

02:12:41.109 --> 02:12:41.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:12:42.390 --> 02:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
because they've been more involved with
 
02:12:42.400 --> 02:12:44.149 align:start position:0%
because they've been more involved with
it

02:12:44.149 --> 02:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:12:46.069 --> 02:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
representative harrington
 
02:12:47.589 --> 02:12:47.599 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chairman thank you my
 
02:12:49.910 --> 02:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
question senator i'm just curious the in
 
02:12:51.990 --> 02:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
the middle of the on line 15 you talk
 
02:12:53.750 --> 02:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
about total name plate capacity rating
 
02:12:56.310 --> 02:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
of six megawatts that seems to make a
 
02:12:58.470 --> 02:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
break point if it's over six megawatts
 
02:13:00.310 --> 02:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
it's considered differently what's the
 
02:13:02.229 --> 02:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
significance of the six megawatts is
 
02:13:03.669 --> 02:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
that it's just a random number or is
 
02:13:05.109 --> 02:13:05.119 align:start position:0%
there something behind that that i'm
 
02:13:05.119 --> 02:13:06.870 align:start position:0%
there something behind that that i'm
missing

02:13:06.870 --> 02:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
missing
 
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
thanks for your question um i i think
 
02:13:10.550 --> 02:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
sam evans brown would have something but
 
02:13:12.310 --> 02:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
i think the point is that when you get
 
02:13:15.030 --> 02:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
to that size of project economy scale
 
02:13:17.270 --> 02:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
and you might have it might be cheaper
 
02:13:19.510 --> 02:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
and so you know that's what it says hey
 
02:13:22.550 --> 02:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
look if it gets up to that size um the
 
02:13:24.629 --> 02:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
program would have the has the capacity
 
02:13:27.109 --> 02:13:27.119 align:start position:0%
to decide which which producer they're
 
02:13:28.629 --> 02:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
gonna let in because they're gonna get
 
02:13:34.310 --> 02:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:36.870 --> 02:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
okay seeing those further questions for
 
02:13:39.669 --> 02:13:39.679 align:start position:0%
you senator we'll let you off the hook
 
02:13:41.990 --> 02:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you let you get to an early lunch
 
02:13:43.109 --> 02:13:43.119 align:start position:0%
another bill
 
02:13:44.790 --> 02:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
or another bill
 
02:13:46.950 --> 02:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
whichever is more important
 
02:13:47.910 --> 02:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:13:49.910 --> 02:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
let's now hear from the department of
 
02:13:53.669 --> 02:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
energy and ask griffin robarge to uh
 
02:14:00.790 --> 02:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:02.310 --> 02:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman vos members of the
 
02:14:04.470 --> 02:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
committee for the record griffin roberge
 
02:14:06.069 --> 02:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire department of
 
02:14:08.149 --> 02:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
energy um
 
02:14:11.189 --> 02:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
last week we had informed sander waters
 
02:14:14.470 --> 02:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
and other interested stakeholders that
 
02:14:16.870 --> 02:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
we had three technical concerns with the
 
02:14:19.830 --> 02:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
bill as it came out of the senate
 
02:14:19.840 --> 02:14:20.870 align:start position:0%
bill as it came out of the senate
those

02:14:20.870 --> 02:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:14:23.350 --> 02:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
technical concerns were addressed in
 
02:14:24.709 --> 02:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
this amendment that you have before you
 
02:14:26.870 --> 02:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
1396 s
 
02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:27.910 align:start position:0%
1396 s
um

02:14:27.910 --> 02:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:29.430 --> 02:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
senator waters i think
 
02:14:31.669 --> 02:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
went over each of the concerns that we
 
02:14:34.310 --> 02:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
expressed in how they were addressed
 
02:14:36.790 --> 02:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
so that really concludes my testimony
 
02:14:38.790 --> 02:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any questions and uh
 
02:14:40.390 --> 02:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
to be clear from the outset i didn't
 
02:14:43.270 --> 02:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
mention it we are neutral on the bill um
 
02:14:45.669 --> 02:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
so uh and again with that i'll take any
 
02:14:48.149 --> 02:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
02:14:50.870 --> 02:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
okay representative callie pitts has a
 
02:14:50.880 --> 02:14:54.069 align:start position:0%
okay representative callie pitts has a
question

02:14:54.069 --> 02:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:55.109 --> 02:14:55.119 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
02:14:58.870 --> 02:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
confused as to how
 
02:15:00.870 --> 02:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
well i can't ask a question
 
02:15:03.830 --> 02:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
i'm on a sponsor so let it go i'll ask
 
02:15:06.709 --> 02:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:08.950 --> 02:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
i will ask him offline i'm a sponsor on
 
02:15:13.270 --> 02:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:13.280 --> 02:15:17.189 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:15:17.189 --> 02:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:19.750 --> 02:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
if if we have the time yes
 
02:15:19.760 --> 02:15:20.550 align:start position:0%
if if we have the time yes
uh

02:15:20.550 --> 02:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:15:23.669 --> 02:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
who's next
 
02:15:26.950 --> 02:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
no further questions for
 
02:15:29.750 --> 02:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
the department of energy so mr roberge
 
02:15:31.830 --> 02:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
02:15:33.910 --> 02:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
and we'll next call to the
 
02:15:33.920 --> 02:15:35.189 align:start position:0%
and we'll next call to the
table

02:15:35.189 --> 02:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
table
 
02:15:37.270 --> 02:15:37.280 align:start position:0%
sam evans brown representing clean
 
02:15:39.830 --> 02:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
energy new hampshire and i'm sure mr
 
02:15:42.629 --> 02:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
evans brown has a lot to offer to us
 
02:15:44.310 --> 02:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
including some written testimony so
 
02:15:49.589 --> 02:15:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:51.109 --> 02:15:51.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you members of
 
02:15:52.629 --> 02:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:15:55.510 --> 02:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
02:15:57.030 --> 02:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
this actually was not my idea this was
 
02:15:59.910 --> 02:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
eversource's idea um
 
02:16:02.550 --> 02:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
this is a pilot that was submitted in
 
02:16:04.470 --> 02:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
docket 16
 
02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:06.629 align:start position:0%
docket 16
576

02:16:06.629 --> 02:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
576
 
02:16:10.870 --> 02:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
and it it essentially takes a program
 
02:16:12.310 --> 02:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
that exists in their connecticut service
 
02:16:13.990 --> 02:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
territory and scales it to new
 
02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:15.510 align:start position:0%
territory and scales it to new
hampshire's

02:16:15.510 --> 02:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire's
 
02:16:17.430 --> 02:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
market size and brings it to new
 
02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:18.709 align:start position:0%
market size and brings it to new
hampshire

02:16:18.709 --> 02:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:16:21.510 --> 02:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh and as a bit of a
 
02:16:24.069 --> 02:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
reminder of the history here
 
02:16:25.669 --> 02:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
the governor in 2019 in his state of the
 
02:16:27.750 --> 02:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
state address
 
02:16:29.750 --> 02:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
suggested that if the benefits of net
 
02:16:31.350 --> 02:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
metering are going to flow
 
02:16:34.309 --> 02:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
to folks who are investing in solar we
 
02:16:36.709 --> 02:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
should we should investigate ways to
 
02:16:39.349 --> 02:16:39.359 align:start position:0%
make that program more accessible to low
 
02:16:42.230 --> 02:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
and moderate income customers
 
02:16:43.990 --> 02:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
following that state of the state uh
 
02:16:45.669 --> 02:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
that state of the state address
 
02:16:47.589 --> 02:16:47.599 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire general court passed
 
02:16:48.950 --> 02:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
what is referred to as the low to
 
02:16:51.990 --> 02:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
moderate income adder which uh inc
 
02:16:54.309 --> 02:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
modestly increases the net metering uh
 
02:16:55.990 --> 02:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
tariff for low to moderate income
 
02:16:58.549 --> 02:16:58.559 align:start position:0%
customers who are defined as 300 of the
 
02:17:00.549 --> 02:17:00.559 align:start position:0%
federal excuse me i've got a frog in my
 
02:17:06.549 --> 02:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:06.559 --> 02:17:07.429 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:17:07.429 --> 02:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:17:07.439 --> 02:17:08.950 align:start position:0%
so
uh

02:17:08.950 --> 02:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:17:10.870 --> 02:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
so this is a pre-existing program it has
 
02:17:12.709 --> 02:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
been identified as
 
02:17:15.270 --> 02:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
as a priority by the governor to make
 
02:17:17.910 --> 02:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
sure that folks who are of lower income
 
02:17:19.110 --> 02:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
can benefit from the state's net
 
02:17:21.349 --> 02:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
metering program that if we are going to
 
02:17:23.270 --> 02:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
be providing net metering folk rates to
 
02:17:25.349 --> 02:17:25.359 align:start position:0%
folks that we should that we should try
 
02:17:27.910 --> 02:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
to unlock those rates for customers who
 
02:17:30.870 --> 02:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
have not traditionally benefited
 
02:17:32.950 --> 02:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
in the subsequent years there's been
 
02:17:34.469 --> 02:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
only one project that has taken
 
02:17:36.709 --> 02:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
advantage of this program
 
02:17:38.469 --> 02:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
over the summer eversource conducted a
 
02:17:39.669 --> 02:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
request for information trying to figure
 
02:17:41.429 --> 02:17:41.439 align:start position:0%
out what was going on here
 
02:17:43.509 --> 02:17:43.519 align:start position:0%
and the response they got said that it's
 
02:17:45.190 --> 02:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
very difficult to identify customers
 
02:17:47.270 --> 02:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to identify sites
 
02:17:49.030 --> 02:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to coordinate
 
02:17:50.309 --> 02:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
amongst all the parties who would be
 
02:17:51.589 --> 02:17:51.599 align:start position:0%
required to
 
02:17:53.910 --> 02:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
you know annually income verify folks
 
02:17:56.150 --> 02:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
who would be eligible for this program
 
02:17:57.990 --> 02:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
and indeed it's difficult to achieve
 
02:18:00.950 --> 02:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
economies of scale given given the
 
02:18:03.349 --> 02:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
existing confines of new hampshire's net
 
02:18:04.709 --> 02:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
metering laws
 
02:18:07.110 --> 02:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
and so in response as required by
 
02:18:08.870 --> 02:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
legislation already
 
02:18:11.990 --> 02:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
eversource put forth this pilot program
 
02:18:15.110 --> 02:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
subsequently uh the the poc gave them an
 
02:18:16.549 --> 02:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
extension said you've got you've got
 
02:18:17.910 --> 02:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
another year to implement this pilot
 
02:18:20.629 --> 02:18:20.639 align:start position:0%
program and simply all this bill does is
 
02:18:22.950 --> 02:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
take a program that is already proposed
 
02:18:24.870 --> 02:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
is already is already
 
02:18:27.030 --> 02:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
going to be rolled out in roughly a
 
02:18:29.509 --> 02:18:29.519 align:start position:0%
year's time if the poc approves it and
 
02:18:31.190 --> 02:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
says let's do it we think that's a good
 
02:18:31.200 --> 02:18:32.950 align:start position:0%
says let's do it we think that's a good
idea

02:18:32.950 --> 02:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
idea
 
02:18:32.960 --> 02:18:34.230 align:start position:0%
idea
so

02:18:34.230 --> 02:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:18:36.070 --> 02:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
i think it's a pretty modest proposal
 
02:18:37.509 --> 02:18:37.519 align:start position:0%
it's one that has been proven out in
 
02:18:38.790 --> 02:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
other places
 
02:18:40.309 --> 02:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
eversource themselves say they think
 
02:18:42.389 --> 02:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
this is a very administratively
 
02:18:44.070 --> 02:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
efficient way of doing this
 
02:18:46.230 --> 02:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
um and the the privacy concerns which i
 
02:18:48.870 --> 02:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
think are very valid ones are most most
 
02:18:51.270 --> 02:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
aptly addressed by letting the
 
02:18:52.950 --> 02:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
department of energy and the utilities
 
02:18:54.790 --> 02:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
coordinate in such a way so that so that
 
02:18:57.110 --> 02:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
the the account information of these
 
02:18:58.709 --> 02:18:58.719 align:start position:0%
already identified income eligible
 
02:19:00.629 --> 02:19:00.639 align:start position:0%
customers does not
 
02:19:02.309 --> 02:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
you know become public knowledge in any
 
02:19:03.589 --> 02:19:03.599 align:start position:0%
possible way
 
02:19:05.589 --> 02:19:05.599 align:start position:0%
and the the bill as written attempts to
 
02:19:05.599 --> 02:19:06.389 align:start position:0%
and the the bill as written attempts to
allow

02:19:06.389 --> 02:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
allow
 
02:19:08.950 --> 02:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh the the doe and the utilities to
 
02:19:11.270 --> 02:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
figure out how to do that
 
02:19:11.280 --> 02:19:12.309 align:start position:0%
figure out how to do that
so

02:19:12.309 --> 02:19:12.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:19:14.389 --> 02:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
that's all i really have to say um again
 
02:19:16.389 --> 02:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
as i said this was not my idea i'm
 
02:19:18.309 --> 02:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
simply saying let's do it
 
02:19:22.150 --> 02:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:23.270 --> 02:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
great so
 
02:19:26.790 --> 02:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:29.349 --> 02:19:29.359 align:start position:0%
from clean energy new hampshire um did
 
02:19:31.270 --> 02:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
you have a
 
02:19:32.950 --> 02:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
something to say go ahead
 
02:19:35.030 --> 02:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
i am a co-sponsor though so can i ask it
 
02:19:35.040 --> 02:19:36.469 align:start position:0%
i am a co-sponsor though so can i ask it
anyway

02:19:36.469 --> 02:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
02:19:38.629 --> 02:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
you have plenty of time so go ahead okay
 
02:19:40.549 --> 02:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:19:40.559 --> 02:19:41.750 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

02:19:41.750 --> 02:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:43.669 --> 02:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
so the question is around it sounds like
 
02:19:45.509 --> 02:19:45.519 align:start position:0%
from your description
 
02:19:47.270 --> 02:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
that this is
 
02:19:49.190 --> 02:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
to facilitate an administrative
 
02:19:51.510 --> 02:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
procedure that would allow the program
 
02:19:53.349 --> 02:19:53.359 align:start position:0%
to be more successful because they're
 
02:19:55.990 --> 02:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
having difficulty reaching people
 
02:19:58.070 --> 02:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
who might benefit or who we're trying to
 
02:20:00.150 --> 02:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
reach so is that
 
02:20:02.150 --> 02:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
that how you would describe what we're
 
02:20:03.510 --> 02:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
doing here it's an administrative
 
02:20:05.830 --> 02:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
improvement yes correct i mean the the
 
02:20:07.910 --> 02:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
difficulty has been identifying low to
 
02:20:10.790 --> 02:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
moderate income eligible customers uh
 
02:20:12.870 --> 02:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
and b given that the utilities have a
 
02:20:14.950 --> 02:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
list of customers who are who are
 
02:20:16.790 --> 02:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
definitely qualified so the list would
 
02:20:17.910 --> 02:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
come from the electric assistance
 
02:20:20.309 --> 02:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
program which are folks who are who are
 
02:20:22.309 --> 02:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
definitely below the 300
 
02:20:24.150 --> 02:20:24.160 align:start position:0%
federal poverty rate line in fact most
 
02:20:26.230 --> 02:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
of them are below the actual poverty
 
02:20:28.550 --> 02:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
line right so so this is definitely
 
02:20:30.950 --> 02:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
sending the credit to the the the
 
02:20:33.750 --> 02:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
population that is most in need of a
 
02:20:34.790 --> 02:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
little help
 
02:20:36.389 --> 02:20:36.399 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
02:20:38.070 --> 02:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
so it is it is
 
02:20:40.150 --> 02:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh un you know is unlocking a program
 
02:20:42.389 --> 02:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
that already exists and and helping it
 
02:20:44.469 --> 02:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
to get off the ground and i'll just
 
02:20:46.550 --> 02:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
follow up i know representative samsuch
 
02:20:47.990 --> 02:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
had the question earlier of the
 
02:20:49.830 --> 02:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
explanation of the solar piece and you
 
02:20:52.150 --> 02:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
just mentioned the credits so
 
02:20:54.309 --> 02:20:54.319 align:start position:0%
what's happening is it sounds like the
 
02:20:56.309 --> 02:20:56.319 align:start position:0%
governor's request in his state of the
 
02:20:56.319 --> 02:20:57.110 align:start position:0%
governor's request in his state of the
state

02:20:57.110 --> 02:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:20:59.110 --> 02:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
that we be able to figure out a way to
 
02:21:02.309 --> 02:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
take solar advantages and make sure
 
02:21:04.950 --> 02:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
they're distributed to people who are
 
02:21:06.790 --> 02:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
in the low income
 
02:21:09.110 --> 02:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
uh register that that's
 
02:21:10.550 --> 02:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
that's what you're talking about that's
 
02:21:12.150 --> 02:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
exactly what i'm talking about and in
 
02:21:13.510 --> 02:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
fact it would result in the development
 
02:21:15.590 --> 02:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
of new projects essentially if if you
 
02:21:17.590 --> 02:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
were a solar developer you would uh
 
02:21:19.510 --> 02:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
identify a project as being one that
 
02:21:21.429 --> 02:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
would be eligible for these types of off
 
02:21:23.429 --> 02:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
takers uh you would coordinate with the
 
02:21:25.830 --> 02:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
department of energy who would then uh
 
02:21:28.469 --> 02:21:28.479 align:start position:0%
take your project and and assign off
 
02:21:31.510 --> 02:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
takers to it from this list of of income
 
02:21:33.190 --> 02:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
eligible folks that that again the
 
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
utilities have already assembled because
 
02:21:36.389 --> 02:21:36.399 align:start position:0%
they're the participants in the electric
 
02:21:37.990 --> 02:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
assistance program
 
02:21:39.590 --> 02:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:21:39.600 --> 02:21:41.750 align:start position:0%
um and
uh

02:21:41.750 --> 02:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:21:41.760 --> 02:21:43.429 align:start position:0%
uh
yeah

02:21:43.429 --> 02:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:21:45.429 --> 02:21:45.439 align:start position:0%
okay thanks next uh representative
 
02:21:47.270 --> 02:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
lewicki has a question okay thank you mr
 
02:21:49.510 --> 02:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you um
 
02:21:51.030 --> 02:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to understand the mechanics
 
02:21:52.710 --> 02:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
of this and where does the capital come
 
02:21:56.309 --> 02:21:56.319 align:start position:0%
from because somebody has to invest and
 
02:21:58.550 --> 02:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
clearly the people who benefit are not
 
02:22:00.469 --> 02:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
in a position to invest and how would
 
02:22:02.790 --> 02:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
they get their pay back
 
02:22:04.950 --> 02:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
that's a an excellent question um and so
 
02:22:06.389 --> 02:22:06.399 align:start position:0%
solar developers would have to find the
 
02:22:08.469 --> 02:22:08.479 align:start position:0%
capital to to invest up front in these
 
02:22:11.830 --> 02:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
projects and and uh the the department
 
02:22:13.429 --> 02:22:13.439 align:start position:0%
would i mean essentially they would get
 
02:22:15.670 --> 02:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
paid back the same way that that any
 
02:22:17.670 --> 02:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
solar development gets paid back is that
 
02:22:20.870 --> 02:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
you'd have a host who who either is
 
02:22:22.630 --> 02:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
paying the upfront cost themselves and
 
02:22:24.550 --> 02:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
then receiving the benefits or you'd
 
02:22:26.550 --> 02:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
have some sort of third party ownership
 
02:22:28.309 --> 02:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
arrangement in which
 
02:22:30.389 --> 02:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
you know if for instance if the host is
 
02:22:32.309 --> 02:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
not eligible for tax credits it is often
 
02:22:34.309 --> 02:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
the case that that a third-party entity
 
02:22:36.150 --> 02:22:36.160 align:start position:0%
will own the project and arrange to sell
 
02:22:37.830 --> 02:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
the power through a power purchase
 
02:22:39.670 --> 02:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
agreement and so that would that would
 
02:22:40.870 --> 02:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
depend on the hosts who depend on the
 
02:22:42.389 --> 02:22:42.399 align:start position:0%
situation but essentially it would be
 
02:22:43.910 --> 02:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
developed the same way any solar project
 
02:22:46.550 --> 02:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
is developed the question of
 
02:22:48.950 --> 02:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
how to meet out the bill credits to the
 
02:22:51.190 --> 02:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
off takers that is the question that
 
02:22:53.030 --> 02:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
would be delegated to the department of
 
02:22:53.040 --> 02:22:54.550 align:start position:0%
would be delegated to the department of
energy

02:22:54.550 --> 02:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
energy
 
02:22:56.389 --> 02:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
as opposed to being determined by the
 
02:22:58.710 --> 02:22:58.720 align:start position:0%
the site host
 
02:23:01.190 --> 02:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative thomas has a question
 
02:23:03.349 --> 02:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and
 
02:23:05.349 --> 02:23:05.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for your test point
 
02:23:06.950 --> 02:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
in difference to the fact that you've
 
02:23:11.030 --> 02:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned that this is eversource's idea
 
02:23:13.510 --> 02:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
would it be possible perhaps if
 
02:23:16.630 --> 02:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
eversource could come up here and maybe
 
02:23:18.469 --> 02:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
explain their program because these
 
02:23:20.309 --> 02:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
questions seem to be being asked of you
 
02:23:22.070 --> 02:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
of how that program works it's not up to
 
02:23:23.670 --> 02:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
me i mean i don't know if donna is
 
02:23:25.510 --> 02:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
prepared to speak to the program because
 
02:23:27.510 --> 02:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
it does if you're if you're interested i
 
02:23:29.750 --> 02:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
can forward along the program design
 
02:23:31.190 --> 02:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
which has been filed at the public
 
02:23:33.030 --> 02:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
utilities uh commission i have it here
 
02:23:34.469 --> 02:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
in front of me but i i don't know if
 
02:23:36.309 --> 02:23:36.319 align:start position:0%
donna has studied up on on the program
 
02:23:38.550 --> 02:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
so she may not uh i may actually be
 
02:23:39.990 --> 02:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
better positioned to answer them in this
 
02:23:41.750 --> 02:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
i see okay
 
02:23:41.760 --> 02:23:42.550 align:start position:0%
i see okay
you

02:23:42.550 --> 02:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:23:45.590 --> 02:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
well that's my question was i
 
02:23:47.590 --> 02:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
it was their idea so often i thought
 
02:23:48.630 --> 02:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
that they might have come up here and
 
02:23:51.030 --> 02:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
just spoken just for a minute or two on
 
02:23:52.550 --> 02:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
the overall synopsis of it but if
 
02:23:53.990 --> 02:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
they're not if the
 
02:23:55.750 --> 02:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
if the right person is not here for it
 
02:24:00.550 --> 02:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:02.070 --> 02:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
harrington is recognized for a question
 
02:24:03.110 --> 02:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i think you're
 
02:24:04.630 --> 02:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question i'm a little confused
 
02:24:07.349 --> 02:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
at the how this works so i'm going to at
 
02:24:08.389 --> 02:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
first i'm going to start with the
 
02:24:10.630 --> 02:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully the easy question uh the six
 
02:24:12.469 --> 02:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
megawatts i asked senator was there any
 
02:24:14.389 --> 02:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
significance to that six megawatts in
 
02:24:16.070 --> 02:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
aggregate so it's not that would not be
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
an individual project that would be
 
02:24:19.429 --> 02:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
allowed to be six megawatts in size but
 
02:24:21.190 --> 02:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
but that's that's essentially a cap on
 
02:24:22.710 --> 02:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
the program and that's that's again
 
02:24:24.469 --> 02:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
that's taken from eversource's proposal
 
02:24:25.830 --> 02:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
before the puc okay that's where it
 
02:24:28.150 --> 02:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
comes from right follow-up
 
02:24:28.160 --> 02:24:28.950 align:start position:0%
comes from right follow-up
so

02:24:28.950 --> 02:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:24:31.510 --> 02:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
now okay so i'm a low-income electric
 
02:24:34.389 --> 02:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
user and it says i'm going to be mailed
 
02:24:36.389 --> 02:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
to something that says if if i don't do
 
02:24:38.550 --> 02:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
anything because it's opt out i will be
 
02:24:40.469 --> 02:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
given credits
 
02:24:42.790 --> 02:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
how where were these credits coming from
 
02:24:45.110 --> 02:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
the credits essentially are would are
 
02:24:46.630 --> 02:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
generated in the exact same way that
 
02:24:48.630 --> 02:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
that any group net metered project
 
02:24:50.469 --> 02:24:50.479 align:start position:0%
generates bill credits right so we have
 
02:24:52.710 --> 02:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
an existing mechanism through which you
 
02:24:52.720 --> 02:24:53.670 align:start position:0%
an existing mechanism through which you
you

02:24:53.670 --> 02:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:24:55.990 --> 02:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
divvy out the production of a facility
 
02:24:59.270 --> 02:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
to to off takers um and if you you know
 
02:25:00.630 --> 02:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
if you'd like you can grab the form off
 
02:25:02.389 --> 02:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
the pc's website it's it's pretty simple
 
02:25:04.309 --> 02:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
it essentially says here's the here's
 
02:25:06.309 --> 02:25:06.319 align:start position:0%
the account here's the percentage of the
 
02:25:07.510 --> 02:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
of the production that is going to be
 
02:25:10.870 --> 02:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
credited to that account um and and in
 
02:25:13.349 --> 02:25:13.359 align:start position:0%
in the proposal before the puc
 
02:25:17.270 --> 02:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh the the idea was to divide those
 
02:25:19.030 --> 02:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
those credits up in such a way that each
 
02:25:21.429 --> 02:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
customer would receive about 240 worth
 
02:25:23.510 --> 02:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
of bill credit per year uh so that you'd
 
02:25:25.190 --> 02:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
maximize the number of people who could
 
02:25:26.790 --> 02:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
credit who could who could benefit from
 
02:25:29.590 --> 02:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
an individual project um and but there
 
02:25:31.190 --> 02:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
is there is going to be a certain amount
 
02:25:33.429 --> 02:25:33.439 align:start position:0%
of of you know
 
02:25:35.510 --> 02:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
figuring out how much credit should an
 
02:25:37.670 --> 02:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
individual customer get because they're
 
02:25:39.590 --> 02:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
not they're not involved in you know
 
02:25:41.830 --> 02:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
paying for the project themselves which
 
02:25:43.349 --> 02:25:43.359 align:start position:0%
which is often the case in community
 
02:25:45.429 --> 02:25:45.439 align:start position:0%
solar projects you sort of pay into them
 
02:25:47.270 --> 02:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
in this instance the bill credit would
 
02:25:48.710 --> 02:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
be determined by the department of
 
02:25:48.720 --> 02:25:50.630 align:start position:0%
be determined by the department of
energy

02:25:50.630 --> 02:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
energy
 
02:25:52.150 --> 02:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
okay the follow-up done that because i'm
 
02:25:54.309 --> 02:25:54.319 align:start position:0%
just i'm trying to follow the money sure
 
02:25:56.389 --> 02:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
so i understand
 
02:25:58.070 --> 02:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
what you just said but
 
02:26:01.030 --> 02:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
who is actually paying with the credits
 
02:26:02.630 --> 02:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
come from somebody somebody has to open
 
02:26:05.190 --> 02:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
their wallet out and say this is 240
 
02:26:07.510 --> 02:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
okay here's my share who who is paying
 
02:26:10.150 --> 02:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
that and how is it collected so in in
 
02:26:12.469 --> 02:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
this instance it would again the the
 
02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
project would likely be developed by a
 
02:26:16.070 --> 02:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
third party
 
02:26:20.469 --> 02:26:20.479 align:start position:0%
um they would perhaps have a an on-site
 
02:26:23.190 --> 02:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
load that they're they're offsetting
 
02:26:25.510 --> 02:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
um and that that third-party developer
 
02:26:28.070 --> 02:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
would would have to have to
 
02:26:30.630 --> 02:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
look at the the amount of reimbursement
 
02:26:31.910 --> 02:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
that they're getting from the sale of
 
02:26:33.750 --> 02:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
the energy and determine if that's a
 
02:26:36.469 --> 02:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
reasonable return on their capital um if
 
02:26:38.630 --> 02:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
they want to develop it or not uh so so
 
02:26:38.640 --> 02:26:39.429 align:start position:0%
they want to develop it or not uh so so
it's

02:26:39.429 --> 02:26:39.439 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:26:41.349 --> 02:26:41.359 align:start position:0%
it's essentially like any other
 
02:26:43.030 --> 02:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
community solar project you know you'd
 
02:26:44.469 --> 02:26:44.479 align:start position:0%
have to you have to find a source of
 
02:26:46.230 --> 02:26:46.240 align:start position:0%
capital you have to find a site and then
 
02:26:49.750 --> 02:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
but the the the only difference is here
 
02:26:52.630 --> 02:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
the off takers are are outsourced to
 
02:26:55.349 --> 02:26:55.359 align:start position:0%
this eap list so they would be then
 
02:26:58.230 --> 02:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
receiving the uh up till was 100
 
02:27:00.630 --> 02:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
kilowatts they'd get the full rate and
 
02:27:02.389 --> 02:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
then above that it would be just the
 
02:27:03.590 --> 02:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
energy person
 
02:27:05.750 --> 02:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
portion the default service rate right
 
02:27:08.070 --> 02:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
so that's exactly right it would work it
 
02:27:09.590 --> 02:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
i mean it changes nothing about the net
 
02:27:11.910 --> 02:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
metering status all right thank you
 
02:27:16.790 --> 02:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:19.349 --> 02:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
my concern on this one
 
02:27:21.750 --> 02:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
and i am a co-sponsor my concern was the
 
02:27:23.510 --> 02:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
privacy of
 
02:27:23.520 --> 02:27:25.030 align:start position:0%
privacy of
knowing

02:27:25.030 --> 02:27:25.040 align:start position:0%
knowing
 
02:27:30.469 --> 02:27:30.479 align:start position:0%
who and who is not a low-income user and
 
02:27:33.110 --> 02:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
who has that information and to whom
 
02:27:34.630 --> 02:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
it's going to be given
 
02:27:34.640 --> 02:27:35.590 align:start position:0%
it's going to be given
i

02:27:35.590 --> 02:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:27:35.600 --> 02:27:37.110 align:start position:0%
i
also

02:27:37.110 --> 02:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:27:39.670 --> 02:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
i i would imagine that i and i know this
 
02:27:42.309 --> 02:27:42.319 align:start position:0%
program is for single home owners it's
 
02:27:44.790 --> 02:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
not for apartments not for housing
 
02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:46.070 align:start position:0%
not for apartments not for housing
authorities

02:27:46.070 --> 02:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
authorities
 
02:27:49.030 --> 02:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
which would be very interesting is that
 
02:27:50.790 --> 02:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
that information
 
02:27:53.110 --> 02:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
going to be divulged
 
02:27:55.590 --> 02:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
from say housing authorities or other
 
02:27:55.600 --> 02:27:57.270 align:start position:0%
from say housing authorities or other
entities

02:27:57.270 --> 02:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
entities
 
02:27:59.030 --> 02:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so i actually think it could it
 
02:28:00.870 --> 02:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
could flow to any electric account that
 
02:28:02.230 --> 02:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
that is already receiving benefits
 
02:28:03.590 --> 02:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
through the electric assistance program
 
02:28:06.070 --> 02:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
so it may it may be to apartment um
 
02:28:07.830 --> 02:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
dwellers or or folks in the housing
 
02:28:09.030 --> 02:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
authorities i
 
02:28:10.710 --> 02:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
i would not know because those the list
 
02:28:13.910 --> 02:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
of who's on the eap is not public um and
 
02:28:15.750 --> 02:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
i would imagine
 
02:28:17.270 --> 02:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
that it wouldn't be terribly difficult
 
02:28:19.910 --> 02:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
for the utilities to to share enough
 
02:28:20.790 --> 02:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
information with the department of
 
02:28:23.590 --> 02:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
energy for for the doe to determine
 
02:28:25.910 --> 02:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh you know who the off takers or how
 
02:28:27.590 --> 02:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
many off takers they're going to be and
 
02:28:29.670 --> 02:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
and uh and what the bill credit should
 
02:28:32.389 --> 02:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
be without having to share any any
 
02:28:33.670 --> 02:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
private information for instance it
 
02:28:35.750 --> 02:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
could be it could you could they could
 
02:28:38.230 --> 02:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
come up with it's similar to how testing
 
02:28:39.510 --> 02:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
happens in the schools you could come up
 
02:28:41.110 --> 02:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
with sort of an identifier that's not
 
02:28:42.550 --> 02:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
associated with the accounts in any
 
02:28:44.710 --> 02:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
other way and and you know how much
 
02:28:46.150 --> 02:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
what's the electric bill you know the
 
02:28:47.750 --> 02:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
typical load associated with this
 
02:28:49.910 --> 02:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
identifying number and you know that but
 
02:28:52.950 --> 02:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
but the the bill intends to uh you know
 
02:28:54.950 --> 02:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
the the question of did we do what we
 
02:28:56.309 --> 02:28:56.319 align:start position:0%
intend to do is always a fair one but
 
02:28:58.230 --> 02:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
the bill intends to leave that mechanism
 
02:28:59.349 --> 02:28:59.359 align:start position:0%
up to the department of energy and the
 
02:29:01.270 --> 02:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
utilities to determine how to do it in a
 
02:29:06.469 --> 02:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:08.790 --> 02:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
representative partial
 
02:29:10.309 --> 02:29:10.319 align:start position:0%
thank you sir voice
 
02:29:10.319 --> 02:29:11.510 align:start position:0%
thank you sir voice
um

02:29:11.510 --> 02:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:13.270 --> 02:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
just so i can
 
02:29:14.950 --> 02:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
get my mind wrapped around already who
 
02:29:16.550 --> 02:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
may already be qualified for this
 
02:29:16.560 --> 02:29:17.830 align:start position:0%
may already be qualified for this
program

02:29:17.830 --> 02:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:29:21.429 --> 02:29:21.439 align:start position:0%
if i am not receiving any energy uh bill
 
02:29:23.830 --> 02:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
support from the utility currently
 
02:29:25.270 --> 02:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
could i still
 
02:29:25.280 --> 02:29:26.309 align:start position:0%
could i still
apply

02:29:26.309 --> 02:29:26.319 align:start position:0%
apply
 
02:29:28.469 --> 02:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
to benefit from this program if i were
 
02:29:29.910 --> 02:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
income eligible
 
02:29:32.150 --> 02:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh so certainly it is the case that
 
02:29:34.630 --> 02:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
anyone who's income eligible is already
 
02:29:36.309 --> 02:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
eligible to receive the load of modern
 
02:29:38.550 --> 02:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
income adder onto from from a net
 
02:29:40.710 --> 02:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
metered project uh the the problem has
 
02:29:42.150 --> 02:29:42.160 align:start position:0%
been assembling enough of those
 
02:29:43.990 --> 02:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
customers into a block to do a community
 
02:29:45.990 --> 02:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
solar project that actually is you know
 
02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:47.270 align:start position:0%
solar project that actually is you know
financiable

02:29:47.270 --> 02:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
financiable
 
02:29:49.429 --> 02:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
uh which is the problem the bill aims to
 
02:29:50.710 --> 02:29:50.720 align:start position:0%
solve uh
 
02:29:52.710 --> 02:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
that said uh folks folks my
 
02:29:54.550 --> 02:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
understanding is that folks typically
 
02:29:55.670 --> 02:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
learn about the electric assistance
 
02:29:57.270 --> 02:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
program mostly through the the community
 
02:29:59.910 --> 02:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
action programs um and so there there
 
02:30:02.070 --> 02:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
are income eligible customers out there
 
02:30:04.469 --> 02:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
who are not going to be on this list uh
 
02:30:06.309 --> 02:30:06.319 align:start position:0%
and and there are folks who who we would
 
02:30:07.670 --> 02:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
want to either
 
02:30:10.870 --> 02:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
direct to sign up which i think
 
02:30:11.830 --> 02:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
that's what the community action
 
02:30:12.950 --> 02:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
programs are doing all the time is
 
02:30:13.990 --> 02:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
trying to get everyone who's income
 
02:30:15.349 --> 02:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
eligible onto their the electric
 
02:30:17.830 --> 02:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
assistance program um but also you know
 
02:30:20.550 --> 02:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
if if we are successful in getting uh
 
02:30:22.710 --> 02:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
the low to moderate income solar program
 
02:30:23.990 --> 02:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
up and running
 
02:30:25.990 --> 02:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
we we may find that that solar
 
02:30:26.000 --> 02:30:27.110 align:start position:0%
we we may find that that solar
developers

02:30:27.110 --> 02:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
developers
 
02:30:29.750 --> 02:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
are able to to you know through more
 
02:30:31.590 --> 02:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
traditional means start to identify
 
02:30:33.030 --> 02:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
income qualified customers who could
 
02:30:34.469 --> 02:30:34.479 align:start position:0%
serve as off takers for projects and
 
02:30:35.910 --> 02:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
maybe could do some sort of hybrid
 
02:30:37.429 --> 02:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
arrangement between
 
02:30:39.349 --> 02:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
um you know a program that's finding its
 
02:30:40.630 --> 02:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
customers through
 
02:30:42.469 --> 02:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
a project that's finding its customers
 
02:30:44.950 --> 02:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
through this program as well as those
 
02:30:46.870 --> 02:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
more traditional means
 
02:30:48.469 --> 02:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
and i would assume that would include
 
02:30:50.230 --> 02:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
word of mouth as well
 
02:30:53.990 --> 02:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
i think that's how most folks learn yeah
 
02:30:54.000 --> 02:30:55.510 align:start position:0%
i think that's how most folks learn yeah
okay

02:30:55.510 --> 02:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:30:57.270 --> 02:30:57.280 align:start position:0%
representative harrington has one last
 
02:30:59.030 --> 02:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
question really quick you in your
 
02:31:01.670 --> 02:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
handout you said but to date no projects
 
02:31:03.190 --> 02:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of this ad have been
 
02:31:05.030 --> 02:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
completed and i think you stated there
 
02:31:07.670 --> 02:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
was one so one is correct yeah that is
 
02:31:07.680 --> 02:31:08.790 align:start position:0%
was one so one is correct yeah that is
uh

02:31:08.790 --> 02:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:31:10.070 --> 02:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
that was a mistake in the testimony
 
02:31:14.150 --> 02:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:16.790 --> 02:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
see no further questions for mr sam

02:31:25.830 --> 02:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
representative lewis to give us the blue
 
02:31:27.990 --> 02:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
sheet recommendations okay on the blue
 
02:31:30.710 --> 02:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
sheet we have 49 in support zero opposed
 
02:31:33.510 --> 02:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
zero neutral and that's it

i'm getting there
 
04:16:24.070 --> 04:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
i'll get to my notes

04:16:29.030 --> 04:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
thing that
 
04:16:30.389 --> 04:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
motivates this
 
04:16:32.469 --> 04:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
legislation motivated the senate to
 
04:16:34.469 --> 04:16:34.479 align:start position:0%
support this legislation
 
04:16:37.510 --> 04:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh is the fact that you can drive about
 
04:16:39.910 --> 04:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
anywhere in new hampshire and
 
04:16:43.429 --> 04:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
find dead spots
 
04:16:45.750 --> 04:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
where you drop calls
 
04:16:48.630 --> 04:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
cellular service is
 
04:16:48.640 --> 04:16:50.389 align:start position:0%
cellular service is
as

04:16:50.389 --> 04:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:16:53.189 --> 04:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
it may touch many communities in the
 
04:16:55.269 --> 04:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
state but many of those served
 
04:16:55.279 --> 04:16:58.070 align:start position:0%
state but many of those served
communities

04:16:58.070 --> 04:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:00.550 --> 04:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
have spotty service it's inconsistent
 
04:17:00.560 --> 04:17:03.189 align:start position:0%
have spotty service it's inconsistent
and

04:17:03.189 --> 04:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:05.429 --> 04:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
we've been at this for a long time
 
04:17:07.830 --> 04:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
trying to solve this issue
 
04:17:10.149 --> 04:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:17:12.710 --> 04:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
so it this exists in cheshire county
 
04:17:15.269 --> 04:17:15.279 align:start position:0%
this exists in the north country this uh
 
04:17:16.389 --> 04:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
i've got an
 
04:17:19.590 --> 04:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
email yesterday from somebody from beau
 
04:17:19.600 --> 04:17:20.389 align:start position:0%
email yesterday from somebody from beau
uh

04:17:20.389 --> 04:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:17:23.670 --> 04:17:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh indicating that it's in uh there as
 
04:17:23.680 --> 04:17:25.510 align:start position:0%
uh indicating that it's in uh there as
well

04:17:25.510 --> 04:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:17:28.070 --> 04:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
i was driving down to boston one day
 
04:17:29.429 --> 04:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
past derry
 
04:17:29.439 --> 04:17:30.229 align:start position:0%
past derry
and

04:17:30.229 --> 04:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:17:30.239 --> 04:17:32.550 align:start position:0%
and
i

04:17:32.550 --> 04:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:36.389 --> 04:17:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:36.399 --> 04:17:37.510 align:start position:0%
 
that

04:17:37.510 --> 04:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:17:40.950 --> 04:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
i had my my call dropped the as i was
 
04:17:42.950 --> 04:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
driving through dairy
 
04:17:42.960 --> 04:17:43.910 align:start position:0%
driving through dairy
uh

04:17:43.910 --> 04:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:17:43.920 --> 04:17:45.030 align:start position:0%
uh
so

04:17:45.030 --> 04:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:17:47.030 --> 04:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
04:17:48.550 --> 04:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
we have
 
04:17:50.950 --> 04:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
these spots throughout new hampshire uh
 
04:17:52.950 --> 04:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
so we need to address it we need to find
 
04:17:54.790 --> 04:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
some way to do it whether
 
04:17:57.429 --> 04:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
the opportunity comes from federal money
 
04:17:59.910 --> 04:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh or it comes from state uh funds
 
04:18:02.070 --> 04:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
somewhere down the fro the road or it
 
04:18:02.080 --> 04:18:03.030 align:start position:0%
somewhere down the fro the road or it
comes

04:18:03.030 --> 04:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
comes
 
04:18:05.510 --> 04:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
through partnerships that providers and
 
04:18:07.830 --> 04:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
the state can enter into
 
04:18:11.670 --> 04:18:11.680 align:start position:0%
this is an important thing to do so
 
04:18:16.710 --> 04:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:21.110 --> 04:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
requiring an allocation at this time
 
04:18:21.120 --> 04:18:22.630 align:start position:0%
requiring an allocation at this time
but

04:18:22.630 --> 04:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:18:24.469 --> 04:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
it's important to to to make some
 
04:18:27.030 --> 04:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
progress here so
 
04:18:30.790 --> 04:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
that's what 395 attempts to do
 
04:18:33.510 --> 04:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
is provide us with the opportunity to
 
04:18:33.520 --> 04:18:34.389 align:start position:0%
is provide us with the opportunity to
establish

04:18:34.389 --> 04:18:34.399 align:start position:0%
establish
 
04:18:36.630 --> 04:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
a fund
 
04:18:38.790 --> 04:18:38.800 align:start position:0%
this says within the
 
04:18:38.800 --> 04:18:40.630 align:start position:0%
this says within the
broadband

04:18:40.630 --> 04:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
broadband
 
04:18:42.550 --> 04:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
fund which we
 
04:18:45.830 --> 04:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
established through hb2 in this last
 
04:18:45.840 --> 04:18:49.910 align:start position:0%
established through hb2 in this last
biennium

04:18:49.910 --> 04:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:52.710 --> 04:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
there will be an amendment
 
04:18:55.189 --> 04:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
and i hope to work with
 
04:18:57.189 --> 04:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
 
04:19:00.070 --> 04:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
to bring that amendment forward
 
04:19:01.750 --> 04:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
that will define
 
04:19:05.030 --> 04:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
this process more thoroughly
 
04:19:07.349 --> 04:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
and it's been a really good opportunity
 
04:19:10.070 --> 04:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
to work with the providers
 
04:19:12.950 --> 04:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
with the wireless carriers in the state
 
04:19:14.830 --> 04:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
04:19:19.269 --> 04:19:19.279 align:start position:0%
to talk about this uh initiative in more
 
04:19:19.279 --> 04:19:20.550 align:start position:0%
to talk about this uh initiative in more
detail

04:19:20.550 --> 04:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
detail
 
04:19:23.990 --> 04:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
and uh where this is leading is that uh
 
04:19:25.349 --> 04:19:25.359 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
04:19:25.359 --> 04:19:26.630 align:start position:0%
rather than
uh

04:19:26.630 --> 04:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:19:29.670 --> 04:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
establishing multiple purposes or
 
04:19:31.830 --> 04:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
technology developments through the
 
04:19:33.670 --> 04:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
broadband fund
 
04:19:37.910 --> 04:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:41.510 --> 04:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
a wireless services
 
04:19:41.520 --> 04:19:42.830 align:start position:0%
a wireless services
deployment

04:19:42.830 --> 04:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
deployment
 
04:19:45.830 --> 04:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
initiative so that is what the fund
 
04:19:49.670 --> 04:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:53.030 --> 04:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
to dedicate dollars towards a wireless
 
04:19:54.790 --> 04:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
deployment initiative
 
04:19:54.800 --> 04:19:55.990 align:start position:0%
deployment initiative
uh

04:19:55.990 --> 04:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:19:56.000 --> 04:19:57.429 align:start position:0%
uh
the

04:19:57.429 --> 04:19:57.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:20:01.030 --> 04:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh the need for this is is clear uh
 
04:20:03.830 --> 04:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
when i was visiting with
 
04:20:06.389 --> 04:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
uh a town in my district
 
04:20:10.550 --> 04:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh the police chief in that smaller town
 
04:20:13.670 --> 04:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
seventeen hundred people uh
 
04:20:15.750 --> 04:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
indicated that they could receive nine
 
04:20:18.309 --> 04:20:18.319 align:start position:0%
one one calls but when they made the
 
04:20:22.710 --> 04:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
effort to contact the person in distress
 
04:20:25.910 --> 04:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
they were unable to make that call
 
04:20:28.149 --> 04:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
so there are safety reasons we've lived
 
04:20:29.910 --> 04:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
through a pandemic and we know that
 
04:20:31.910 --> 04:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
there are workplace
 
04:20:34.870 --> 04:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
health care and education reasons
 
04:20:37.269 --> 04:20:37.279 align:start position:0%
that we need a more robust wireless
 
04:20:40.950 --> 04:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
technology deployment in the state
 
04:20:40.960 --> 04:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
technology deployment in the state
and

04:20:41.280 --> 04:20:41.290 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:41.290 --> 04:20:43.030 align:start position:0%
and
[Music]

04:20:43.030 --> 04:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:20:45.110 --> 04:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
you know this is an opportunity whether
 
04:20:47.349 --> 04:20:47.359 align:start position:0%
it comes through federal dollars that
 
04:20:49.590 --> 04:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
are available to us or state dollars
 
04:20:51.510 --> 04:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
that are available because
 
04:20:52.710 --> 04:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
the states
 
04:20:57.910 --> 04:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:00.469 --> 04:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
just establishing the fund will give us
 
04:21:02.229 --> 04:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
that mechanism
 
04:21:05.590 --> 04:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh and the vehicle through which this uh
 
04:21:09.510 --> 04:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
a more robust distribution can occur
 
04:21:11.110 --> 04:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
if you're familiar with the broadband
 
04:21:13.429 --> 04:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
fund the business and economic affairs
 
04:21:15.590 --> 04:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
is taking the leadership on this that
 
04:21:19.269 --> 04:21:19.279 align:start position:0%
was what was delegated through hb2
 
04:21:19.279 --> 04:21:20.630 align:start position:0%
was what was delegated through hb2
and

04:21:20.630 --> 04:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:21:24.550 --> 04:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
they are aware of this uh initiative and
 
04:21:26.870 --> 04:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
waiting to see how the legislature deals
 
04:21:27.910 --> 04:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
with it
 
04:21:27.920 --> 04:21:28.710 align:start position:0%
with it
uh

04:21:28.710 --> 04:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:21:30.389 --> 04:21:30.399 align:start position:0%
but i think that
 
04:21:32.790 --> 04:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
the the infrastructure that the state
 
04:21:35.189 --> 04:21:35.199 align:start position:0%
has set up through their broadband fund
 
04:21:37.429 --> 04:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
would also be the infrastructure that
 
04:21:38.550 --> 04:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
could be
 
04:21:40.710 --> 04:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
depended upon to carry out this
 
04:21:42.790 --> 04:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
initiative as well
 
04:21:44.469 --> 04:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
be glad to answer any questions the
 
04:21:44.479 --> 04:21:46.309 align:start position:0%
be glad to answer any questions the
committee

04:21:46.309 --> 04:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:21:48.389 --> 04:21:48.399 align:start position:0%
thank you senator before i take
 
04:21:50.149 --> 04:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
questions from the other members of the
 
04:21:50.159 --> 04:21:52.229 align:start position:0%
questions from the other members of the
committee

04:21:52.229 --> 04:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:21:53.910 --> 04:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
i would like to
 
04:21:55.590 --> 04:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
apologize to the other members of the
 
04:21:57.990 --> 04:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
committee for not having some amendment
 
04:22:00.229 --> 04:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
language to present to them today i
 
04:22:01.910 --> 04:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
thought maybe we would
 
04:22:04.469 --> 04:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't look like
 
04:22:07.110 --> 04:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
the draft was completed in time for us
 
04:22:10.070 --> 04:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
to present it to the committee today
 
04:22:12.870 --> 04:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
i have worked with senator khan and some
 
04:22:14.710 --> 04:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
04:22:18.389 --> 04:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
the industry to develop this draft and i
 
04:22:19.830 --> 04:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
will send it to other members of the
 
04:22:22.550 --> 04:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
committee as soon as it is complete
 
04:22:24.870 --> 04:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
which i expect will be by the end of day
 
04:22:24.880 --> 04:22:26.149 align:start position:0%
which i expect will be by the end of day
today

04:22:26.149 --> 04:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:22:26.159 --> 04:22:27.269 align:start position:0%
today
and

04:22:27.269 --> 04:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:22:29.349 --> 04:22:29.359 align:start position:0%
then we'll be able to inspect it
 
04:22:31.510 --> 04:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
essentially what it does it sets up a
 
04:22:31.520 --> 04:22:32.950 align:start position:0%
essentially what it does it sets up a
wireless

04:22:32.950 --> 04:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
wireless
 
04:22:35.510 --> 04:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
matching grant initiative
 
04:22:37.429 --> 04:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
very similar to one that already exists
 
04:22:40.070 --> 04:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
for broadband which is hardwired this is
 
04:22:41.990 --> 04:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
simply a wireless
 
04:22:43.990 --> 04:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
grant initiative
 
04:22:44.000 --> 04:22:45.590 align:start position:0%
grant initiative
and

04:22:45.590 --> 04:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:22:47.750 --> 04:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
with that i will now
 
04:22:49.670 --> 04:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh encourage members of the committee to
 
04:22:51.750 --> 04:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
ask the senator questions and recognize
 
04:22:54.149 --> 04:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
representative thomas
 
04:22:56.070 --> 04:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh thank you senator
 
04:22:57.990 --> 04:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question that this
 
04:22:59.269 --> 04:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
question might be better directed
 
04:23:01.750 --> 04:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
towards maybe one of the providers but
 
04:23:04.710 --> 04:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
my question just for clarification by
 
04:23:06.710 --> 04:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
setting up this grant fund
 
04:23:08.950 --> 04:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
and since the word granted you a grant
 
04:23:11.429 --> 04:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
to me usually means a one-time payment
 
04:23:14.550 --> 04:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
from from from the government so
 
04:23:16.469 --> 04:23:16.479 align:start position:0%
if we were to set up additional cell
 
04:23:18.710 --> 04:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
service using the grant would it be the
 
04:23:23.030 --> 04:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the providers to
 
04:23:24.950 --> 04:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
hope that the customer base that they
 
04:23:27.189 --> 04:23:27.199 align:start position:0%
get from this will pay for their their
 
04:23:29.349 --> 04:23:29.359 align:start position:0%
expenses from here on in or would they
 
04:23:32.389 --> 04:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
be picking up an area where it might be
 
04:23:33.910 --> 04:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
a losing proposition once the grant
 
04:23:35.510 --> 04:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
money runs out i just don't not quite
 
04:23:37.429 --> 04:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
sure how that works but that's that's
 
04:23:39.269 --> 04:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
the only concern i have on that have the
 
04:23:41.110 --> 04:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
providers come to you to tell them to
 
04:23:43.750 --> 04:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
tell you how how they would work that
 
04:23:46.070 --> 04:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
we have had that conversation uh
 
04:23:47.750 --> 04:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative thomas and
 
04:23:50.389 --> 04:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
it's it's a very good question and i
 
04:23:52.630 --> 04:23:52.640 align:start position:0%
think you should pursue that with the
 
04:23:54.469 --> 04:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
providers my
 
04:23:56.389 --> 04:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
feeling on this is that
 
04:23:56.399 --> 04:23:57.189 align:start position:0%
feeling on this is that
there

04:23:57.189 --> 04:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:23:58.950 --> 04:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
is a mixture
 
04:24:00.480 --> 04:24:00.490 align:start position:0%
of uh where
 
04:24:00.490 --> 04:24:01.750 align:start position:0%
of uh where
[Music]

04:24:01.750 --> 04:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:24:03.990 --> 04:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
there are some areas that are unserved
 
04:24:05.990 --> 04:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
because there is
 
04:24:08.469 --> 04:24:08.479 align:start position:0%
not much revenue to be derived
 
04:24:10.469 --> 04:24:10.479 align:start position:0%
to pay back that investment
 
04:24:13.429 --> 04:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
there are other areas like in dairy uh
 
04:24:16.309 --> 04:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
where if that needs to be deployed in a
 
04:24:18.630 --> 04:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
more robust manner uh
 
04:24:22.070 --> 04:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
the customer base is is uh you know
 
04:24:25.830 --> 04:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
clearly much deeper
 
04:24:25.840 --> 04:24:27.590 align:start position:0%
clearly much deeper
so

04:24:27.590 --> 04:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:24:29.269 --> 04:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
but i think it's envisioned that the
 
04:24:31.189 --> 04:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
grant dollars would provide the
 
04:24:34.309 --> 04:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
infrastructure investment
 
04:24:36.469 --> 04:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:24:38.550 --> 04:24:38.560 align:start position:0%
representative harrington has a question
 
04:24:39.750 --> 04:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you mr chairman i thank you
 
04:24:42.309 --> 04:24:42.319 align:start position:0%
for taking my question senator um
 
04:24:43.990 --> 04:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
actually a couple
 
04:24:45.910 --> 04:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
it says in uh line three here a
 
04:24:48.469 --> 04:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
municipality is located in an area that
 
04:24:50.710 --> 04:24:50.720 align:start position:0%
is determined to lack adequate cell
 
04:24:52.389 --> 04:24:52.399 align:start position:0%
phone service
 
04:24:54.229 --> 04:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
so is i correct in assuming that if you
 
04:24:56.870 --> 04:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
have a municipality and any portion of
 
04:24:58.950 --> 04:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
that is lacking cell phone service that
 
04:25:01.110 --> 04:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
the municipality would be eligible for
 
04:25:08.149 --> 04:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:08.159 --> 04:25:09.429 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:25:09.429 --> 04:25:09.439 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:25:11.590 --> 04:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's the way that
 
04:25:12.950 --> 04:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:25:15.349 --> 04:25:15.359 align:start position:0%
in the amendment that you're going to
 
04:25:15.359 --> 04:25:16.389 align:start position:0%
in the amendment that you're going to
see

04:25:16.389 --> 04:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
see
 
04:25:19.990 --> 04:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
it's both for unserved areas and areas
 
04:25:22.229 --> 04:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
that have inconsistent service
 
04:25:24.229 --> 04:25:24.239 align:start position:0%
if you
 
04:25:26.469 --> 04:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
think about i mean
 
04:25:29.110 --> 04:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
one of the towns i represent
 
04:25:32.070 --> 04:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
it would be nelson new hampshire
 
04:25:35.189 --> 04:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
nelson has you can get cell service in
 
04:25:38.070 --> 04:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
some spots of nelson in about two-thirds
 
04:25:39.990 --> 04:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
of nelson you can't get cell phone
 
04:25:41.189 --> 04:25:41.199 align:start position:0%
service so
 
04:25:42.710 --> 04:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
04:25:47.590 --> 04:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
the it it it needs to uh recognize both
 
04:25:50.790 --> 04:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
unserved and areas that are served
 
04:25:50.800 --> 04:25:52.550 align:start position:0%
unserved and areas that are served
inconsistently

04:25:52.550 --> 04:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
inconsistently
 
04:25:55.189 --> 04:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
okay follow up mr chairman follow up
 
04:25:56.550 --> 04:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
yeah well that's what i'm trying to get
 
04:25:57.910 --> 04:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
straight because let's just say for
 
04:25:59.990 --> 04:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
example i'm the town i live in is
 
04:26:01.990 --> 04:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
traffic we have the same situation some
 
04:26:03.590 --> 04:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
areas get very good coverage some have
 
04:26:06.309 --> 04:26:06.319 align:start position:0%
zero coverage so if i can go to a
 
04:26:08.309 --> 04:26:08.319 align:start position:0%
whatever town and wander around with a
 
04:26:10.710 --> 04:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
cell phone and find some one location
 
04:26:12.630 --> 04:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
that doesn't get service does that mean
 
04:26:14.229 --> 04:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
that the whole town is now eligible for
 
04:26:16.149 --> 04:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
the grant money
 
04:26:19.189 --> 04:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
but what's the criteria for doing that
 
04:26:23.189 --> 04:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
simply a single location only or
 
04:26:26.070 --> 04:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
it's envisioned and and again that
 
04:26:28.070 --> 04:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
the providers i think understand their
 
04:26:31.189 --> 04:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
technology best uh you know you put up a
 
04:26:33.830 --> 04:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
tower you put up some type of wireless
 
04:26:37.269 --> 04:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
uh receiver it's not quite it likely
 
04:26:39.830 --> 04:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
will have overlapping uh
 
04:26:41.670 --> 04:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
with with something that
 
04:26:46.870 --> 04:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:50.630 --> 04:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
yeah i recognize the issue that you're
 
04:26:50.640 --> 04:26:54.149 align:start position:0%
yeah i recognize the issue that you're
stating

04:26:54.149 --> 04:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:54.159 --> 04:26:55.510 align:start position:0%
 
the

04:26:55.510 --> 04:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:26:57.510 --> 04:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of this needs to get sorted out
 
04:26:58.950 --> 04:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
through the
 
04:27:02.070 --> 04:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
uh or the rule making process
 
04:27:02.080 --> 04:27:03.030 align:start position:0%
uh or the rule making process
and

04:27:03.030 --> 04:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:27:05.349 --> 04:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
in the rulemaking process the bea will
 
04:27:07.189 --> 04:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
need to identify what will be the
 
04:27:09.429 --> 04:27:09.439 align:start position:0%
criteria for reward
 
04:27:11.510 --> 04:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
so i think the
 
04:27:13.990 --> 04:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
part of the that criteria would be the
 
04:27:15.910 --> 04:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
extent to which it's providing service
 
04:27:19.269 --> 04:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
to areas that are currently not served
 
04:27:23.670 --> 04:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:26.870 --> 04:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
further questions for senator khan
 
04:27:33.030 --> 04:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:34.710 --> 04:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
senator khan thank you for taking my
 
04:27:38.710 --> 04:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:40.870 --> 04:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
is not all shot
 
04:27:43.269 --> 04:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
i seem to remember that we
 
04:27:45.590 --> 04:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
provided legislation whereby
 
04:27:45.600 --> 04:27:47.750 align:start position:0%
provided legislation whereby
municipalities

04:27:47.750 --> 04:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
04:27:47.760 --> 04:27:48.870 align:start position:0%
municipalities
could

04:27:48.870 --> 04:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
could
 
04:27:48.880 --> 04:27:50.309 align:start position:0%
could
bond

04:27:50.309 --> 04:27:50.319 align:start position:0%
bond
 
04:27:52.630 --> 04:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
for broadband
 
04:27:52.640 --> 04:27:53.429 align:start position:0%
for broadband
uh

04:27:53.429 --> 04:27:53.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:27:54.710 --> 04:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
04:27:57.269 --> 04:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
and that one of the problems was that
 
04:27:58.950 --> 04:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
there were the money it was just much
 
04:28:00.469 --> 04:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
too expensive
 
04:28:03.349 --> 04:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
and not enough customers to do the
 
04:28:05.349 --> 04:28:05.359 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for the companies to make
 
04:28:07.189 --> 04:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
it worth their while
 
04:28:08.950 --> 04:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
so this grant
 
04:28:11.590 --> 04:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
please if i'm understanding it right
 
04:28:15.349 --> 04:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
would pay for that infrastructure
 
04:28:17.269 --> 04:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
what then
 
04:28:19.670 --> 04:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
who would own that infrastructure who
 
04:28:22.149 --> 04:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
would be responsible for maintenance of
 
04:28:24.309 --> 04:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
that infrastructure
 
04:28:27.110 --> 04:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
and would the town or the
 
04:28:28.630 --> 04:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
municipality or a group of
 
04:28:30.950 --> 04:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities who get together
 
04:28:32.790 --> 04:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
04:28:35.349 --> 04:28:35.359 align:start position:0%
control the rates on that particular
 
04:28:35.359 --> 04:28:37.349 align:start position:0%
control the rates on that particular
line

04:28:37.349 --> 04:28:37.359 align:start position:0%
line
 
04:28:40.149 --> 04:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um
 
04:28:40.159 --> 04:28:41.750 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um
the

04:28:41.750 --> 04:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:28:43.110 --> 04:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
it's because this is an important
 
04:28:45.590 --> 04:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
clarification i think um
 
04:28:45.600 --> 04:28:47.269 align:start position:0%
clarification i think um
the

04:28:47.269 --> 04:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:28:49.910 --> 04:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
ownership would be with the providers
 
04:28:51.189 --> 04:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
the maintenance would be with the
 
04:28:51.199 --> 04:28:52.870 align:start position:0%
the maintenance would be with the
providers

04:28:52.870 --> 04:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
providers
 
04:28:54.389 --> 04:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
i think this operates a little bit
 
04:28:56.950 --> 04:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
differently because this service is not
 
04:28:59.910 --> 04:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
to a point of delivery
 
04:29:02.630 --> 04:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
a wired service you know is going to a
 
04:29:02.640 --> 04:29:03.670 align:start position:0%
a wired service you know is going to a
point

04:29:03.670 --> 04:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
point
 
04:29:05.349 --> 04:29:05.359 align:start position:0%
to be served
 
04:29:07.990 --> 04:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
to that residence to that business
 
04:29:09.189 --> 04:29:09.199 align:start position:0%
it is
 
04:29:10.630 --> 04:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
to the door
 
04:29:13.269 --> 04:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:16.950 --> 04:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
a central hub right
 
04:29:20.389 --> 04:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
the so the town it makes sense for a
 
04:29:23.670 --> 04:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
town to be participating in that
 
04:29:25.590 --> 04:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
and and actually
 
04:29:28.389 --> 04:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing my my neighbor from
 
04:29:30.469 --> 04:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
marlborough representative partial
 
04:29:34.149 --> 04:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
and and uh his town has recently uh
 
04:29:35.750 --> 04:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
elected to bond
 
04:29:37.510 --> 04:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh and that's a small
 
04:29:39.189 --> 04:29:39.199 align:start position:0%
community uh
 
04:29:39.199 --> 04:29:39.910 align:start position:0%
community uh
so

04:29:39.910 --> 04:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:29:42.149 --> 04:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
we we've had good success with that
 
04:29:45.189 --> 04:29:45.199 align:start position:0%
broadband fund because it is wired to a
 
04:29:47.750 --> 04:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
user and you
 
04:29:50.630 --> 04:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
i think the companies have figured out a
 
04:29:53.510 --> 04:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
long-term return on that investment
 
04:29:55.830 --> 04:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
this is different
 
04:29:57.670 --> 04:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
because it's not bounded by town
 
04:29:57.680 --> 04:29:59.510 align:start position:0%
because it's not bounded by town
territories

04:29:59.510 --> 04:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
territories
 
04:30:02.149 --> 04:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
and it's not wired directly to a
 
04:30:05.429 --> 04:30:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:08.229 --> 04:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
and and so it's likely to be providers
 
04:30:10.710 --> 04:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
that are seeking these grants and the
 
04:30:12.550 --> 04:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
town's control will be through the
 
04:30:16.309 --> 04:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:18.710 --> 04:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
any kind of tower any kind of
 
04:30:20.790 --> 04:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
structure that needs to be
 
04:30:20.800 --> 04:30:22.149 align:start position:0%
structure that needs to be
deployed

04:30:22.149 --> 04:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
deployed
 
04:30:26.309 --> 04:30:26.319 align:start position:0%
as part of expanding the service area
 
04:30:28.790 --> 04:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
is is going to be controlled by a town
 
04:30:31.429 --> 04:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
and the town's participation in this is
 
04:30:32.950 --> 04:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
going to be through its permitting
 
04:30:32.960 --> 04:30:34.309 align:start position:0%
going to be through its permitting
process

04:30:34.309 --> 04:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:30:34.319 --> 04:30:36.469 align:start position:0%
process
follow-up

04:30:36.469 --> 04:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:30:36.479 --> 04:30:37.349 align:start position:0%
follow-up
peace

04:30:37.349 --> 04:30:37.359 align:start position:0%
peace
 
04:30:37.359 --> 04:30:38.389 align:start position:0%
peace
i

04:30:38.389 --> 04:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:30:40.229 --> 04:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
i just want to try to get my head around
 
04:30:43.990 --> 04:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
this i have a t
 
04:30:45.269 --> 04:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
and one of the
 
04:30:46.870 --> 04:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
cheapest plants
 
04:30:50.550 --> 04:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:53.189 --> 04:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
that is a wireless service
 
04:30:55.189 --> 04:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
but it is directed
 
04:30:56.950 --> 04:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
at me
 
04:30:59.429 --> 04:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
and i pick up my own
 
04:31:02.149 --> 04:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
bill i pay my own bill for that
 
04:31:02.159 --> 04:31:03.510 align:start position:0%
bill i pay my own bill for that
so

04:31:03.510 --> 04:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:31:05.910 --> 04:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
that indeed is
 
04:31:08.790 --> 04:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
directed at a customer is it not is this
 
04:31:11.510 --> 04:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
are we talking about the same thing
 
04:31:11.520 --> 04:31:12.870 align:start position:0%
are we talking about the same thing
so

04:31:12.870 --> 04:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:31:15.189 --> 04:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
that service would have to be directed
 
04:31:17.590 --> 04:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
toward a customer am i correct
 
04:31:19.670 --> 04:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
the customer would have to elect
 
04:31:21.830 --> 04:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
to take that service and then be billed
 
04:31:22.790 --> 04:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
and pay
 
04:31:24.710 --> 04:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
for whatever
 
04:31:26.550 --> 04:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
capacity or whatever they want on that
 
04:31:29.110 --> 04:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
service is that correct yes thank you
 
04:31:32.309 --> 04:31:32.319 align:start position:0%
yes and and hopefully in the amendment
 
04:31:35.590 --> 04:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
that you see it'll
 
04:31:37.910 --> 04:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
begin to indicate what some of the award
 
04:31:40.149 --> 04:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
criteria need to be
 
04:31:42.790 --> 04:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
in the rule making process
 
04:31:44.870 --> 04:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
so that
 
04:31:46.550 --> 04:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
the extent to which
 
04:31:49.110 --> 04:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
a state grant is covering
 
04:31:51.030 --> 04:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
the costs and the extent to which a
 
04:31:57.429 --> 04:31:57.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:59.750 --> 04:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
so to give you a sense of
 
04:32:02.550 --> 04:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
what the amendment will say it says that
 
04:32:04.469 --> 04:32:04.479 align:start position:0%
there is hereby established within the
 
04:32:06.149 --> 04:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
department of business and economic
 
04:32:09.429 --> 04:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
affairs a wireless grant initiative
 
04:32:11.750 --> 04:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
the purpose of which shall be to provide
 
04:32:14.790 --> 04:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
grants to wireless providers in order to
 
04:32:17.510 --> 04:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
improve wireless connectivity within
 
04:32:20.710 --> 04:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
communities and across the state
 
04:32:20.720 --> 04:32:21.750 align:start position:0%
communities and across the state
and

04:32:21.750 --> 04:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:32:24.149 --> 04:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
it says that eligible projects shall
 
04:32:26.469 --> 04:32:26.479 align:start position:0%
include provide shall provide wireless
 
04:32:29.670 --> 04:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
infrastructure in areas that lack
 
04:32:31.830 --> 04:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
mobile wireless coverage
 
04:32:34.149 --> 04:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
an eligible project you'll be evaluated
 
04:32:37.269 --> 04:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
as part of a competitive prod process
 
04:32:39.189 --> 04:32:39.199 align:start position:0%
selected projects shall meet the needs
 
04:32:41.510 --> 04:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
of consumers with the lowest possible
 
04:32:43.349 --> 04:32:43.359 align:start position:0%
cost and the highest possible
 
04:32:43.359 --> 04:32:45.910 align:start position:0%
cost and the highest possible
functionality

04:32:45.910 --> 04:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
functionality
 
04:32:47.990 --> 04:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
that gives you a flavor of what the
 
04:32:49.910 --> 04:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
amended language will
 
04:32:52.469 --> 04:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
will say it's much more specific
 
04:32:54.870 --> 04:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
than the bill we're reading
 
04:32:57.030 --> 04:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
here this afternoon
 
04:32:59.510 --> 04:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative lewicki has a question uh
 
04:33:01.429 --> 04:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
04:33:01.439 --> 04:33:02.790 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
um

04:33:02.790 --> 04:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:04.629 --> 04:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
you mentioned dropped calls
 
04:33:04.639 --> 04:33:05.590 align:start position:0%
you mentioned dropped calls
this

04:33:05.590 --> 04:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:33:07.109 --> 04:33:07.119 align:start position:0%
my impression is that people aren't
 
04:33:08.709 --> 04:33:08.719 align:start position:0%
supposed to be on their cell phones
 
04:33:11.510 --> 04:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
while they're driving and
 
04:33:12.949 --> 04:33:12.959 align:start position:0%
that's at least what the sign i saw when
 
04:33:14.709 --> 04:33:14.719 align:start position:0%
i got on the state highway said so would
 
04:33:17.510 --> 04:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
this not encourage people in areas where
 
04:33:19.670 --> 04:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
rural to actually be doing more of what
 
04:33:25.029 --> 04:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:25.039 --> 04:33:25.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:33:25.910 --> 04:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:27.670 --> 04:33:27.680 align:start position:0%
you know it it it says you're not
 
04:33:30.869 --> 04:33:30.879 align:start position:0%
supposed to be handling your cell phone
 
04:33:30.879 --> 04:33:31.670 align:start position:0%
supposed to be handling your cell phone
and

04:33:31.670 --> 04:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:33:34.230 --> 04:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
i just as somebody who
 
04:33:36.789 --> 04:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
uses hand-free devices
 
04:33:36.799 --> 04:33:38.310 align:start position:0%
uses hand-free devices
in

04:33:38.310 --> 04:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:33:39.990 --> 04:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
my vehicle i
 
04:33:42.150 --> 04:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
cover a lot of miles coming to and from
 
04:33:42.160 --> 04:33:43.830 align:start position:0%
cover a lot of miles coming to and from
concord

04:33:43.830 --> 04:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
concord
 
04:33:46.390 --> 04:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:48.310 --> 04:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
it it uh
 
04:33:51.510 --> 04:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's pretty difficult for me to complete
 
04:33:53.029 --> 04:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
a phone call
 
04:33:53.039 --> 04:33:55.349 align:start position:0%
a phone call
uh

04:33:55.349 --> 04:33:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:55.359 --> 04:33:56.230 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:33:56.230 --> 04:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:33:59.189 --> 04:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
you know it's totally hands-free i can
 
04:34:01.189 --> 04:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
i can say i'd like to
 
04:34:03.670 --> 04:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
contact representative lewicki
 
04:34:03.680 --> 04:34:04.869 align:start position:0%
contact representative lewicki
uh

04:34:04.869 --> 04:34:04.879 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:34:08.070 --> 04:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
no i don't have your phone number
 
04:34:10.150 --> 04:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
but you understand
 
04:34:12.470 --> 04:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you senator i my phone is in
 
04:34:13.990 --> 04:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
the car and if it rings when i'm in the
 
04:34:16.949 --> 04:34:16.959 align:start position:0%
car i don't answer it
 
04:34:19.029 --> 04:34:19.039 align:start position:0%
rep representative mcgee has recognized
 
04:34:21.109 --> 04:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
request thank you mr chairman and thank
 
04:34:23.269 --> 04:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
you senator khan for taking my question
 
04:34:26.551 --> 04:34:26.561 align:start position:0%
um we had a bill earlier this session on
 
04:34:29.349 --> 04:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
relieving the telecom carriers of last
 
04:34:31.349 --> 04:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
resort in certain areas and part of the
 
04:34:35.029 --> 04:34:35.039 align:start position:0%
testimony that we had was that cell
 
04:34:37.670 --> 04:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
cell receptivity was pretty much
 
04:34:39.670 --> 04:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
ubiquitous now so that people had
 
04:34:41.349 --> 04:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
coverage all over new hampshire and
 
04:34:43.910 --> 04:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
you're testifying here today that that's
 
04:34:45.830 --> 04:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
still not quite the case so it sounds to
 
04:34:47.670 --> 04:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
me like it's a it's a good bill and it's
 
04:34:49.990 --> 04:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
a good idea to do um
 
04:34:52.470 --> 04:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
so the question would be is is the
 
04:34:55.429 --> 04:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
intent then to ensure
 
04:34:57.590 --> 04:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
that there is sufficient funding to try
 
04:34:58.789 --> 04:34:58.799 align:start position:0%
and fill
 
04:35:01.269 --> 04:35:01.279 align:start position:0%
those gaps that still exist for people
 
04:35:03.429 --> 04:35:03.439 align:start position:0%
to have basically universal service in
 
04:35:04.551 --> 04:35:04.561 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:35:04.561 --> 04:35:05.590 align:start position:0%
the state
yes

04:35:05.590 --> 04:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:35:07.109 --> 04:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
yes it is
 
04:35:07.119 --> 04:35:08.390 align:start position:0%
yes it is
that

04:35:08.390 --> 04:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:35:10.150 --> 04:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
you know we're going to achieve that
 
04:35:12.470 --> 04:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
someday through broadband
 
04:35:15.670 --> 04:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh but it doesn't deal with the mobile
 
04:35:18.390 --> 04:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
device and while some people might use
 
04:35:20.310 --> 04:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
it from a car other people are going to
 
04:35:22.709 --> 04:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
use it from their workplace and we know
 
04:35:22.719 --> 04:35:23.670 align:start position:0%
use it from their workplace and we know
through

04:35:23.670 --> 04:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:35:25.510 --> 04:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
i chair the telehealth services
 
04:35:27.189 --> 04:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
commission of the state
 
04:35:29.269 --> 04:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh we know that that
 
04:35:30.629 --> 04:35:30.639 align:start position:0%
so many
 
04:35:30.639 --> 04:35:32.150 align:start position:0%
so many
uh

04:35:32.150 --> 04:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:35:34.830 --> 04:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
what has helped the behavioral
 
04:35:38.470 --> 04:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:41.590 --> 04:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
mental health services in the state
 
04:35:44.789 --> 04:35:44.799 align:start position:0%
is the ability for people to make their
 
04:35:47.910 --> 04:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
appointments not leave the workplace
 
04:35:47.920 --> 04:35:49.269 align:start position:0%
appointments not leave the workplace
uh

04:35:49.269 --> 04:35:49.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:35:52.949 --> 04:35:52.959 align:start position:0%
and and not have to travel uh and
 
04:35:55.189 --> 04:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
wireless connectivity is essential for
 
04:35:55.199 --> 04:35:56.070 align:start position:0%
wireless connectivity is essential for
that

04:35:56.070 --> 04:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:35:59.349 --> 04:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh it's the same way with with students
 
04:36:01.269 --> 04:36:01.279 align:start position:0%
uh trying to
 
04:36:04.709 --> 04:36:04.719 align:start position:0%
access from any place after school
 
04:36:07.429 --> 04:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
program uh and be able to access their
 
04:36:07.439 --> 04:36:08.629 align:start position:0%
program uh and be able to access their
assignments

04:36:08.629 --> 04:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
assignments
 
04:36:08.639 --> 04:36:10.230 align:start position:0%
assignments
um

04:36:10.230 --> 04:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:13.750 --> 04:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:15.269 --> 04:36:15.279 align:start position:0%
uh yeah
 
04:36:16.310 --> 04:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
that this
 
04:36:18.789 --> 04:36:18.799 align:start position:0%
this need for universal coverage that
 
04:36:20.869 --> 04:36:20.879 align:start position:0%
you've referenced
 
04:36:23.269 --> 04:36:23.279 align:start position:0%
is going to be met not just by
 
04:36:25.910 --> 04:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
land-based connectivity
 
04:36:27.990 --> 04:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh wire to wire
 
04:36:30.629 --> 04:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
service but through wireless services as
 
04:36:30.639 --> 04:36:31.429 align:start position:0%
service but through wireless services as
well

04:36:31.429 --> 04:36:31.439 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:36:34.629 --> 04:36:34.639 align:start position:0%
and i would just follow follow up
 
04:36:36.390 --> 04:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
my understanding is for a lot of people
 
04:36:38.390 --> 04:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
not of my generation
 
04:36:40.230 --> 04:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
um is that they don't have landlines
 
04:36:41.830 --> 04:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
right they only have the cell which is
 
04:36:44.629 --> 04:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
another reason why that ubiquity is is
 
04:36:45.590 --> 04:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
04:36:47.910 --> 04:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
more necessary for competition in terms
 
04:36:49.349 --> 04:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
of the state's
 
04:36:51.830 --> 04:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
even business basis because a lot of
 
04:36:53.830 --> 04:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
people are not reachable by a landline
 
04:36:55.510 --> 04:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
anymore and they're not connecting their
 
04:36:57.590 --> 04:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
homes in that way unless it's for their
 
04:36:57.600 --> 04:36:58.869 align:start position:0%
homes in that way unless it's for their
computers

04:36:58.869 --> 04:36:58.879 align:start position:0%
computers
 
04:37:00.470 --> 04:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:37:02.390 --> 04:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
it would seem like this
 
04:37:05.750 --> 04:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
the platform of the cell or the cellular
 
04:37:08.390 --> 04:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
receptivity it needs to be addressed
 
04:37:10.709 --> 04:37:10.719 align:start position:0%
maybe even more urgent urgently because
 
04:37:12.390 --> 04:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
of the way people use the technology
 
04:37:15.590 --> 04:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
today i think i think your perceptions
 
04:37:17.910 --> 04:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
right on uh
 
04:37:19.109 --> 04:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
if you
 
04:37:22.470 --> 04:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
i know a realtor has
 
04:37:23.910 --> 04:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
taken me aside
 
04:37:24.949 --> 04:37:24.959 align:start position:0%
and said
 
04:37:27.189 --> 04:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
i lost a customer this weekend because
 
04:37:28.949 --> 04:37:28.959 align:start position:0%
they pulled out their cell phone and
 
04:37:31.189 --> 04:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
tried to make a call and couldn't from
 
04:37:32.949 --> 04:37:32.959 align:start position:0%
this location so
 
04:37:32.959 --> 04:37:34.869 align:start position:0%
this location so
yeah

04:37:34.869 --> 04:37:34.879 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:37:36.470 --> 04:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
that ubiquitous
 
04:37:39.029 --> 04:37:39.039 align:start position:0%
uh that sense of that that people come
 
04:37:41.429 --> 04:37:41.439 align:start position:0%
to new hampshire and expect
 
04:37:42.949 --> 04:37:42.959 align:start position:0%
and and and
 
04:37:46.150 --> 04:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh we we are losing people because
 
04:37:50.629 --> 04:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:50.639 --> 04:37:52.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:37:52.070 --> 04:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:37:54.551 --> 04:37:54.561 align:start position:0%
senator kahn i have a question for you
 
04:37:56.949 --> 04:37:56.959 align:start position:0%
it's been reported that new hampshire
 
04:37:58.789 --> 04:37:58.799 align:start position:0%
will receive something
 
04:38:02.230 --> 04:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
in the neighborhood of 150 122 or 150
 
04:38:05.429 --> 04:38:05.439 align:start position:0%
million dollars in federal funds
 
04:38:08.830 --> 04:38:08.840 align:start position:0%
to expand broadband
 
04:38:11.670 --> 04:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
infrastructure if this wireless
 
04:38:11.680 --> 04:38:13.029 align:start position:0%
infrastructure if this wireless
initiative

04:38:13.029 --> 04:38:13.039 align:start position:0%
initiative
 
04:38:13.039 --> 04:38:14.230 align:start position:0%
initiative
grant

04:38:14.230 --> 04:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
grant
 
04:38:16.709 --> 04:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
fund is established
 
04:38:19.510 --> 04:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
could it apply for grants
 
04:38:21.590 --> 04:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
some of those federal grants
 
04:38:23.670 --> 04:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
or some of that federal grant money
 
04:38:26.070 --> 04:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
could it be used for this
 
04:38:26.080 --> 04:38:29.429 align:start position:0%
could it be used for this
initiative

04:38:29.429 --> 04:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:29.439 --> 04:38:30.869 align:start position:0%
 
i

04:38:30.869 --> 04:38:30.879 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:38:32.470 --> 04:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
04:38:32.480 --> 04:38:34.709 align:start position:0%
don't know
um

04:38:34.709 --> 04:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:36.551 --> 04:38:36.561 align:start position:0%
that clearly is
 
04:38:38.949 --> 04:38:38.959 align:start position:0%
uh would be
 
04:38:40.789 --> 04:38:40.799 align:start position:0%
an important
 
04:38:43.830 --> 04:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
bit of information to to be certain of
 
04:38:46.230 --> 04:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
and and maybe providers can can answer
 
04:38:49.349 --> 04:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
that more thoroughly
 
04:38:52.470 --> 04:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
it requires a certain performance
 
04:38:55.429 --> 04:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
level and meaning bandwidth
 
04:38:57.510 --> 04:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know that wireless
 
04:38:59.590 --> 04:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
services can meet all of those
 
04:38:59.600 --> 04:39:01.349 align:start position:0%
services can meet all of those
requirements

04:39:01.349 --> 04:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
04:39:03.510 --> 04:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
but those rules are in the process of
 
04:39:06.470 --> 04:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
being written and aren't available right
 
04:39:10.390 --> 04:39:10.400 align:start position:0%
now to answer definitively your question
 
04:39:13.750 --> 04:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative partial
 
04:39:17.670 --> 04:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and uh good afternoon uh
 
04:39:17.680 --> 04:39:19.510 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and uh good afternoon uh
um

04:39:19.510 --> 04:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:19.520 --> 04:39:21.029 align:start position:0%
um
my

04:39:21.029 --> 04:39:21.039 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:39:21.039 --> 04:39:22.390 align:start position:0%
my
concern

04:39:22.390 --> 04:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
concern
 
04:39:24.390 --> 04:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
i guess you'd say is that hearing the
 
04:39:26.869 --> 04:39:26.879 align:start position:0%
discussion about um
 
04:39:26.879 --> 04:39:27.670 align:start position:0%
discussion about um
how

04:39:27.670 --> 04:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
how
 
04:39:29.670 --> 04:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
young people tend to use broadband
 
04:39:32.070 --> 04:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
services uh
 
04:39:33.670 --> 04:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
wireless services which tend to be
 
04:39:35.029 --> 04:39:35.039 align:start position:0%
broadband they tend to be watching their
 
04:39:36.470 --> 04:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
movies and they tend to be doing a lot
 
04:39:39.030 --> 04:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
of things that require a lot of
 
04:39:39.040 --> 04:39:39.830 align:start position:0%
of things that require a lot of
and

04:39:39.830 --> 04:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:39:41.510 --> 04:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
then with broadband money coming into
 
04:39:43.350 --> 04:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:39:45.430 --> 04:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
i see the real concern personally is
 
04:39:48.708 --> 04:39:48.718 align:start position:0%
that we need to be able to ensure 9-1-1
 
04:39:50.788 --> 04:39:50.798 align:start position:0%
coverage throughout the state
 
04:39:53.110 --> 04:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
um and i'm not married to that being a
 
04:39:56.550 --> 04:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
5g servicer or what they sometimes call
 
04:39:58.948 --> 04:39:58.958 align:start position:0%
a wireless broadband service
 
04:40:01.590 --> 04:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
i'm my big concern is making sure that
 
04:40:03.430 --> 04:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
no matter where you are in the state you
 
04:40:06.150 --> 04:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
can access emergency services
 
04:40:06.160 --> 04:40:07.350 align:start position:0%
can access emergency services
um

04:40:07.350 --> 04:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:08.948 --> 04:40:08.958 align:start position:0%
is there any type of guarantee that
 
04:40:10.788 --> 04:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
you're aware of that would put this as a
 
04:40:16.150 --> 04:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:16.160 --> 04:40:17.670 align:start position:0%
 
i

04:40:17.670 --> 04:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:40:20.070 --> 04:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
again i think the rules will need to
 
04:40:20.080 --> 04:40:21.590 align:start position:0%
again i think the rules will need to
define

04:40:21.590 --> 04:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
define
 
04:40:21.600 --> 04:40:22.788 align:start position:0%
define
uh

04:40:22.788 --> 04:40:22.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:40:25.350 --> 04:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
the priority of service
 
04:40:25.360 --> 04:40:26.470 align:start position:0%
the priority of service
um

04:40:26.470 --> 04:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:27.590 --> 04:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
04:40:29.430 --> 04:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh firstnet
 
04:40:32.470 --> 04:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
t wireless is in the room
 
04:40:35.830 --> 04:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
and you might want to ask uh
 
04:40:37.750 --> 04:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
more specifically that question i will
 
04:40:40.550 --> 04:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
do then thank you so much
 
04:40:42.948 --> 04:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
representative mirner has a question
 
04:40:45.270 --> 04:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
yes just to follow up on um
 
04:40:47.670 --> 04:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
what the chairman suppose said um i'm in
 
04:40:49.830 --> 04:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
coast county and they applied for a
 
04:40:51.750 --> 04:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
study we gave them some study money for
 
04:40:54.708 --> 04:40:54.718 align:start position:0%
the funds to you can't hardwire koaz
 
04:40:56.390 --> 04:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
county it's huge it's top third of the
 
04:40:58.310 --> 04:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
state and putting these towers up with
 
04:41:00.470 --> 04:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
the 5g that we're talking about
 
04:41:02.628 --> 04:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
the solution so i'm hoping that
 
04:41:04.868 --> 04:41:04.878 align:start position:0%
this 140 million dollars that chairman's
 
04:41:07.030 --> 04:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
talking about is available to these real
 
04:41:09.270 --> 04:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
rural areas because i could never see it
 
04:41:10.708 --> 04:41:10.718 align:start position:0%
being wired up there
 
04:41:12.230 --> 04:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
i don't even think 140 million would
 
04:41:14.788 --> 04:41:14.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:17.590 --> 04:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
so i hope that gets included in the
 
04:41:20.150 --> 04:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
in that when that money comes forth yes
 
04:41:23.830 --> 04:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
i think the balance between unserved and
 
04:41:26.150 --> 04:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
inconsistently served is going to be one
 
04:41:28.070 --> 04:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
of those tension points
 
04:41:29.430 --> 04:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
that's going to need to be worked out
 
04:41:31.750 --> 04:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
through that rfp right and and the the
 
04:41:32.868 --> 04:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
value of
 
04:41:34.230 --> 04:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
how do you value
 
04:41:37.990 --> 04:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh different proposals thank you senator
 
04:41:41.430 --> 04:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
representative pimentel has a question
 
04:41:43.510 --> 04:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
04:41:46.150 --> 04:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
senator khan i
 
04:41:49.990 --> 04:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
my concern is basically
 
04:41:51.910 --> 04:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
i guess it gets down to the rule making
 
04:41:53.830 --> 04:41:53.840 align:start position:0%
and who's going to make them
 
04:41:56.708 --> 04:41:56.718 align:start position:0%
two towns where you brought up
 
04:41:57.910 --> 04:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
derry and
 
04:41:57.920 --> 04:41:59.270 align:start position:0%
derry and
nelson

04:41:59.270 --> 04:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
nelson
 
04:42:02.470 --> 04:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
in derry you've got a fairly large
 
04:42:02.480 --> 04:42:04.070 align:start position:0%
in derry you've got a fairly large
population

04:42:04.070 --> 04:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
population
 
04:42:05.190 --> 04:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
and more
 
04:42:07.750 --> 04:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
towers could be added there
 
04:42:11.030 --> 04:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
and be profitable
 
04:42:11.040 --> 04:42:12.310 align:start position:0%
and be profitable
without

04:42:12.310 --> 04:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
without
 
04:42:13.590 --> 04:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
grant money
 
04:42:16.390 --> 04:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
whereas in nelson
 
04:42:16.400 --> 04:42:17.350 align:start position:0%
whereas in nelson
there's

04:42:17.350 --> 04:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
there's
 
04:42:19.830 --> 04:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
a place that would definitely need grant
 
04:42:19.840 --> 04:42:20.948 align:start position:0%
a place that would definitely need grant
money

04:42:20.948 --> 04:42:20.958 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:42:22.628 --> 04:42:22.638 align:start position:0%
to make it work
 
04:42:22.638 --> 04:42:23.510 align:start position:0%
to make it work
um

04:42:23.510 --> 04:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:26.550 --> 04:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
so how do you separate to keep
 
04:42:26.560 --> 04:42:27.510 align:start position:0%
so how do you separate to keep
the

04:42:27.510 --> 04:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:42:29.910 --> 04:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
these easy projects that are going to be
 
04:42:34.390 --> 04:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
profitable anyway from taking the money
 
04:42:39.110 --> 04:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:40.948 --> 04:42:40.958 align:start position:0%
i i think you're
 
04:42:40.958 --> 04:42:41.990 align:start position:0%
i i think you're
you're

04:42:41.990 --> 04:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
you're
 
04:42:44.708 --> 04:42:44.718 align:start position:0%
zeroing in on on an issue that
 
04:42:44.718 --> 04:42:45.910 align:start position:0%
zeroing in on on an issue that
uh

04:42:45.910 --> 04:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:42:47.990 --> 04:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
you know we we ought to
 
04:42:49.830 --> 04:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't stand in the way of what
 
04:42:52.070 --> 04:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
this initiative is trying to do
 
04:42:55.270 --> 04:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
but it does need to be a part of the
 
04:42:55.280 --> 04:42:58.230 align:start position:0%
but it does need to be a part of the
prioritization

04:42:58.230 --> 04:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
prioritization
 
04:43:01.590 --> 04:43:01.600 align:start position:0%
in awards you know i i i understand
 
04:43:01.600 --> 04:43:03.270 align:start position:0%
in awards you know i i i understand
that

04:43:03.270 --> 04:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:43:03.280 --> 04:43:04.470 align:start position:0%
that
providers

04:43:04.470 --> 04:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
providers
 
04:43:06.948 --> 04:43:06.958 align:start position:0%
and their participation in an overall
 
04:43:06.958 --> 04:43:09.030 align:start position:0%
and their participation in an overall
project

04:43:09.030 --> 04:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
project
 
04:43:11.910 --> 04:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
it differs between
 
04:43:11.920 --> 04:43:12.788 align:start position:0%
it differs between
where

04:43:12.788 --> 04:43:12.798 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:43:15.350 --> 04:43:15.360 align:start position:0%
the potential for earnings
 
04:43:15.360 --> 04:43:16.230 align:start position:0%
the potential for earnings
and

04:43:16.230 --> 04:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:43:17.750 --> 04:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
the potential for
 
04:43:19.350 --> 04:43:19.360 align:start position:0%
serving unserved
 
04:43:23.030 --> 04:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh need to be valued differently
 
04:43:25.110 --> 04:43:25.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:43:28.788 --> 04:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:30.708 --> 04:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
being an old-timer and
 
04:43:32.628 --> 04:43:32.638 align:start position:0%
also having a landline which i don't
 
04:43:34.550 --> 04:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
think i'd ever give up
 
04:43:34.560 --> 04:43:35.910 align:start position:0%
think i'd ever give up
um

04:43:35.910 --> 04:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:38.390 --> 04:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
i'm reading the bill and it says
 
04:43:40.948 --> 04:43:40.958 align:start position:0%
a municipality is determined to lack
 
04:43:44.310 --> 04:43:44.320 align:start position:0%
adequate self-service now i'm thinking
 
04:43:47.270 --> 04:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
of something that we did
 
04:43:49.350 --> 04:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
quite a few years ago
 
04:43:51.270 --> 04:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
with unh
 
04:43:53.830 --> 04:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
getting a grant to do the last mile and
 
04:43:56.310 --> 04:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
what it turned out to be was just upping
 
04:43:59.590 --> 04:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
speeds because adequate service
 
04:44:02.868 --> 04:44:02.878 align:start position:0%
has a very defined definition it can be
 
04:44:04.708 --> 04:44:04.718 align:start position:0%
people who have service that don't have
 
04:44:06.310 --> 04:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
enough speed
 
04:44:09.030 --> 04:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
it can be defined many ways
 
04:44:11.190 --> 04:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
you are on a commission with your
 
04:44:13.670 --> 04:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
commission that it's on the broadband
 
04:44:15.830 --> 04:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
commission for this the governor
 
04:44:18.150 --> 04:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
would you see or
 
04:44:20.230 --> 04:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
be looking into that to see what the
 
04:44:23.190 --> 04:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
parameters are and be involved in the
 
04:44:23.200 --> 04:44:24.470 align:start position:0%
parameters are and be involved in the
rulemaking

04:44:24.470 --> 04:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
rulemaking
 
04:44:27.030 --> 04:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
for this particular
 
04:44:27.040 --> 04:44:32.788 align:start position:0%
for this particular
process

04:44:32.788 --> 04:44:32.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:32.798 --> 04:44:34.550 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:44:34.550 --> 04:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:44:37.110 --> 04:44:37.120 align:start position:0%
i i'm not sure how the department of
 
04:44:39.190 --> 04:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
business economic affairs would would
 
04:44:41.430 --> 04:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
carry out its rulemaking uh
 
04:44:43.590 --> 04:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
i you know
 
04:44:44.948 --> 04:44:44.958 align:start position:0%
i don't know that there's a broadband
 
04:44:46.948 --> 04:44:46.958 align:start position:0%
commission in the state i don't think
 
04:44:48.230 --> 04:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
that there is
 
04:44:50.310 --> 04:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
the commission that i chair is on
 
04:44:52.788 --> 04:44:52.798 align:start position:0%
telehealth services which is very
 
04:44:52.798 --> 04:44:53.990 align:start position:0%
telehealth services which is very
concerned

04:44:53.990 --> 04:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
04:44:56.948 --> 04:44:56.958 align:start position:0%
with the ability for people to have cell
 
04:44:59.110 --> 04:44:59.120 align:start position:0%
service so that
 
04:45:01.110 --> 04:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
those appointments that
 
04:45:03.270 --> 04:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
people have with physicians or mental
 
04:45:04.788 --> 04:45:04.798 align:start position:0%
health providers
 
04:45:07.030 --> 04:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
can occur
 
04:45:09.270 --> 04:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
without problem in the same way that the
 
04:45:10.390 --> 04:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
safety concern
 
04:45:10.400 --> 04:45:11.190 align:start position:0%
safety concern
uh

04:45:11.190 --> 04:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:45:13.270 --> 04:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
you know uh but
 
04:45:13.280 --> 04:45:14.470 align:start position:0%
you know uh but
um

04:45:14.470 --> 04:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:17.430 --> 04:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
yeah i i i understand
 
04:45:19.190 --> 04:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:45:21.190 --> 04:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
you know where where your concern is
 
04:45:21.200 --> 04:45:21.990 align:start position:0%
you know where where your concern is
there

04:45:21.990 --> 04:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:45:24.150 --> 04:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
okay senator khan thank you uh if we
 
04:45:25.670 --> 04:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
have i'm just going to add that i was
 
04:45:25.680 --> 04:45:26.788 align:start position:0%
have i'm just going to add that i was
very

04:45:26.788 --> 04:45:26.798 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:45:30.150 --> 04:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
involved with carol miller on that
 
04:45:30.160 --> 04:45:31.110 align:start position:0%
involved with carol miller on that
and

04:45:31.110 --> 04:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:45:33.590 --> 04:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
and that was a middle mile service i
 
04:45:37.270 --> 04:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:40.708 --> 04:45:40.718 align:start position:0%
two communities had enfield and uh
 
04:45:43.190 --> 04:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
rindge i believe were the two
 
04:45:45.750 --> 04:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh communities that had last mile
 
04:45:45.760 --> 04:45:46.868 align:start position:0%
uh communities that had last mile
service

04:45:46.868 --> 04:45:46.878 align:start position:0%
service
 
04:45:49.750 --> 04:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
allocated to that otherwise that was
 
04:45:51.910 --> 04:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
i mean that infrastructure will serve us
 
04:45:53.910 --> 04:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
well with broadband deployment
 
04:45:55.590 --> 04:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you senator khan we have to move
 
04:45:57.670 --> 04:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
on i know the committee may have further
 
04:45:59.510 --> 04:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
questions but we need to
 
04:46:02.708 --> 04:46:02.718 align:start position:0%
hear from representatives from a t and t
 
04:46:04.550 --> 04:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to call
 
04:46:04.560 --> 04:46:06.230 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to call
owen

owen
smith

04:46:07.830 --> 04:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
smith
 
04:46:10.230 --> 04:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
to testify on this bill
 
04:46:12.390 --> 04:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
and committee members he will have
 
04:46:14.230 --> 04:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
answers to a lot of your additional
 
04:46:22.150 --> 04:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:25.910 --> 04:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:28.470 --> 04:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
i said i hope that's the case i think i
 
04:46:31.190 --> 04:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
was able to sitting back there answer
 
04:46:32.708 --> 04:46:32.718 align:start position:0%
most of them but
 
04:46:35.350 --> 04:46:35.360 align:start position:0%
happy to do that so uh
 
04:46:36.708 --> 04:46:36.718 align:start position:0%
chair voz
 
04:46:38.550 --> 04:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
vice chair thomas members of the
 
04:46:40.230 --> 04:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
committee uh i appreciate the
 
04:46:41.910 --> 04:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be here
 
04:46:44.948 --> 04:46:44.958 align:start position:0%
to comment uh in support of this concept
 
04:46:47.270 --> 04:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
of of creating a wireless
 
04:46:50.708 --> 04:46:50.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:52.868 --> 04:46:52.878 align:start position:0%
my name is owen smith i'm with at t i'm
 
04:46:54.868 --> 04:46:54.878 align:start position:0%
the state president for the northern new
 
04:46:56.948 --> 04:46:56.958 align:start position:0%
england maine new hampshire and vermont
 
04:47:01.110 --> 04:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
and i'd first like to bring attention to
 
04:47:03.830 --> 04:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
a letter that i think ctia has submitted
 
04:47:05.110 --> 04:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you have it yet i think
 
04:47:07.430 --> 04:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
it was done maybe later
 
04:47:09.110 --> 04:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
04:47:10.948 --> 04:47:10.958 align:start position:0%
earlier this morning but i just wanted
 
04:47:12.470 --> 04:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
to highlight a couple of things this is
 
04:47:14.948 --> 04:47:14.958 align:start position:0%
from the cellular telephone
 
04:47:17.110 --> 04:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
industry association which is for the
 
04:47:19.910 --> 04:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
wireless providers
 
04:47:21.990 --> 04:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
they write in support of creation of a
 
04:47:24.150 --> 04:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
wireless deployment grant initiative and
 
04:47:26.390 --> 04:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
its respective fund which is yet to be
 
04:47:26.400 --> 04:47:28.070 align:start position:0%
its respective fund which is yet to be
determined

04:47:28.070 --> 04:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
determined
 
04:47:29.990 --> 04:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
the importance of wireless is also
 
04:47:33.110 --> 04:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
highlighted in 2020 during covid
 
04:47:35.110 --> 04:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
wireless data traffic
 
04:47:37.350 --> 04:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
had another record year
 
04:47:39.750 --> 04:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
and since 2016
 
04:47:43.510 --> 04:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
data has increased by 207 percent
 
04:47:45.830 --> 04:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
according to the national center for
 
04:47:47.910 --> 04:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
health statistics in the last six months
 
04:47:49.310 --> 04:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
of 2020
 
04:47:52.948 --> 04:47:52.958 align:start position:0%
65.8 percent of adults and 75.5 percent
 
04:47:55.190 --> 04:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
of children lived in households with
 
04:47:58.708 --> 04:47:58.718 align:start position:0%
wireless only voice services
 
04:48:01.670 --> 04:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire it's about half
 
04:48:04.550 --> 04:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
of the population is with a
 
04:48:07.830 --> 04:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
just a wireless household no no landline
 
04:48:10.470 --> 04:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
connection whatsoever
 
04:48:14.230 --> 04:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
so um anyway the ctia applause the
 
04:48:16.150 --> 04:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
committee's effort uh for the creation
 
04:48:18.150 --> 04:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
of a wireless deployment grant in that
 
04:48:19.590 --> 04:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
respective fund so i just wanted to
 
04:48:19.600 --> 04:48:20.708 align:start position:0%
respective fund so i just wanted to
highlight

04:48:20.708 --> 04:48:20.718 align:start position:0%
highlight
 
04:48:22.550 --> 04:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
that if i if i could
 
04:48:22.560 --> 04:48:23.270 align:start position:0%
that if i if i could
so

04:48:23.270 --> 04:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:48:23.280 --> 04:48:24.150 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:48:24.150 --> 04:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:27.430 --> 04:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
so we appreciate um the intent of
 
04:48:30.948 --> 04:48:30.958 align:start position:0%
senator khan and have worked with him on
 
04:48:33.110 --> 04:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
the amendment that he has referenced
 
04:48:35.510 --> 04:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
along with with others
 
04:48:35.520 --> 04:48:36.550 align:start position:0%
along with with others
and

04:48:36.550 --> 04:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:48:37.750 --> 04:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
04:48:40.310 --> 04:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
the industry has worked along with
 
04:48:42.230 --> 04:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
myself from att
 
04:48:42.240 --> 04:48:43.510 align:start position:0%
myself from att
and

04:48:43.510 --> 04:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:48:45.350 --> 04:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
i think it's important that
 
04:48:47.590 --> 04:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
we we take the bill that senator khan
 
04:48:49.590 --> 04:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
has introduced and make it sort of more
 
04:48:49.600 --> 04:48:51.350 align:start position:0%
has introduced and make it sort of more
defined

04:48:51.350 --> 04:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
defined
 
04:48:55.190 --> 04:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
a more robust opportunity in creating
 
04:48:57.990 --> 04:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
a separate fund for wireless and with
 
04:49:02.788 --> 04:49:02.798 align:start position:0%
some some guidance that the bea would
 
04:49:04.788 --> 04:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
through a rulemaking process be putting
 
04:49:04.798 --> 04:49:05.990 align:start position:0%
through a rulemaking process be putting
together

04:49:05.990 --> 04:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:49:07.830 --> 04:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
some key elements should include a
 
04:49:09.830 --> 04:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
separate fund for wireless
 
04:49:11.750 --> 04:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
for various reasons establish a
 
04:49:14.470 --> 04:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
competitive rfp process for the wireless
 
04:49:16.948 --> 04:49:16.958 align:start position:0%
providers establish a challenge process
 
04:49:19.670 --> 04:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
that where questions and answers can be
 
04:49:21.670 --> 04:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
had after the process and ensure
 
04:49:23.750 --> 04:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
proprietary information is protected
 
04:49:26.390 --> 04:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
we're a very competitive industry and
 
04:49:27.830 --> 04:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
that information
 
04:49:29.750 --> 04:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
we would like to see protective and then
 
04:49:32.070 --> 04:49:32.080 align:start position:0%
a process that would promote
 
04:49:35.270 --> 04:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
um a wireless connectivity statewide
 
04:49:35.280 --> 04:49:36.868 align:start position:0%
um a wireless connectivity statewide
and

04:49:36.868 --> 04:49:36.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:49:38.948 --> 04:49:38.958 align:start position:0%
so just the last couple of years we've
 
04:49:41.510 --> 04:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
realized how reliant we've become
 
04:49:44.310 --> 04:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
on broadband and wireless communications
 
04:49:46.470 --> 04:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
with covid
 
04:49:49.270 --> 04:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
you know the wireless networks were
 
04:49:51.590 --> 04:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
performed very well as did the broadband
 
04:49:54.230 --> 04:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
networks uh the wired the wire line um
 
04:49:56.948 --> 04:49:56.958 align:start position:0%
the wireless had an increase of 25 to 30
 
04:49:56.958 --> 04:49:57.910 align:start position:0%
the wireless had an increase of 25 to 30
percent

04:49:57.910 --> 04:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:50:00.390 --> 04:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
um literally overnight when when cove
 
04:50:04.390 --> 04:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
hit back in i think it was march of 2019
 
04:50:04.400 --> 04:50:05.670 align:start position:0%
hit back in i think it was march of 2019
and

04:50:05.670 --> 04:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:50:05.680 --> 04:50:06.948 align:start position:0%
and
so

04:50:06.948 --> 04:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:50:10.550 --> 04:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
that's i think important to to state
 
04:50:12.470 --> 04:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
so it's important that we
 
04:50:15.190 --> 04:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
put an initiative together and address
 
04:50:17.670 --> 04:50:17.680 align:start position:0%
the areas in new hampshire using federal
 
04:50:19.590 --> 04:50:19.600 align:start position:0%
funding that would
 
04:50:22.788 --> 04:50:22.798 align:start position:0%
lack adequate mobile wireless service
 
04:50:22.798 --> 04:50:24.070 align:start position:0%
lack adequate mobile wireless service
so

04:50:24.070 --> 04:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:50:26.628 --> 04:50:26.638 align:start position:0%
there are federal dollars that have come
 
04:50:29.270 --> 04:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
to the state there are more coming
 
04:50:31.490 --> 04:50:31.500 align:start position:0%
a lot of the funds
 
04:50:31.500 --> 04:50:32.628 align:start position:0%
a lot of the funds
[Music]

04:50:32.628 --> 04:50:32.638 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:50:34.788 --> 04:50:34.798 align:start position:0%
are open to interpretation on whether or
 
04:50:36.310 --> 04:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
not they can be used what they can be
 
04:50:38.788 --> 04:50:38.798 align:start position:0%
used for whether it's wireless
 
04:50:41.670 --> 04:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
or or or not there are some specific
 
04:50:43.670 --> 04:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
speeds and in some cases wireless cannot
 
04:50:45.030 --> 04:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
meet those
 
04:50:47.350 --> 04:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
there seems to be
 
04:50:47.360 --> 04:50:48.150 align:start position:0%
there seems to be
a

04:50:48.150 --> 04:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:50:48.160 --> 04:50:49.350 align:start position:0%
a
a

04:50:49.350 --> 04:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:50:52.070 --> 04:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
out for public safety
 
04:50:53.830 --> 04:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
that doesn't tie
 
04:50:57.110 --> 04:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
to specific speeds and of course 5g
 
04:50:57.120 --> 04:50:58.230 align:start position:0%
to specific speeds and of course 5g
coming

04:50:58.230 --> 04:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
coming
 
04:50:59.590 --> 04:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
will be able to meet some of those
 
04:51:03.190 --> 04:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
speeds unlike a 4g lte can today
 
04:51:04.550 --> 04:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
so just
 
04:51:06.230 --> 04:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
looking at new hampshire and
 
04:51:09.270 --> 04:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
specifically now with a t over the last
 
04:51:11.750 --> 04:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
three years we've invested 120 million
 
04:51:14.788 --> 04:51:14.798 align:start position:0%
dollars in this state on our network and
 
04:51:17.430 --> 04:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of that had to do with uh firstnet
 
04:51:20.470 --> 04:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
which is a public safety network that
 
04:51:21.990 --> 04:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
we have a contract with the federal
 
04:51:24.550 --> 04:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
government over a 25-year period
 
04:51:26.470 --> 04:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to be investing 40 billion
 
04:51:28.708 --> 04:51:28.718 align:start position:0%
dollars and
 
04:51:28.718 --> 04:51:29.990 align:start position:0%
dollars and
we've

04:51:29.990 --> 04:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
we've
 
04:51:31.910 --> 04:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
done a lot in new hampshire and across
 
04:51:34.550 --> 04:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
the country with that funding
 
04:51:38.550 --> 04:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire since 2018
 
04:51:38.560 --> 04:51:39.510 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire since 2018
we've

04:51:39.510 --> 04:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
we've
 
04:51:42.470 --> 04:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
turned on well over 50 cell sites
 
04:51:42.480 --> 04:51:43.590 align:start position:0%
turned on well over 50 cell sites
and

04:51:43.590 --> 04:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:51:46.470 --> 04:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
those benefit both the att commercial
 
04:51:48.708 --> 04:51:48.718 align:start position:0%
customers and public safety with
 
04:51:51.270 --> 04:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
firstnet when a site is built and when
 
04:51:52.628 --> 04:51:52.638 align:start position:0%
all is said and done and it's up and
 
04:51:52.638 --> 04:51:54.390 align:start position:0%
all is said and done and it's up and
running

04:51:54.390 --> 04:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
running
 
04:51:57.110 --> 04:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
both the att's customers and first
 
04:52:01.110 --> 04:52:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:04.150 --> 04:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
so we've put coverage in towns lots of
 
04:52:08.310 --> 04:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
towns but towns like jeffrey and antrim
 
04:52:08.320 --> 04:52:09.750 align:start position:0%
towns but towns like jeffrey and antrim
stoddard

04:52:09.750 --> 04:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
stoddard
 
04:52:12.230 --> 04:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
stewart's town westchesterfield
 
04:52:12.240 --> 04:52:13.510 align:start position:0%
stewart's town westchesterfield
bath

04:52:13.510 --> 04:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
bath
 
04:52:16.708 --> 04:52:16.718 align:start position:0%
and and you know 50 50 more
 
04:52:18.708 --> 04:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
some of those
 
04:52:20.390 --> 04:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
really were
 
04:52:22.230 --> 04:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
areas that needed improved coverage that
 
04:52:23.830 --> 04:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
had some coverage
 
04:52:26.390 --> 04:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
but that list that i just read really
 
04:52:28.708 --> 04:52:28.718 align:start position:0%
didn't have any coverage and uh i'm
 
04:52:30.788 --> 04:52:30.798 align:start position:0%
happy to say that i can now drive from
 
04:52:34.150 --> 04:52:34.160 align:start position:0%
keene to concord and not drop a call
 
04:52:36.708 --> 04:52:36.718 align:start position:0%
i couldn't say that 18 months ago
 
04:52:38.470 --> 04:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:52:40.788 --> 04:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
with all that said there are still towns
 
04:52:44.150 --> 04:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
nelson was was mentioned um that would
 
04:52:46.470 --> 04:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
still like to have and need better cell
 
04:52:46.480 --> 04:52:47.510 align:start position:0%
still like to have and need better cell
coverage

04:52:47.510 --> 04:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
04:52:50.390 --> 04:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
um one of the points that was
 
04:52:52.470 --> 04:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
asked or questions that was asked here
 
04:52:52.480 --> 04:52:53.670 align:start position:0%
asked or questions that was asked here
um

04:52:53.670 --> 04:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:54.868 --> 04:52:54.878 align:start position:0%
you know people shouldn't be making
 
04:52:56.948 --> 04:52:56.958 align:start position:0%
calls in their in your cars
 
04:52:59.030 --> 04:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
the majority of calls that are made on a
 
04:53:01.510 --> 04:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
cell phone are made inside of a building
 
04:53:05.030 --> 04:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:06.550 --> 04:53:06.560 align:start position:0%
are done on a cell 911
 
04:53:09.590 --> 04:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
so this isn't about teenagers driving
 
04:53:09.600 --> 04:53:10.550 align:start position:0%
so this isn't about teenagers driving
around

04:53:10.550 --> 04:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
around
 
04:53:12.230 --> 04:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
you know texting which they shouldn't be
 
04:53:15.430 --> 04:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
doing um but some do and we know that
 
04:53:17.830 --> 04:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
that's an issue but this is this is a
 
04:53:19.750 --> 04:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
much bigger piece
 
04:53:22.230 --> 04:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
in that again more than 22 percent or
 
04:53:25.110 --> 04:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
excuse me more than 50 percent of new
 
04:53:25.120 --> 04:53:27.990 align:start position:0%
excuse me more than 50 percent of new
hampshire

04:53:27.990 --> 04:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:28.000 --> 04:53:29.590 align:start position:0%
 
residents

04:53:29.590 --> 04:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
residents
 
04:53:33.590 --> 04:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
use wireless only for their connectivity
 
04:53:33.600 --> 04:53:34.868 align:start position:0%
use wireless only for their connectivity
so

04:53:34.868 --> 04:53:34.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:53:36.310 --> 04:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
all of that investment that we've done
 
04:53:38.470 --> 04:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
120 million over the next over the last
 
04:53:41.110 --> 04:53:41.120 align:start position:0%
three years and more will be coming but
 
04:53:43.750 --> 04:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
there's um we still have a ways to go
 
04:53:46.150 --> 04:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
and nelson was mentioned dairy we've got
 
04:53:47.910 --> 04:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
a couple of sites and dairies you know
 
04:53:48.868 --> 04:53:48.878 align:start position:0%
it's going to be
 
04:53:50.948 --> 04:53:50.958 align:start position:0%
specific by carrier i don't think we
 
04:53:52.788 --> 04:53:52.798 align:start position:0%
have an issue in dairy new hampshire
 
04:53:54.868 --> 04:53:54.878 align:start position:0%
with a network
 
04:53:57.590 --> 04:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
but there are towns that we do and
 
04:53:59.750 --> 04:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
but there's areas
 
04:54:01.830 --> 04:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
and maybe nelson is one of them where
 
04:54:01.840 --> 04:54:02.788 align:start position:0%
and maybe nelson is one of them where
the

04:54:02.788 --> 04:54:02.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:54:05.670 --> 04:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
return on investment is not there
 
04:54:09.110 --> 04:54:09.120 align:start position:0%
and at t is going to put a very low
 
04:54:11.670 --> 04:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
priority on that versus trying to get
 
04:54:14.948 --> 04:54:14.958 align:start position:0%
more capacity in manchester or boston
 
04:54:17.430 --> 04:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
and with firstnet
 
04:54:19.430 --> 04:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
we didn't have a return on investment to
 
04:54:21.110 --> 04:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
worry about we've got sites out there
 
04:54:23.830 --> 04:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
that we've spent two million dollars on
 
04:54:25.590 --> 04:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
that we will never get a return on
 
04:54:28.150 --> 04:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
investment but we also got some federal
 
04:54:30.390 --> 04:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
money on that and we've committed to
 
04:54:32.310 --> 04:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
build out the network
 
04:54:34.310 --> 04:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
and the return on investment didn't
 
04:54:34.320 --> 04:54:35.190 align:start position:0%
and the return on investment didn't
matter

04:54:35.190 --> 04:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
matter
 
04:54:38.310 --> 04:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
so we're in a situation now where
 
04:54:40.390 --> 04:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of these hard to find places will
 
04:54:42.708 --> 04:54:42.718 align:start position:0%
first net cover those at some point some
 
04:54:45.030 --> 04:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
of them perhaps we're just starting to
 
04:54:47.270 --> 04:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
talk about the next round of funding but
 
04:54:49.510 --> 04:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
many of those places providers are just
 
04:54:51.030 --> 04:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
not going to go to because there is no
 
04:54:51.040 --> 04:54:51.990 align:start position:0%
not going to go to because there is no
return

04:54:51.990 --> 04:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
return
 
04:54:54.230 --> 04:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
on investment
 
04:54:56.070 --> 04:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:54:58.788 --> 04:54:58.798 align:start position:0%
i think that does it for me but um thank
 
04:55:01.110 --> 04:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
you again for taking up this important
 
04:55:03.750 --> 04:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
point and we would certainly
 
04:55:05.510 --> 04:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
um encourage you to pass a bill that
 
04:55:08.948 --> 04:55:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:09.910 --> 04:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:55:11.670 --> 04:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate that yep representative
 
04:55:13.430 --> 04:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
partial has a question
 
04:55:15.430 --> 04:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
thank you chair uh thank you for coming
 
04:55:17.110 --> 04:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
and take my question
 
04:55:17.120 --> 04:55:18.230 align:start position:0%
and take my question
um

04:55:18.230 --> 04:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:20.470 --> 04:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
my concern is a place like nelson where
 
04:55:21.910 --> 04:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
you may not get that return on
 
04:55:24.628 --> 04:55:24.638 align:start position:0%
investment and i know you're you have a
 
04:55:26.788 --> 04:55:26.798 align:start position:0%
responsibility to your shareholders
 
04:55:29.270 --> 04:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
but at the same time there's a
 
04:55:31.190 --> 04:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
good for the state it's good for the
 
04:55:34.310 --> 04:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
community to have this 9911 connectivity
 
04:55:36.788 --> 04:55:36.798 align:start position:0%
it's a public safety issue i figure
 
04:55:38.788 --> 04:55:38.798 align:start position:0%
and my concern would be
 
04:55:41.190 --> 04:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
because you're focusing on broadband
 
04:55:42.788 --> 04:55:42.798 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
04:55:44.948 --> 04:55:44.958 align:start position:0%
at least by meeting this letter and has
 
04:55:46.470 --> 04:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
a very strong focus on providing
 
04:55:48.070 --> 04:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
broadband service
 
04:55:51.270 --> 04:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
wireless service for the state
 
04:55:53.270 --> 04:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
my concern is a place like nelson will
 
04:55:55.590 --> 04:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
continue to be underserved
 
04:55:55.600 --> 04:55:56.788 align:start position:0%
continue to be underserved
and

04:55:56.788 --> 04:55:56.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:56:01.030 --> 04:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
or places like that that are really
 
04:56:03.430 --> 04:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
not financially feasible for a company
 
04:56:06.230 --> 04:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
that does need to turn a profit to serve
 
04:56:08.628 --> 04:56:08.638 align:start position:0%
and i see this bill as a means the
 
04:56:10.070 --> 04:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill is a means to get
 
04:56:12.230 --> 04:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
around that to make sure we get adequate
 
04:56:13.990 --> 04:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
coverage throughout the state
 
04:56:14.000 --> 04:56:15.670 align:start position:0%
coverage throughout the state
um

04:56:15.670 --> 04:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:17.190 --> 04:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
do you believe this bill can be tweaked
 
04:56:19.750 --> 04:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
in such a way so we can ensure coverage
 
04:56:20.788 --> 04:56:20.798 align:start position:0%
in these uh
 
04:56:22.788 --> 04:56:22.798 align:start position:0%
less profitable areas
 
04:56:25.030 --> 04:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely and and i think that's why
 
04:56:26.868 --> 04:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
this bill is so important
 
04:56:29.750 --> 04:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
again uh first net aside
 
04:56:29.760 --> 04:56:31.590 align:start position:0%
again uh first net aside
att

04:56:31.590 --> 04:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
att
 
04:56:33.510 --> 04:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
has to prioritize our budgets start on a
 
04:56:35.190 --> 04:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
national level and then they come into
 
04:56:36.948 --> 04:56:36.958 align:start position:0%
new england and then new hampshire you
 
04:56:39.270 --> 04:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
know based on subscribers and that kind
 
04:56:42.230 --> 04:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
of thing um but we've got to prioritize
 
04:56:44.788 --> 04:56:44.798 align:start position:0%
where we um want to go and spend that
 
04:56:48.708 --> 04:56:48.718 align:start position:0%
money and although we would love to have
 
04:56:50.470 --> 04:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
continuous coverage throughout
 
04:56:52.310 --> 04:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
everywhere in new hampshire we don't i
 
04:56:54.550 --> 04:56:54.560 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody i know no provider
 
04:56:56.150 --> 04:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
does um
 
04:56:58.550 --> 04:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
the terrain is tough so
 
04:57:02.868 --> 04:57:02.878 align:start position:0%
you know a situation like nelson
 
04:57:05.510 --> 04:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
basically the the grant would pay for
 
04:57:07.670 --> 04:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
all of the capital costs
 
04:57:09.110 --> 04:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
of a sell site
 
04:57:11.350 --> 04:57:11.360 align:start position:0%
and an average sell site depending on
 
04:57:13.270 --> 04:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
the provider for a t
 
04:57:16.948 --> 04:57:16.958 align:start position:0%
it's about 400 to 450 000
 
04:57:19.510 --> 04:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
so that's all this grant would do um is
 
04:57:22.470 --> 04:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
is provide the capital cost to do that
 
04:57:24.550 --> 04:57:24.560 align:start position:0%
once it's up and running
 
04:57:26.230 --> 04:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
you know the return on investment is
 
04:57:28.550 --> 04:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
still important you know we have uh
 
04:57:28.560 --> 04:57:29.510 align:start position:0%
still important you know we have uh
leases

04:57:29.510 --> 04:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
leases
 
04:57:32.628 --> 04:57:32.638 align:start position:0%
typically at t or verizon wouldn't own
 
04:57:34.230 --> 04:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
that cell site we would get a third
 
04:57:36.390 --> 04:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
party to build that
 
04:57:37.910 --> 04:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
we may take it through the permitting
 
04:57:40.628 --> 04:57:40.638 align:start position:0%
process but hand it over sell it to a
 
04:57:42.470 --> 04:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
third party and then they would be
 
04:57:44.470 --> 04:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
responsible for we would become they
 
04:57:45.990 --> 04:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
would be the landlord we would become a
 
04:57:48.628 --> 04:57:48.638 align:start position:0%
customer you know verizon u.s cellular
 
04:57:51.830 --> 04:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
t-mobile could also jump on that site um
 
04:57:51.840 --> 04:57:53.270 align:start position:0%
t-mobile could also jump on that site um
so

04:57:53.270 --> 04:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:57:55.430 --> 04:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
there are ongoing expenses operating
 
04:57:58.948 --> 04:57:58.958 align:start position:0%
expenses but you you blend that site
 
04:58:01.830 --> 04:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
into the you know 400 other sites that
 
04:58:04.470 --> 04:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
we have in new hampshire and uh you know
 
04:58:07.190 --> 04:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
you look at it as a total
 
04:58:07.200 --> 04:58:09.350 align:start position:0%
you look at it as a total
so

04:58:09.350 --> 04:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:58:11.110 --> 04:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:58:12.628 --> 04:58:12.638 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if it's that actually a
 
04:58:15.670 --> 04:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up or maybe some content um
 
04:58:15.680 --> 04:58:17.350 align:start position:0%
follow-up or maybe some content um
att

04:58:17.350 --> 04:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
att
 
04:58:19.030 --> 04:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
may come in as a better for a place like
 
04:58:20.708 --> 04:58:20.718 align:start position:0%
nelson which is dear to me because i
 
04:58:22.550 --> 04:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
have lost self-coverage in nelson when i
 
04:58:24.150 --> 04:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
really desperately needed it i think
 
04:58:26.788 --> 04:58:26.798 align:start position:0%
abdina was a story here um
 
04:58:29.190 --> 04:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
but um
 
04:58:31.750 --> 04:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
if i'm on a strip network or verizon or
 
04:58:33.670 --> 04:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
any other network
 
04:58:35.430 --> 04:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
that necessarily means that does not
 
04:58:37.430 --> 04:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean i can still have
 
04:58:40.150 --> 04:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
adequate cell phone coverage in nelson
 
04:58:42.150 --> 04:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
because i'm on their own network i mean
 
04:58:44.070 --> 04:58:44.080 align:start position:0%
that is correct right
 
04:58:46.868 --> 04:58:46.878 align:start position:0%
that's correct um i have a caveat
 
04:58:50.390 --> 04:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
regarding 9-1-1 i'd love to hear it so
 
04:58:53.350 --> 04:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
if there is anybody's network there
 
04:58:56.150 --> 04:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
and you were dialing 9-1-1 it would go
 
04:58:57.830 --> 04:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
to whatever network
 
04:59:01.270 --> 04:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
that was there so if verizon was in
 
04:59:01.280 --> 04:59:02.628 align:start position:0%
that was there so if verizon was in
um

04:59:02.628 --> 04:59:02.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:04.310 --> 04:59:04.320 align:start position:0%
you know nelson
 
04:59:06.628 --> 04:59:06.638 align:start position:0%
and you were an att customer in dialed
 
04:59:10.230 --> 04:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 it would be picked up through
 
04:59:13.190 --> 04:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
that's reassuring thank you thank you
 
04:59:14.868 --> 04:59:14.878 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts has a
 
04:59:14.878 --> 04:59:17.190 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts has a
question

04:59:17.190 --> 04:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:59:21.190 --> 04:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
yeah my question is is on this bill
 
04:59:23.670 --> 04:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
and i think something that
 
04:59:25.830 --> 04:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
representative votes read
 
04:59:28.628 --> 04:59:28.638 align:start position:0%
from a possible amendment confused me
 
04:59:31.190 --> 04:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
who actually would apply for this bill
 
04:59:33.350 --> 04:59:33.360 align:start position:0%
would it be the town or would it be the
 
04:59:36.390 --> 04:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
provider and is that money or was it the
 
04:59:38.470 --> 04:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
state and then the state goes to the
 
04:59:40.550 --> 04:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
town and goes to the i mean it's just
 
04:59:42.310 --> 04:59:42.320 align:start position:0%
very convoluted to me
 
04:59:46.070 --> 04:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
and then the last lines of the bill
 
04:59:48.948 --> 04:59:48.958 align:start position:0%
eight and nine i go back to the adequate
 
04:59:52.470 --> 04:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
cell phone service which could mean
 
04:59:55.270 --> 04:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
many towns not just the ones that have
 
04:59:55.280 --> 04:59:57.270 align:start position:0%
many towns not just the ones that have
gaps

04:59:57.270 --> 04:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
gaps
 
04:59:57.280 --> 04:59:59.190 align:start position:0%
gaps
so

04:59:59.190 --> 04:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:00:01.510 --> 05:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
depending on who picks
 
05:00:03.430 --> 05:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
who gets the money
 
05:00:05.750 --> 05:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
somebody picks the town or the place so
 
05:00:09.430 --> 05:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
i'd like to know that who who
 
05:00:11.430 --> 05:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
who actually applies for the grant from
 
05:00:13.270 --> 05:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
05:00:15.670 --> 05:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
and or the state government
 
05:00:18.230 --> 05:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
so that would be the provider in and
 
05:00:22.390 --> 05:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
in senator khan's bill 395 um that's one
 
05:00:24.628 --> 05:00:24.638 align:start position:0%
of the areas that has
 
05:00:26.868 --> 05:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
in the process i guess of being amended
 
05:00:26.878 --> 05:00:27.750 align:start position:0%
in the process i guess of being amended
um

05:00:27.750 --> 05:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:29.590 --> 05:00:29.600 align:start position:0%
that's sort of how the broadband
 
05:00:33.030 --> 05:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
networks work the wire line um i know i
 
05:00:35.430 --> 05:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
think consolidated has gone into you
 
05:00:38.390 --> 05:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
know partnership with municipalities um
 
05:00:40.070 --> 05:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
that really can't happen with with
 
05:00:40.080 --> 05:00:41.430 align:start position:0%
that really can't happen with with
wireless

05:00:41.430 --> 05:00:41.440 align:start position:0%
wireless
 
05:00:43.510 --> 05:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
you need to own spectrum which the
 
05:00:45.990 --> 05:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
wireless providers do in order to put up
 
05:00:49.030 --> 05:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
a network a wireless network that will
 
05:00:52.788 --> 05:00:52.798 align:start position:0%
work with the other providers so
 
05:00:55.030 --> 05:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
it's very much driven by
 
05:00:57.350 --> 05:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
the provider not the municipality so the
 
05:00:59.510 --> 05:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
provider would own all of the equipment
 
05:01:01.270 --> 05:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
and be responsible for the upkeep of all
 
05:01:03.190 --> 05:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
of that equipment
 
05:01:05.430 --> 05:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
may i follow up follow up
 
05:01:07.510 --> 05:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
ownership is something i understand but
 
05:01:10.868 --> 05:01:10.878 align:start position:0%
it's a application for the grant itself
 
05:01:13.190 --> 05:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
and then it if
 
05:01:14.868 --> 05:01:14.878 align:start position:0%
the provider
 
05:01:17.830 --> 05:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
applies for the grant it would who would
 
05:01:22.628 --> 05:01:22.638 align:start position:0%
pick out which areas are going to be
 
05:01:24.868 --> 05:01:24.878 align:start position:0%
served and it may not be those who are
 
05:01:26.390 --> 05:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
not served at all
 
05:01:29.430 --> 05:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
it may be those who are underserved so
 
05:01:31.190 --> 05:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
who actually makes the federal
 
05:01:31.200 --> 05:01:32.628 align:start position:0%
who actually makes the federal
application

05:01:32.628 --> 05:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
application
 
05:01:35.430 --> 05:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
so it would be um the provider that
 
05:01:36.708 --> 05:01:36.718 align:start position:0%
would that would
 
05:01:38.868 --> 05:01:38.878 align:start position:0%
that would work and again these rules
 
05:01:41.030 --> 05:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
all need to be worked out through bea um
 
05:01:42.628 --> 05:01:42.638 align:start position:0%
so i don't know exactly how it would
 
05:01:44.628 --> 05:01:44.638 align:start position:0%
work but that's obviously first and
 
05:01:47.510 --> 05:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
foremost but my understanding is
 
05:01:50.310 --> 05:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
that the the provider would apply for
 
05:01:51.670 --> 05:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
those grants and it would be in a
 
05:01:53.990 --> 05:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
particular area listen we know our
 
05:01:56.150 --> 05:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
network we know where there's holes
 
05:01:59.110 --> 05:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
right um uh and
 
05:02:00.868 --> 05:02:00.878 align:start position:0%
we would we would certainly work with a
 
05:02:02.788 --> 05:02:02.798 align:start position:0%
community which we we do through the
 
05:02:05.910 --> 05:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
permitting process so we would let's say
 
05:02:07.270 --> 05:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
go to
 
05:02:10.310 --> 05:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
a bea and and say you know we would like
 
05:02:12.390 --> 05:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
to apply for a grant for nelson
 
05:02:14.390 --> 05:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
we then have to go to nelson
 
05:02:17.110 --> 05:02:17.120 align:start position:0%
and nelson sort of wants to
 
05:02:19.590 --> 05:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
needs to to want it and we need to work
 
05:02:19.600 --> 05:02:20.390 align:start position:0%
needs to to want it and we need to work
through

05:02:20.390 --> 05:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:02:22.310 --> 05:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
the permitting process that is already
 
05:02:25.590 --> 05:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
in place with the town of nelson where
 
05:02:27.030 --> 05:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
we show them
 
05:02:28.868 --> 05:02:28.878 align:start position:0%
you know our great coverage around
 
05:02:31.030 --> 05:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
across route 9. i think nelson's on
 
05:02:33.990 --> 05:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
route 9 right yeah and uh but that we
 
05:02:36.868 --> 05:02:36.878 align:start position:0%
have a gap in coverage in the village of
 
05:02:39.510 --> 05:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
nelson maybe not out on the highway so
 
05:02:39.520 --> 05:02:40.550 align:start position:0%
nelson maybe not out on the highway so
we we

05:02:40.550 --> 05:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
we we
 
05:02:43.270 --> 05:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
have our propagation maps we have the
 
05:02:46.390 --> 05:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
propagation of the site that we would be
 
05:02:49.190 --> 05:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
proposing in nelson and
 
05:02:51.350 --> 05:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
we would be looking for a permit from
 
05:02:53.670 --> 05:02:53.680 align:start position:0%
the town which we would then take back
 
05:02:56.868 --> 05:02:56.878 align:start position:0%
to to be a bea and say
 
05:02:58.150 --> 05:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
here you go
 
05:03:00.390 --> 05:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
and that's i believe when we would get
 
05:03:02.310 --> 05:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
the funding
 
05:03:05.030 --> 05:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
okay before we move on i'm going to open
 
05:03:08.470 --> 05:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on senate bill 424
 
05:03:08.480 --> 05:03:09.590 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on senate bill 424
fn

05:03:09.590 --> 05:03:09.600 align:start position:0%
fn
 
05:03:11.990 --> 05:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
and recess that public hearing until
 
05:03:14.550 --> 05:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
we're done with this one
 
05:03:15.750 --> 05:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
all right further questions
 
05:03:18.230 --> 05:03:18.240 align:start position:0%
representative berezni
 
05:03:19.990 --> 05:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question it's a
 
05:03:22.628 --> 05:03:22.638 align:start position:0%
two-part question the first one is uh is
 
05:03:24.868 --> 05:03:24.878 align:start position:0%
firstnet intended to cover all of new
 
05:03:26.628 --> 05:03:26.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire do you know and then the
 
05:03:29.750 --> 05:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
second one is where atnt offers
 
05:03:32.868 --> 05:03:32.878 align:start position:0%
service because of firstnet is that only
 
05:03:35.350 --> 05:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
calls or does that include broadband as
 
05:03:38.628 --> 05:03:38.638 align:start position:0%
well so great great question um you know
 
05:03:40.868 --> 05:03:40.878 align:start position:0%
the mandate that we have
 
05:03:43.350 --> 05:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
with firstnet the first net authority
 
05:03:44.470 --> 05:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
which is
 
05:03:46.628 --> 05:03:46.638 align:start position:0%
uh under ntia
 
05:03:50.390 --> 05:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
is a a mandate to build out a robust
 
05:03:53.190 --> 05:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
network for first responders that that
 
05:03:54.948 --> 05:03:54.958 align:start position:0%
first responder it's a separate network
 
05:03:56.868 --> 05:03:56.878 align:start position:0%
from the att
 
05:03:58.708 --> 05:03:58.718 align:start position:0%
core network we
 
05:04:00.948 --> 05:04:00.958 align:start position:0%
currently are running two networks in
 
05:04:02.230 --> 05:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire actually more than that
 
05:04:03.910 --> 05:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
with our fiber but from a wireless
 
05:04:06.150 --> 05:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
standpoint we have the att network and
 
05:04:09.670 --> 05:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
we have the the firstnet core network
 
05:04:12.470 --> 05:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
there are shared services and
 
05:04:15.190 --> 05:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
shared spectrum um between those two but
 
05:04:17.430 --> 05:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
they are two separate networks um this
 
05:04:17.440 --> 05:04:18.390 align:start position:0%
they are two separate networks um this
is

05:04:18.390 --> 05:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:04:21.030 --> 05:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
a broadband network with voice
 
05:04:21.040 --> 05:04:22.470 align:start position:0%
a broadband network with voice
capabilities

05:04:22.470 --> 05:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
capabilities
 
05:04:25.910 --> 05:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
so it is absolutely both on every single
 
05:04:27.990 --> 05:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
um cell site that both commercial
 
05:04:30.628 --> 05:04:30.638 align:start position:0%
customers and first responders can take
 
05:04:32.390 --> 05:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
advantage of
 
05:04:34.390 --> 05:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
i don't think we have a mandate to cover
 
05:04:37.190 --> 05:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
a hundred percent of the state um we we
 
05:04:39.910 --> 05:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
already cover well over 95 percent of
 
05:04:42.868 --> 05:04:42.878 align:start position:0%
the population um and we'll continue to
 
05:04:46.788 --> 05:04:46.798 align:start position:0%
get it 100 of the population um
 
05:04:49.430 --> 05:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
i can't sit here and tell you because
 
05:04:51.670 --> 05:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
this is all line of sight that that we
 
05:04:52.948 --> 05:04:52.958 align:start position:0%
will ever get
 
05:04:54.788 --> 05:04:54.798 align:start position:0%
through this technology
 
05:04:57.190 --> 05:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
of of macro towers around the state
 
05:04:59.910 --> 05:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
where we or anybody else would cover 100
 
05:05:02.070 --> 05:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
percent of the state of new hampshire or
 
05:05:03.750 --> 05:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
any other state
 
05:05:05.750 --> 05:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
you know if you're behind a big rock in
 
05:05:07.750 --> 05:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
nelson you know you may not be getting
 
05:05:07.760 --> 05:05:09.510 align:start position:0%
nelson you know you may not be getting
coverage

05:05:09.510 --> 05:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
coverage
 
05:05:14.230 --> 05:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:16.310 --> 05:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
representative harrington has a question
 
05:05:17.510 --> 05:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
05:05:20.470 --> 05:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question um just trying to
 
05:05:22.470 --> 05:05:22.480 align:start position:0%
clarify the bill a little bit here in my
 
05:05:24.390 --> 05:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
mind because we keep talking people keep
 
05:05:26.390 --> 05:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
talking about it'll be done in rules i
 
05:05:28.390 --> 05:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
prefer that we put it in the bill what
 
05:05:31.430 --> 05:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
we want is our intent so
 
05:05:33.270 --> 05:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
first question would be it appears that
 
05:05:35.910 --> 05:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
the municipality can apply for a grant
 
05:05:38.390 --> 05:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
and then use that money to hire a
 
05:05:41.110 --> 05:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
communication provider or the
 
05:05:43.110 --> 05:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
communications provider can apply for
 
05:05:44.708 --> 05:05:44.718 align:start position:0%
the grant with the concurrence of the
 
05:05:46.708 --> 05:05:46.718 align:start position:0%
governing body of municipality so
 
05:05:48.390 --> 05:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
there's two different methods for
 
05:05:50.150 --> 05:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
getting the grant
 
05:05:52.230 --> 05:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
the way the bill is written yes but i
 
05:05:53.830 --> 05:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
think that's part of the amendment that
 
05:05:55.830 --> 05:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
will be coming out that will that will
 
05:05:57.750 --> 05:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
build a municipality yes
 
05:05:59.190 --> 05:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
and this follow-up and then in the
 
05:06:00.948 --> 05:06:00.958 align:start position:0%
second part is i'm still
 
05:06:02.708 --> 05:06:02.718 align:start position:0%
a little confused on it meets federal
 
05:06:04.868 --> 05:06:04.878 align:start position:0%
standards for speed lacing latency
 
05:06:07.270 --> 05:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
reliability and consistency is there a
 
05:06:10.150 --> 05:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
defined thing somewhere in the federal
 
05:06:11.670 --> 05:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
code of federal regulations or something
 
05:06:13.910 --> 05:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
that tells me what that is there is not
 
05:06:13.920 --> 05:06:14.788 align:start position:0%
that tells me what that is there is not
so

05:06:14.788 --> 05:06:14.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:06:16.708 --> 05:06:16.718 align:start position:0%
the bill that has to be amended in the
 
05:06:19.030 --> 05:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
bill because it's a standard that
 
05:06:20.470 --> 05:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
anybody or nobody could meet because you
 
05:06:21.750 --> 05:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
don't know what it is
 
05:06:25.270 --> 05:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
well that's that's a federal guidance
 
05:06:28.470 --> 05:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
and and and there is no definition of a
 
05:06:31.670 --> 05:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
wireless broadband um
 
05:06:33.190 --> 05:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think they're they point to
 
05:06:36.628 --> 05:06:36.638 align:start position:0%
speeds or you know latency or capacity
 
05:06:38.628 --> 05:06:38.638 align:start position:0%
or anything like that
 
05:06:40.948 --> 05:06:40.958 align:start position:0%
and and i think one of the reasons is
 
05:06:43.670 --> 05:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
that if you've got a cell site in
 
05:06:45.430 --> 05:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh nelson it sounds like we're gonna
 
05:06:47.910 --> 05:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
have to get a sell site nelson but
 
05:06:50.868 --> 05:06:50.878 align:start position:0%
you get a have a sell site in nelson um
 
05:06:53.830 --> 05:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
if they're if you've got an event going
 
05:06:55.430 --> 05:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
on you know a
 
05:06:55.440 --> 05:06:56.470 align:start position:0%
on you know a
town

05:06:56.470 --> 05:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
town
 
05:06:58.708 --> 05:06:58.718 align:start position:0%
you know fair whatever and there's
 
05:07:01.430 --> 05:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people in nelson um there
 
05:07:04.628 --> 05:07:04.638 align:start position:0%
may be some capacity issues um not for
 
05:07:06.230 --> 05:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
first responders because of first net
 
05:07:08.470 --> 05:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
but there could be some capacity issues
 
05:07:10.868 --> 05:07:10.878 align:start position:0%
um there could be um
 
05:07:13.590 --> 05:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh some some some coverage issues
 
05:07:16.470 --> 05:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
compared to where there may only be
 
05:07:18.788 --> 05:07:18.798 align:start position:0%
the normal what's the population of
 
05:07:21.750 --> 05:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
nelson 250 people i don't know
 
05:07:25.590 --> 05:07:25.600 align:start position:0%
so so it varies so much on the the
 
05:07:25.600 --> 05:07:26.708 align:start position:0%
so so it varies so much on the the
traffic

05:07:26.708 --> 05:07:26.718 align:start position:0%
traffic
 
05:07:29.750 --> 05:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh in in usage and number of people
 
05:07:32.150 --> 05:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
that it's tough to pin down a definition
 
05:07:34.230 --> 05:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
for a wireless broadband but but as far
 
05:07:36.550 --> 05:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
as what we have here adequate cell phone
 
05:07:38.788 --> 05:07:38.798 align:start position:0%
service it's not defined in the bill and
 
05:07:40.070 --> 05:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
what you're telling me it's not to find
 
05:07:41.830 --> 05:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
any place else either right all right
 
05:07:43.750 --> 05:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:07:45.510 --> 05:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
all right it will be defined in the
 
05:07:48.788 --> 05:07:48.798 align:start position:0%
amendment to read as follows it will
 
05:07:48.798 --> 05:07:50.868 align:start position:0%
amendment to read as follows it will
read

05:07:50.868 --> 05:07:50.878 align:start position:0%
read
 
05:07:52.708 --> 05:07:52.718 align:start position:0%
selected projects shall meet the needs
 
05:07:54.470 --> 05:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
of customers with the lowest possible
 
05:07:55.830 --> 05:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
cost and the highest possible
 
05:07:55.840 --> 05:07:57.350 align:start position:0%
cost and the highest possible
functionality

05:07:57.350 --> 05:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
functionality
 
05:07:59.670 --> 05:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
which admittedly is
 
05:08:03.190 --> 05:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
not terribly precise but
 
05:08:07.030 --> 05:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
that's what the amendment calls for
 
05:08:08.310 --> 05:08:08.320 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:08:10.708 --> 05:08:10.718 align:start position:0%
i think uh
 
05:08:12.628 --> 05:08:12.638 align:start position:0%
we will have time for one more question
 
05:08:14.470 --> 05:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
and that's it so representative partial
 
05:08:16.868 --> 05:08:16.878 align:start position:0%
you can ask it thank you so much for
 
05:08:19.110 --> 05:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
your indulgence chair
 
05:08:19.120 --> 05:08:20.150 align:start position:0%
your indulgence chair
um

05:08:20.150 --> 05:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:21.590 --> 05:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
do i understand that now we're looking
 
05:08:23.510 --> 05:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
at a situation like nelson again our
 
05:08:25.350 --> 05:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
favorite town here
 
05:08:28.310 --> 05:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:31.350 --> 05:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
would you consider it economically
 
05:08:35.430 --> 05:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
feasible to install a 4g lte system in
 
05:08:37.830 --> 05:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
that town if it serves the needs
 
05:08:40.868 --> 05:08:40.878 align:start position:0%
without uh being as robust as a 5g
 
05:08:42.390 --> 05:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
could you see something at an event like
 
05:08:45.590 --> 05:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
that occurring
 
05:08:47.430 --> 05:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
can you i'm sorry can you repeat
 
05:08:47.440 --> 05:08:48.310 align:start position:0%
can you i'm sorry can you repeat
um

05:08:48.310 --> 05:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:49.990 --> 05:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
the uh statement that chair vote said
 
05:08:52.390 --> 05:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to highest uh functionality
 
05:08:55.830 --> 05:08:55.840 align:start position:0%
or what's the word um and
 
05:08:57.990 --> 05:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
so that would imply that maybe we're
 
05:09:00.070 --> 05:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
looking at a 5g situation for time like
 
05:09:02.310 --> 05:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
nelson could you see any company coming
 
05:09:04.628 --> 05:09:04.638 align:start position:0%
in saying we're going to wire nelson for
 
05:09:07.990 --> 05:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
a 4g lte system or is that a thing of
 
05:09:09.270 --> 05:09:09.280 align:start position:0%
the past
 
05:09:10.470 --> 05:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
that opens up a whole different
 
05:09:13.510 --> 05:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
discussion but um
 
05:09:14.948 --> 05:09:14.958 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:09:16.788 --> 05:09:16.798 align:start position:0%
a t
 
05:09:19.510 --> 05:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
has 5g here in new hampshire you know
 
05:09:21.830 --> 05:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
and it's and it's not the
 
05:09:24.948 --> 05:09:24.958 align:start position:0%
the small cell version um it's it's the
 
05:09:27.190 --> 05:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
big cell it's the macro cell so when
 
05:09:28.708 --> 05:09:28.718 align:start position:0%
when we come in
 
05:09:31.910 --> 05:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
today and and put on a new tower um it
 
05:09:33.990 --> 05:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
has to be you know contiguous with where
 
05:09:36.788 --> 05:09:36.798 align:start position:0%
our 5g service is today but we will we
 
05:09:39.590 --> 05:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
will build a 4g lte network and most
 
05:09:42.070 --> 05:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
likely it will have
 
05:09:42.080 --> 05:09:44.550 align:start position:0%
likely it will have
5g

05:09:44.550 --> 05:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
5g
 
05:09:46.550 --> 05:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
already so we're not going to go into
 
05:09:48.150 --> 05:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
nelson and say
 
05:09:50.390 --> 05:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
you know this doesn't warrant 5g we're
 
05:09:52.470 --> 05:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
just going to do 4g
 
05:09:54.948 --> 05:09:54.958 align:start position:0%
and you know we're shutting off our 3g
 
05:09:57.590 --> 05:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
as most everybody else is to make room
 
05:09:59.030 --> 05:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
for the the next
 
05:10:02.070 --> 05:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
iteration so that it really doesn't come
 
05:10:06.470 --> 05:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:08.230 --> 05:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you very much i
 
05:10:10.948 --> 05:10:10.958 align:start position:0%
think we have exhausted our time for
 
05:10:11.990 --> 05:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
05:10:13.670 --> 05:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
05:10:15.910 --> 05:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh we're over by
 
05:10:18.070 --> 05:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
almost 10 minutes we did start 15
 
05:10:19.750 --> 05:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
minutes late so i've been a little bit
 
05:10:21.510 --> 05:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
liberal and
 
05:10:23.270 --> 05:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
adhering to our
 
05:10:24.788 --> 05:10:24.798 align:start position:0%
schedule but i think we're going to call
 
05:10:24.798 --> 05:10:26.470 align:start position:0%
schedule but i think we're going to call
it

05:10:26.470 --> 05:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:10:28.150 --> 05:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
a public hearing for now so i'm going to
 
05:10:30.948 --> 05:10:30.958 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on hb
 
05:10:30.958 --> 05:10:34.070 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on hb
395.

05:10:34.070 --> 05:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:36.868 --> 05:10:36.878 align:start position:0%
blue sheet information please from
 
05:10:39.750 --> 05:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
representative nick williams
 
05:10:42.150 --> 05:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
senate bill 395 seven in support one
 
05:10:44.948 --> 05:10:44.958 align:start position:0%
opposed zero neutral open until midnight
 
05:10:44.958 --> 05:10:46.628 align:start position:0%
opposed zero neutral open until midnight
tonight

05:10:46.628 --> 05:10:46.638 align:start position:0%
tonight
 
05:10:50.070 --> 05:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mick williams
 
05:10:51.270 --> 05:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
so now
 
05:10:52.948 --> 05:10:52.958 align:start position:0%
let's resume
 
05:10:54.550 --> 05:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
the public hearing that i opened a few
 
05:10:56.868 --> 05:10:56.878 align:start position:0%
minutes ago on house bill or senate bill
 
05:10:56.878 --> 05:10:58.390 align:start position:0%
minutes ago on house bill or senate bill
424

05:10:58.390 --> 05:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
424
 
05:11:03.830 --> 05:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
relative to renewable energy and natural
 
05:11:06.628 --> 05:11:06.638 align:start position:0%
and i don't believe that
 
05:11:10.070 --> 05:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
senator brad is here today to
 
05:11:11.750 --> 05:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
introduce this bill even though he's the
 
05:11:13.830 --> 05:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor but i think we have
 
05:11:16.070 --> 05:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
a substitute
 
05:11:18.628 --> 05:11:18.638 align:start position:0%
oh senator bradley is here
 
05:11:22.470 --> 05:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:24.150 --> 05:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
senator bradley welcome it's nice to
 
05:11:26.390 --> 05:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
have you back in st e it's good to see
 
05:11:29.270 --> 05:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:50.070 --> 05:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:52.470 --> 05:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
it's all yours senator okidoke thank you
 
05:11:54.628 --> 05:11:54.638 align:start position:0%
mr chair and
 
05:11:56.470 --> 05:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
05:11:56.480 --> 05:11:58.310 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
um

05:11:58.310 --> 05:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:01.030 --> 05:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
pleased to be here for the record jeb
 
05:12:03.110 --> 05:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
bradley from wolfeboro
 
05:12:06.868 --> 05:12:06.878 align:start position:0%
and the sponsor of senate bill 424 which
 
05:12:09.110 --> 05:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
um passed the senate
 
05:12:13.030 --> 05:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:15.750 --> 05:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
maybe a month ago and obviously here we
 
05:12:15.760 --> 05:12:16.868 align:start position:0%
maybe a month ago and obviously here we
are

05:12:16.868 --> 05:12:16.878 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:12:20.310 --> 05:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
so what this um seeks to do is allow a
 
05:12:23.430 --> 05:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
utility to recover costs
 
05:12:27.190 --> 05:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
if a utility procures um renewable
 
05:12:30.550 --> 05:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:32.788 --> 05:12:32.798 align:start position:0%
and i think that given our energy
 
05:12:32.798 --> 05:12:34.230 align:start position:0%
and i think that given our energy
situation

05:12:34.230 --> 05:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
situation
 
05:12:36.470 --> 05:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
where we're trying to get more and more
 
05:12:39.110 --> 05:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
renewable sources of power
 
05:12:42.708 --> 05:12:42.718 align:start position:0%
um this is a very good although very
 
05:12:42.718 --> 05:12:43.750 align:start position:0%
um this is a very good although very
small

05:12:43.750 --> 05:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
small
 
05:12:46.708 --> 05:12:46.718 align:start position:0%
step in the direction of allowing
 
05:12:50.628 --> 05:12:50.638 align:start position:0%
the possibility of renewable natural gas
 
05:12:53.510 --> 05:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
which would otherwise be emitted into
 
05:12:55.030 --> 05:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
the environment
 
05:12:56.628 --> 05:12:56.638 align:start position:0%
to be captured
 
05:12:59.270 --> 05:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
purified so it meets the same standards
 
05:13:01.670 --> 05:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
as conventional natural gas
 
05:13:04.390 --> 05:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
and then be utilized as a replacement
 
05:13:07.110 --> 05:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
for other natural gas in
 
05:13:10.550 --> 05:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
the existing pipeline infrastructure
 
05:13:13.350 --> 05:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
for natural gas in the state
 
05:13:16.070 --> 05:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
so what can renewable natural gas come
 
05:13:18.390 --> 05:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
from it could be animal waste it could
 
05:13:21.110 --> 05:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
be food waste could be renewable gas
 
05:13:23.510 --> 05:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
from landfills could be low low-grade
 
05:13:23.520 --> 05:13:24.390 align:start position:0%
from landfills could be low low-grade
wood

05:13:24.390 --> 05:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
wood
 
05:13:27.750 --> 05:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:30.628 --> 05:13:30.638 align:start position:0%
it is intended to be a substitute for
 
05:13:32.390 --> 05:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
natural gas
 
05:13:32.400 --> 05:13:33.510 align:start position:0%
natural gas
and

05:13:33.510 --> 05:13:33.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:13:36.470 --> 05:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
it will have i think a number of
 
05:13:39.750 --> 05:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
positive benefits both in terms of jobs
 
05:13:41.990 --> 05:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
but also as i said
 
05:13:44.868 --> 05:13:44.878 align:start position:0%
renewable energy and also
 
05:13:46.550 --> 05:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
and i think this is
 
05:13:48.948 --> 05:13:48.958 align:start position:0%
uh pretty important from
 
05:13:51.110 --> 05:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
an environmental point of view
 
05:13:53.910 --> 05:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
capturing methane emissions methane
 
05:13:55.430 --> 05:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
being one of the
 
05:13:55.440 --> 05:13:57.670 align:start position:0%
being one of the
um

05:13:57.670 --> 05:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:14:01.350 --> 05:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
principal gases and one of the most
 
05:14:01.360 --> 05:14:02.628 align:start position:0%
principal gases and one of the most
damaging

05:14:02.628 --> 05:14:02.638 align:start position:0%
damaging
 
05:14:04.830 --> 05:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
of those in terms
 
05:14:07.350 --> 05:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
of global warming
 
05:14:08.550 --> 05:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
so let me
 
05:14:17.030 --> 05:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:19.350 --> 05:14:19.360 align:start position:0%
try to walk you through the provisions
 
05:14:24.150 --> 05:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:30.550 --> 05:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:33.270 --> 05:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
so in the legislative findings it talks
 
05:14:35.190 --> 05:14:35.200 align:start position:0%
about you know the merits of it
 
05:14:37.430 --> 05:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
obviously which i um
 
05:14:37.440 --> 05:14:39.110 align:start position:0%
obviously which i um
discussed

05:14:39.110 --> 05:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
05:14:42.948 --> 05:14:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:46.628 --> 05:14:46.638 align:start position:0%
call out what's on line 16.
 
05:14:49.190 --> 05:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
this is something that's not mandatory
 
05:14:51.590 --> 05:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
for the public utilities commission to
 
05:14:51.600 --> 05:14:52.628 align:start position:0%
for the public utilities commission to
approve

05:14:52.628 --> 05:14:52.638 align:start position:0%
approve
 
05:14:55.670 --> 05:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
recovery of prudently incurred costs the
 
05:14:56.868 --> 05:14:56.878 align:start position:0%
word may
 
05:14:59.830 --> 05:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
which is very important
 
05:15:01.350 --> 05:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
for the commission to be able to
 
05:15:03.510 --> 05:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
determine the public interest
 
05:15:06.070 --> 05:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
may approve recovery
 
05:15:08.470 --> 05:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
of those costs
 
05:15:08.480 --> 05:15:09.270 align:start position:0%
of those costs
then

05:15:09.270 --> 05:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:15:11.510 --> 05:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
it creates a new chapter with
 
05:15:14.868 --> 05:15:14.878 align:start position:0%
definitions for biogas gasification
 
05:15:17.430 --> 05:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
carbon offsets
 
05:15:19.750 --> 05:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
etc etc
 
05:15:22.150 --> 05:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
i'll skip ahead to
 
05:15:24.470 --> 05:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
what are known as the incremental costs
 
05:15:27.030 --> 05:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
on line nine of the bill
 
05:15:29.590 --> 05:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
it talks about avoidance of conventional
 
05:15:32.390 --> 05:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
gas purchase or development such as
 
05:15:34.310 --> 05:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
avoided pipeline costs or carbon
 
05:15:36.788 --> 05:15:36.798 align:start position:0%
emission reduction costs through the
 
05:15:40.788 --> 05:15:40.798 align:start position:0%
avoidance of capacity costs so these are
 
05:15:42.868 --> 05:15:42.878 align:start position:0%
sort of the price points
 
05:15:45.830 --> 05:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
and how the public utilities commission
 
05:15:48.310 --> 05:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
it would be intended that
 
05:15:50.628 --> 05:15:50.638 align:start position:0%
they would um
 
05:15:53.030 --> 05:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
judge the public interest the standard
 
05:15:53.040 --> 05:15:53.750 align:start position:0%
judge the public interest the standard
for

05:15:53.750 --> 05:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:15:56.628 --> 05:15:56.638 align:start position:0%
approving whether a utility can go
 
05:15:58.948 --> 05:15:58.958 align:start position:0%
forward with
 
05:16:01.670 --> 05:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
this type of scenario
 
05:16:06.470 --> 05:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
jumping down to line 30 on page two
 
05:16:08.310 --> 05:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
again it says
 
05:16:12.150 --> 05:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
very clearly the commission may approve
 
05:16:14.628 --> 05:16:14.638 align:start position:0%
upon a filing of a petition by a gas
 
05:16:17.910 --> 05:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
utility recovery of costs
 
05:16:19.750 --> 05:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
including the use
 
05:16:22.788 --> 05:16:22.798 align:start position:0%
of an associated cost recovery mechanism
 
05:16:25.030 --> 05:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
but only
 
05:16:27.270 --> 05:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
if it's in the public interest and again
 
05:16:30.150 --> 05:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
the public interest has to take in to
 
05:16:32.310 --> 05:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
affect things like the environmental
 
05:16:32.320 --> 05:16:33.510 align:start position:0%
affect things like the environmental
impact

05:16:33.510 --> 05:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
impact
 
05:16:36.948 --> 05:16:36.958 align:start position:0%
the energy reliability the cost to
 
05:16:39.430 --> 05:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
consumers all of those things have to be
 
05:16:39.440 --> 05:16:40.868 align:start position:0%
consumers all of those things have to be
adjudicated

05:16:40.868 --> 05:16:40.878 align:start position:0%
adjudicated
 
05:16:44.948 --> 05:16:44.958 align:start position:0%
by the public utilities commission
 
05:16:47.270 --> 05:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
important to note on the top of page
 
05:16:50.070 --> 05:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
three how it outlines the monetary
 
05:16:52.628 --> 05:16:52.638 align:start position:0%
benefits of the proposal to utility
 
05:16:55.750 --> 05:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
customers as well as the environmental
 
05:16:58.150 --> 05:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
attributes and carbon offsets all of
 
05:16:58.160 --> 05:16:59.750 align:start position:0%
attributes and carbon offsets all of
which

05:16:59.750 --> 05:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:17:02.310 --> 05:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
constitute what the public utilities
 
05:17:02.320 --> 05:17:04.150 align:start position:0%
constitute what the public utilities
commission

05:17:04.150 --> 05:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
commission
 
05:17:06.788 --> 05:17:06.798 align:start position:0%
would look at in terms of determining
 
05:17:10.230 --> 05:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:12.230 --> 05:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
starting on line four
 
05:17:12.240 --> 05:17:12.948 align:start position:0%
starting on line four
it

05:17:12.948 --> 05:17:12.958 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:17:15.750 --> 05:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
this was something that was added in the
 
05:17:17.270 --> 05:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
senate process
 
05:17:19.590 --> 05:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
that the proposal advances the
 
05:17:23.750 --> 05:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
objectives of state energy policy
 
05:17:26.788 --> 05:17:26.798 align:start position:0%
including consumer choice and improving
 
05:17:29.030 --> 05:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
the gas system resiliency and
 
05:17:29.040 --> 05:17:30.628 align:start position:0%
the gas system resiliency and
diversification

05:17:30.628 --> 05:17:30.638 align:start position:0%
diversification
 
05:17:33.510 --> 05:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
all things that
 
05:17:34.470 --> 05:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
we should
 
05:17:37.030 --> 05:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
at least in my opinion favor
 
05:17:40.628 --> 05:17:40.638 align:start position:0%
also added in the process um
 
05:17:42.708 --> 05:17:42.718 align:start position:0%
on line eight and nine
 
05:17:45.110 --> 05:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
and ten is a competitive
 
05:17:47.270 --> 05:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
um bidding process
 
05:17:51.110 --> 05:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
um that has to be through consultation
 
05:17:53.110 --> 05:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
with the department of energy in terms
 
05:17:55.510 --> 05:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
of rfps
 
05:17:58.470 --> 05:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
05:17:58.480 --> 05:18:01.830 align:start position:0%
and then um
lastly

05:18:01.830 --> 05:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:04.550 --> 05:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
there is a five percent cap on a
 
05:18:07.350 --> 05:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
utility's total gas volume so as i
 
05:18:09.350 --> 05:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
started out in the beginning
 
05:18:11.190 --> 05:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
this is meant to be
 
05:18:13.670 --> 05:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
a pilot program but an ongoing pilot
 
05:18:15.590 --> 05:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
program i think you will hear from the
 
05:18:18.230 --> 05:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
utilities as the senate heard from the
 
05:18:20.708 --> 05:18:20.718 align:start position:0%
utilities that this is
 
05:18:23.350 --> 05:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
um not only an emerging technology but a
 
05:18:26.070 --> 05:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
viable technology and something that
 
05:18:29.030 --> 05:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
should be workable so happy to mr chair
 
05:18:34.390 --> 05:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:35.990 --> 05:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you senator questions for the
 
05:18:40.230 --> 05:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:42.708 --> 05:18:42.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
05:18:42.718 --> 05:18:45.110 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
um

05:18:45.110 --> 05:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:48.390 --> 05:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
do you do you see this bill as
 
05:18:50.788 --> 05:18:50.798 align:start position:0%
a viable um
 
05:18:52.550 --> 05:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
option to
 
05:18:55.590 --> 05:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
replacing the need for extra natural gas
 
05:18:58.150 --> 05:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
to be imported into the state
 
05:19:01.510 --> 05:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
and would would it be competitive enough
 
05:19:01.520 --> 05:19:02.948 align:start position:0%
and would would it be competitive enough
financially

05:19:02.948 --> 05:19:02.958 align:start position:0%
financially
 
05:19:05.190 --> 05:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
to compete with that well first of all
 
05:19:06.948 --> 05:19:06.958 align:start position:0%
representative uh thank you for your
 
05:19:09.190 --> 05:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
sponsorship of the bill i appreciate
 
05:19:10.550 --> 05:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
that very much
 
05:19:10.560 --> 05:19:12.230 align:start position:0%
that very much
um

05:19:12.230 --> 05:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:13.590 --> 05:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
you know i think those are questions
 
05:19:15.350 --> 05:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
that get answered through the process i
 
05:19:17.510 --> 05:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
mean at a five percent cap
 
05:19:17.520 --> 05:19:18.788 align:start position:0%
mean at a five percent cap
um

05:19:18.788 --> 05:19:18.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:18.798 --> 05:19:19.830 align:start position:0%
um
we

05:19:19.830 --> 05:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:19:21.910 --> 05:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
a get an opportunity to determine what
 
05:19:23.910 --> 05:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
the supply is what the cost is what the
 
05:19:23.920 --> 05:19:25.270 align:start position:0%
the supply is what the cost is what the
infrastructure

05:19:25.270 --> 05:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
05:19:26.948 --> 05:19:26.958 align:start position:0%
is needed to
 
05:19:26.958 --> 05:19:29.030 align:start position:0%
is needed to
um

05:19:29.030 --> 05:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:31.350 --> 05:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
you know be able to produce this
 
05:19:34.788 --> 05:19:34.798 align:start position:0%
and then you know assess it based on its
 
05:19:38.230 --> 05:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
carbon offsets especially if the
 
05:19:40.788 --> 05:19:40.798 align:start position:0%
bill uses methane so
 
05:19:42.628 --> 05:19:42.638 align:start position:0%
i don't know that we can answer those
 
05:19:44.628 --> 05:19:44.638 align:start position:0%
questions today but i do
 
05:19:46.390 --> 05:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
think that um
 
05:19:48.470 --> 05:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
this is definitely technology worth
 
05:19:51.270 --> 05:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
exploring it's the time is now to do it
 
05:19:53.350 --> 05:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
and i think it could lead in those
 
05:19:55.350 --> 05:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
directions if there's adequate supply
 
05:19:57.350 --> 05:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
and the cost is reasonable the only way
 
05:20:08.150 --> 05:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:09.590 --> 05:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
it's okay
 
05:20:11.830 --> 05:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative miggy has a question
 
05:20:13.350 --> 05:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair i'm not a
 
05:20:13.360 --> 05:20:15.190 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chair i'm not a
co-sponsor

05:20:15.190 --> 05:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor
 
05:20:16.708 --> 05:20:16.718 align:start position:0%
what does that mean you can ask me
 
05:20:19.270 --> 05:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
questions if co-sponsors can't
 
05:20:22.628 --> 05:20:22.638 align:start position:0%
well we we usually limit yeah anyhow
 
05:20:24.390 --> 05:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's up to the chair
 
05:20:24.400 --> 05:20:25.910 align:start position:0%
that's that's up to the chair
um

05:20:25.910 --> 05:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:27.990 --> 05:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
my question is around you mentioned
 
05:20:29.590 --> 05:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
as you started your testimony that it's
 
05:20:33.350 --> 05:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
just a small amount of gas necessarily
 
05:20:35.430 --> 05:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
and i think the concern that i had in
 
05:20:38.628 --> 05:20:38.638 align:start position:0%
reading through the bill is that we are
 
05:20:41.110 --> 05:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
setting it up so that there's a rate
 
05:20:41.120 --> 05:20:42.548 align:start position:0%
setting it up so that there's a rate
payer

05:20:42.548 --> 05:20:42.558 align:start position:0%
payer
 
05:20:42.558 --> 05:20:43.990 align:start position:0%
payer
reimbursement

05:20:43.990 --> 05:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
05:20:44.000 --> 05:20:46.470 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
to

05:20:46.470 --> 05:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:46.480 --> 05:20:47.510 align:start position:0%
 
gas

05:20:47.510 --> 05:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
gas
 
05:20:50.230 --> 05:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
companies for procuring their gas from
 
05:20:51.670 --> 05:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
these sites
 
05:20:53.510 --> 05:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
and yet there doesn't seem to be
 
05:20:58.070 --> 05:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:00.470 --> 05:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
any types of
 
05:21:02.628 --> 05:21:02.638 align:start position:0%
specificity around offsets or the
 
05:21:04.548 --> 05:21:04.558 align:start position:0%
expectation that this we're calling it
 
05:21:07.830 --> 05:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
renewable but do we have any idea if if
 
05:21:10.150 --> 05:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
these sites are already emitting methane
 
05:21:11.830 --> 05:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
how much how much we're going to
 
05:21:14.150 --> 05:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
actually be
 
05:21:17.190 --> 05:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
sequestering or capturing or using and
 
05:21:19.190 --> 05:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
um and whether it's actually going to be
 
05:21:20.948 --> 05:21:20.958 align:start position:0%
that benefit that we're saying it is
 
05:21:23.830 --> 05:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
well again and and i have to
 
05:21:25.830 --> 05:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
you know give a shout out to
 
05:21:28.150 --> 05:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
my friend from portsmouth
 
05:21:29.830 --> 05:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
who's not a co-sponsor of the bill but
 
05:21:31.190 --> 05:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be able to ask me a
 
05:21:33.190 --> 05:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
question about the red sox getting
 
05:21:35.030 --> 05:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
shellac two out of three times that's
 
05:21:37.830 --> 05:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
what this card is about
 
05:21:39.670 --> 05:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
by the yankees
 
05:21:42.230 --> 05:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
representative pitz's favorite team so
 
05:21:43.830 --> 05:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
to get back to your question i think
 
05:21:44.868 --> 05:21:44.878 align:start position:0%
again is
 
05:21:46.470 --> 05:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh the question for representative
 
05:21:49.350 --> 05:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
sosmich that's what um
 
05:21:51.830 --> 05:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
you know a pilot program at five percent
 
05:21:54.070 --> 05:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
i think helps answer those questions
 
05:21:56.070 --> 05:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
especially in terms of you know the
 
05:21:56.080 --> 05:21:57.190 align:start position:0%
especially in terms of you know the
methane

05:21:57.190 --> 05:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
methane
 
05:21:57.200 --> 05:21:58.230 align:start position:0%
methane
um

05:21:58.230 --> 05:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:00.390 --> 05:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
that could come from animal waste or
 
05:22:02.548 --> 05:22:02.558 align:start position:0%
from landfills that that
 
05:22:05.110 --> 05:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
is an ongoing situation but if it can be
 
05:22:07.430 --> 05:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
utilized and utilized in a cost
 
05:22:10.150 --> 05:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
effective and environmentally acceptable
 
05:22:11.990 --> 05:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
way i think that
 
05:22:14.868 --> 05:22:14.878 align:start position:0%
is helpful i agree i agree but i think
 
05:22:18.150 --> 05:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
my my concern or my question is there's
 
05:22:18.160 --> 05:22:19.270 align:start position:0%
my my concern or my question is there's
nothing

05:22:19.270 --> 05:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
05:22:21.750 --> 05:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
specific in the bill about the level of
 
05:22:23.350 --> 05:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
accountability that's required or the
 
05:22:25.190 --> 05:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
level of emissions reductions that would
 
05:22:27.430 --> 05:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
be required to make it a benefit and you
 
05:22:29.190 --> 05:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
i think what you're saying is
 
05:22:31.270 --> 05:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to go in by defining the
 
05:22:32.788 --> 05:22:32.798 align:start position:0%
fact that the rate payers will be
 
05:22:34.548 --> 05:22:34.558 align:start position:0%
helping with whatever infrastructure is
 
05:22:36.948 --> 05:22:36.958 align:start position:0%
required in order to create a site that
 
05:22:39.110 --> 05:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
would that would function but we're not
 
05:22:42.230 --> 05:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
requiring at the same time or trying to
 
05:22:42.240 --> 05:22:43.350 align:start position:0%
requiring at the same time or trying to
define

05:22:43.350 --> 05:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
define
 
05:22:45.430 --> 05:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
what kind of benefit we will be getting
 
05:22:47.590 --> 05:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
from the site or in order to make those
 
05:22:49.590 --> 05:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
investments i would partially agree with
 
05:22:51.270 --> 05:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
you and partially disagree with you
 
05:22:54.310 --> 05:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
there's no specificity in terms of the
 
05:22:54.320 --> 05:22:55.430 align:start position:0%
there's no specificity in terms of the
um

05:22:55.430 --> 05:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:58.708 --> 05:22:58.718 align:start position:0%
amount of offsets but at the same time
 
05:23:01.270 --> 05:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
the fact that offsets are referred to
 
05:23:03.430 --> 05:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
and that there has to be a public
 
05:23:06.230 --> 05:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
interest determination which means
 
05:23:08.470 --> 05:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
net benefits of
 
05:23:11.750 --> 05:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
cost environmental reliability
 
05:23:13.910 --> 05:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
those things that the public utilities
 
05:23:13.920 --> 05:23:15.190 align:start position:0%
those things that the public utilities
commission

05:23:15.190 --> 05:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
commission
 
05:23:18.470 --> 05:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
takes into account i think that you can
 
05:23:21.110 --> 05:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
make a pretty clear argument
 
05:23:21.120 --> 05:23:22.628 align:start position:0%
make a pretty clear argument
if

05:23:22.628 --> 05:23:22.638 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:23:24.948 --> 05:23:24.958 align:start position:0%
you are just arguing on an environmental
 
05:23:27.910 --> 05:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
ground when a utility makes a filing
 
05:23:30.390 --> 05:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
before the public utilities commission
 
05:23:30.400 --> 05:23:31.830 align:start position:0%
before the public utilities commission
or

05:23:31.830 --> 05:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:23:33.750 --> 05:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
environmental groups which intervene at
 
05:23:34.948 --> 05:23:34.958 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
05:23:34.958 --> 05:23:36.788 align:start position:0%
the commission
that

05:23:36.788 --> 05:23:36.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:23:38.948 --> 05:23:38.958 align:start position:0%
in order to meet the public interest
 
05:23:41.750 --> 05:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
standard there has to be that you know
 
05:23:43.270 --> 05:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
level of
 
05:23:45.910 --> 05:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
um offsets without the bill
 
05:23:48.788 --> 05:23:48.798 align:start position:0%
taking a hard and fast position that
 
05:23:50.628 --> 05:23:50.638 align:start position:0%
might undermine
 
05:23:52.788 --> 05:23:52.798 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to go forward with this
 
05:23:55.270 --> 05:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
because again
 
05:23:57.430 --> 05:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes we don't know we don't know
 
05:24:01.190 --> 05:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
and that's why it's small to start with
 
05:24:03.030 --> 05:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
okay okay representative mirner is
 
05:24:04.948 --> 05:24:04.958 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question thank you
 
05:24:06.708 --> 05:24:06.718 align:start position:0%
senator bradley um about a year and a
 
05:24:08.708 --> 05:24:08.718 align:start position:0%
half ago a company i think they're out
 
05:24:09.750 --> 05:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
of france
 
05:24:11.750 --> 05:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
was looking at a low-grade wood gas
 
05:24:13.990 --> 05:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
plant in the north country it's been an
 
05:24:15.750 --> 05:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
ongoing discussion with business and
 
05:24:17.750 --> 05:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
economic affairs
 
05:24:18.868 --> 05:24:18.878 align:start position:0%
now they're using two sites you're
 
05:24:20.150 --> 05:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
looking at one in vermont over the
 
05:24:22.948 --> 05:24:22.958 align:start position:0%
border but it's my point is any of this
 
05:24:24.708 --> 05:24:24.718 align:start position:0%
would this benefit that project that
 
05:24:26.548 --> 05:24:26.558 align:start position:0%
kind of fell through up there right now
 
05:24:29.430 --> 05:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
that's on hold it could i mean obviously
 
05:24:31.270 --> 05:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
biomass is cited from the bill the
 
05:24:34.230 --> 05:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
technology is emerging as i understand
 
05:24:36.948 --> 05:24:36.958 align:start position:0%
it correct so it could be helpful
 
05:24:38.788 --> 05:24:38.798 align:start position:0%
it would have to depend on
 
05:24:40.948 --> 05:24:40.958 align:start position:0%
you know proximity to pipelines and
 
05:24:42.788 --> 05:24:42.798 align:start position:0%
things like that to make it economical
 
05:24:47.590 --> 05:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:50.070 --> 05:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
okay further questions for the senator
 
05:24:51.990 --> 05:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh could you hold it for someone else we
 
05:24:53.430 --> 05:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
have six other people who would like to
 
05:24:55.430 --> 05:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill bill
 
05:24:56.948 --> 05:24:56.958 align:start position:0%
so senator bradley i know you're very
 
05:24:59.190 --> 05:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
busy we'll we really thank you for being
 
05:25:00.708 --> 05:25:00.718 align:start position:0%
here to introduce the bill but let you
 
05:25:03.350 --> 05:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
go so you can get on to other things
 
05:25:05.350 --> 05:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
and we'll see you again tomorrow
 
05:25:10.070 --> 05:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:11.910 --> 05:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
maybe the red sox will win tonight and
 
05:25:13.910 --> 05:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
the yankees will lose and then we'll be
 
05:25:13.920 --> 05:25:15.270 align:start position:0%
the yankees will lose and then we'll be
tied

05:25:15.270 --> 05:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
tied
 
05:25:16.628 --> 05:25:16.638 align:start position:0%
let's hope so
 
05:25:18.150 --> 05:25:18.160 align:start position:0%
all right next i'd like to hear from the
 
05:25:30.548 --> 05:25:30.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:31.990 --> 05:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman vos members of the
 
05:25:34.150 --> 05:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
committee for the record griffin roberge
 
05:25:37.430 --> 05:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire department of energy um
 
05:25:41.510 --> 05:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
department is neutral on senate bill 424
 
05:25:43.110 --> 05:25:43.120 align:start position:0%
just by way of background the department
 
05:25:44.868 --> 05:25:44.878 align:start position:0%
did work with senator bradley an
 
05:25:47.350 --> 05:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
interested stakeholders in the senate on
 
05:25:49.110 --> 05:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
an amendment that addressed all the
 
05:25:51.350 --> 05:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
department's technical concerns uh with
 
05:25:54.150 --> 05:25:54.160 align:start position:0%
the bill's language
 
05:25:54.160 --> 05:25:54.868 align:start position:0%
the bill's language
so

05:25:54.868 --> 05:25:54.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:25:58.070 --> 05:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
we don't have any at this time uh any we
 
05:25:59.510 --> 05:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
don't have any technical concerns with
 
05:26:00.708 --> 05:26:00.718 align:start position:0%
the bill so
 
05:26:02.628 --> 05:26:02.638 align:start position:0%
really with that uh they'll conclude my
 
05:26:05.270 --> 05:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
testimony and i'll certainly answer any
 
05:26:09.910 --> 05:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:12.628 --> 05:26:12.638 align:start position:0%
could you speak briefly about the fiscal
 
05:26:14.390 --> 05:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
note did you and the rest of the
 
05:26:15.990 --> 05:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
department have anything to do with the
 
05:26:18.150 --> 05:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
construction of the fiscal note yes uh
 
05:26:21.750 --> 05:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
we did um construct the fiscal note um i
 
05:26:23.590 --> 05:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
believe committee members should have
 
05:26:25.590 --> 05:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note as amended by the senate
 
05:26:27.190 --> 05:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
so it was amended
 
05:26:28.980 --> 05:26:28.990 align:start position:0%
3 7 22
 
05:26:28.990 --> 05:26:30.470 align:start position:0%
3 7 22
[Music]

05:26:30.470 --> 05:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:26:32.470 --> 05:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
obviously as senator bradley alluded to
 
05:26:33.990 --> 05:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
the bill authorizes the recovery of
 
05:26:36.470 --> 05:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
costs related to utilities procurement
 
05:26:40.150 --> 05:26:40.160 align:start position:0%
of natural gas upon approval by the puc
 
05:26:42.948 --> 05:26:42.958 align:start position:0%
there is language in the bill
 
05:26:46.390 --> 05:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
specifically on page three of the bill
 
05:26:48.470 --> 05:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
lines eight
 
05:26:50.470 --> 05:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
and lines fourteen
 
05:26:52.390 --> 05:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
um requires the
 
05:26:55.110 --> 05:26:55.120 align:start position:0%
department to review all the requests
 
05:26:56.150 --> 05:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
for a
 
05:26:57.990 --> 05:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
request for proposals for renewable
 
05:27:00.470 --> 05:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
natural gas supply
 
05:27:02.150 --> 05:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
and on line 14
 
05:27:04.310 --> 05:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
again because it's kind of a pilot
 
05:27:04.320 --> 05:27:05.510 align:start position:0%
again because it's kind of a pilot
program

05:27:05.510 --> 05:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:27:07.350 --> 05:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
the department of energy in consultation
 
05:27:09.430 --> 05:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
with the gas utilities will study each
 
05:27:11.190 --> 05:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
utility's renewable natural gas
 
05:27:11.200 --> 05:27:12.390 align:start position:0%
utility's renewable natural gas
contracts

05:27:12.390 --> 05:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
05:27:12.400 --> 05:27:14.708 align:start position:0%
contracts
um

05:27:14.708 --> 05:27:14.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:16.708 --> 05:27:16.718 align:start position:0%
oh i apologize where i'm i'm looking
 
05:27:20.628 --> 05:27:20.638 align:start position:0%
specifically on page three of the bill
 
05:27:22.830 --> 05:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
line 14 i'm
 
05:27:26.470 --> 05:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
sorry page three line 14. so um the
 
05:27:28.390 --> 05:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
department of energy is required to
 
05:27:30.470 --> 05:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
study each utilities renewable natural
 
05:27:32.868 --> 05:27:32.878 align:start position:0%
gas contracts if they do obviously enter
 
05:27:35.590 --> 05:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
into those contracts um the study shall
 
05:27:37.670 --> 05:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
begin three years of the effective date
 
05:27:39.590 --> 05:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
the study includes various factors such
 
05:27:41.990 --> 05:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
as market terms price conditions
 
05:27:45.190 --> 05:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
economic benefits etc etc
 
05:27:46.470 --> 05:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
the department
 
05:27:48.390 --> 05:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
shall generate that report deliver its
 
05:27:50.708 --> 05:27:50.718 align:start position:0%
findings to the speaker senate president
 
05:27:53.110 --> 05:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
house clerk senate clerk puc
 
05:27:54.788 --> 05:27:54.798 align:start position:0%
um and the cost of the study would be
 
05:27:58.070 --> 05:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
funded by a special assessment um on the
 
05:28:00.628 --> 05:28:00.638 align:start position:0%
utility and utilities purchasing this
 
05:28:00.638 --> 05:28:01.670 align:start position:0%
utility and utilities purchasing this
rng

05:28:01.670 --> 05:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
rng
 
05:28:03.430 --> 05:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
um the department estimates that the
 
05:28:05.590 --> 05:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
study will cost roughly 25 thousand
 
05:28:07.750 --> 05:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
dollars due uh to complete due to the
 
05:28:09.350 --> 05:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
need for outside consultants and
 
05:28:09.360 --> 05:28:10.470 align:start position:0%
need for outside consultants and
analysts

05:28:10.470 --> 05:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
analysts
 
05:28:13.430 --> 05:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
um again that cost would be covered by
 
05:28:15.430 --> 05:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
special assessment on the natural gas
 
05:28:18.548 --> 05:28:18.558 align:start position:0%
utilities that elect to procure rng
 
05:28:18.558 --> 05:28:19.350 align:start position:0%
utilities that elect to procure rng
um

05:28:19.350 --> 05:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:23.750 --> 05:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:25.750 --> 05:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
i'm referencing the fiscal note here now
 
05:28:28.470 --> 05:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry um aside from the recovery of
 
05:28:30.070 --> 05:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
the cost of the study
 
05:28:31.750 --> 05:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
the department does not
 
05:28:34.628 --> 05:28:34.638 align:start position:0%
expect any impact on state county or
 
05:28:36.788 --> 05:28:36.798 align:start position:0%
local revenue
 
05:28:39.030 --> 05:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
you know that might change due to
 
05:28:41.350 --> 05:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
whether or not a state county or union
 
05:28:43.510 --> 05:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
of local government is a customer of you
 
05:28:45.270 --> 05:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
of a gas utility and elects to purchase
 
05:28:45.280 --> 05:28:46.310 align:start position:0%
of a gas utility and elects to purchase
rng

05:28:46.310 --> 05:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
rng
 
05:28:46.320 --> 05:28:47.110 align:start position:0%
rng
um

05:28:47.110 --> 05:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:49.430 --> 05:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
but that's essentially
 
05:28:51.590 --> 05:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
it um certainly willing to answer any
 
05:28:54.628 --> 05:28:54.638 align:start position:0%
questions thank you questions for uh
 
05:28:56.948 --> 05:28:56.958 align:start position:0%
representative harrington is
 
05:28:58.788 --> 05:28:58.798 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you mr chairman i think
 
05:29:01.990 --> 05:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
you're taking my question i guess um
 
05:29:03.670 --> 05:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
my first position my first question
 
05:29:06.070 --> 05:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
would be uh was anyone from the puc do
 
05:29:07.270 --> 05:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
you know if they were involved in this
 
05:29:08.868 --> 05:29:08.878 align:start position:0%
bill at all and if they have an opinion
 
05:29:10.628 --> 05:29:10.638 align:start position:0%
on it one way or the other i i can't
 
05:29:13.590 --> 05:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
speak to that um i don't know i don't
 
05:29:13.600 --> 05:29:14.310 align:start position:0%
speak to that um i don't know i don't
know

05:29:14.310 --> 05:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:29:16.708 --> 05:29:16.718 align:start position:0%
off the top now follow follow up
 
05:29:19.350 --> 05:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh it appears what's being done here is
 
05:29:21.430 --> 05:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
that the puc will have some adjudicative
 
05:29:23.270 --> 05:29:23.280 align:start position:0%
process and will decide yes or no and
 
05:29:26.150 --> 05:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
allow the uh utility to go out and
 
05:29:29.190 --> 05:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
procure this uh renewable natural gas
 
05:29:31.110 --> 05:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
then in the future the department of
 
05:29:33.270 --> 05:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
energy is going to be reviewing that and
 
05:29:35.510 --> 05:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
making some determination of how whether
 
05:29:37.670 --> 05:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
the whether it's working
 
05:29:40.868 --> 05:29:40.878 align:start position:0%
so and that goes back to the puc
 
05:29:42.150 --> 05:29:42.160 align:start position:0%
but basically they already said they
 
05:29:43.750 --> 05:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
thought it was a good idea so this is
 
05:29:44.788 --> 05:29:44.798 align:start position:0%
like a
 
05:29:46.868 --> 05:29:46.878 align:start position:0%
a post review that they'll be doing and
 
05:29:49.350 --> 05:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
advising the puc on it
 
05:29:50.628 --> 05:29:50.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question represent i
 
05:29:52.868 --> 05:29:52.878 align:start position:0%
guess i wouldn't say it's necessarily
 
05:29:56.150 --> 05:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
well the report as outlined on page 14
 
05:29:58.150 --> 05:29:58.160 align:start position:0%
would go to the puc but obviously
 
05:30:00.150 --> 05:30:00.160 align:start position:0%
because this is a new concept i believe
 
05:30:01.750 --> 05:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
the intent here and i certainly don't
 
05:30:04.070 --> 05:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
want to speak for the sponsor uh but i'm
 
05:30:05.110 --> 05:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
going to
 
05:30:08.230 --> 05:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
so um is maybe to inform policymakers
 
05:30:09.750 --> 05:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
such as yourselves as to how this
 
05:30:12.708 --> 05:30:12.718 align:start position:0%
program is working uh um and everything
 
05:30:14.310 --> 05:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
like that to the extent that gas
 
05:30:16.948 --> 05:30:16.958 align:start position:0%
utilities do want to petition the puc
 
05:30:18.788 --> 05:30:18.798 align:start position:0%
for recovery of these costs i just it's
 
05:30:21.350 --> 05:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
the first time that i'm aware of that
 
05:30:23.830 --> 05:30:23.840 align:start position:0%
we're having one department review
 
05:30:26.470 --> 05:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
another department's work and say what
 
05:30:28.310 --> 05:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
you did was either good or bad yeah i
 
05:30:30.310 --> 05:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
mean it's kind of unique yeah and i
 
05:30:31.830 --> 05:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
don't think it's it's i don't think the
 
05:30:33.750 --> 05:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
report is necessarily saying this is a
 
05:30:35.350 --> 05:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
good thing or a bad thing i think it's
 
05:30:37.190 --> 05:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
just more of an inclusive study looking
 
05:30:39.270 --> 05:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
at various factors related to this type
 
05:30:41.190 --> 05:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
of pilot program
 
05:30:42.470 --> 05:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
and obviously that report would be
 
05:30:44.070 --> 05:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
generated and delivered to legislators
 
05:30:46.150 --> 05:30:46.160 align:start position:0%
the governor puc to review and things
 
05:30:49.270 --> 05:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
like that all right thank you thank you
 
05:30:51.590 --> 05:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
additional questions representative
 
05:30:53.750 --> 05:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
mcgee has a question
 
05:30:55.590 --> 05:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you mr
 
05:30:57.910 --> 05:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
robert for taking my question
 
05:30:59.910 --> 05:30:59.920 align:start position:0%
um in looking at the language that you
 
05:31:03.110 --> 05:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
referred to that starts on 14 and then
 
05:31:04.948 --> 05:31:04.958 align:start position:0%
goes on
 
05:31:05.990 --> 05:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
05:31:08.788 --> 05:31:08.798 align:start position:0%
sentence that starts on 16 says the
 
05:31:10.470 --> 05:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
study shall include but not be limited
 
05:31:12.310 --> 05:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
to market term price conditions
 
05:31:14.628 --> 05:31:14.638 align:start position:0%
availability service quality economic
 
05:31:14.638 --> 05:31:15.910 align:start position:0%
availability service quality economic
benefits

05:31:15.910 --> 05:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
05:31:17.430 --> 05:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
and it goes on
 
05:31:19.030 --> 05:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
the thing that i'm concerned about is
 
05:31:19.040 --> 05:31:21.350 align:start position:0%
the thing that i'm concerned about is
that

05:31:21.350 --> 05:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:22.948 --> 05:31:22.958 align:start position:0%
up until this point
 
05:31:25.830 --> 05:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
renewables uh referred to
 
05:31:25.840 --> 05:31:26.788 align:start position:0%
renewables uh referred to
um

05:31:26.788 --> 05:31:26.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:28.868 --> 05:31:28.878 align:start position:0%
non-emitting sources that we could use
 
05:31:30.708 --> 05:31:30.718 align:start position:0%
to procure energy and they were in a you
 
05:31:33.110 --> 05:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
know separate category and
 
05:31:35.510 --> 05:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
and now we're using the word renewable
 
05:31:35.520 --> 05:31:36.470 align:start position:0%
and now we're using the word renewable
for

05:31:36.470 --> 05:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:31:38.070 --> 05:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
natural gas
 
05:31:38.080 --> 05:31:39.350 align:start position:0%
natural gas
um

05:31:39.350 --> 05:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:41.750 --> 05:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
to elicit them
 
05:31:44.390 --> 05:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
to to elicit that
 
05:31:47.030 --> 05:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
source from a new it's a new source but
 
05:31:49.030 --> 05:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
just like a fracked well i mean
 
05:31:51.350 --> 05:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
it's a limited amount of gas that can be
 
05:31:54.548 --> 05:31:54.558 align:start position:0%
secured and procured and sold yes
 
05:31:57.110 --> 05:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
so it's it's not dissimilar it's just a
 
05:31:58.628 --> 05:31:58.638 align:start position:0%
different source
 
05:32:00.470 --> 05:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
and so my question is
 
05:32:02.310 --> 05:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
this list does not include again
 
05:32:04.548 --> 05:32:04.558 align:start position:0%
anything about the environment which is
 
05:32:06.548 --> 05:32:06.558 align:start position:0%
the kind of point of having the
 
05:32:08.548 --> 05:32:08.558 align:start position:0%
renewable source that puts it in a
 
05:32:11.110 --> 05:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
different category so i'm concerned that
 
05:32:11.120 --> 05:32:12.548 align:start position:0%
different category so i'm concerned that
we're

05:32:12.548 --> 05:32:12.558 align:start position:0%
we're
 
05:32:15.270 --> 05:32:15.280 align:start position:0%
we're using this terminology to talk
 
05:32:18.548 --> 05:32:18.558 align:start position:0%
about gas that continues to emit
 
05:32:21.350 --> 05:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
without listing
 
05:32:22.788 --> 05:32:22.798 align:start position:0%
what what i would think would be a
 
05:32:25.510 --> 05:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
primary um
 
05:32:28.230 --> 05:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
primary point that we would want to be
 
05:32:30.310 --> 05:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
assessing which is whether or not there
 
05:32:32.548 --> 05:32:32.558 align:start position:0%
is an environmental benefit to securing
 
05:32:34.628 --> 05:32:34.638 align:start position:0%
the gas in this way
 
05:32:38.070 --> 05:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
that that's really my question is
 
05:32:39.430 --> 05:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in here saying that
 
05:32:41.830 --> 05:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
you're going to be looking over
 
05:32:43.430 --> 05:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
how well anybody that's going to be
 
05:32:45.750 --> 05:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
procuring this gas for their own benefit
 
05:32:47.510 --> 05:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
with rate payers paying for the
 
05:32:47.520 --> 05:32:48.948 align:start position:0%
with rate payers paying for the
infrastructure

05:32:48.948 --> 05:32:48.958 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
05:32:50.230 --> 05:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
05:32:51.990 --> 05:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
there's an environmental aspect here
 
05:32:53.350 --> 05:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
that is going to be looked at by the
 
05:32:54.788 --> 05:32:54.798 align:start position:0%
department or department of
 
05:32:57.350 --> 05:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
environmental services or anyone
 
05:32:59.190 --> 05:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
the fact that it's not listed i think is
 
05:33:00.628 --> 05:33:00.638 align:start position:0%
seems like a real oversight with a
 
05:33:01.910 --> 05:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
project like this
 
05:33:03.670 --> 05:33:03.680 align:start position:0%
sure sure and thank you very much for
 
05:33:05.830 --> 05:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
the question representative you know i
 
05:33:05.840 --> 05:33:06.628 align:start position:0%
the question representative you know i
again

05:33:06.628 --> 05:33:06.638 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:33:08.230 --> 05:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
much of what the department did in the
 
05:33:09.830 --> 05:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
senate was just addressed technical
 
05:33:11.110 --> 05:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
concerns with the bill we weren't
 
05:33:12.230 --> 05:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily in the position of
 
05:33:14.948 --> 05:33:14.958 align:start position:0%
advocating uh you know
 
05:33:17.110 --> 05:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
specific directions of the bill or
 
05:33:18.230 --> 05:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
anything like that just to make sure
 
05:33:19.670 --> 05:33:19.680 align:start position:0%
that if this bill were to move forward
 
05:33:22.230 --> 05:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
that it operated appropriately i think
 
05:33:24.230 --> 05:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
if you know to the extent policy makers
 
05:33:26.628 --> 05:33:26.638 align:start position:0%
want to have a specific study looking at
 
05:33:28.070 --> 05:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts obviously that's a
 
05:33:30.470 --> 05:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
call for uh this committee to make and
 
05:33:32.708 --> 05:33:32.718 align:start position:0%
obviously if that's something um that
 
05:33:34.310 --> 05:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
you want to ask more about i encourage
 
05:33:35.990 --> 05:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
you to reach out to the the bill's
 
05:33:38.150 --> 05:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
sponsors or the uh follow-ups
 
05:33:38.160 --> 05:33:39.670 align:start position:0%
sponsors or the uh follow-ups
stakeholders

05:33:39.670 --> 05:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
05:33:41.270 --> 05:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
yes i think
 
05:33:43.510 --> 05:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
sort of what i'm getting at is that
 
05:33:43.520 --> 05:33:44.390 align:start position:0%
sort of what i'm getting at is that
we're

05:33:44.390 --> 05:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
we're
 
05:33:46.788 --> 05:33:46.798 align:start position:0%
taking a terminology and we're applying
 
05:33:49.030 --> 05:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
it here to this new type of project
 
05:33:50.390 --> 05:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
right renewable
 
05:33:52.788 --> 05:33:52.798 align:start position:0%
renewables are in a category because of
 
05:33:54.708 --> 05:33:54.718 align:start position:0%
a benefit that they provide
 
05:33:56.788 --> 05:33:56.798 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure that this type of a
 
05:33:56.798 --> 05:33:57.990 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure that this type of a
project

05:33:57.990 --> 05:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
project
 
05:33:59.750 --> 05:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
it's like a slippery slope where we're
 
05:34:01.350 --> 05:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
taking um
 
05:34:03.990 --> 05:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
a terminology and applying it here
 
05:34:07.110 --> 05:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
which may in turn allow you know provide
 
05:34:09.670 --> 05:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
other benefits going down
 
05:34:11.670 --> 05:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
into the future
 
05:34:15.430 --> 05:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
to this form of sequestration of gas so
 
05:34:17.750 --> 05:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm trying to figure out is
 
05:34:19.510 --> 05:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
where does the term come from is it
 
05:34:22.230 --> 05:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
because these landfill sites are
 
05:34:24.390 --> 05:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
constantly emitting methane
 
05:34:26.548 --> 05:34:26.558 align:start position:0%
that we're calling them renewable
 
05:34:29.350 --> 05:34:29.360 align:start position:0%
because it's it's an ongoing source
 
05:34:30.548 --> 05:34:30.558 align:start position:0%
sure and thank you again for the
 
05:34:31.910 --> 05:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
question again that's not necessarily
 
05:34:33.430 --> 05:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
something i guess i'm in a position to
 
05:34:35.190 --> 05:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
comment on the department didn't you
 
05:34:37.110 --> 05:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
know provide technical feedback to the
 
05:34:39.110 --> 05:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
bill we didn't write the bill so again
 
05:34:41.270 --> 05:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
probably a question to maybe direct to
 
05:34:43.750 --> 05:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh interested stakeholders or um the
 
05:34:47.670 --> 05:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor okay thank you that's okay
 
05:34:49.510 --> 05:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
representative bernardi is recognized
 
05:34:51.430 --> 05:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
05:34:53.590 --> 05:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh
 
05:34:56.628 --> 05:34:56.638 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you mr robert uh what
 
05:35:00.470 --> 05:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
renewable gas capacity do you see
 
05:35:03.830 --> 05:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
coming from this uh
 
05:35:07.190 --> 05:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
venture in new hampshire well
 
05:35:07.910 --> 05:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:35:09.750 --> 05:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
representative bernardi i know there is
 
05:35:09.760 --> 05:35:10.628 align:start position:0%
representative bernardi i know there is
um

05:35:10.628 --> 05:35:10.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:13.350 --> 05:35:13.360 align:start position:0%
an ongoing docket at the puc that is
 
05:35:16.150 --> 05:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
suspended for the time being um i
 
05:35:17.910 --> 05:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
believe in that
 
05:35:19.910 --> 05:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
docket and forgive me i'm doing this
 
05:35:21.590 --> 05:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
from memory is that
 
05:35:24.470 --> 05:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
a gas utility petitioned the puc because
 
05:35:25.990 --> 05:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
they wanted to
 
05:35:27.990 --> 05:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
work with a company called
 
05:35:30.230 --> 05:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
rude arpa i think which is a resource
 
05:35:33.430 --> 05:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
recovery company that was going to
 
05:35:34.868 --> 05:35:34.878 align:start position:0%
capture a lot of the methane that's
 
05:35:36.708 --> 05:35:36.718 align:start position:0%
released from a landfill in the north
 
05:35:38.310 --> 05:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
country i believe that's
 
05:35:42.070 --> 05:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:44.390 --> 05:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
05:35:45.830 --> 05:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative murder do you have an
 
05:35:48.230 --> 05:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
answer yes one of our buildings actually
 
05:35:50.948 --> 05:35:50.958 align:start position:0%
i think it was uh 577 or a few years ago
 
05:35:52.868 --> 05:35:52.878 align:start position:0%
we attached the gas on the bottom of
 
05:35:54.788 --> 05:35:54.798 align:start position:0%
that bill and it was specific to
 
05:35:56.948 --> 05:35:56.958 align:start position:0%
bethlehem that company so it was on a
 
05:35:57.990 --> 05:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
bill that
 
05:36:00.868 --> 05:36:00.878 align:start position:0%
did was made topic was actually
 
05:36:00.878 --> 05:36:03.270 align:start position:0%
did was made topic was actually
berlin

05:36:03.270 --> 05:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
berlin
 
05:36:05.270 --> 05:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
okay representative bernardi continue
 
05:36:07.990 --> 05:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
with your question i'm sorry um and so i
 
05:36:09.510 --> 05:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
believe that docket's ongoing so i
 
05:36:11.990 --> 05:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
believe there is um certainly interest
 
05:36:14.470 --> 05:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
from companies out there to capture
 
05:36:16.548 --> 05:36:16.558 align:start position:0%
some of this methane or other means
 
05:36:19.110 --> 05:36:19.120 align:start position:0%
that's outlined i think in
 
05:36:22.948 --> 05:36:22.958 align:start position:0%
page 2 lines 22-27
 
05:36:25.750 --> 05:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
to the extent that it
 
05:36:27.350 --> 05:36:27.360 align:start position:0%
if you're asking me to guess how much
 
05:36:28.708 --> 05:36:28.718 align:start position:0%
there may or may not be out there i
 
05:36:30.150 --> 05:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
couldn't necessarily answer but there is
 
05:36:33.270 --> 05:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
kind of a cap in the bill um with a five
 
05:36:36.708 --> 05:36:36.718 align:start position:0%
percent cap as outlined on page three
 
05:36:40.070 --> 05:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
line 11 so you know just kind of a a
 
05:36:41.590 --> 05:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
narrowly tailored pilot i guess you
 
05:36:45.670 --> 05:36:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:47.190 --> 05:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
let's move on now
 
05:36:49.190 --> 05:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
we have other folks who need to testify
 
05:36:50.708 --> 05:36:50.718 align:start position:0%
on this bill thank you
 
05:36:52.628 --> 05:36:52.638 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that uh from the department
 
05:36:54.548 --> 05:36:54.558 align:start position:0%
of energy and i'd like to call now on
 
05:36:58.230 --> 05:36:58.240 align:start position:0%
cat fork from unitil a gas company she
 
05:37:06.948 --> 05:37:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:09.830 --> 05:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
please turn on the mic
 
05:37:11.350 --> 05:37:11.360 align:start position:0%
is it on now
 
05:37:13.590 --> 05:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
i didn't know griffin shut me off
 
05:37:13.600 --> 05:37:14.390 align:start position:0%
i didn't know griffin shut me off
um

05:37:14.390 --> 05:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:15.830 --> 05:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is kat burke and
 
05:37:17.110 --> 05:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
i'm the director of government affairs
 
05:37:18.310 --> 05:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
at unitil
 
05:37:20.548 --> 05:37:20.558 align:start position:0%
unitil is here today in support of this
 
05:37:23.830 --> 05:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation and i do think most
 
05:37:25.270 --> 05:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:37:27.110 --> 05:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
highlights of the bill have been well
 
05:37:29.910 --> 05:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
covered by senator bradley but
 
05:37:31.910 --> 05:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
if you would like to indulge me in more
 
05:37:33.670 --> 05:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
than the one minute i wrote on my
 
05:37:36.230 --> 05:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
testimony card i'm happy to walk through
 
05:37:38.310 --> 05:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
sort of how unitil sees this process
 
05:37:40.150 --> 05:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
unfolding i know it can be a little bit
 
05:37:41.750 --> 05:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
confusing especially given the
 
05:37:43.670 --> 05:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
significant changes that we saw in the
 
05:37:43.680 --> 05:37:45.190 align:start position:0%
significant changes that we saw in the
senate

05:37:45.190 --> 05:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
senate
 
05:37:46.948 --> 05:37:46.958 align:start position:0%
so essentially um
 
05:37:49.110 --> 05:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
what would happen is a utility would
 
05:37:51.830 --> 05:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
have a gas utility so liberty or unitil
 
05:37:53.590 --> 05:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
would have an interest in going out and
 
05:37:56.230 --> 05:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
procuring renewable natural gas and
 
05:37:58.230 --> 05:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
partaking in a contract for renewable
 
05:38:00.390 --> 05:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
natural gas when we do that we would
 
05:38:02.230 --> 05:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
have to issue under the amended version
 
05:38:03.430 --> 05:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
of the senate
 
05:38:06.230 --> 05:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
various rfps in consultation with the
 
05:38:08.230 --> 05:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
department of energy so that would be
 
05:38:09.830 --> 05:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
strictly in consultation and that would
 
05:38:11.750 --> 05:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
be exactly what we would do even if this
 
05:38:13.190 --> 05:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't in the bill right we would of
 
05:38:15.110 --> 05:38:15.120 align:start position:0%
course go to the department we would
 
05:38:17.270 --> 05:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
work closely with the individuals that
 
05:38:19.350 --> 05:38:19.360 align:start position:0%
we worked with during this stakeholder
 
05:38:21.830 --> 05:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
process you know tom franz david shulock
 
05:38:23.030 --> 05:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
et cetera
 
05:38:25.190 --> 05:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
to discuss what these contracts tracks
 
05:38:28.390 --> 05:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
are looking like their price um duration
 
05:38:30.470 --> 05:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
which has a hard cap of 15 years in this
 
05:38:33.430 --> 05:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
bill etc after we worked on that with
 
05:38:35.670 --> 05:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
doe again it wouldn't require approval
 
05:38:38.070 --> 05:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
from the department but it would require
 
05:38:40.310 --> 05:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
um you know extensive conversation with
 
05:38:42.310 --> 05:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
them we would then decide whether or not
 
05:38:44.788 --> 05:38:44.798 align:start position:0%
we wanted to move forward with a formal
 
05:38:46.868 --> 05:38:46.878 align:start position:0%
filing with the commission which would
 
05:38:50.230 --> 05:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
then have to sort of walk through this
 
05:38:52.470 --> 05:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
multi-prong public interest test that
 
05:38:54.230 --> 05:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
you see in the amended version of the
 
05:38:56.708 --> 05:38:56.718 align:start position:0%
senate on the bottom of page two
 
05:38:59.350 --> 05:38:59.360 align:start position:0%
and on the top of page three
 
05:39:01.350 --> 05:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
subsections a and b
 
05:39:03.830 --> 05:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
so it would be the burden of the utility
 
05:39:03.840 --> 05:39:04.628 align:start position:0%
so it would be the burden of the utility
to

05:39:04.628 --> 05:39:04.638 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:39:06.708 --> 05:39:06.718 align:start position:0%
prove that the monetary benefits of the
 
05:39:08.868 --> 05:39:08.878 align:start position:0%
proposal to utility customers and the
 
05:39:10.230 --> 05:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
state are there
 
05:39:12.628 --> 05:39:12.638 align:start position:0%
including the value of any environmental
 
05:39:15.030 --> 05:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
attributes or carbon offsets which are
 
05:39:18.868 --> 05:39:18.878 align:start position:0%
both defined in this bill we would also
 
05:39:21.510 --> 05:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
weigh whether or not the proposal in
 
05:39:23.110 --> 05:39:23.120 align:start position:0%
front of the commission advances the
 
05:39:25.110 --> 05:39:25.120 align:start position:0%
objectives of the state's
 
05:39:27.510 --> 05:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
tenure energy strategy in the energy
 
05:39:30.788 --> 05:39:30.798 align:start position:0%
policy of the state under rsa 378
 
05:39:32.868 --> 05:39:32.878 align:start position:0%
that would include enhancing consumer
 
05:39:35.750 --> 05:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
choice improving gas system resiliency
 
05:39:38.310 --> 05:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
through diversification of supply etc so
 
05:39:39.590 --> 05:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
those would be all things that we would
 
05:39:42.868 --> 05:39:42.878 align:start position:0%
present to the commission when and if
 
05:39:44.628 --> 05:39:44.638 align:start position:0%
after consultation with the department
 
05:39:46.868 --> 05:39:46.878 align:start position:0%
we decided to move forward with this
 
05:39:48.788 --> 05:39:48.798 align:start position:0%
after that the public
 
05:39:50.708 --> 05:39:50.718 align:start position:0%
the public interest standard laid out
 
05:39:52.628 --> 05:39:52.638 align:start position:0%
here the commission would walk through
 
05:39:54.788 --> 05:39:54.798 align:start position:0%
that and decide whether or not
 
05:39:57.190 --> 05:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
the utility meets those standards right
 
05:39:58.788 --> 05:39:58.798 align:start position:0%
just like they do with any other
 
05:40:00.628 --> 05:40:00.638 align:start position:0%
balancing test or test put forth in
 
05:40:00.638 --> 05:40:03.030 align:start position:0%
balancing test or test put forth in
statute

05:40:03.030 --> 05:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
statute
 
05:40:05.910 --> 05:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
if and when any of the utilities were to
 
05:40:07.910 --> 05:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
take part in this
 
05:40:09.830 --> 05:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
three years after the effective date of
 
05:40:11.590 --> 05:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
this bill there would be a comprehensive
 
05:40:13.350 --> 05:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
study that the doe would kick off in
 
05:40:15.670 --> 05:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
consultation with the utilities that you
 
05:40:17.750 --> 05:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
know like rep mcgee said he would study
 
05:40:20.070 --> 05:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
all of these particular issues economic
 
05:40:22.470 --> 05:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
benefits whether or not the market has
 
05:40:24.868 --> 05:40:24.878 align:start position:0%
developed what the price of rng is
 
05:40:27.190 --> 05:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
compared to say conventional natural gas
 
05:40:28.628 --> 05:40:28.638 align:start position:0%
et cetera
 
05:40:30.470 --> 05:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
service quality
 
05:40:33.190 --> 05:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
any sort of benefits to participating
 
05:40:35.670 --> 05:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
customers or non-participating customers
 
05:40:38.070 --> 05:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
and to be clear in order to change that
 
05:40:39.750 --> 05:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
five percent cap
 
05:40:40.948 --> 05:40:40.958 align:start position:0%
we would need to come back to the
 
05:40:43.590 --> 05:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
legislature so that study i'm imagining
 
05:40:45.510 --> 05:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
would probably recommend something like
 
05:40:47.590 --> 05:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
that either it makes sense to keep it at
 
05:40:49.430 --> 05:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
this let's raise the cap let's get rid
 
05:40:51.830 --> 05:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
of this let's anything right
 
05:40:53.030 --> 05:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
and then we'd have to come forward with
 
05:40:55.190 --> 05:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
another piece of legislation so the
 
05:40:56.948 --> 05:40:56.958 align:start position:0%
guardrails in place here are the
 
05:40:59.110 --> 05:40:59.120 align:start position:0%
consultation with doe when we're putting
 
05:41:01.830 --> 05:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
out the rfps the public interest test
 
05:41:03.830 --> 05:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
that's at the commission
 
05:41:05.670 --> 05:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
and then the study that will follow in
 
05:41:06.788 --> 05:41:06.798 align:start position:0%
three years
 
05:41:09.350 --> 05:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
um or about thereafter
 
05:41:12.070 --> 05:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
so unitil feels as though you know all
 
05:41:13.510 --> 05:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders who've worked on this
 
05:41:15.990 --> 05:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
bill have really um worked hard to
 
05:41:18.548 --> 05:41:18.558 align:start position:0%
develop significant control mechanisms
 
05:41:21.830 --> 05:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
for for ratepayers um while recognizing
 
05:41:24.868 --> 05:41:24.878 align:start position:0%
that rng is you know a developing
 
05:41:27.190 --> 05:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
technology that has a lot of
 
05:41:29.590 --> 05:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
environmental benefits including but not
 
05:41:31.750 --> 05:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
limited to potentially being carbon
 
05:41:34.788 --> 05:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
neutral in that when you capture it and
 
05:41:37.510 --> 05:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
use it as a source you're capturing and
 
05:41:37.520 --> 05:41:38.548 align:start position:0%
use it as a source you're capturing and
utilizing

05:41:38.548 --> 05:41:38.558 align:start position:0%
utilizing
 
05:41:40.788 --> 05:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
more methane than what would be emitted
 
05:41:42.628 --> 05:41:42.638 align:start position:0%
into the air if you were just letting it
 
05:41:44.788 --> 05:41:44.798 align:start position:0%
emit into the air right
 
05:41:46.788 --> 05:41:46.798 align:start position:0%
so we see a lot of benefits here and we
 
05:41:49.110 --> 05:41:49.120 align:start position:0%
think that this is you know the right
 
05:41:51.510 --> 05:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
pace and magnitude for a state of like
 
05:41:54.310 --> 05:41:54.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to move forward with this
 
05:41:56.070 --> 05:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
many other states are
 
05:41:58.628 --> 05:41:58.638 align:start position:0%
putting in rng bills like this at 20 or
 
05:42:01.590 --> 05:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
30 percent minimum so 5
 
05:42:05.990 --> 05:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
with a 15-year cap on contracts a study
 
05:42:07.510 --> 05:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
are all really good
 
05:42:09.030 --> 05:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
places to start here and i'm happy to
 
05:42:11.510 --> 05:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
05:42:13.830 --> 05:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
thank you that was an excellent
 
05:42:16.628 --> 05:42:16.638 align:start position:0%
overview of how the process would work
 
05:42:20.150 --> 05:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
i notice in the bill that on page 2 line
 
05:42:20.160 --> 05:42:22.230 align:start position:0%
i notice in the bill that on page 2 line
17

05:42:22.230 --> 05:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
17
 
05:42:23.910 --> 05:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
there is a definition of renewable
 
05:42:27.750 --> 05:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
energy that includes biomass
 
05:42:29.830 --> 05:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering
 
05:42:32.390 --> 05:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
if biomass is renewable is renewable
 
05:42:35.510 --> 05:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
natural gas also
 
05:42:38.230 --> 05:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
renewable in that sense and is there any
 
05:42:39.990 --> 05:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
difference between the two
 
05:42:42.310 --> 05:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean i know um we work closely
 
05:42:43.830 --> 05:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
with the rng coalition who i don't
 
05:42:45.590 --> 05:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
believe is here today but i do believe
 
05:42:48.548 --> 05:42:48.558 align:start position:0%
you got testimony from them submitted um
 
05:42:51.190 --> 05:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
but rng is the
 
05:42:53.750 --> 05:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
term used by the industry it's you know
 
05:42:55.910 --> 05:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
renewable natural gas i have no other
 
05:42:57.830 --> 05:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
you know insight outside of that but i
 
05:43:00.548 --> 05:43:00.558 align:start position:0%
do know that rng can be derived from or
 
05:43:03.030 --> 05:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
has been derived from all of the sources
 
05:43:04.390 --> 05:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
outlined here
 
05:43:07.350 --> 05:43:07.360 align:start position:0%
um this is a sector neutral and source
 
05:43:09.270 --> 05:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
neutral bill right so you know as
 
05:43:11.270 --> 05:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
senator bradley said if
 
05:43:13.430 --> 05:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
we find here in the state that there's a
 
05:43:15.430 --> 05:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
lot of local resources from landfills or
 
05:43:17.670 --> 05:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
the biomass industry from you know woody
 
05:43:19.670 --> 05:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
byproduct anything like that animal
 
05:43:21.510 --> 05:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
waste etc
 
05:43:23.110 --> 05:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
that's certainly something we can use i
 
05:43:24.948 --> 05:43:24.958 align:start position:0%
know we've seen companies like hannaford
 
05:43:27.190 --> 05:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
and maine looking to contract
 
05:43:28.868 --> 05:43:28.878 align:start position:0%
to use their
 
05:43:30.868 --> 05:43:30.878 align:start position:0%
produce that you or i may not buy at the
 
05:43:33.350 --> 05:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
store because it's bruised old et cetera
 
05:43:35.910 --> 05:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
put that into a digester and be able to
 
05:43:37.990 --> 05:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully make something like rng out of
 
05:43:39.270 --> 05:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
this so it's
 
05:43:40.470 --> 05:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
quite literally something that would
 
05:43:42.150 --> 05:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
otherwise go to waste but i would
 
05:43:45.750 --> 05:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
consider that renewable energy to mean
 
05:43:47.270 --> 05:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
renewable under that definition of the
 
05:43:47.280 --> 05:43:49.990 align:start position:0%
renewable under that definition of the
bill

05:43:49.990 --> 05:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:52.070 --> 05:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee has a question
 
05:43:53.830 --> 05:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you ms
 
05:43:55.830 --> 05:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
book for taking my question it's very
 
05:43:59.190 --> 05:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
informative um i my question is around
 
05:43:59.200 --> 05:43:59.910 align:start position:0%
informative um i my question is around
the

05:43:59.910 --> 05:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:44:02.070 --> 05:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
chemical plant that will be needed at
 
05:44:04.230 --> 05:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
any landfill i'm curious since you're
 
05:44:06.310 --> 05:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
with unitil
 
05:44:09.190 --> 05:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
if you could discuss in other places
 
05:44:11.110 --> 05:44:11.120 align:start position:0%
where they've already had projects like
 
05:44:13.830 --> 05:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
this what kind of a chemical plant would
 
05:44:15.430 --> 05:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
be required
 
05:44:18.230 --> 05:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
yes or infrastructure i guess not very
 
05:44:20.788 --> 05:44:20.798 align:start position:0%
um involved in that side of the process
 
05:44:23.430 --> 05:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
of course um you know and under the bill
 
05:44:25.270 --> 05:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
actually we really couldn't be involved
 
05:44:26.868 --> 05:44:26.878 align:start position:0%
in that process
 
05:44:28.310 --> 05:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
the senate did amend the piece of
 
05:44:30.868 --> 05:44:30.878 align:start position:0%
legislation to insist that the utilities
 
05:44:32.788 --> 05:44:32.798 align:start position:0%
cannot be involved in the rng
 
05:44:34.310 --> 05:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so we can't rate base
 
05:44:36.230 --> 05:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
that which makes a lot of sense right so
 
05:44:37.990 --> 05:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
these would be private organizations
 
05:44:39.990 --> 05:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
private businesses who are billing
 
05:44:40.000 --> 05:44:41.030 align:start position:0%
private businesses who are billing
building

05:44:41.030 --> 05:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
building
 
05:44:42.548 --> 05:44:42.558 align:start position:0%
die gestures
 
05:44:45.670 --> 05:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
and um utilizing you know putting up
 
05:44:49.110 --> 05:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
capital utilizing that process that i am
 
05:44:51.430 --> 05:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
only broadly familiar with very high
 
05:44:51.440 --> 05:44:52.548 align:start position:0%
only broadly familiar with very high
level

05:44:52.548 --> 05:44:52.558 align:start position:0%
level
 
05:44:52.558 --> 05:44:53.670 align:start position:0%
level
follow-up

05:44:53.670 --> 05:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:44:55.270 --> 05:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
follow up so i guess the only other
 
05:44:57.190 --> 05:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
question i would have then is
 
05:44:58.948 --> 05:44:58.958 align:start position:0%
are there are there additional pipes
 
05:45:00.310 --> 05:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
involved in order to get it where it
 
05:45:02.150 --> 05:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
needs to go do you have any idea of how
 
05:45:03.910 --> 05:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
that part yes
 
05:45:06.788 --> 05:45:06.798 align:start position:0%
so under this particular version of the
 
05:45:06.798 --> 05:45:07.590 align:start position:0%
so under this particular version of the
bill

05:45:07.590 --> 05:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:45:09.510 --> 05:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
i believe we would be able only to
 
05:45:11.430 --> 05:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
invest in infrastructure that would
 
05:45:13.350 --> 05:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
include dropping it in the pipe
 
05:45:15.110 --> 05:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
transporting it we wouldn't we would not
 
05:45:17.350 --> 05:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
but you can truck it
 
05:45:19.670 --> 05:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
depending on where
 
05:45:21.910 --> 05:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
that private company was located if it
 
05:45:25.750 --> 05:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
was very close to a liberty or unitil
 
05:45:27.030 --> 05:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
pipe that you could drop it in that
 
05:45:29.510 --> 05:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
would certainly be ideal right
 
05:45:32.230 --> 05:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
but part of the
 
05:45:34.230 --> 05:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
issue here in new hampshire is we have a
 
05:45:36.150 --> 05:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
real interesting i call it the chicken
 
05:45:38.070 --> 05:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
and the egg problem right we want to
 
05:45:41.430 --> 05:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
develop this rng market we want to see
 
05:45:43.030 --> 05:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
private businesses
 
05:45:44.548 --> 05:45:44.558 align:start position:0%
you know contract
 
05:45:47.270 --> 05:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
for rng with the utilities but up until
 
05:45:49.110 --> 05:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
now this wouldn't be possible unless
 
05:45:51.190 --> 05:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
this you know bill moves forward right
 
05:45:53.430 --> 05:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
so we're hoping to see um more
 
05:45:55.270 --> 05:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
development in the market
 
05:45:57.190 --> 05:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
once this once this happens but that
 
05:45:58.548 --> 05:45:58.558 align:start position:0%
would be something that would be
 
05:46:00.150 --> 05:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
included in that study that i mentioned
 
05:46:02.948 --> 05:46:02.958 align:start position:0%
earlier as well okay thank you sure okay
 
05:46:04.628 --> 05:46:04.638 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts you get the
 
05:46:06.628 --> 05:46:06.638 align:start position:0%
last question for ms burke
 
05:46:06.638 --> 05:46:07.590 align:start position:0%
last question for ms burke
okay

05:46:07.590 --> 05:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:46:07.600 --> 05:46:08.470 align:start position:0%
okay
um

05:46:08.470 --> 05:46:08.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:46:10.230 --> 05:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
 
05:46:12.310 --> 05:46:12.320 align:start position:0%
my question would be where then would
 
05:46:14.628 --> 05:46:14.638 align:start position:0%
the rate pay is having to foot some of
 
05:46:16.868 --> 05:46:16.878 align:start position:0%
the bill come in if it's not with the
 
05:46:19.030 --> 05:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure would it be at the in the
 
05:46:19.040 --> 05:46:19.830 align:start position:0%
infrastructure would it be at the in the
uh

05:46:19.830 --> 05:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:46:21.510 --> 05:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
payment agreements
 
05:46:23.190 --> 05:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
05:46:24.948 --> 05:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
sorry that's it thank you thank you for
 
05:46:27.430 --> 05:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
the question representative um i think
 
05:46:29.830 --> 05:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
the the issue that some individuals have
 
05:46:32.150 --> 05:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
raised with the cost to rate pairs is
 
05:46:34.470 --> 05:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
regarding the cost of rng itself
 
05:46:36.708 --> 05:46:36.718 align:start position:0%
compared to conventional natural gas
 
05:46:40.230 --> 05:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
that unitil or liberty is delivering now
 
05:46:42.470 --> 05:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
historically speaking rng has been
 
05:46:43.830 --> 05:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
slightly more expensive than
 
05:46:46.548 --> 05:46:46.558 align:start position:0%
conventional natural gas however
 
05:46:48.390 --> 05:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
i think we can all agree that right now
 
05:46:51.190 --> 05:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
the cost of natural gas is very high so
 
05:46:53.430 --> 05:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
this bill if it were to move forward
 
05:46:56.470 --> 05:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
would allow the utilities to utilize rng
 
05:46:59.350 --> 05:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
as a drop-in replacement for natural gas
 
05:47:01.510 --> 05:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
including at times like now where the
 
05:47:03.430 --> 05:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
cost of natural gas is high
 
05:47:04.788 --> 05:47:04.798 align:start position:0%
there could be a time when the market
 
05:47:06.948 --> 05:47:06.958 align:start position:0%
further develops in the future where rng
 
05:47:08.948 --> 05:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
is at cost or less expensive than
 
05:47:10.390 --> 05:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
natural gas
 
05:47:12.310 --> 05:47:12.320 align:start position:0%
and that of course would be a great
 
05:47:14.150 --> 05:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
benefit for the state right but that
 
05:47:16.470 --> 05:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
would be the the time um when it's
 
05:47:16.480 --> 05:47:18.470 align:start position:0%
would be the the time um when it's
incurred

05:47:18.470 --> 05:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
incurred
 
05:47:18.480 --> 05:47:20.230 align:start position:0%
incurred
follow-up

05:47:20.230 --> 05:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:47:22.788 --> 05:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
follow-up quickly would be then you
 
05:47:24.548 --> 05:47:24.558 align:start position:0%
would if you contracted with these
 
05:47:26.548 --> 05:47:26.558 align:start position:0%
companies you would contract them with
 
05:47:28.390 --> 05:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
them for a certain period of time
 
05:47:29.990 --> 05:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
and you would take that gas no matter
 
05:47:32.310 --> 05:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
what it costs is that correct
 
05:47:35.030 --> 05:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
no so well we would have to issue the
 
05:47:37.990 --> 05:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
rfps it would have to be less than 15
 
05:47:39.510 --> 05:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
years for the contract unless the
 
05:47:41.030 --> 05:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
department of energy thinks it should be
 
05:47:42.390 --> 05:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
something other than that
 
05:47:43.990 --> 05:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
and then again remember we would still
 
05:47:46.390 --> 05:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
have to go to the commission and prove
 
05:47:49.270 --> 05:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
that this rng is in the public interest
 
05:47:50.948 --> 05:47:50.958 align:start position:0%
with the prongs in the test laid out
 
05:47:53.510 --> 05:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
here and then the commission could say
 
05:47:55.990 --> 05:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
yay or nay so they could say no you
 
05:47:57.670 --> 05:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
can't move forward with this contract
 
05:48:00.470 --> 05:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
it's pre-approval so you you can't um
 
05:48:02.788 --> 05:48:02.798 align:start position:0%
contract for this rng
 
05:48:02.798 --> 05:48:03.670 align:start position:0%
contract for this rng
no

05:48:03.670 --> 05:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:48:05.990 --> 05:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
so so that process is pretty well laid
 
05:48:08.230 --> 05:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
out here so the cost will not be
 
05:48:10.310 --> 05:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
incurred to rate payers unless it's
 
05:48:12.470 --> 05:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
approved by the puc at the cost that we
 
05:48:14.788 --> 05:48:14.798 align:start position:0%
present to them
 
05:48:16.788 --> 05:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
okay ms bork we appreciate that
 
05:48:18.390 --> 05:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you we're going to move
 
05:48:20.470 --> 05:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
on we still have quite a few people who
 
05:48:22.868 --> 05:48:22.878 align:start position:0%
want to testify and unfortunately
 
05:48:24.628 --> 05:48:24.638 align:start position:0%
because we're running short i'm going to
 
05:48:28.230 --> 05:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
have to start limiting people to
 
05:48:29.670 --> 05:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
two minutes
 
05:48:32.310 --> 05:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
of testimony so next we'll hear from
 
05:48:34.788 --> 05:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
katherine corcory of the new hampshire
 
05:48:49.350 --> 05:48:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:53.750 --> 05:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:53.760 --> 05:48:54.708 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:48:54.708 --> 05:48:54.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:48:56.948 --> 05:48:56.958 align:start position:0%
i'll give you three minutes oh that's
 
05:49:01.750 --> 05:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
plenty um i handed out some testimony
 
05:49:01.760 --> 05:49:02.628 align:start position:0%
plenty um i handed out some testimony
in

05:49:02.628 --> 05:49:02.638 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:49:04.548 --> 05:49:04.558 align:start position:0%
here um
 
05:49:07.350 --> 05:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
i think it's the last
 
05:49:07.360 --> 05:49:08.708 align:start position:0%
i think it's the last
yeah

05:49:08.708 --> 05:49:08.718 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:49:10.708 --> 05:49:10.718 align:start position:0%
this being the science and technology
 
05:49:12.788 --> 05:49:12.798 align:start position:0%
committee i wanted to make sure you got
 
05:49:14.470 --> 05:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
some good science
 
05:49:16.470 --> 05:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
and this last report
 
05:49:20.470 --> 05:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
um is from it looks like this one it's
 
05:49:23.670 --> 05:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
from the air resources council of
 
05:49:23.680 --> 05:49:25.910 align:start position:0%
from the air resources council of
california

05:49:25.910 --> 05:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
california
 
05:49:27.910 --> 05:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
and it talks about
 
05:49:31.110 --> 05:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
emissions from landfills
 
05:49:35.590 --> 05:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
and contrary to what we just heard
 
05:49:35.600 --> 05:49:36.470 align:start position:0%
and contrary to what we just heard
it

05:49:36.470 --> 05:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:49:38.948 --> 05:49:38.958 align:start position:0%
it's not what it seems
 
05:49:40.788 --> 05:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
my name's catherine corkery i'm from new
 
05:49:42.628 --> 05:49:42.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire sierra club
 
05:49:45.510 --> 05:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh i'm the chapter director uh sorry i
 
05:49:46.830 --> 05:49:46.840 align:start position:0%
didn't do that
 
05:49:50.788 --> 05:49:50.798 align:start position:0%
first uh if you go to um it's it's a
 
05:49:50.798 --> 05:49:51.910 align:start position:0%
first uh if you go to um it's it's a
really

05:49:51.910 --> 05:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
really
 
05:49:51.920 --> 05:49:52.788 align:start position:0%
really
um

05:49:52.788 --> 05:49:52.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:54.628 --> 05:49:54.638 align:start position:0%
short report
 
05:49:57.190 --> 05:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
um but i wanted to
 
05:49:57.200 --> 05:50:00.470 align:start position:0%
um but i wanted to
highlight

05:50:00.470 --> 05:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:04.150 --> 05:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
page five in that section combining the
 
05:50:07.510 --> 05:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:07.520 --> 05:50:08.390 align:start position:0%
 
here

05:50:08.390 --> 05:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:50:10.708 --> 05:50:10.718 align:start position:0%
and this this report talks about
 
05:50:13.670 --> 05:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
closed landfills and active landfills
 
05:50:16.470 --> 05:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
and the different types of
 
05:50:19.750 --> 05:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
the rate of emissions
 
05:50:21.430 --> 05:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
and the thing is
 
05:50:26.070 --> 05:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
in a landfill that has been capped
 
05:50:28.948 --> 05:50:28.958 align:start position:0%
or even an active landfill
 
05:50:31.430 --> 05:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
the emissions percolate
 
05:50:31.440 --> 05:50:32.470 align:start position:0%
the emissions percolate
and

05:50:32.470 --> 05:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:50:36.548 --> 05:50:36.558 align:start position:0%
they emit all over the landfill not just
 
05:50:38.868 --> 05:50:38.878 align:start position:0%
the one pipe that they have that they
 
05:50:42.548 --> 05:50:42.558 align:start position:0%
flare off right and it emits all over
 
05:50:45.030 --> 05:50:45.040 align:start position:0%
and what they have found
 
05:50:48.470 --> 05:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
is that when they add all the equipment
 
05:50:51.670 --> 05:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
to help make this
 
05:50:54.390 --> 05:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
this methane gas
 
05:50:54.400 --> 05:50:55.510 align:start position:0%
this methane gas
usable

05:50:55.510 --> 05:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
usable
 
05:50:57.830 --> 05:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
to put into a pipeline you have to
 
05:51:00.390 --> 05:51:00.400 align:start position:0%
really pump it up
 
05:51:02.470 --> 05:51:02.480 align:start position:0%
and when that happens you're pumping up
 
05:51:04.390 --> 05:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
the whole landfill
 
05:51:05.590 --> 05:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
not just
 
05:51:05.600 --> 05:51:06.948 align:start position:0%
not just
the

05:51:06.948 --> 05:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:51:09.670 --> 05:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
methane that gets put into the pipe
 
05:51:12.548 --> 05:51:12.558 align:start position:0%
and so what happens overall
 
05:51:15.910 --> 05:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
you're actually emitting more escape gas
 
05:51:18.310 --> 05:51:18.320 align:start position:0%
and that's that 3.8
 
05:51:22.310 --> 05:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
to 7.8 times more
 
05:51:25.350 --> 05:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gases
 
05:51:28.150 --> 05:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
when you have this augmentation of a
 
05:51:28.160 --> 05:51:29.590 align:start position:0%
when you have this augmentation of a
landfill

05:51:29.590 --> 05:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
landfill
 
05:51:31.910 --> 05:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
and i really i
 
05:51:31.920 --> 05:51:33.030 align:start position:0%
and i really i
i

05:51:33.030 --> 05:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:51:36.628 --> 05:51:36.638 align:start position:0%
so want i want this to work
 
05:51:40.310 --> 05:51:40.320 align:start position:0%
but it just doesn't work like that i
 
05:51:42.150 --> 05:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
feel like um
 
05:51:43.670 --> 05:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
that ad about
 
05:51:46.150 --> 05:51:46.160 align:start position:0%
putting things online on on facebook or
 
05:51:48.788 --> 05:51:48.798 align:start position:0%
something like it just it doesn't work
 
05:51:50.708 --> 05:51:50.718 align:start position:0%
like that
 
05:51:53.670 --> 05:51:53.680 align:start position:0%
the emissions when you're pumping up the
 
05:51:55.350 --> 05:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
emissions to go out
 
05:51:58.070 --> 05:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
you're not capturing all of it and in
 
05:51:58.080 --> 05:51:59.190 align:start position:0%
you're not capturing all of it and in
fact

05:51:59.190 --> 05:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
fact
 
05:52:03.750 --> 05:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:03.760 --> 05:52:05.350 align:start position:0%
 
overall

05:52:05.350 --> 05:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
overall
 
05:52:08.628 --> 05:52:08.638 align:start position:0%
and so you're making matters worse
 
05:52:11.110 --> 05:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
for climate
 
05:52:11.120 --> 05:52:12.070 align:start position:0%
for climate
um

05:52:12.070 --> 05:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:14.788 --> 05:52:14.798 align:start position:0%
so there's that report 30 seconds oh my
 
05:52:14.798 --> 05:52:15.990 align:start position:0%
so there's that report 30 seconds oh my
goodness

05:52:15.990 --> 05:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
goodness
 
05:52:18.470 --> 05:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
i had three
 
05:52:21.510 --> 05:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
i had three points um point number one
 
05:52:23.590 --> 05:52:23.600 align:start position:0%
the emissions uh
 
05:52:26.788 --> 05:52:26.798 align:start position:0%
are are not what they seem number two it
 
05:52:29.030 --> 05:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
was about ratepayers rate payers
 
05:52:31.190 --> 05:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
ratepayers ratepayers are paying for
 
05:52:31.200 --> 05:52:32.150 align:start position:0%
ratepayers ratepayers are paying for
this

05:52:32.150 --> 05:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:52:35.270 --> 05:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm really surprised that
 
05:52:37.510 --> 05:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
this is something
 
05:52:40.150 --> 05:52:40.160 align:start position:0%
that this kind of project would be
 
05:52:42.470 --> 05:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
paid by rate payers but something that
 
05:52:45.270 --> 05:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
would actually save ratepayers money
 
05:52:49.430 --> 05:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
like new hampshire saves was was not a
 
05:52:52.230 --> 05:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
not supported by this third point and
 
05:52:55.030 --> 05:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
the third point thank you for that
 
05:52:57.750 --> 05:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
um was about changing
 
05:52:57.760 --> 05:52:58.708 align:start position:0%
um was about changing
the

05:52:58.708 --> 05:52:58.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:52:58.718 --> 05:52:59.670 align:start position:0%
the
the

05:52:59.670 --> 05:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:53:01.510 --> 05:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
moving the goal posts
 
05:53:04.788 --> 05:53:04.798 align:start position:0%
um there is as we heard a docket at the
 
05:53:07.670 --> 05:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
puc that is active now
 
05:53:11.270 --> 05:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
and um in that docket
 
05:53:13.430 --> 05:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
05:53:14.788 --> 05:53:14.798 align:start position:0%
an issue
 
05:53:17.670 --> 05:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
and the petitioner asked
 
05:53:20.390 --> 05:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
that the docket be suspended
 
05:53:23.110 --> 05:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
um so that then they could come here
 
05:53:24.230 --> 05:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
and fix
 
05:53:27.030 --> 05:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
change something change the law
 
05:53:29.830 --> 05:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
and they would go back to the puc now
 
05:53:31.750 --> 05:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
they said they also said
 
05:53:34.788 --> 05:53:34.798 align:start position:0%
that they would still move forward on
 
05:53:37.190 --> 05:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
their docket at the puc
 
05:53:39.910 --> 05:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
if this bill fails
 
05:53:39.920 --> 05:53:40.708 align:start position:0%
if this bill fails
but

05:53:40.708 --> 05:53:40.718 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:53:43.590 --> 05:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
i as someone who was here for northern
 
05:53:46.628 --> 05:53:46.638 align:start position:0%
pass i heard time and time again
 
05:53:48.788 --> 05:53:48.798 align:start position:0%
that we could not change
 
05:53:50.868 --> 05:53:50.878 align:start position:0%
anything about the site evaluation
 
05:53:50.878 --> 05:53:52.548 align:start position:0%
anything about the site evaluation
committee

05:53:52.548 --> 05:53:52.558 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:53:54.788 --> 05:53:54.798 align:start position:0%
in regards to the northern pass because
 
05:53:56.868 --> 05:53:56.878 align:start position:0%
it was an active docket
 
05:53:59.590 --> 05:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm just um
 
05:54:01.830 --> 05:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
i i feel like this could
 
05:54:03.830 --> 05:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
change the precedence
 
05:54:06.150 --> 05:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
at the puc and i think that's dangerous
 
05:54:07.590 --> 05:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
so please
 
05:54:07.600 --> 05:54:08.390 align:start position:0%
so please
oh

05:54:08.390 --> 05:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
oh
 
05:54:11.670 --> 05:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
sorry please oppose this bill thank you
 
05:54:11.680 --> 05:54:12.548 align:start position:0%
sorry please oppose this bill thank you
okay

05:54:12.548 --> 05:54:12.558 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:54:15.110 --> 05:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
good try you were about two minutes over
 
05:54:16.470 --> 05:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
but that's okay
 
05:54:16.480 --> 05:54:17.350 align:start position:0%
but that's okay
so

05:54:17.350 --> 05:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:54:19.910 --> 05:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
would it surprise you to learn that
 
05:54:23.030 --> 05:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
methane which is reported in parts per
 
05:54:25.190 --> 05:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
billion in the atmosphere
 
05:54:27.190 --> 05:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
versus carbon dioxide which is reported
 
05:54:30.470 --> 05:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
in parts per million
 
05:54:32.708 --> 05:54:32.718 align:start position:0%
to put it in perspective the amount of
 
05:54:34.628 --> 05:54:34.638 align:start position:0%
methane that's in the air
 
05:54:36.070 --> 05:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
if it was
 
05:54:36.080 --> 05:54:38.070 align:start position:0%
if it was
uh

05:54:38.070 --> 05:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:54:40.070 --> 05:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
computed as feet
 
05:54:43.430 --> 05:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
on the on the highway between new york
 
05:54:45.190 --> 05:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
city and los angeles
 
05:54:47.990 --> 05:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
would be 26 feet
 
05:54:50.070 --> 05:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't be surprised
 
05:54:51.510 --> 05:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
that is the case
 
05:54:53.350 --> 05:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
all right uh further questions for ms
 
05:54:53.360 --> 05:54:55.510 align:start position:0%
all right uh further questions for ms
corkery

05:54:55.510 --> 05:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
corkery
 
05:54:58.708 --> 05:54:58.718 align:start position:0%
representative samsich
 
05:55:01.030 --> 05:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you miss
 
05:55:03.350 --> 05:55:03.360 align:start position:0%
corkery um
 
05:55:03.360 --> 05:55:05.190 align:start position:0%
corkery um
so

05:55:05.190 --> 05:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:55:05.200 --> 05:55:06.708 align:start position:0%
so
uh

05:55:06.708 --> 05:55:06.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:55:08.230 --> 05:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
if in fact
 
05:55:11.030 --> 05:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
what you say is true that this would
 
05:55:13.510 --> 05:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
create more greenhouse gas emissions
 
05:55:14.708 --> 05:55:14.718 align:start position:0%
from methane
 
05:55:17.590 --> 05:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh then would be recoverable or compared
 
05:55:19.190 --> 05:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
to flaring
 
05:55:21.750 --> 05:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh do you see other ways of recovering
 
05:55:23.270 --> 05:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
that methane
 
05:55:25.510 --> 05:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
from landfills that would not do such
 
05:55:27.350 --> 05:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
great harm
 
05:55:29.030 --> 05:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
i think um
 
05:55:30.470 --> 05:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question because
 
05:55:30.480 --> 05:55:31.510 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question because
that's

05:55:31.510 --> 05:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:55:34.390 --> 05:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
there are really two issues at hand one
 
05:55:37.190 --> 05:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
is a waste issue and one is an emissions
 
05:55:41.510 --> 05:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
issue and and what would be great is if
 
05:55:43.030 --> 05:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
we did not
 
05:55:43.040 --> 05:55:44.070 align:start position:0%
we did not
send

05:55:44.070 --> 05:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
send
 
05:55:47.750 --> 05:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
this organic matter to landfills
 
05:55:47.760 --> 05:55:49.190 align:start position:0%
this organic matter to landfills
like

05:55:49.190 --> 05:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:55:53.110 --> 05:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
what we have here if there is um
 
05:55:53.120 --> 05:55:54.868 align:start position:0%
what we have here if there is um
another

05:55:54.868 --> 05:55:54.878 align:start position:0%
another
 
05:55:57.030 --> 05:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
because organic matter is really great
 
05:55:58.310 --> 05:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
for soil
 
05:56:00.788 --> 05:56:00.798 align:start position:0%
and making compost
 
05:56:03.670 --> 05:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
and um i don't know about you but my
 
05:56:07.110 --> 05:56:07.120 align:start position:0%
backyard is nothing but sand and having
 
05:56:10.470 --> 05:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
really good compost is really important
 
05:56:10.480 --> 05:56:12.070 align:start position:0%
really good compost is really important
um

05:56:12.070 --> 05:56:12.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:15.350 --> 05:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
that would be a really great solution
 
05:56:15.360 --> 05:56:16.548 align:start position:0%
that would be a really great solution
to

05:56:16.548 --> 05:56:16.558 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:56:19.110 --> 05:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
finding a new place for this kind of
 
05:56:20.788 --> 05:56:20.798 align:start position:0%
organic matter
 
05:56:20.798 --> 05:56:22.548 align:start position:0%
organic matter
um

05:56:22.548 --> 05:56:22.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:56:22.558 --> 05:56:25.350 align:start position:0%
um
so

05:56:25.350 --> 05:56:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:27.430 --> 05:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
05:56:29.510 --> 05:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i understand that but what i'm
 
05:56:32.310 --> 05:56:32.320 align:start position:0%
saying is um we have these landfills now
 
05:56:34.948 --> 05:56:34.958 align:start position:0%
they are there okay so i don't disagree
 
05:56:36.628 --> 05:56:36.638 align:start position:0%
with you we shouldn't be doing it this
 
05:56:36.638 --> 05:56:37.830 align:start position:0%
with you we shouldn't be doing it this
way

05:56:37.830 --> 05:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
way
 
05:56:40.470 --> 05:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
but these landfills are already there
 
05:56:40.480 --> 05:56:41.350 align:start position:0%
but these landfills are already there
uh

05:56:41.350 --> 05:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:56:43.670 --> 05:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh no one's come up with an idea of how
 
05:56:45.910 --> 05:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
to dismantle them or convert them to
 
05:56:48.470 --> 05:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
something else so do you see any way
 
05:56:51.190 --> 05:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
that we could possibly recover methane
 
05:56:51.200 --> 05:56:52.150 align:start position:0%
that we could possibly recover methane
from

05:56:52.150 --> 05:56:52.160 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:56:52.160 --> 05:56:53.030 align:start position:0%
from
these

05:56:53.030 --> 05:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:56:55.430 --> 05:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
closed landfills
 
05:56:57.430 --> 05:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
in an environmentally
 
05:57:00.230 --> 05:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
sound way so that we don't do more harm
 
05:57:01.350 --> 05:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
than good
 
05:57:04.788 --> 05:57:04.798 align:start position:0%
right and i think um there
 
05:57:06.948 --> 05:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
you know there's this study
 
05:57:09.750 --> 05:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately it's at the tail end
 
05:57:12.390 --> 05:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
i would flip that over and put the study
 
05:57:14.868 --> 05:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
at the beginning we heard from
 
05:57:16.868 --> 05:57:16.878 align:start position:0%
two speakers here that this is new
 
05:57:16.878 --> 05:57:18.948 align:start position:0%
two speakers here that this is new
technology

05:57:18.948 --> 05:57:18.958 align:start position:0%
technology
 
05:57:21.910 --> 05:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
that maybe there should be a thorough
 
05:57:24.390 --> 05:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
study first
 
05:57:25.590 --> 05:57:25.600 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:57:28.310 --> 05:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
look into this rfp process and maybe
 
05:57:30.548 --> 05:57:30.558 align:start position:0%
clear it up because it wasn't clear to
 
05:57:30.558 --> 05:57:31.350 align:start position:0%
clear it up because it wasn't clear to
me

05:57:31.350 --> 05:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
me
 
05:57:33.750 --> 05:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
that this was some sort of plot pilot
 
05:57:33.760 --> 05:57:34.948 align:start position:0%
that this was some sort of plot pilot
program

05:57:34.948 --> 05:57:34.958 align:start position:0%
program
 
05:57:37.190 --> 05:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
from this bill
 
05:57:40.230 --> 05:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
but certainly what lebanon is doing
 
05:57:42.708 --> 05:57:42.718 align:start position:0%
um the city of lebanon has
 
05:57:42.718 --> 05:57:43.670 align:start position:0%
um the city of lebanon has
just

05:57:43.670 --> 05:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:57:45.030 --> 05:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
05:57:47.910 --> 05:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
um piping out the gas or trucking out
 
05:57:51.030 --> 05:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
the gas which is the proposal at the puc
 
05:57:53.190 --> 05:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
this what they're doing in lebanon is
 
05:57:55.990 --> 05:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
that they have a generator right there
 
05:57:58.868 --> 05:57:58.878 align:start position:0%
and they're putting it into the wires
 
05:58:01.350 --> 05:58:01.360 align:start position:0%
the electricity directly into the wires
 
05:58:03.670 --> 05:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
that's certainly a lot more cost
 
05:58:06.150 --> 05:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
efficient for rate payers
 
05:58:08.230 --> 05:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
um okay that's uh
 
05:58:09.910 --> 05:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
that's a little bit off subject for the
 
05:58:11.830 --> 05:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
bill but we appreciate that sure we're
 
05:58:13.430 --> 05:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
going to move on because we still have a
 
05:58:15.030 --> 05:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
lot of people to testify and i'm going
 
05:58:17.670 --> 05:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
to call next on kelly buchanan of clean
 
05:58:20.070 --> 05:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
energy new hampshire who supports the
 
05:58:20.080 --> 05:58:31.030 align:start position:0%
energy new hampshire who supports the
bill

05:58:31.030 --> 05:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:33.190 --> 05:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
and has written testimony for us thank
 
05:58:35.590 --> 05:58:35.600 align:start position:0%
you ms buchanan of course thank you mr
 
05:58:37.190 --> 05:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
chair and members of the committee i
 
05:58:39.430 --> 05:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
will be exceedingly brief seeing as we
 
05:58:41.670 --> 05:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
are short on time
 
05:58:43.190 --> 05:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
but for the record my name is kelly
 
05:58:45.670 --> 05:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
buchanan i'm the director of legislative
 
05:58:47.670 --> 05:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
and regulatory affairs at clean energy
 
05:58:49.830 --> 05:58:49.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and we are in support of
 
05:58:51.830 --> 05:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
senate bill 424
 
05:58:53.990 --> 05:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
and its potential to capture sources of
 
05:58:57.110 --> 05:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
methane from existing waste streams
 
05:58:58.948 --> 05:58:58.958 align:start position:0%
so in our interview locally produced
 
05:59:00.948 --> 05:59:00.958 align:start position:0%
energy is one of the most important
 
05:59:03.270 --> 05:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
tools to enable the diversified energy
 
05:59:04.948 --> 05:59:04.958 align:start position:0%
landscape that caters to our energy
 
05:59:07.350 --> 05:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
independence a lower cost of energy and
 
05:59:09.430 --> 05:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
local economic development
 
05:59:12.310 --> 05:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh senate bill 420 beam time really
 
05:59:14.948 --> 05:59:14.958 align:start position:0%
um so while we believe that renewable
 
05:59:17.670 --> 05:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
natural gas isn't quite as
 
05:59:19.670 --> 05:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
sunny in terms of outlook and other
 
05:59:22.310 --> 05:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources like solar
 
05:59:24.230 --> 05:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
hydro or wind
 
05:59:27.190 --> 05:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
it is a potential near-term solution to
 
05:59:29.590 --> 05:59:29.600 align:start position:0%
reducing our reliance on natural gas
 
05:59:30.948 --> 05:59:30.958 align:start position:0%
especially as we've seen some of the
 
05:59:33.190 --> 05:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
highest prices and
 
05:59:35.510 --> 05:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
increasing instability in that market
 
05:59:37.110 --> 05:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
so i'll be glad to take any questions
 
05:59:38.548 --> 05:59:38.558 align:start position:0%
that you may have for me today but
 
05:59:40.948 --> 05:59:40.958 align:start position:0%
otherwise that concludes my testimony
 
05:59:42.948 --> 05:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
thank you i sincerely regret that
 
05:59:44.788 --> 05:59:44.798 align:start position:0%
representative platt wasn't here to hear
 
05:59:46.620 --> 05:59:46.630 align:start position:0%
you talk about the sunny outlook
 
05:59:46.630 --> 05:59:48.628 align:start position:0%
you talk about the sunny outlook
[Laughter]

05:59:48.628 --> 05:59:48.638 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:59:51.430 --> 05:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
for uh renewable energy okay questions
 
05:59:51.440 --> 05:59:52.548 align:start position:0%
for uh renewable energy okay questions
for

05:59:52.548 --> 05:59:52.558 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:59:54.470 --> 05:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
ms buchanan
 
05:59:57.030 --> 05:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts
 
05:59:59.590 --> 05:59:59.600 align:start position:0%
question that wasn't answered the last
 
06:00:02.788 --> 06:00:02.798 align:start position:0%
time do you have any uh information on
 
06:00:05.430 --> 06:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
new on unh study
 
06:00:08.868 --> 06:00:08.878 align:start position:0%
what the reduction or the spread of
 
06:00:11.030 --> 06:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
methane gas is or anything like that
 
06:00:11.040 --> 06:00:11.910 align:start position:0%
methane gas is or anything like that
just

06:00:11.910 --> 06:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
just
 
06:00:14.868 --> 06:00:14.878 align:start position:0%
is is it available and do you have it
 
06:00:16.788 --> 06:00:16.798 align:start position:0%
i do not have it off the top of my head
 
06:00:18.150 --> 06:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
but i would be happy to look into that
 
06:00:20.868 --> 06:00:20.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:22.708 --> 06:00:22.718 align:start position:0%
ms buchanan thank you for being here
 
06:00:27.510 --> 06:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:30.150 --> 06:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
who would like to oppose the bill and mr
 
06:00:32.470 --> 06:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
tuthill i'll give you two minutes thank
 
06:00:35.910 --> 06:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman members of the committee
 
06:00:37.350 --> 06:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
this is a bill i really would have liked
 
06:00:40.150 --> 06:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
to have supported and
 
06:00:41.670 --> 06:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
i'm john tuthill from akwas new
 
06:00:43.350 --> 06:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire sullivan county former member
 
06:00:45.430 --> 06:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
of the ena
 
06:00:48.628 --> 06:00:48.638 align:start position:0%
and i was glad that uh the senate had
 
06:00:49.990 --> 06:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
made the amendments they made i think
 
06:00:51.430 --> 06:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
that improves the bill but i don't think
 
06:00:53.510 --> 06:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
we're ready for this yet particularly
 
06:00:55.910 --> 06:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
looking at senate bill 367
 
06:00:58.310 --> 06:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with 424
 
06:01:00.470 --> 06:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
that one is over at ena right now
 
06:01:02.150 --> 06:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh these two bills need to be looked at
 
06:01:04.470 --> 06:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
together my main focus over the last
 
06:01:06.708 --> 06:01:06.718 align:start position:0%
decades has been on on solid waste
 
06:01:06.718 --> 06:01:08.230 align:start position:0%
decades has been on on solid waste
policy

06:01:08.230 --> 06:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
policy
 
06:01:10.708 --> 06:01:10.718 align:start position:0%
uh and landfills but um
 
06:01:12.548 --> 06:01:12.558 align:start position:0%
in the case of this bill while landfills
 
06:01:14.548 --> 06:01:14.558 align:start position:0%
are important and an important component
 
06:01:17.990 --> 06:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
of development of of rng as a
 
06:01:19.590 --> 06:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
resource in the state for energy
 
06:01:19.600 --> 06:01:20.628 align:start position:0%
resource in the state for energy
production

06:01:20.628 --> 06:01:20.638 align:start position:0%
production
 
06:01:22.230 --> 06:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
the ones that i think we really need to
 
06:01:22.240 --> 06:01:22.948 align:start position:0%
the ones that i think we really need to
be

06:01:22.948 --> 06:01:22.958 align:start position:0%
be
 
06:01:24.310 --> 06:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
careful about
 
06:01:25.830 --> 06:01:25.840 align:start position:0%
are some of these other emerging
 
06:01:28.070 --> 06:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
technologies modern pyrolysis
 
06:01:30.948 --> 06:01:30.958 align:start position:0%
gasification chemical recycling
 
06:01:33.430 --> 06:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
all of these have got the potential for
 
06:01:33.440 --> 06:01:34.788 align:start position:0%
all of these have got the potential for
generating

06:01:34.788 --> 06:01:34.798 align:start position:0%
generating
 
06:01:37.110 --> 06:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
a marketable product syn gas for example
 
06:01:39.190 --> 06:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
by other bio gases and there are
 
06:01:42.390 --> 06:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
contamination issues related to all of
 
06:01:44.868 --> 06:01:44.878 align:start position:0%
this production when you're using
 
06:01:47.830 --> 06:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
waste products as your feed stock so
 
06:01:49.430 --> 06:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
i really think this bill needs to go to
 
06:01:52.070 --> 06:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
study i think that des needs to be more
 
06:01:52.080 --> 06:01:53.110 align:start position:0%
study i think that des needs to be more
involved

06:01:53.110 --> 06:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
involved
 
06:01:55.910 --> 06:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
in this particular bill in 424 i'm very
 
06:01:57.750 --> 06:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
glad to see some consideration of the
 
06:02:00.470 --> 06:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
public interest or what in des world is
 
06:02:02.150 --> 06:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
called public benefit
 
06:02:04.788 --> 06:02:04.798 align:start position:0%
but i think that that consideration does
 
06:02:07.110 --> 06:02:07.120 align:start position:0%
need to con include
 
06:02:09.670 --> 06:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
some thought about climate impacts
 
06:02:12.788 --> 06:02:12.798 align:start position:0%
air pollution water pollution potential
 
06:02:14.628 --> 06:02:14.638 align:start position:0%
which have in the past
 
06:02:16.788 --> 06:02:16.798 align:start position:0%
and including at turnkey in rochester
 
06:02:18.628 --> 06:02:18.638 align:start position:0%
have been associated with
 
06:02:21.190 --> 06:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
some of the gas collection 30 seconds
 
06:02:22.788 --> 06:02:22.798 align:start position:0%
thank you some of the gas collection
 
06:02:24.708 --> 06:02:24.718 align:start position:0%
systems i'll leave it right there i did
 
06:02:27.190 --> 06:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
submit a brief note
 
06:02:29.030 --> 06:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh to members of the committee just
 
06:02:30.708 --> 06:02:30.718 align:start position:0%
before i came down
 
06:02:32.788 --> 06:02:32.798 align:start position:0%
but i do hope that you will consider
 
06:02:35.030 --> 06:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
sending this to study along with 367
 
06:02:36.628 --> 06:02:36.638 align:start position:0%
work on them together
 
06:02:38.708 --> 06:02:38.718 align:start position:0%
and bring in the environmental
 
06:02:41.030 --> 06:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
side of this question thank you
 
06:02:43.750 --> 06:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you 367 is a waste
 
06:02:47.110 --> 06:02:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh a landfill bill that's correct well
 
06:02:48.470 --> 06:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
not necessarily no it's more a
 
06:02:50.708 --> 06:02:50.718 align:start position:0%
technology bill in my opinion this bill
 
06:02:52.310 --> 06:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
could be considered more of a landfill
 
06:02:55.190 --> 06:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
bill 367 they call it advanced recycling
 
06:02:57.270 --> 06:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
i call it chemical recycling
 
06:02:57.280 --> 06:02:57.990 align:start position:0%
i call it chemical recycling
um

06:02:57.990 --> 06:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:59.990 --> 06:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
it is actually mentioned if you look at
 
06:03:02.708 --> 06:03:02.718 align:start position:0%
some of the definitions in the bill here
 
06:03:02.718 --> 06:03:03.910 align:start position:0%
some of the definitions in the bill here
um

06:03:03.910 --> 06:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:05.670 --> 06:03:05.680 align:start position:0%
this is not just about landfills this is
 
06:03:08.868 --> 06:03:08.878 align:start position:0%
about a number of different technologies
 
06:03:10.390 --> 06:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
great thank you any further questions
 
06:03:13.670 --> 06:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
for mr tuthill representative partial
 
06:03:15.270 --> 06:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
thank you sir votes
 
06:03:15.280 --> 06:03:16.470 align:start position:0%
thank you sir votes
um

06:03:16.470 --> 06:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:17.830 --> 06:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
as you are
 
06:03:17.840 --> 06:03:18.548 align:start position:0%
as you are
uh

06:03:18.548 --> 06:03:18.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:03:21.350 --> 06:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
admittedly uh somewhat knowledgeable on
 
06:03:21.360 --> 06:03:22.628 align:start position:0%
admittedly uh somewhat knowledgeable on
landfills

06:03:22.628 --> 06:03:22.638 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
06:03:22.638 --> 06:03:24.390 align:start position:0%
landfills
um

06:03:24.390 --> 06:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:03:25.990 --> 06:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
we are going to be looking down the line
 
06:03:28.948 --> 06:03:28.958 align:start position:0%
at the public good on this bill um
 
06:03:30.788 --> 06:03:30.798 align:start position:0%
but my concern is there's no baseline to
 
06:03:33.110 --> 06:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
know i mean if if what our current
 
06:03:34.708 --> 06:03:34.718 align:start position:0%
situation is when it comes to methane
 
06:03:34.718 --> 06:03:35.750 align:start position:0%
situation is when it comes to methane
production

06:03:35.750 --> 06:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
production
 
06:03:37.670 --> 06:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
methane off gassing on our current
 
06:03:37.680 --> 06:03:38.788 align:start position:0%
methane off gassing on our current
landfills

06:03:38.788 --> 06:03:38.798 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
06:03:40.470 --> 06:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
so it could be comparing
 
06:03:42.788 --> 06:03:42.798 align:start position:0%
two years down the line
 
06:03:45.510 --> 06:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
the potential increase or decrease this
 
06:03:47.750 --> 06:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
increase or decrease in methane
 
06:03:47.760 --> 06:03:48.948 align:start position:0%
increase or decrease in methane
production

06:03:48.948 --> 06:03:48.958 align:start position:0%
production
 
06:03:50.788 --> 06:03:50.798 align:start position:0%
to uh numbers that we don't currently
 
06:03:52.708 --> 06:03:52.718 align:start position:0%
have are you concerned about not having
 
06:03:54.708 --> 06:03:54.718 align:start position:0%
a baseline established before you
 
06:03:57.190 --> 06:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
proceed with this technology
 
06:03:58.310 --> 06:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question that
 
06:03:59.750 --> 06:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
certainly be one of the things i think
 
06:04:01.350 --> 06:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
could be looked at for studying but
 
06:04:02.868 --> 06:04:02.878 align:start position:0%
realize that
 
06:04:04.948 --> 06:04:04.958 align:start position:0%
waste management's very large landfill a
 
06:04:07.750 --> 06:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
regional landfill in rochester is
 
06:04:07.760 --> 06:04:08.948 align:start position:0%
regional landfill in rochester is
already

06:04:08.948 --> 06:04:08.958 align:start position:0%
already
 
06:04:08.958 --> 06:04:09.990 align:start position:0%
already
collecting

06:04:09.990 --> 06:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
collecting
 
06:04:12.150 --> 06:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
considerable amounts of methane and it
 
06:04:13.910 --> 06:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
is being used for energy at the unh
 
06:04:16.470 --> 06:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
campus so that's been going on for years
 
06:04:16.480 --> 06:04:17.830 align:start position:0%
campus so that's been going on for years
um

06:04:17.830 --> 06:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:04:19.350 --> 06:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
in bethlehem
 
06:04:21.830 --> 06:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately they the company
 
06:04:23.350 --> 06:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
operating that landfill owns that
 
06:04:25.510 --> 06:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
landfill decided not to
 
06:04:27.190 --> 06:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
be capturing methane for energy
 
06:04:29.590 --> 06:04:29.600 align:start position:0%
production but they have been flaring it
 
06:04:31.350 --> 06:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
so the only area that really is emitting
 
06:04:33.830 --> 06:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
direct methane is is the open face the
 
06:04:35.350 --> 06:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
uncapped areas
 
06:04:37.110 --> 06:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
so methane
 
06:04:38.548 --> 06:04:38.558 align:start position:0%
is a serious issue i think as the
 
06:04:40.708 --> 06:04:40.718 align:start position:0%
chairman has pointed out however
 
06:04:43.110 --> 06:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
landfills are only a piece of that
 
06:04:44.708 --> 06:04:44.718 align:start position:0%
problem if you look at this globally and
 
06:04:47.190 --> 06:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
in terms of climate um you want to be
 
06:04:48.948 --> 06:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
thinking a lot more just about how do we
 
06:04:50.310 --> 06:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
start reducing
 
06:04:53.110 --> 06:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh greenhouse gases in in our entire
 
06:04:55.190 --> 06:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
system through human activities
 
06:04:57.110 --> 06:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh landfills are at the waste sector it
 
06:04:58.788 --> 06:04:58.798 align:start position:0%
has been estimated is roughly seven
 
06:04:58.798 --> 06:05:00.070 align:start position:0%
has been estimated is roughly seven
percent

06:05:00.070 --> 06:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
percent
 
06:05:01.910 --> 06:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
or some of some are found in studies
 
06:05:03.110 --> 06:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
it's about seven percent of our
 
06:05:05.350 --> 06:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
contribution to man-made greenhouse
 
06:05:07.670 --> 06:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
gases but that's the entire waste
 
06:05:09.830 --> 06:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
system transportation
 
06:05:12.628 --> 06:05:12.638 align:start position:0%
disposal uh processing
 
06:05:14.788 --> 06:05:14.798 align:start position:0%
so it's significant
 
06:05:17.110 --> 06:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you mr tuttle we appreciate
 
06:05:18.548 --> 06:05:18.558 align:start position:0%
it we have three more people who want to
 
06:05:21.110 --> 06:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
testify but before we let them do that
 
06:05:22.230 --> 06:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
i will
 
06:05:24.310 --> 06:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing on
 
06:05:27.190 --> 06:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
senate bill 429 fn
 
06:05:29.110 --> 06:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
which is relative to the site evaluation
 
06:05:31.910 --> 06:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
committee and i will recess that
 
06:05:33.830 --> 06:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
public hearing until we finish this one
 
06:05:34.788 --> 06:05:34.798 align:start position:0%
is that all right with you
 
06:05:37.830 --> 06:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
representative guida thank you
 
06:05:40.548 --> 06:05:40.558 align:start position:0%
okay so next person to testify will be
 
06:05:43.430 --> 06:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
nick krakoff of the conservative
 
06:05:47.110 --> 06:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh conservation law foundation
 
06:05:48.548 --> 06:05:48.558 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to give you two minutes
 
06:05:49.590 --> 06:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
how's that
 
06:05:51.430 --> 06:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
that's fine thank you thank you i'm
 
06:05:53.030 --> 06:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
honorable committee members my name is
 
06:05:54.470 --> 06:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
nick krakow i'm with the conservation
 
06:05:56.070 --> 06:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
law foundation
 
06:05:58.948 --> 06:05:58.958 align:start position:0%
um so today we talked a lot about guard
 
06:06:01.910 --> 06:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
rails with with uh sb424
 
06:06:03.430 --> 06:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
and frankly there just aren't enough
 
06:06:05.190 --> 06:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
guardrails with this bill to ensure that
 
06:06:07.270 --> 06:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
it's in the public interest
 
06:06:09.190 --> 06:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
that's why clf is proposing a number of
 
06:06:11.670 --> 06:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
amendments i provided written comments
 
06:06:13.510 --> 06:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
by email to the members of the committee
 
06:06:15.350 --> 06:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
so you'll see those amendments outlined
 
06:06:16.390 --> 06:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
in more detail there but i'm going to
 
06:06:18.868 --> 06:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
talk about them briefly right now
 
06:06:22.230 --> 06:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
in general rng cost significantly more
 
06:06:25.030 --> 06:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
than traditional natural gas
 
06:06:26.230 --> 06:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
several people talked about this
 
06:06:28.230 --> 06:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
proposal before the puc
 
06:06:30.310 --> 06:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
there uh there were several analyses
 
06:06:33.270 --> 06:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
done on that proposal they found that
 
06:06:35.670 --> 06:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
rng costs three times more
 
06:06:37.910 --> 06:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
than um the traditional natural gas so
 
06:06:40.070 --> 06:06:40.080 align:start position:0%
this is a burden to rate payers
 
06:06:42.470 --> 06:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
um you know maybe someday it'll be
 
06:06:43.910 --> 06:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
cheaper than traditional natural gas but
 
06:06:45.830 --> 06:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
we're not there yet so we need guard
 
06:06:47.430 --> 06:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
rails in place to make sure this isn't
 
06:06:48.708 --> 06:06:48.718 align:start position:0%
going to burden rate payers too
 
06:06:48.718 --> 06:06:50.708 align:start position:0%
going to burden rate payers too
extensively

06:06:50.708 --> 06:06:50.718 align:start position:0%
extensively
 
06:06:52.230 --> 06:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
and so the bill doesn't have those guard
 
06:06:53.590 --> 06:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
rails in place
 
06:06:55.350 --> 06:06:55.360 align:start position:0%
looking at the um
 
06:06:57.030 --> 06:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
the discussion of sort of the greenhouse
 
06:06:58.948 --> 06:06:58.958 align:start position:0%
gas emissions benefits
 
06:06:58.958 --> 06:06:59.910 align:start position:0%
gas emissions benefits
um

06:06:59.910 --> 06:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:07:01.510 --> 06:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
you know that language doesn't provide
 
06:07:03.590 --> 06:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
enough protections in place to ensure
 
06:07:05.590 --> 06:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
that this bill is in the public interest
 
06:07:08.310 --> 06:07:08.320 align:start position:0%
for example the language there does not
 
06:07:11.350 --> 06:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
um properly account for methane leakage
 
06:07:14.230 --> 06:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
from remove from rng
 
06:07:15.590 --> 06:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
that language needs to be strengthened
 
06:07:17.510 --> 06:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
to ensure that it properly accounts for
 
06:07:19.590 --> 06:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
that leakage as well as for the
 
06:07:21.750 --> 06:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
transportation emissions involved with
 
06:07:23.670 --> 06:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
transporting the gas from
 
06:07:23.680 --> 06:07:24.868 align:start position:0%
transporting the gas from
landfills

06:07:24.868 --> 06:07:24.878 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
06:07:26.868 --> 06:07:26.878 align:start position:0%
to distribution networks
 
06:07:28.708 --> 06:07:28.718 align:start position:0%
second you know as i was mentioned
 
06:07:31.030 --> 06:07:31.040 align:start position:0%
earlier this this gas is often sourced
 
06:07:32.788 --> 06:07:32.798 align:start position:0%
from landfills
 
06:07:34.070 --> 06:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
now there's nothing in the bill to
 
06:07:36.708 --> 06:07:36.718 align:start position:0%
ensure that this doesn't contribute to
 
06:07:39.030 --> 06:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
building new landfills or expanding
 
06:07:41.350 --> 06:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
existing landfills 30 seconds so for
 
06:07:43.910 --> 06:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
those reasons c clf is proposing a
 
06:07:46.070 --> 06:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
number of amendments those are outlined
 
06:07:47.830 --> 06:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
in further detail in the written
 
06:07:49.990 --> 06:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
comments which i already provided um i
 
06:07:51.590 --> 06:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
encourage you to look at those comments
 
06:07:52.868 --> 06:07:52.878 align:start position:0%
that provide a little more detail on
 
06:07:54.788 --> 06:07:54.798 align:start position:0%
what we're thinking but i usually to
 
06:07:54.798 --> 06:07:55.750 align:start position:0%
what we're thinking but i usually to
only

06:07:55.750 --> 06:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
only
 
06:07:57.270 --> 06:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
pass this bill if those amendments that
 
06:07:59.430 --> 06:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
are in our written comments are
 
06:07:59.440 --> 06:08:01.830 align:start position:0%
are in our written comments are
adopted

06:08:01.830 --> 06:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
06:08:04.070 --> 06:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
very good thank you very much are there
 
06:08:05.590 --> 06:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee about
 
06:08:08.788 --> 06:08:08.798 align:start position:0%
those amendments or anything else
 
06:08:10.788 --> 06:08:10.798 align:start position:0%
they're in your email
 
06:08:13.110 --> 06:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
your legislative email i took a look at
 
06:08:14.948 --> 06:08:14.958 align:start position:0%
them myself
 
06:08:16.948 --> 06:08:16.958 align:start position:0%
uh and i have no questions anybody else
 
06:08:19.430 --> 06:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
have questions see none
 
06:08:20.868 --> 06:08:20.878 align:start position:0%
uh did you
 
06:08:22.708 --> 06:08:22.718 align:start position:0%
start to raise your hand representative
 
06:08:24.788 --> 06:08:24.798 align:start position:0%
breshney thank you uh
 
06:08:26.070 --> 06:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
my question is to something you said
 
06:08:26.080 --> 06:08:26.788 align:start position:0%
my question is to something you said
that

06:08:26.788 --> 06:08:26.798 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:08:28.788 --> 06:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
that rng is three times as much as
 
06:08:30.390 --> 06:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
natural gas
 
06:08:32.070 --> 06:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
if we're not doing this how do we know
 
06:08:33.670 --> 06:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
that it's going to be three times as
 
06:08:35.830 --> 06:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
much as rng thank you well i'm talking
 
06:08:37.110 --> 06:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
about the particular proposal that was
 
06:08:37.120 --> 06:08:38.230 align:start position:0%
about the particular proposal that was
before

06:08:38.230 --> 06:08:38.240 align:start position:0%
before
 
06:08:40.788 --> 06:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
the puc that was filed last year you
 
06:08:43.510 --> 06:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
know their analyses done by the oca as
 
06:08:45.030 --> 06:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
well as from the department of energy
 
06:08:46.868 --> 06:08:46.878 align:start position:0%
they found that that particular proposal
 
06:08:48.708 --> 06:08:48.718 align:start position:0%
would be three times more expensive per
 
06:08:50.708 --> 06:08:50.718 align:start position:0%
deca therm for rate payers and i'm not
 
06:08:51.990 --> 06:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
gonna say that's gonna be that expensive
 
06:08:53.190 --> 06:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
all the time but for that particular
 
06:08:53.200 --> 06:08:56.310 align:start position:0%
all the time but for that particular
proposal

06:08:56.310 --> 06:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:58.310 --> 06:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you very much and
 
06:09:01.030 --> 06:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
our last uh well now our next to last
 
06:09:03.510 --> 06:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
our pent ultimate testifier on this bill
 
06:09:05.910 --> 06:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
will be jason stock from the timberland
 
06:09:18.868 --> 06:09:18.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:20.628 --> 06:09:20.638 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh for the record i'm
 
06:09:22.390 --> 06:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
jason stock i'm the executive director
 
06:09:23.830 --> 06:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire timberland owners
 
06:09:26.548 --> 06:09:26.558 align:start position:0%
association and uh i did not plan on
 
06:09:28.390 --> 06:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
testifying today but given the
 
06:09:30.628 --> 06:09:30.638 align:start position:0%
conversation and the debate i've got two
 
06:09:31.990 --> 06:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
minutes gotcha
 
06:09:32.000 --> 06:09:32.788 align:start position:0%
minutes gotcha
um

06:09:32.788 --> 06:09:32.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:09:34.548 --> 06:09:34.558 align:start position:0%
given the conversation it was all about
 
06:09:37.590 --> 06:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
landfills i wanted to point out biomass
 
06:09:39.670 --> 06:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
and biogas are very much a part of this
 
06:09:41.750 --> 06:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
bill and
 
06:09:43.030 --> 06:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things
 
06:09:43.040 --> 06:09:43.990 align:start position:0%
one of the things
that

06:09:43.990 --> 06:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:09:45.430 --> 06:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
you know it's an emerging as you heard
 
06:09:47.350 --> 06:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
from a previous speaker an emerging
 
06:09:50.390 --> 06:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
technology is looking at using
 
06:09:53.350 --> 06:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
whole tree tips biomass as a potential
 
06:09:56.150 --> 06:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
energy source and gasifying them
 
06:09:59.270 --> 06:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
as you folks passed earlier this or as
 
06:10:01.350 --> 06:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
the house passed i should say earliest
 
06:10:04.868 --> 06:10:04.878 align:start position:0%
earlier this session house bill 105 that
 
06:10:07.030 --> 06:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
is designed to look at emerging markets
 
06:10:09.590 --> 06:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
for low-grade wood we see this bill as
 
06:10:13.750 --> 06:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
kind of a almost a fit with that because
 
06:10:15.990 --> 06:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
because energy markets this is a
 
06:10:17.590 --> 06:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
potential fit with that bill because
 
06:10:19.270 --> 06:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
this could pave the way for some of
 
06:10:21.110 --> 06:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
those emerging markets that house bill
 
06:10:23.750 --> 06:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
1005 is going to be looking at and
 
06:10:25.990 --> 06:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
exploring to help address the low-grade
 
06:10:27.990 --> 06:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
wood crisis that the forest products
 
06:10:29.990 --> 06:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
industry is facing
 
06:10:30.000 --> 06:10:31.030 align:start position:0%
industry is facing
and

06:10:31.030 --> 06:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:10:33.510 --> 06:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
to representative mcgee's concerns about
 
06:10:36.628 --> 06:10:36.638 align:start position:0%
some of the renewable renewable aspects
 
06:10:38.548 --> 06:10:38.558 align:start position:0%
of it when we look at biomass
 
06:10:42.868 --> 06:10:42.878 align:start position:0%
gasification on page 1 line 27 that ties
 
06:10:45.510 --> 06:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
specifically to the definition
 
06:10:47.670 --> 06:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
when we talk about biomass that's used
 
06:10:50.470 --> 06:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
in the rps that was a definition that
 
06:10:52.788 --> 06:10:52.798 align:start position:0%
had been contemplated and looked at
 
06:10:52.798 --> 06:10:54.070 align:start position:0%
had been contemplated and looked at
embedded

06:10:54.070 --> 06:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
embedded
 
06:10:56.070 --> 06:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
in the context of what is quote
 
06:10:59.510 --> 06:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
renewable biomass and so that that piece
 
06:11:01.750 --> 06:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
from our point of view is
 
06:11:02.708 --> 06:11:02.718 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
06:11:04.390 --> 06:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
checks that box
 
06:11:07.750 --> 06:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
and that again ties back into page two
 
06:11:10.628 --> 06:11:10.638 align:start position:0%
line 24 where we talk of where it talks
 
06:11:13.990 --> 06:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
about rng so that's kind of the
 
06:11:15.830 --> 06:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
how this threads through and how this
 
06:11:18.310 --> 06:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
connects to to wood chips forest
 
06:11:21.030 --> 06:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
products and i would argue in conclusion
 
06:11:23.430 --> 06:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
i would argue that when we look at
 
06:11:24.868 --> 06:11:24.878 align:start position:0%
public good
 
06:11:26.548 --> 06:11:26.558 align:start position:0%
and you're going to hear more about this
 
06:11:28.470 --> 06:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
probably tomorrow when we look at public
 
06:11:30.948 --> 06:11:30.958 align:start position:0%
good we look at biomass
 
06:11:32.310 --> 06:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
we look at
 
06:11:34.390 --> 06:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
look at the big picture look at our
 
06:11:36.628 --> 06:11:36.638 align:start position:0%
forest look at the jobs that that are in
 
06:11:38.708 --> 06:11:38.718 align:start position:0%
our forest products industry and how
 
06:11:40.948 --> 06:11:40.958 align:start position:0%
this dovetails with the state's
 
06:11:42.788 --> 06:11:42.798 align:start position:0%
rural economies
 
06:11:42.798 --> 06:11:43.750 align:start position:0%
rural economies
and

06:11:43.750 --> 06:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:11:45.590 --> 06:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
the health of our forest and our ability
 
06:11:47.750 --> 06:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
to perform sustainable management you've
 
06:11:50.548 --> 06:11:50.558 align:start position:0%
all heard it before this is this is also
 
06:11:52.070 --> 06:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
a piece of it we look at it as a
 
06:11:54.470 --> 06:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
potential emerging market
 
06:11:56.310 --> 06:11:56.320 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to try and answer any
 
06:11:56.320 --> 06:11:58.150 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to try and answer any
questions

06:11:58.150 --> 06:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:12:00.548 --> 06:12:00.558 align:start position:0%
two minutes 30 seconds pretty good
 
06:12:03.030 --> 06:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
okay any questions for
 
06:12:05.510 --> 06:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative samsuch has one
 
06:12:07.990 --> 06:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you mr stock
 
06:12:10.150 --> 06:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh can you um
 
06:12:12.628 --> 06:12:12.638 align:start position:0%
elaborate how you see
 
06:12:14.470 --> 06:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
um the
 
06:12:14.480 --> 06:12:15.670 align:start position:0%
um the
um

06:12:15.670 --> 06:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:17.110 --> 06:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
the wood wood
 
06:12:19.750 --> 06:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
industry and the um
 
06:12:22.708 --> 06:12:22.718 align:start position:0%
wood products becoming a part of this
 
06:12:25.350 --> 06:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
is that separate from the methane
 
06:12:27.510 --> 06:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
portion now you're talking about yeah i
 
06:12:29.510 --> 06:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
mean i i would say
 
06:12:32.470 --> 06:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
that the nexus here is
 
06:12:34.548 --> 06:12:34.558 align:start position:0%
let's say you have a sawmill that's
 
06:12:37.110 --> 06:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
producing mill waste out the back end of
 
06:12:38.230 --> 06:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
that mill
 
06:12:41.270 --> 06:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
chipped slabs bark sawdust
 
06:12:43.350 --> 06:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
there are emerging technologies now that
 
06:12:44.628 --> 06:12:44.638 align:start position:0%
can take that
 
06:12:46.628 --> 06:12:46.638 align:start position:0%
product or looking at taking that
 
06:12:49.430 --> 06:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
product and gasifying it
 
06:12:51.590 --> 06:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
um and producing a
 
06:12:54.628 --> 06:12:54.638 align:start position:0%
either a liquid fuel or a what i would
 
06:12:57.750 --> 06:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
call rng out of it if that let's say
 
06:12:59.750 --> 06:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
that saw mill or that facility is
 
06:13:02.390 --> 06:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
located in conjunction with an existing
 
06:13:04.310 --> 06:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
gas line
 
06:13:06.470 --> 06:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
there you go you can tap right into that
 
06:13:09.590 --> 06:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
gas line and provide it
 
06:13:12.548 --> 06:13:12.558 align:start position:0%
and so that's that's how we we view it
 
06:13:14.390 --> 06:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
is there's another this creates some
 
06:13:16.788 --> 06:13:16.798 align:start position:0%
opportunities for our industry down the
 
06:13:16.798 --> 06:13:19.750 align:start position:0%
opportunities for our industry down the
road

06:13:19.750 --> 06:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:21.430 --> 06:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
06:13:24.548 --> 06:13:24.558 align:start position:0%
representative callie pitts
 
06:13:28.868 --> 06:13:28.878 align:start position:0%
jason uh thank you sure i
 
06:13:31.350 --> 06:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
when i heard you say tree tips i think
 
06:13:35.110 --> 06:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
you said tree tips or treetops whatever
 
06:13:37.430 --> 06:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
we in this
 
06:13:39.510 --> 06:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
state i believe pretty soon are going to
 
06:13:41.990 --> 06:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
have a landfill crisis will we be
 
06:13:44.868 --> 06:13:44.878 align:start position:0%
filling up our landfill with free tips
 
06:13:48.230 --> 06:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
and bottoms and things that people don't
 
06:13:52.868 --> 06:13:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:54.948 --> 06:13:54.958 align:start position:0%
is that contributory they i know they
 
06:13:57.110 --> 06:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
biodegrade but they take a while to do
 
06:13:57.120 --> 06:13:58.470 align:start position:0%
biodegrade but they take a while to do
that

06:13:58.470 --> 06:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:13:59.830 --> 06:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
yeah they do i
 
06:13:59.840 --> 06:14:01.110 align:start position:0%
yeah they do i
mean

06:14:01.110 --> 06:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
mean
 
06:14:03.430 --> 06:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
i don't i'd hate to see that day when we
 
06:14:06.230 --> 06:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
take either chips from a sawmill or
 
06:14:08.150 --> 06:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
sawdust from a sawmill
 
06:14:10.868 --> 06:14:10.878 align:start position:0%
and or tree tips chipped wood
 
06:14:13.030 --> 06:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
and just have to land fill it
 
06:14:15.270 --> 06:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
again as an organization
 
06:14:17.270 --> 06:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
we we believe this is a renewable
 
06:14:19.430 --> 06:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
resource there are opportunities to
 
06:14:21.910 --> 06:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
capture energy from it and
 
06:14:24.070 --> 06:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
and even other products from it
 
06:14:27.270 --> 06:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
house bill 1005 looks at that
 
06:14:30.070 --> 06:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
this also creates an opportunity to try
 
06:14:33.430 --> 06:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
to look at all right is rng one of those
 
06:14:36.230 --> 06:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
pieces that can capture the value
 
06:14:37.990 --> 06:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
it would be pretty sad to see that
 
06:14:39.910 --> 06:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
renewable resource being dumped into a
 
06:14:42.150 --> 06:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
landfill just because there's literally
 
06:14:44.788 --> 06:14:44.798 align:start position:0%
no other home for it
 
06:14:46.708 --> 06:14:46.718 align:start position:0%
and that's a good closing statement so
 
06:14:48.948 --> 06:14:48.958 align:start position:0%
we appreciate your testimony uh thank
 
06:14:50.948 --> 06:14:50.958 align:start position:0%
you mr stock
 
06:14:55.510 --> 06:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
and our last speaker on this bill is
 
06:14:57.830 --> 06:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
mark brown from the consumer energy
 
06:15:10.548 --> 06:15:10.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:11.910 --> 06:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
06:15:13.510 --> 06:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is mark
 
06:15:14.948 --> 06:15:14.958 align:start position:0%
brown i'm executive director of new
 
06:15:17.270 --> 06:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
england for consumer energy alliance
 
06:15:19.510 --> 06:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
and on behalf of caa i want to thank you
 
06:15:20.628 --> 06:15:20.638 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to speak today in
 
06:15:23.590 --> 06:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
support of senate bill 424
 
06:15:25.590 --> 06:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
senate bill 424 is a forward-looking
 
06:15:25.600 --> 06:15:26.470 align:start position:0%
senate bill 424 is a forward-looking
bill

06:15:26.470 --> 06:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:15:27.830 --> 06:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
it will help prepare new hampshire and
 
06:15:30.150 --> 06:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
its gas utilities for what the future of
 
06:15:32.230 --> 06:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
the natural gas distribution system
 
06:15:33.670 --> 06:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
might look like
 
06:15:35.590 --> 06:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
the bill is a prime example of how
 
06:15:37.030 --> 06:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
thoughtful legislation can balance
 
06:15:39.350 --> 06:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
competing public interests
 
06:15:41.590 --> 06:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
the provisions in sb424 will result in a
 
06:15:43.430 --> 06:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
cleaner natural gas system with lower
 
06:15:45.270 --> 06:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
emissions and ancillary benefits like
 
06:15:48.070 --> 06:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
cleaner waste water streams
 
06:15:49.990 --> 06:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
it will also help to ensure reliability
 
06:15:51.430 --> 06:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
of the gas system
 
06:15:53.110 --> 06:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
and preserve consumer choice by
 
06:15:55.270 --> 06:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
insulating new hampshire consumers from
 
06:15:56.948 --> 06:15:56.958 align:start position:0%
actions taken by its neighboring states
 
06:15:59.030 --> 06:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
as well as the federal government that
 
06:16:01.990 --> 06:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
may limit access to natural gas
 
06:16:03.510 --> 06:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
additionally the five percent cap and
 
06:16:06.470 --> 06:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
puc doe review study will protect
 
06:16:08.070 --> 06:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
consumers from any potential and
 
06:16:10.948 --> 06:16:10.958 align:start position:0%
excessive rate hikes renewable natural
 
06:16:12.310 --> 06:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
gas will play an important role in the
 
06:16:15.190 --> 06:16:15.200 align:start position:0%
energy transition and we support it i'd
 
06:16:16.948 --> 06:16:16.958 align:start position:0%
like to address the cost issue real
 
06:16:19.030 --> 06:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
quick um
 
06:16:20.948 --> 06:16:20.958 align:start position:0%
you know i think contracts for natural
 
06:16:23.030 --> 06:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
gas are probably in the seven to eight
 
06:16:25.590 --> 06:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
dollar an mmb2 range right now for you
 
06:16:28.390 --> 06:16:28.400 align:start position:0%
know gas gas distribution utilities
 
06:16:31.350 --> 06:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
and i know that in places like vermont
 
06:16:33.670 --> 06:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
um you know you're getting contracts for
 
06:16:36.868 --> 06:16:36.878 align:start position:0%
rng and the 11 to 12 dollar you know an
 
06:16:39.750 --> 06:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
mbt range so it's not that far off
 
06:16:40.948 --> 06:16:40.958 align:start position:0%
especially when you start looking at
 
06:16:42.628 --> 06:16:42.638 align:start position:0%
what's going on with
 
06:16:45.190 --> 06:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
you know winter peaking gas you know the
 
06:16:47.350 --> 06:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
january price for natural gas averaged
 
06:16:50.548 --> 06:16:50.558 align:start position:0%
twenty dollars mmbtu i think february is
 
06:16:53.670 --> 06:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
about 14. you know you're looking at you
 
06:16:55.510 --> 06:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
know the federal government
 
06:16:57.590 --> 06:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
holding back on on leasing for oil and
 
06:16:59.750 --> 06:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
gas you're looking at potential you know
 
06:17:01.270 --> 06:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
methane fees
 
06:17:03.510 --> 06:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
we've seen actions at ferc that are
 
06:17:05.430 --> 06:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
taking into you know downstream
 
06:17:07.030 --> 06:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
greenhouse gas emissions that may
 
06:17:09.030 --> 06:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
increase the cost of and restrict the
 
06:17:10.708 --> 06:17:10.718 align:start position:0%
supply of natural gas
 
06:17:12.070 --> 06:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
what's going on in new york with
 
06:17:13.670 --> 06:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
restricting natural gas pipelines
 
06:17:15.910 --> 06:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
certainly in fact affects new england so
 
06:17:18.310 --> 06:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
this is kind of a bill that you know a
 
06:17:20.390 --> 06:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
lot of people should be behind it's good
 
06:17:21.190 --> 06:17:21.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:17:23.270 --> 06:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
it has environmental benefits but it
 
06:17:25.030 --> 06:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
also will ensure and help protect
 
06:17:27.110 --> 06:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
against reliability of the system and
 
06:17:29.510 --> 06:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
preserve consumer choice people will you
 
06:17:32.310 --> 06:17:32.320 align:start position:0%
know be able to use gas stoves um they
 
06:17:33.910 --> 06:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
won't be forced to convert to you know
 
06:17:35.350 --> 06:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
to electric or something like that so
 
06:17:37.510 --> 06:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
with that i'll take any questions
 
06:17:39.190 --> 06:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for that testimony i have a
 
06:17:39.200 --> 06:17:40.150 align:start position:0%
thank you for that testimony i have a
question

06:17:40.150 --> 06:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:17:41.750 --> 06:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the price
 
06:17:43.430 --> 06:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
of gas today maybe seven or eight
 
06:17:45.590 --> 06:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
dollars per unit
 
06:17:45.600 --> 06:17:46.548 align:start position:0%
dollars per unit
um

06:17:46.548 --> 06:17:46.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:17:49.990 --> 06:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
rng in vermont might be 11
 
06:17:50.000 --> 06:17:51.030 align:start position:0%
rng in vermont might be 11
and

06:17:51.030 --> 06:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:17:53.910 --> 06:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
in the middle of winter it might be 20 a
 
06:17:53.920 --> 06:17:55.270 align:start position:0%
in the middle of winter it might be 20 a
unit

06:17:55.270 --> 06:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
unit
 
06:17:57.110 --> 06:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
is it possible that you could
 
06:18:01.270 --> 06:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
manufacture this rng and store it
 
06:18:03.510 --> 06:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
and then use it during the winter when
 
06:18:05.670 --> 06:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
the the peak
 
06:18:07.910 --> 06:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
price of gas is high to bring that cost
 
06:18:07.920 --> 06:18:09.030 align:start position:0%
price of gas is high to bring that cost
down

06:18:09.030 --> 06:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
down
 
06:18:10.548 --> 06:18:10.558 align:start position:0%
is it possible
 
06:18:12.150 --> 06:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sure it's possible i don't know if
 
06:18:13.670 --> 06:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
it's cost effective to do that and i
 
06:18:15.270 --> 06:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
think that's the big that would be the
 
06:18:17.510 --> 06:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
that would be the big question and i
 
06:18:19.510 --> 06:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
i can't i just can't you would have to
 
06:18:20.548 --> 06:18:20.558 align:start position:0%
know what's going to happen with the
 
06:18:22.708 --> 06:18:22.718 align:start position:0%
price of gas down the road but we know
 
06:18:24.548 --> 06:18:24.558 align:start position:0%
that you know in new england we are more
 
06:18:27.030 --> 06:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
susceptible to volatile gas prices than
 
06:18:28.628 --> 06:18:28.638 align:start position:0%
literally anywhere else in the country
 
06:18:30.548 --> 06:18:30.558 align:start position:0%
you know the price at henry hub
 
06:18:32.310 --> 06:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
might be four bucks
 
06:18:35.830 --> 06:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
and it'll be 15 here so you know that's
 
06:18:37.510 --> 06:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
you're not comparing apples to oranges
 
06:18:40.310 --> 06:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at those two prices
 
06:18:45.030 --> 06:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
additional questions for mr brown
 
06:18:47.510 --> 06:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none i guess we're done so thank
 
06:18:49.750 --> 06:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you and with that
 
06:18:52.310 --> 06:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
we'll close the public hearing on senate
 
06:18:52.320 --> 06:18:54.390 align:start position:0%
we'll close the public hearing on senate

the record bob guida state senator
 
06:19:41.670 --> 06:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
district 2
 
06:19:43.590 --> 06:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
and prime sponsor of
 
06:19:46.868 --> 06:19:46.878 align:start position:0%
senate bill 429 fn
 
06:19:49.830 --> 06:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is a product one of several
 
06:19:51.190 --> 06:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
out of committee that met over the
 
06:19:51.200 --> 06:19:52.708 align:start position:0%
out of committee that met over the
summer

06:19:52.708 --> 06:19:52.718 align:start position:0%
summer
 
06:19:55.270 --> 06:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
to discuss
 
06:19:57.750 --> 06:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee uh and in
 
06:20:00.548 --> 06:20:00.558 align:start position:0%
fact that report i think i provided in a
 
06:20:02.150 --> 06:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
prior bill
 
06:20:05.030 --> 06:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's dated october 1 of 2021 final
 
06:20:06.390 --> 06:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
report of the committee to study
 
06:20:07.830 --> 06:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
necessary revisions for the site
 
06:20:09.670 --> 06:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee
 
06:20:11.430 --> 06:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
and if you don't have that report i'm
 
06:20:13.990 --> 06:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
sure you could access it and uh it's
 
06:20:15.510 --> 06:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
it's a very good primer as for where
 
06:20:17.510 --> 06:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
we're going with this bill
 
06:20:19.270 --> 06:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
this bill does a number of things and
 
06:20:20.788 --> 06:20:20.798 align:start position:0%
that's again based out of the results of
 
06:20:23.750 --> 06:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
that study first it modifies the sec to
 
06:20:26.150 --> 06:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
allow for agency designees
 
06:20:27.750 --> 06:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
one of the problems they have in the
 
06:20:29.830 --> 06:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
existing language for the existing
 
06:20:31.830 --> 06:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
statute is it requires the commissioners
 
06:20:33.110 --> 06:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
all to be in the same room at the same
 
06:20:34.628 --> 06:20:34.638 align:start position:0%
time basically which is virtually
 
06:20:36.788 --> 06:20:36.798 align:start position:0%
impossible to get done so it greatly
 
06:20:38.868 --> 06:20:38.878 align:start position:0%
slows any progress that the sec might
 
06:20:41.430 --> 06:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
get done so it allows designees
 
06:20:43.190 --> 06:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
it changes the quorum down to five
 
06:20:43.200 --> 06:20:44.468 align:start position:0%
it changes the quorum down to five
members

06:20:44.468 --> 06:20:44.478 align:start position:0%
members
 
06:20:47.270 --> 06:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
um and incorporates training
 
06:20:49.270 --> 06:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
for members of the sec on
 
06:20:52.788 --> 06:20:52.798 align:start position:0%
on statutes and procedures and so forth
 
06:20:54.468 --> 06:20:54.478 align:start position:0%
requires a public notice an adequate
 
06:20:56.948 --> 06:20:56.958 align:start position:0%
public notice of committee proceedings
 
06:20:59.590 --> 06:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh pursuant to 91a
 
06:21:01.430 --> 06:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
so that there is
 
06:21:03.590 --> 06:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
adequate time given of notice and then
 
06:21:05.030 --> 06:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
of course
 
06:21:07.190 --> 06:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
enabling our citizens as well as
 
06:21:09.670 --> 06:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
other stakeholders to participate
 
06:21:12.230 --> 06:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
by arranging their schedules timely
 
06:21:14.390 --> 06:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
updates fees to reflect changes
 
06:21:16.390 --> 06:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
changes previously applied by the fiscal
 
06:21:16.400 --> 06:21:17.830 align:start position:0%
changes previously applied by the fiscal
committee

06:21:17.830 --> 06:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:21:19.590 --> 06:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
clarifies certain that subsequent
 
06:21:21.190 --> 06:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
certificate holders are responsible for
 
06:21:24.070 --> 06:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
associated costs of their applications
 
06:21:26.310 --> 06:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
and authorizes the committee
 
06:21:27.910 --> 06:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
to impose a fine for preliminary
 
06:21:29.990 --> 06:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
determinations of violations of anything
 
06:21:32.150 --> 06:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
under 162h
 
06:21:33.990 --> 06:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
also provides for funding all of the
 
06:21:35.670 --> 06:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
operating funding of all operating costs
 
06:21:37.910 --> 06:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
out of this sec committee fund
 
06:21:39.430 --> 06:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
and allows the chair of the committee to
 
06:21:41.750 --> 06:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
seek additional funding the sec funding
 
06:21:43.270 --> 06:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
i think as i discussed in the previous
 
06:21:45.910 --> 06:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
bill is sporadic because applications
 
06:21:48.230 --> 06:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
aren't constant and they
 
06:21:49.510 --> 06:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes they'll go two three years
 
06:21:50.868 --> 06:21:50.878 align:start position:0%
without and sometimes you'll have two or
 
06:21:52.788 --> 06:21:52.798 align:start position:0%
three in one year so that that doesn't
 
06:21:54.708 --> 06:21:54.718 align:start position:0%
bode well for trying to maintain a
 
06:21:54.718 --> 06:21:55.750 align:start position:0%
bode well for trying to maintain a
stable

06:21:55.750 --> 06:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
stable
 
06:21:58.150 --> 06:21:58.160 align:start position:0%
um and funded staff without tapping
 
06:22:00.070 --> 06:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
general fund revenues so take a look at
 
06:22:00.080 --> 06:22:03.350 align:start position:0%
general fund revenues so take a look at
that

06:22:03.350 --> 06:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:05.270 --> 06:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
that pretty much sums up what the bill
 
06:22:07.910 --> 06:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
gets proposes and
 
06:22:10.070 --> 06:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
i would note that
 
06:22:12.548 --> 06:22:12.558 align:start position:0%
senator i'm sorry representative um
 
06:22:14.390 --> 06:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
votes representative harrington
 
06:22:17.110 --> 06:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh also served on this committee in this
 
06:22:19.110 --> 06:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
past summer and our co-sponsors on this
 
06:22:19.120 --> 06:22:20.548 align:start position:0%
past summer and our co-sponsors on this
legislation

06:22:20.548 --> 06:22:20.558 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
06:22:21.910 --> 06:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
with that i'll conclude my testimony
 
06:22:23.910 --> 06:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
06:22:25.830 --> 06:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you senator gardner
 
06:22:28.070 --> 06:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
excellent testimony a question from
 
06:22:28.080 --> 06:22:29.750 align:start position:0%
excellent testimony a question from
representative

06:22:29.750 --> 06:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:22:29.760 --> 06:22:31.110 align:start position:0%
representative
mcgee

06:22:31.110 --> 06:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
mcgee
 
06:22:33.190 --> 06:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr acting chairman and thank
 
06:22:35.750 --> 06:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
you senator gaida um
 
06:22:38.468 --> 06:22:38.478 align:start position:0%
i'm looking on page two
 
06:22:40.310 --> 06:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
and down in the bolded area that starts
 
06:22:42.390 --> 06:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
on line 19 and i wonder if you could
 
06:22:45.030 --> 06:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
speak to us about
 
06:22:47.270 --> 06:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
the various pricing structures that are
 
06:22:49.670 --> 06:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
being applied to the various types of
 
06:22:49.680 --> 06:22:50.948 align:start position:0%
being applied to the various types of
energy

06:22:50.948 --> 06:22:50.958 align:start position:0%
energy
 
06:22:53.670 --> 06:22:53.680 align:start position:0%
and how they were arrived at
 
06:22:55.110 --> 06:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
i will leave that to subsequent
 
06:22:58.150 --> 06:22:58.160 align:start position:0%
testimony okay thank you um were you any
 
06:23:00.310 --> 06:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
part of that conversation and
 
06:23:02.070 --> 06:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
did this come out of the subcommittee i
 
06:23:03.510 --> 06:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
guess no this came out out of the
 
06:23:07.270 --> 06:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
committee um but um
 
06:23:09.030 --> 06:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
i think that those numbers were adjusted
 
06:23:11.910 --> 06:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
to an attempt to cover the sporadic
 
06:23:13.830 --> 06:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
nature of
 
06:23:15.670 --> 06:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
maintaining a staff
 
06:23:17.110 --> 06:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
to do that with the things that are
 
06:23:19.830 --> 06:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
required that my recollection but yes oh
 
06:23:22.230 --> 06:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
i think it's representing mcgee yes may
 
06:23:22.240 --> 06:23:22.868 align:start position:0%
i think it's representing mcgee yes may
i

06:23:22.868 --> 06:23:22.878 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:23:25.590 --> 06:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
one last follow-up yes thank you
 
06:23:25.600 --> 06:23:26.788 align:start position:0%
one last follow-up yes thank you
uh

06:23:26.788 --> 06:23:26.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:23:28.390 --> 06:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
i think
 
06:23:30.230 --> 06:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
it is wholly appropriate for us to be
 
06:23:31.910 --> 06:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
doing that because they clearly don't
 
06:23:34.230 --> 06:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
have adequate funding i think there's a
 
06:23:35.830 --> 06:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
distinction between
 
06:23:37.670 --> 06:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
calling out all of the different types
 
06:23:40.310 --> 06:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
and having them have widely different
 
06:23:42.390 --> 06:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
numbers i i guess that's what i was
 
06:23:44.150 --> 06:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
hoping you could speak to is how that
 
06:23:45.750 --> 06:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
was arrived at because they're they're
 
06:23:49.510 --> 06:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:50.830 --> 06:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:23:54.708 --> 06:23:54.718 align:start position:0%
so sixty thousand dollar base charge
 
06:23:56.150 --> 06:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
that's i believe that's for the
 
06:23:56.160 --> 06:23:57.830 align:start position:0%
that's i believe that's for the
application

06:23:57.830 --> 06:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
application
 
06:23:59.350 --> 06:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
and then the twenty thousand for
 
06:24:01.350 --> 06:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
monitoring and compliance remember we're
 
06:24:03.110 --> 06:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
breaking where the department of energy
 
06:24:05.510 --> 06:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
is gonna be most likely taken over
 
06:24:07.750 --> 06:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
monitoring and compliance yes all right
 
06:24:07.760 --> 06:24:08.628 align:start position:0%
monitoring and compliance yes all right
so

06:24:08.628 --> 06:24:08.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:24:11.110 --> 06:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
i think that that would go towards that
 
06:24:14.070 --> 06:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
i was i'm sorry it's my fault
 
06:24:16.868 --> 06:24:16.878 align:start position:0%
on line 21 starts item number one and
 
06:24:19.990 --> 06:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
one through five lists
 
06:24:23.910 --> 06:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:25.830 --> 06:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
for different types of energy so i'm
 
06:24:27.030 --> 06:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
wondering why
 
06:24:29.750 --> 06:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh 1200 per megawatt for renewable
 
06:24:32.390 --> 06:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
energy generating facility versus
 
06:24:35.270 --> 06:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
120 per megawatt for a ga natural gas or
 
06:24:37.750 --> 06:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
biomass fueled facility that's it's a
 
06:24:40.310 --> 06:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
big jump so i'm just curious
 
06:24:41.910 --> 06:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh unfortunately i'm not going to be
 
06:24:44.070 --> 06:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
able to assuage your curiosity
 
06:24:44.080 --> 06:24:45.590 align:start position:0%
able to assuage your curiosity
okay

06:24:45.590 --> 06:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:24:47.830 --> 06:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
fair enough
 
06:24:50.070 --> 06:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh additional questions representative
 
06:24:50.080 --> 06:24:51.670 align:start position:0%
uh additional questions representative
berezni

06:24:51.670 --> 06:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
berezni
 
06:24:53.430 --> 06:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh mine's not as much of a question i
 
06:24:55.350 --> 06:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
just noticed all of these amounts are
 
06:24:57.510 --> 06:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
increased by 20 percent is that
 
06:25:04.310 --> 06:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:06.070 --> 06:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
well they're all up 20
 
06:25:07.830 --> 06:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
just across the board thank you for that
 
06:25:11.190 --> 06:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
observation mr chairman if i might um
 
06:25:12.948 --> 06:25:12.958 align:start position:0%
representative harrington i believe the
 
06:25:14.708 --> 06:25:14.718 align:start position:0%
original numbers on here the thousand
 
06:25:16.390 --> 06:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
one hundred hundred fifty and so forth
 
06:25:18.390 --> 06:25:18.400 align:start position:0%
those were were done at the beginning of
 
06:25:20.070 --> 06:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
the inception of the site evaluation
 
06:25:21.590 --> 06:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
committee with the approximate cost
 
06:25:23.670 --> 06:25:23.680 align:start position:0%
associated with prosecution because
 
06:25:25.430 --> 06:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
obviously if you've got something that's
 
06:25:28.150 --> 06:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
six hundred megawatts gas plant the per
 
06:25:29.750 --> 06:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
megawatt cost is going to be different
 
06:25:33.190 --> 06:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
than a 4 megawatt wind generator so and
 
06:25:34.788 --> 06:25:34.798 align:start position:0%
then they just we just simply took that
 
06:25:36.548 --> 06:25:36.558 align:start position:0%
and increased them because of inflation
 
06:25:41.270 --> 06:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:42.628 --> 06:25:42.638 align:start position:0%
representative mick williams is
 
06:25:45.910 --> 06:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:47.910 --> 06:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for bringing this bill
 
06:25:49.910 --> 06:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
um i just i guess i have a technical
 
06:25:52.390 --> 06:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
question in regards to whenever we put
 
06:25:54.468 --> 06:25:54.478 align:start position:0%
dollars right whenever we put dollar
 
06:25:56.070 --> 06:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
amounts in a bill
 
06:25:58.070 --> 06:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
we know we're going to be revisiting
 
06:26:01.510 --> 06:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
this in 5 10 15 years and we're gonna
 
06:26:03.190 --> 06:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
have to pass another bill
 
06:26:04.948 --> 06:26:04.958 align:start position:0%
to change the numbers
 
06:26:06.868 --> 06:26:06.878 align:start position:0%
so would you be open to an amendment
 
06:26:09.830 --> 06:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
that does something related to a three
 
06:26:11.750 --> 06:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
percent increase
 
06:26:13.750 --> 06:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
so that we can try to track these
 
06:26:16.070 --> 06:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
numbers without coming back again to the
 
06:26:17.270 --> 06:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
well and
 
06:26:20.548 --> 06:26:20.558 align:start position:0%
doing a basically bookkeeping bill again
 
06:26:22.230 --> 06:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
at the house senate and the governor's
 
06:26:24.948 --> 06:26:24.958 align:start position:0%
desk just to fix the numbers every
 
06:26:26.548 --> 06:26:26.558 align:start position:0%
couple years
 
06:26:28.948 --> 06:26:28.958 align:start position:0%
on that i thank you for the question i
 
06:26:30.628 --> 06:26:30.638 align:start position:0%
think it's a valid question but i think
 
06:26:32.868 --> 06:26:32.878 align:start position:0%
given the volatility of energy
 
06:26:35.270 --> 06:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
and the changing structure of energy you
 
06:26:37.110 --> 06:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
know and the changing structure of our
 
06:26:39.270 --> 06:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
government as in the state here as we're
 
06:26:41.030 --> 06:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
attempting to address this i'm not
 
06:26:43.670 --> 06:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
certain that a steady state increase
 
06:26:45.910 --> 06:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate i i would rather
 
06:26:47.670 --> 06:26:47.680 align:start position:0%
actually leave it here and and require
 
06:26:50.150 --> 06:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
the review periodically the legislature
 
06:26:52.788 --> 06:26:52.798 align:start position:0%
uh to maintain uh you know
 
06:26:55.830 --> 06:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
um frankly to maintain
 
06:26:55.840 --> 06:26:57.190 align:start position:0%
um frankly to maintain
oversight

06:26:57.190 --> 06:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
06:26:59.350 --> 06:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
over the fee structure
 
06:27:02.150 --> 06:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
an average citizen cannot
 
06:27:04.070 --> 06:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
go to the sec and want the fees change
 
06:27:05.270 --> 06:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
but that's one of the problems that we
 
06:27:07.590 --> 06:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
have is there an exorbitant price
 
06:27:09.830 --> 06:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
for citizens on some uh and some of the
 
06:27:11.110 --> 06:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
testimony that you wanted to bring in
 
06:27:12.548 --> 06:27:12.558 align:start position:0%
some of the actions
 
06:27:14.310 --> 06:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
so i would favor leaving it the way it
 
06:27:16.150 --> 06:27:16.160 align:start position:0%
is rather than trying to incorporate
 
06:27:17.830 --> 06:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
understandably to the to the
 
06:27:20.310 --> 06:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
legislature's workload uh you know three
 
06:27:21.590 --> 06:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
percent a year or something of that
 
06:27:23.350 --> 06:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
nature i think volatility right now is
 
06:27:24.868 --> 06:27:24.878 align:start position:0%
playing large i think we need to respect
 
06:27:24.878 --> 06:27:25.830 align:start position:0%
playing large i think we need to respect
that

06:27:25.830 --> 06:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:27:27.590 --> 06:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:27:30.788 --> 06:27:30.798 align:start position:0%
senator did the sec study committee
 
06:27:32.628 --> 06:27:32.638 align:start position:0%
find that these fees had not been
 
06:27:35.190 --> 06:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
changed since 2015
 
06:27:38.868 --> 06:27:38.878 align:start position:0%
i would probably say so yes thank you
 
06:27:39.990 --> 06:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:27:42.708 --> 06:27:42.718 align:start position:0%
any further questions for senator guida
 
06:27:46.628 --> 06:27:46.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:48.948 --> 06:27:48.958 align:start position:0%
senate guider if if a group of
 
06:27:51.830 --> 06:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
individuals which you mentioned the fee
 
06:27:54.628 --> 06:27:54.638 align:start position:0%
is exorbitant but my understanding is if
 
06:27:57.510 --> 06:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
there's a problem with an application
 
06:27:57.520 --> 06:27:58.468 align:start position:0%
there's a problem with an application
and

06:27:58.468 --> 06:27:58.478 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:28:01.350 --> 06:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
that a group of individuals can petition
 
06:28:05.910 --> 06:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
and have that application go to the sec
 
06:28:07.750 --> 06:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
what would be the fee that that group of
 
06:28:10.150 --> 06:28:10.160 align:start position:0%
individuals would have to pay
 
06:28:12.548 --> 06:28:12.558 align:start position:0%
would it be in there at twelve thousand
 
06:28:12.558 --> 06:28:13.910 align:start position:0%
would it be in there at twelve thousand
dollars

06:28:13.910 --> 06:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
06:28:16.708 --> 06:28:16.718 align:start position:0%
no no i don't think it would be i think
 
06:28:19.270 --> 06:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
it's significantly less yeah i
 
06:28:21.270 --> 06:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
but i didn't see it and so it could be
 
06:28:25.350 --> 06:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:27.910 --> 06:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
i think if you look on page three
 
06:28:29.350 --> 06:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
i gotta make sure i'm in the right area
 
06:28:29.360 --> 06:28:37.190 align:start position:0%
i gotta make sure i'm in the right area
here

06:28:37.190 --> 06:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:41.110 --> 06:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
a petition for declaratory ruling
 
06:28:41.120 --> 06:28:42.708 align:start position:0%
a petition for declaratory ruling
um

06:28:42.708 --> 06:28:42.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:28:44.708 --> 06:28:44.718 align:start position:0%
up to twelve six or thirty six hundred
 
06:28:47.910 --> 06:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
offered by a three-member subcommittee
 
06:28:50.708 --> 06:28:50.718 align:start position:0%
and then if you go on to
 
06:28:52.868 --> 06:28:52.878 align:start position:0%
uh request for i think that's
 
06:28:52.878 --> 06:28:54.310 align:start position:0%
uh request for i think that's
again

06:28:54.310 --> 06:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
again
 
06:28:56.390 --> 06:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not clear to be honest with you but
 
06:28:58.390 --> 06:28:58.400 align:start position:0%
but the price was exorbitant for just an
 
06:29:00.468 --> 06:29:00.478 align:start position:0%
average citizen to come up and address
 
06:29:02.230 --> 06:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
the sec
 
06:29:04.070 --> 06:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
a group of citizens could do so and you
 
06:29:05.270 --> 06:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that we don't just
 
06:29:08.150 --> 06:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
subject the process to what one might
 
06:29:10.708 --> 06:29:10.718 align:start position:0%
call nuisance
 
06:29:12.468 --> 06:29:12.478 align:start position:0%
complaints and what so we set the
 
06:29:14.390 --> 06:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
threshold high enough that you have to
 
06:29:16.390 --> 06:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
have a serious complaint or serious
 
06:29:18.548 --> 06:29:18.558 align:start position:0%
request or serious idea
 
06:29:19.910 --> 06:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
to be able to garner the attention of
 
06:29:21.350 --> 06:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
calling the sec or three-member
 
06:29:23.590 --> 06:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee back together to address it
 
06:29:24.948 --> 06:29:24.958 align:start position:0%
just to avoid nuisance complaints
 
06:29:27.270 --> 06:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
amongst other things
 
06:29:28.708 --> 06:29:28.718 align:start position:0%
may i follow up
 
06:29:30.390 --> 06:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
yes please follow up but we don't know
 
06:29:32.628 --> 06:29:32.638 align:start position:0%
how much that's going to be because most
 
06:29:34.708 --> 06:29:34.718 align:start position:0%
citizens wouldn't have
 
06:29:35.590 --> 06:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
you know
 
06:29:37.590 --> 06:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking of an average citizen
 
06:29:38.948 --> 06:29:38.958 align:start position:0%
myself for instance are they going to
 
06:29:40.548 --> 06:29:40.558 align:start position:0%
put a wind farm in the back of my house
 
06:29:43.590 --> 06:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
or do i have a right to go and say wait
 
06:29:46.150 --> 06:29:46.160 align:start position:0%
a minute there's a problem
 
06:29:48.548 --> 06:29:48.558 align:start position:0%
there's an application you've ruled on
 
06:29:50.230 --> 06:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
it but
 
06:29:52.788 --> 06:29:52.798 align:start position:0%
i i i want the sec
 
06:29:54.390 --> 06:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
it's been approved but it hadn't gone
 
06:29:57.350 --> 06:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
through the sec how much would it cost
 
06:30:00.150 --> 06:30:00.160 align:start position:0%
because not beside the cost there would
 
06:30:03.750 --> 06:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
probably be attorneys etc involved so is
 
06:30:05.590 --> 06:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
this process
 
06:30:07.510 --> 06:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
is there anywhere in this process that
 
06:30:10.548 --> 06:30:10.558 align:start position:0%
we're redoing to make it
 
06:30:10.558 --> 06:30:11.830 align:start position:0%
we're redoing to make it
easier

06:30:11.830 --> 06:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
easier
 
06:30:14.230 --> 06:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
for a group of citizens concerned
 
06:30:17.270 --> 06:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
citizens to bring
 
06:30:19.990 --> 06:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
their concerns or request the sec to get
 
06:30:22.310 --> 06:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
involved in something that perhaps had a
 
06:30:25.270 --> 06:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
declaratory judgment
 
06:30:27.750 --> 06:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
again i i think that the concern is that
 
06:30:30.468 --> 06:30:30.478 align:start position:0%
we would subject this especially
 
06:30:32.868 --> 06:30:32.878 align:start position:0%
this process of citing an energy
 
06:30:34.150 --> 06:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
facility which
 
06:30:36.150 --> 06:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
historically has been
 
06:30:38.628 --> 06:30:38.638 align:start position:0%
let's say less than cordial
 
06:30:38.638 --> 06:30:39.430 align:start position:0%
let's say less than cordial
uh

06:30:39.430 --> 06:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:30:39.440 --> 06:30:40.468 align:start position:0%
uh
to

06:30:40.468 --> 06:30:40.478 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:30:40.478 --> 06:30:43.190 align:start position:0%
to
innumerable

06:30:43.190 --> 06:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
innumerable
 
06:30:45.430 --> 06:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh complaints that were there intended
 
06:30:48.788 --> 06:30:48.798 align:start position:0%
to delay obfuscate and so forth so
 
06:30:51.030 --> 06:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's it's inappropriate to
 
06:30:52.628 --> 06:30:52.638 align:start position:0%
establish a threshold
 
06:30:54.788 --> 06:30:54.798 align:start position:0%
you know all any citizen can testify on
 
06:30:56.070 --> 06:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
the siding
 
06:30:59.190 --> 06:30:59.200 align:start position:0%
preparatory prior to the decision right
 
06:31:01.110 --> 06:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
it's after the decision and one has to
 
06:31:03.830 --> 06:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
make an assumption sometimes that does
 
06:31:05.270 --> 06:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
you know what it does but nonetheless
 
06:31:06.628 --> 06:31:06.638 align:start position:0%
that the sec is going to act in good
 
06:31:08.150 --> 06:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
faith and do what's best
 
06:31:10.788 --> 06:31:10.798 align:start position:0%
to challenge it after that
 
06:31:12.628 --> 06:31:12.638 align:start position:0%
again i think that
 
06:31:15.350 --> 06:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
to prevent nuisance complaints
 
06:31:17.910 --> 06:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh you know if one citizen has a problem
 
06:31:20.150 --> 06:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
is it really a problem if a community
 
06:31:22.788 --> 06:31:22.798 align:start position:0%
has a problem and you have 20 citizens
 
06:31:24.868 --> 06:31:24.878 align:start position:0%
that's a problem okay and so again the
 
06:31:27.190 --> 06:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
point being to coalesce complaints
 
06:31:29.590 --> 06:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
rather than to keep having one after
 
06:31:31.030 --> 06:31:31.040 align:start position:0%
another after another on the basis of
 
06:31:32.708 --> 06:31:32.718 align:start position:0%
independent citizens the way you do that
 
06:31:34.948 --> 06:31:34.958 align:start position:0%
most effectively is to establish a
 
06:31:37.510 --> 06:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
threshold that's not exorbitant but is
 
06:31:40.708 --> 06:31:40.718 align:start position:0%
nonetheless uh responsible to prevent
 
06:31:44.548 --> 06:31:44.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:47.510 --> 06:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:50.230 --> 06:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
any additional questions for the senator
 
06:31:51.830 --> 06:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
senator i would
 
06:31:54.310 --> 06:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
remind the members of this committee
 
06:31:57.510 --> 06:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
that your committee senate enr has house
 
06:32:00.070 --> 06:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
bill 624
 
06:32:01.030 --> 06:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
which is
 
06:32:02.868 --> 06:32:02.878 align:start position:0%
under consideration there has been a
 
06:32:05.830 --> 06:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
public uh hearing on that bill already
 
06:32:05.840 --> 06:32:06.628 align:start position:0%
public uh hearing on that bill already
and

06:32:06.628 --> 06:32:06.638 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:32:09.270 --> 06:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
that bill provides
 
06:32:12.150 --> 06:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
a way for the average citizen to file a
 
06:32:13.750 --> 06:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
complaint against an existing
 
06:32:13.760 --> 06:32:15.030 align:start position:0%
complaint against an existing
certificate

06:32:15.030 --> 06:32:15.040 align:start position:0%
certificate
 
06:32:17.110 --> 06:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
at no cost to the citizen isn't that
 
06:32:19.270 --> 06:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct thank you
 
06:32:20.868 --> 06:32:20.878 align:start position:0%
i hope the senate will move forward with
 
06:32:23.510 --> 06:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
that bill we will
 
06:32:26.150 --> 06:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
uh representative samsic
 
06:32:28.150 --> 06:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
06:32:30.628 --> 06:32:30.638 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh and i'm sorry
 
06:32:31.510 --> 06:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
i was
 
06:32:33.430 --> 06:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
just out a minute here maybe this
 
06:32:35.350 --> 06:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
question was already asked
 
06:32:36.628 --> 06:32:36.638 align:start position:0%
but on
 
06:32:38.070 --> 06:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
page two
 
06:32:40.150 --> 06:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh lines um
 
06:32:42.830 --> 06:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
25 regarding um
 
06:32:45.510 --> 06:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
um application for elect generation
 
06:32:47.750 --> 06:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
facilities for um
 
06:32:49.510 --> 06:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
compliance charges
 
06:32:49.520 --> 06:32:51.110 align:start position:0%
compliance charges
um

06:32:51.110 --> 06:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:32:54.070 --> 06:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
number one online 25 says
 
06:32:59.110 --> 06:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:02.310 --> 06:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
or a wind energy system
 
06:33:03.510 --> 06:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
and then
 
06:33:06.548 --> 06:33:06.558 align:start position:0%
line 30 says twelve hundred dollars per
 
06:33:08.788 --> 06:33:08.798 align:start position:0%
penguin for a renewable energy
 
06:33:11.270 --> 06:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
generation facility
 
06:33:13.990 --> 06:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
the other items number two three and
 
06:33:16.310 --> 06:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
four i'm i'm not certain i'm on the same
 
06:33:16.320 --> 06:33:17.190 align:start position:0%
four i'm i'm not certain i'm on the same
page

06:33:17.190 --> 06:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
page
 
06:33:17.200 --> 06:33:19.990 align:start position:0%
page
right

06:33:19.990 --> 06:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:23.590 --> 06:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
oh sorry are you looking at 429 fn as
 
06:33:23.600 --> 06:33:24.628 align:start position:0%
oh sorry are you looking at 429 fn as
amended

06:33:24.628 --> 06:33:24.638 align:start position:0%
amended
 
06:33:27.110 --> 06:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
sorry i think i didn't
 
06:33:28.150 --> 06:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
i had
 
06:33:32.548 --> 06:33:32.558 align:start position:0%
but okay it's um similar so on page two
 
06:33:35.030 --> 06:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
and that would be line 21
 
06:33:36.948 --> 06:33:36.958 align:start position:0%
uh where it talks about twelve hundred
 
06:33:39.190 --> 06:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
dollar per megawatt for a wind energy
 
06:33:39.200 --> 06:33:40.390 align:start position:0%
dollar per megawatt for a wind energy
system

06:33:40.390 --> 06:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
system
 
06:33:43.110 --> 06:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
and on line 26
 
06:33:46.070 --> 06:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
it talks about 1200 dollars per megawatt
 
06:33:49.910 --> 06:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
for a renewable energy facility
 
06:33:52.468 --> 06:33:52.478 align:start position:0%
those two are
 
06:33:55.350 --> 06:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
renewable energy facilities
 
06:33:58.868 --> 06:33:58.878 align:start position:0%
and the charge for them per megawatt
 
06:34:01.190 --> 06:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
is about 10 times higher than all the
 
06:34:04.390 --> 06:34:04.400 align:start position:0%
other ones for natural gas for oil for
 
06:34:04.400 --> 06:34:05.590 align:start position:0%
other ones for natural gas for oil for
nuclear

06:34:05.590 --> 06:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
nuclear
 
06:34:07.270 --> 06:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
why is that why is there such a big
 
06:34:10.868 --> 06:34:10.878 align:start position:0%
discrepancy in the charge for
 
06:34:14.230 --> 06:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
a wind energy and renewable facility
 
06:34:15.830 --> 06:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
compared to
 
06:34:18.548 --> 06:34:18.558 align:start position:0%
a natural gas a coal or
 
06:34:22.548 --> 06:34:22.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:25.110 --> 06:34:25.120 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question um is that
 
06:34:27.350 --> 06:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
an oversight somehow or more typo
 
06:34:29.590 --> 06:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
because that's quite a quite a leap
 
06:34:29.600 --> 06:34:40.628 align:start position:0%
because that's quite a quite a leap
there

06:34:40.628 --> 06:34:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:42.548 --> 06:34:42.558 align:start position:0%
i don't have an answer for that i'm not
 
06:34:43.830 --> 06:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
going to answer because i don't have an
 
06:34:45.910 --> 06:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
answer okay and perhaps one of the
 
06:34:50.230 --> 06:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:53.110 --> 06:34:53.120 align:start position:0%
representative uh cambrils yes i think
 
06:34:55.030 --> 06:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
if you read it it says
 
06:34:57.190 --> 06:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
it looks like it's 10 times but it's not
 
06:35:00.310 --> 06:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
because it's 120 per megawatt
 
06:35:00.320 --> 06:35:01.430 align:start position:0%
because it's 120 per megawatt
versus

06:35:01.430 --> 06:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
versus
 
06:35:06.230 --> 06:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:08.150 --> 06:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
i think it was the same question that uh
 
06:35:10.468 --> 06:35:10.478 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee had is why it was
 
06:35:12.708 --> 06:35:12.718 align:start position:0%
so why is such a discrepancy between the
 
06:35:18.788 --> 06:35:18.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:21.510 --> 06:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
that goes back to the original
 
06:35:21.520 --> 06:35:22.548 align:start position:0%
that goes back to the original
uh

06:35:22.548 --> 06:35:22.558 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:35:24.310 --> 06:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee legislation
 
06:35:26.628 --> 06:35:26.638 align:start position:0%
that was passed in 2014
 
06:35:28.310 --> 06:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
so we'd have to consult with people who
 
06:35:30.310 --> 06:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
were involved with that to understand
 
06:35:33.110 --> 06:35:33.120 align:start position:0%
their reasoning for
 
06:35:35.030 --> 06:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee on that point
 
06:35:38.070 --> 06:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
before we move off it it it looks like
 
06:35:39.750 --> 06:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
what's happened here i agree with
 
06:35:43.030 --> 06:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
representative berezni that
 
06:35:45.270 --> 06:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
items one through four
 
06:35:45.280 --> 06:35:46.390 align:start position:0%
items one through four
existed

06:35:46.390 --> 06:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
existed
 
06:35:49.270 --> 06:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
and the increase was
 
06:35:49.280 --> 06:35:50.628 align:start position:0%
and the increase was
20

06:35:50.628 --> 06:35:50.638 align:start position:0%
20
 
06:35:52.468 --> 06:35:52.478 align:start position:0%
right so the numbers were changed for
 
06:35:53.590 --> 06:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
each of those
 
06:35:56.708 --> 06:35:56.718 align:start position:0%
but number one related to
 
06:35:59.190 --> 06:35:59.200 align:start position:0%
wind energy systems and i think it
 
06:36:01.350 --> 06:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
probably came into being with northern
 
06:36:02.788 --> 06:36:02.798 align:start position:0%
pass being considered and that sort of
 
06:36:04.708 --> 06:36:04.718 align:start position:0%
thing wind projects that had gone in
 
06:36:06.150 --> 06:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
front of
 
06:36:09.270 --> 06:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
the sec but number five has been added
 
06:36:12.070 --> 06:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
so that renewable energy facilities have
 
06:36:14.390 --> 06:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
a 1200 per megawatt and i'm wondering
 
06:36:16.868 --> 06:36:16.878 align:start position:0%
how that was arrived at like that's what
 
06:36:19.030 --> 06:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
i'm curious about because
 
06:36:21.590 --> 06:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
um some of the renewable energy facility
 
06:36:23.270 --> 06:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
projects are quite simple and
 
06:36:25.110 --> 06:36:25.120 align:start position:0%
straightforward and might not require
 
06:36:27.030 --> 06:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
such a high
 
06:36:28.948 --> 06:36:28.958 align:start position:0%
number and that that would be my
 
06:36:28.958 --> 06:36:32.628 align:start position:0%
number and that that would be my
question

06:36:32.628 --> 06:36:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:34.708 --> 06:36:34.718 align:start position:0%
i just want to know where the if the
 
06:36:37.430 --> 06:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
number came from the fact that
 
06:36:39.270 --> 06:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
those renewable energy facilities were
 
06:36:41.350 --> 06:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
going to be considered the same as the
 
06:36:42.390 --> 06:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
wind facility
 
06:36:42.400 --> 06:36:44.150 align:start position:0%
wind facility
that

06:36:44.150 --> 06:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:36:46.548 --> 06:36:46.558 align:start position:0%
created number one
 
06:36:52.948 --> 06:36:52.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:01.350 --> 06:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:04.390 --> 06:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
i i think it just drives to the point of
 
06:37:06.868 --> 06:37:06.878 align:start position:0%
covering the costs
 
06:37:06.878 --> 06:37:07.990 align:start position:0%
covering the costs
um

06:37:07.990 --> 06:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:11.190 --> 06:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
again this is an application fee
 
06:37:11.200 --> 06:37:12.468 align:start position:0%
again this is an application fee
so

06:37:12.468 --> 06:37:12.478 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:37:18.070 --> 06:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:23.590 --> 06:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:26.230 --> 06:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
i don't think that was the
 
06:37:28.868 --> 06:37:28.878 align:start position:0%
intent of the original legislation to
 
06:37:31.670 --> 06:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
discourage renewable energy i think it
 
06:37:33.430 --> 06:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
had to do with
 
06:37:36.150 --> 06:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
the cost of evaluating an application
 
06:37:39.030 --> 06:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
for a renewable energy system
 
06:37:41.750 --> 06:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
but i'd have to go back and look at
 
06:37:44.708 --> 06:37:44.718 align:start position:0%
the two 2014 legislation that
 
06:37:47.590 --> 06:37:47.600 align:start position:0%
established those fees initially to
 
06:37:49.910 --> 06:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
to discover exactly
 
06:37:52.150 --> 06:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
why they were set at that level senator
 
06:37:54.390 --> 06:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
bradley would know probably but he's not
 
06:38:03.110 --> 06:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:04.868 --> 06:38:04.878 align:start position:0%
well maybe not state doesn't evaluate it
 
06:38:06.150 --> 06:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
though all right it wouldn't be a
 
06:38:09.190 --> 06:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
statement it's exciting it might not be
 
06:38:09.200 --> 06:38:12.628 align:start position:0%
statement it's exciting it might not be
representative

06:38:12.628 --> 06:38:12.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:38:15.030 --> 06:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
one theory could be that um the
 
06:38:18.150 --> 06:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
renewable energy projects are maybe less
 
06:38:20.788 --> 06:38:20.798 align:start position:0%
megawatts on average than some of these
 
06:38:23.350 --> 06:38:23.360 align:start position:0%
bigger ones and so in terms of how much
 
06:38:24.868 --> 06:38:24.878 align:start position:0%
they get as a fee
 
06:38:26.708 --> 06:38:26.718 align:start position:0%
would be a lot less for the renewable
 
06:38:29.270 --> 06:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
ones versus the nuclear
 
06:38:32.708 --> 06:38:32.718 align:start position:0%
that's likely the the answer yes
 
06:38:33.750 --> 06:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
good point
 
06:38:35.510 --> 06:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
all right further questions for senator
 
06:38:35.520 --> 06:38:37.670 align:start position:0%
all right further questions for senator

okay

06:38:44.070 --> 06:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:38:46.230 --> 06:38:46.240 align:start position:0%
i didn't have one more pink card oh
 
06:38:48.868 --> 06:38:48.878 align:start position:0%
there he is over in the corner form uh
 
06:38:51.910 --> 06:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
mark's sanborn from the department of
 
06:38:53.510 --> 06:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
environmental services i thought you'd
 
06:38:59.830 --> 06:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:02.628 --> 06:39:02.638 align:start position:0%
afternoon mark sanborn assistant
 
06:39:04.468 --> 06:39:04.478 align:start position:0%
commissioner new hampshire department of
 
06:39:08.390 --> 06:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
environmental services um testifying um
 
06:39:10.788 --> 06:39:10.798 align:start position:0%
on in support of this bill
 
06:39:13.110 --> 06:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
myself and bob scott
 
06:39:14.548 --> 06:39:14.558 align:start position:0%
along with other members of the
 
06:39:16.390 --> 06:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
executive branch participated in this
 
06:39:18.230 --> 06:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
committee as well
 
06:39:20.230 --> 06:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
we were here talking about another sec
 
06:39:22.150 --> 06:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
bill last week
 
06:39:24.948 --> 06:39:24.958 align:start position:0%
talking about phase one and phase two
 
06:39:26.628 --> 06:39:26.638 align:start position:0%
we actually
 
06:39:27.990 --> 06:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
just by
 
06:39:30.150 --> 06:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
timing you guys did the bill that's
 
06:39:32.150 --> 06:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
focused on phase two last week and this
 
06:39:34.390 --> 06:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
is the one focused on phase one trying
 
06:39:36.468 --> 06:39:36.478 align:start position:0%
to make some of the improvements so
 
06:39:38.708 --> 06:39:38.718 align:start position:0%
um in the short term we improve the
 
06:39:42.830 --> 06:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
functionality of the sec
 
06:39:47.110 --> 06:39:47.120 align:start position:0%
um i will i too will not guess at the
 
06:39:49.830 --> 06:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
answer but uh the actual perfect person
 
06:39:51.990 --> 06:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
to know the reason where those numbers
 
06:39:53.590 --> 06:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
originally came from is probably bob
 
06:39:55.750 --> 06:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
scott himself i'll
 
06:39:57.670 --> 06:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
i'll check in with bob and we'll get
 
06:40:00.230 --> 06:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
back to you guys um any answer on where
 
06:40:03.350 --> 06:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
those initial came from i can say
 
06:40:04.390 --> 06:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
it was
 
06:40:06.468 --> 06:40:06.478 align:start position:0%
um it did not have anything to do with
 
06:40:10.230 --> 06:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
discouraging it it is about the cost and
 
06:40:12.070 --> 06:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
um again if you remember when we
 
06:40:15.350 --> 06:40:15.360 align:start position:0%
testified last week um unlike the other
 
06:40:18.150 --> 06:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
regulatory activities of uh the state of
 
06:40:20.788 --> 06:40:20.798 align:start position:0%
new hampshire this is a done by an ad
 
06:40:23.990 --> 06:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
hoc committee with no staff
 
06:40:26.390 --> 06:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
overseeing some of the you know looking
 
06:40:28.948 --> 06:40:28.958 align:start position:0%
into these um complaints and issues
 
06:40:28.958 --> 06:40:29.990 align:start position:0%
into these um complaints and issues
versus

06:40:29.990 --> 06:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
versus
 
06:40:30.000 --> 06:40:31.030 align:start position:0%
versus
um

06:40:31.030 --> 06:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:40:32.708 --> 06:40:32.718 align:start position:0%
other you know wetlands we haven't hold
 
06:40:34.708 --> 06:40:34.718 align:start position:0%
up the agency so
 
06:40:36.548 --> 06:40:36.558 align:start position:0%
they're it's just set up differently
 
06:40:39.270 --> 06:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
which again goes back to the idea of
 
06:40:41.350 --> 06:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
some short-term fixes to the sec with
 
06:40:44.070 --> 06:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
the idea of a long-term fix being
 
06:40:46.390 --> 06:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
putting these in an actual department so
 
06:40:47.430 --> 06:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
they can
 
06:40:50.070 --> 06:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
get the standard
 
06:40:52.548 --> 06:40:52.558 align:start position:0%
regulatory response from the state
 
06:40:54.708 --> 06:40:54.718 align:start position:0%
like the other regulatory issues
 
06:40:57.190 --> 06:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
and i was going to address but uh
 
06:41:00.788 --> 06:41:00.798 align:start position:0%
the chairman did as well um
 
06:41:03.510 --> 06:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
the cost for com complaints i i think
 
06:41:06.070 --> 06:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
the practice of the sec now is just is
 
06:41:08.390 --> 06:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
to also take any complaints or concerns
 
06:41:11.990 --> 06:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
from average citizens at no cost it's
 
06:41:14.150 --> 06:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
the problem right now is there's no
 
06:41:14.160 --> 06:41:15.190 align:start position:0%
the problem right now is there's no
staff

06:41:15.190 --> 06:41:15.200 align:start position:0%
staff
 
06:41:15.200 --> 06:41:15.990 align:start position:0%
staff
to

06:41:15.990 --> 06:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:41:18.788 --> 06:41:18.798 align:start position:0%
follow up on the complaints and even if
 
06:41:21.190 --> 06:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
we had one administrator there's no
 
06:41:23.350 --> 06:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
funds in the fund right now
 
06:41:26.310 --> 06:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
to hire the necessary professional
 
06:41:28.548 --> 06:41:28.558 align:start position:0%
technicians you would need to do the
 
06:41:28.558 --> 06:41:29.590 align:start position:0%
technicians you would need to do the
testing

06:41:29.590 --> 06:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
testing
 
06:41:33.350 --> 06:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
um to uh to evaluate the credibility of
 
06:41:35.670 --> 06:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
the complaints so it's not so much that
 
06:41:38.708 --> 06:41:38.718 align:start position:0%
because it costs the complaintants
 
06:41:40.868 --> 06:41:40.878 align:start position:0%
funding it's that right now
 
06:41:42.868 --> 06:41:42.878 align:start position:0%
there's no ability of anyone to follow
 
06:41:44.708 --> 06:41:44.718 align:start position:0%
up on those complaints that's the real
 
06:41:47.670 --> 06:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
problem again which this bill is i'm
 
06:41:49.430 --> 06:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
trying to address in the short term
 
06:41:50.788 --> 06:41:50.798 align:start position:0%
while we figure out a longer term
 
06:41:50.798 --> 06:41:51.750 align:start position:0%
while we figure out a longer term
solution

06:41:51.750 --> 06:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
solution
 
06:41:53.350 --> 06:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
so again just
 
06:41:55.350 --> 06:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
like the other bill very supportive of
 
06:41:56.628 --> 06:41:56.638 align:start position:0%
the sec
 
06:42:00.310 --> 06:42:00.320 align:start position:0%
needs a lot of reform um and
 
06:42:03.270 --> 06:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
with the energy infrastructure being so
 
06:42:05.350 --> 06:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
important um on some bills i was
 
06:42:07.910 --> 06:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
obviously here this morning
 
06:42:11.270 --> 06:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
it's of high value to those of us who uh
 
06:42:13.990 --> 06:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
help in the regulatory side of this to
 
06:42:15.750 --> 06:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
continue to find ways to improve the
 
06:42:19.590 --> 06:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
functionality of the sec
 
06:42:21.350 --> 06:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you uh
 
06:42:24.070 --> 06:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
questions representative samsic
 
06:42:26.230 --> 06:42:26.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you uh mr
 
06:42:28.868 --> 06:42:28.878 align:start position:0%
sanborn um
 
06:42:30.628 --> 06:42:30.638 align:start position:0%
in light of what you just said and we
 
06:42:33.190 --> 06:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
all know this that the sec staffing and
 
06:42:35.590 --> 06:42:35.600 align:start position:0%
the way they funded themselves
 
06:42:38.310 --> 06:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
has created kind of a
 
06:42:40.468 --> 06:42:40.478 align:start position:0%
non-functional entity
 
06:42:40.478 --> 06:42:41.270 align:start position:0%
non-functional entity
that

06:42:41.270 --> 06:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:42:42.948 --> 06:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
the fact that that is now going to be
 
06:42:45.110 --> 06:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
part of the uh department of energy i
 
06:42:47.590 --> 06:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
believe has its function
 
06:42:49.750 --> 06:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
and i assume that you're gonna
 
06:42:51.430 --> 06:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
provide enough staffing to have an
 
06:42:53.430 --> 06:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
efficient program for this
 
06:42:55.190 --> 06:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
and in light of the fact that we heard
 
06:42:57.270 --> 06:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
all these projects and proposals this
 
06:43:00.310 --> 06:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
morning which will impact that uh i
 
06:43:01.830 --> 06:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
would think that you would need to look
 
06:43:05.270 --> 06:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
review as well the funding and the fi
 
06:43:09.190 --> 06:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
fees needed to support that uh because
 
06:43:10.548 --> 06:43:10.558 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a different animal in
 
06:43:13.590 --> 06:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
the future it should be yeah so um a
 
06:43:15.430 --> 06:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
couple points to that number one i don't
 
06:43:16.708 --> 06:43:16.718 align:start position:0%
want to
 
06:43:16.718 --> 06:43:17.708 align:start position:0%
want to
uh

06:43:17.708 --> 06:43:17.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:43:19.990 --> 06:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
pre-determine what will come out of the
 
06:43:23.430 --> 06:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
study um i've mentioned as an individual
 
06:43:23.440 --> 06:43:24.310 align:start position:0%
study um i've mentioned as an individual
uh

06:43:24.310 --> 06:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:43:26.468 --> 06:43:26.478 align:start position:0%
my thought that doe moving this to the
 
06:43:28.310 --> 06:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
oe makes sense but you know we're gonna
 
06:43:29.430 --> 06:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
have a whole committee and then bring
 
06:43:31.830 --> 06:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
that back to you um
 
06:43:33.830 --> 06:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
those proposals would would most likely
 
06:43:37.030 --> 06:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
come in hb2 where more full reform could
 
06:43:38.468 --> 06:43:38.478 align:start position:0%
come including
 
06:43:41.670 --> 06:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
funding um and so it would be packaged
 
06:43:44.230 --> 06:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
in an ability to to have the legislation
 
06:43:47.350 --> 06:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
be fully funded and um i have also
 
06:43:47.360 --> 06:43:48.390 align:start position:0%
be fully funded and um i have also
spoken

06:43:48.390 --> 06:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
spoken
 
06:43:51.910 --> 06:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
um to uh i'll i won't out them but some
 
06:43:53.830 --> 06:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
myself and some of the other state
 
06:43:56.788 --> 06:43:56.798 align:start position:0%
representatives and interested parties
 
06:43:58.708 --> 06:43:58.718 align:start position:0%
i think in the short term what we would
 
06:44:01.590 --> 06:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
probably do is if these bills along with
 
06:44:04.230 --> 06:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
the chairman's and the two from senator
 
06:44:05.990 --> 06:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
gaida pass
 
06:44:08.070 --> 06:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
our big focus would be to
 
06:44:11.830 --> 06:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
find an sec administrator um and then
 
06:44:13.990 --> 06:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
probably go to fiscal committee asking
 
06:44:16.468 --> 06:44:16.478 align:start position:0%
for a one-time infusion of funds to be
 
06:44:18.788 --> 06:44:18.798 align:start position:0%
able to follow up on the existing
 
06:44:18.798 --> 06:44:20.150 align:start position:0%
able to follow up on the existing
complaints

06:44:20.150 --> 06:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
06:44:22.788 --> 06:44:22.798 align:start position:0%
i i think is
 
06:44:24.150 --> 06:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
we want to see how the legislation
 
06:44:25.750 --> 06:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
passes and i want to talk to the
 
06:44:27.990 --> 06:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
governor's office about that obviously
 
06:44:31.030 --> 06:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
before moving forward but um i would
 
06:44:34.230 --> 06:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
suggest that um finding an fcc
 
06:44:36.788 --> 06:44:36.798 align:start position:0%
commissioner and having some amount of
 
06:44:39.430 --> 06:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
funds in there to immediately start
 
06:44:40.868 --> 06:44:40.878 align:start position:0%
following up on the backlog of
 
06:44:42.468 --> 06:44:42.478 align:start position:0%
complaints is in everyone's best
 
06:44:42.478 --> 06:44:43.590 align:start position:0%
complaints is in everyone's best
interest

06:44:43.590 --> 06:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
interest
 
06:44:45.830 --> 06:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
and then for the long term if if it was
 
06:44:45.840 --> 06:44:47.510 align:start position:0%
and then for the long term if if it was
decided

06:44:47.510 --> 06:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
decided
 
06:44:47.520 --> 06:44:48.310 align:start position:0%
decided
that

06:44:48.310 --> 06:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:44:50.310 --> 06:44:50.320 align:start position:0%
the right way to move forward is in hb2
 
06:44:53.510 --> 06:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
putting a proposal together about um
 
06:44:55.750 --> 06:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
these esti the energy
 
06:44:57.590 --> 06:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructure regulatory functions
 
06:44:59.670 --> 06:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
moving department of energy obviously
 
06:45:03.030 --> 06:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
that would include the staffing of uh at
 
06:45:03.040 --> 06:45:06.708 align:start position:0%
that would include the staffing of uh at
doe

06:45:06.708 --> 06:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:08.708 --> 06:45:08.718 align:start position:0%
any further questions for
 
06:45:11.190 --> 06:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative partial has a question
 
06:45:12.548 --> 06:45:12.558 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
06:45:14.390 --> 06:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
if i read this bill i do like this i
 
06:45:15.830 --> 06:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
should add i think there's a lot of
 
06:45:17.350 --> 06:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
cleaning up here that happens but the
 
06:45:19.190 --> 06:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
one thing that i'm still stumbling on is
 
06:45:21.110 --> 06:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
this um
 
06:45:22.708 --> 06:45:22.718 align:start position:0%
certificate for boundary the like i'm
 
06:45:23.990 --> 06:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
seeing that
 
06:45:24.000 --> 06:45:24.948 align:start position:0%
seeing that
um

06:45:24.948 --> 06:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:45:27.510 --> 06:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
in the case like a wind uh system on
 
06:45:28.948 --> 06:45:28.958 align:start position:0%
line 21
 
06:45:30.548 --> 06:45:30.558 align:start position:0%
we're talking about after you add up the
 
06:45:33.030 --> 06:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
cost from line 19 to 20
 
06:45:36.868 --> 06:45:36.878 align:start position:0%
21 and 26 i assume that applies as well
 
06:45:40.070 --> 06:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking about 168 thousand dollars
 
06:45:44.310 --> 06:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh as opposed to 87 200 for a
 
06:45:46.948 --> 06:45:46.958 align:start position:0%
coal or oil fueled factory
 
06:45:46.958 --> 06:45:48.390 align:start position:0%
coal or oil fueled factory
um

06:45:48.390 --> 06:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:45:50.070 --> 06:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
i must really
 
06:45:52.390 --> 06:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
i would love to get an answer on this
 
06:45:54.948 --> 06:45:54.958 align:start position:0%
yep no you have my commitment i'm gonna
 
06:45:54.958 --> 06:45:55.910 align:start position:0%
yep no you have my commitment i'm gonna
uh

06:45:55.910 --> 06:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:45:58.948 --> 06:45:58.958 align:start position:0%
go back to commissioner scott who was
 
06:46:01.830 --> 06:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
puc commissioner at the time and we'll
 
06:46:05.190 --> 06:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
know the history of where the
 
06:46:07.750 --> 06:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
the reasoning behind the amounts i i do
 
06:46:10.070 --> 06:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
believe there was a formula involved
 
06:46:11.510 --> 06:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
based on
 
06:46:14.150 --> 06:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
um how much it would cost to follow up
 
06:46:17.750 --> 06:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
on these but um and i i know it had it
 
06:46:19.350 --> 06:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
wasn't based on
 
06:46:21.430 --> 06:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
a policy initiative to
 
06:46:21.440 --> 06:46:22.708 align:start position:0%
a policy initiative to
um

06:46:22.708 --> 06:46:22.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:46:24.150 --> 06:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
support one
 
06:46:26.468 --> 06:46:26.478 align:start position:0%
fuel versus another one energy source
 
06:46:29.190 --> 06:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
versus another um but let me get you the
 
06:46:31.350 --> 06:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
the right answer on
 
06:46:32.628 --> 06:46:32.638 align:start position:0%
how those
 
06:46:36.150 --> 06:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
um values per megawatt were determined
 
06:46:39.030 --> 06:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
um where where the the figures came from
 
06:46:40.948 --> 06:46:40.958 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
06:46:42.548 --> 06:46:42.558 align:start position:0%
the commissioner won't mind me
 
06:46:44.150 --> 06:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
committing on his behalf we'll get that
 
06:46:46.788 --> 06:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
back to you because i i i can uh i
 
06:46:49.590 --> 06:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't here for the original and and i
 
06:46:50.788 --> 06:46:50.798 align:start position:0%
want to make sure you get the right
 
06:46:53.030 --> 06:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
answer for someone who was here when
 
06:46:55.590 --> 06:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
this was developed
 
06:46:58.230 --> 06:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
representative pementel has a question
 
06:46:59.670 --> 06:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mister
 
06:47:00.788 --> 06:47:00.798 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:47:03.830 --> 06:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you uh
 
06:47:05.590 --> 06:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
mr sanborn
 
06:47:08.548 --> 06:47:08.558 align:start position:0%
on the same subject
 
06:47:12.070 --> 06:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
you cannot ask commissioner scott about
 
06:47:14.548 --> 06:47:14.558 align:start position:0%
uh line 26
 
06:47:17.590 --> 06:47:17.600 align:start position:0%
because that's a totally new line yeah
 
06:47:17.600 --> 06:47:18.708 align:start position:0%
because that's a totally new line yeah
so

06:47:18.708 --> 06:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:47:20.788 --> 06:47:20.798 align:start position:0%
if you could maybe figure out well
 
06:47:23.270 --> 06:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
actually i can because uh we were part
 
06:47:26.788 --> 06:47:26.798 align:start position:0%
of the committee to draft this and um
 
06:47:29.270 --> 06:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
and i also think uh at the time diane
 
06:47:31.590 --> 06:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
martin was still chair
 
06:47:33.270 --> 06:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
so i i can
 
06:47:33.280 --> 06:47:34.310 align:start position:0%
so i i can
um

06:47:34.310 --> 06:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:47:36.868 --> 06:47:36.878 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go back and get some
 
06:47:38.708 --> 06:47:38.718 align:start position:0%
reasoning of where the original numbers
 
06:47:41.350 --> 06:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
came from and where that new line five
 
06:47:43.030 --> 06:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
came from as well thank you the
 
06:47:47.830 --> 06:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:49.990 --> 06:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
okay uh remember to turn your microphone
 
06:47:50.000 --> 06:47:50.708 align:start position:0%
okay uh remember to turn your microphone
off

06:47:50.708 --> 06:47:50.718 align:start position:0%
off
 
06:47:52.390 --> 06:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
if you're not speaking
 
06:47:54.708 --> 06:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
uh representative mcgee thank you mr
 
06:47:56.310 --> 06:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you mr sanborn for taking
 
06:47:57.670 --> 06:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
my question
 
06:48:00.390 --> 06:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
um my question is around you said you
 
06:48:02.788 --> 06:48:02.798 align:start position:0%
gave good a good explanation of what
 
06:48:04.868 --> 06:48:04.878 align:start position:0%
you're thinking is going to happen going
 
06:48:07.430 --> 06:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
forward with hb2 and changes in funding
 
06:48:08.390 --> 06:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
makes sense
 
06:48:10.150 --> 06:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
and i like the idea that you're saying
 
06:48:11.910 --> 06:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
you know the sec is kind of floating out
 
06:48:12.948 --> 06:48:12.958 align:start position:0%
here and it really doesn't have the
 
06:48:14.628 --> 06:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
resources to do what it's supposed to do
 
06:48:16.628 --> 06:48:16.638 align:start position:0%
because it's not a regular thing
 
06:48:18.310 --> 06:48:18.320 align:start position:0%
which makes sense all of that makes
 
06:48:19.430 --> 06:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
sense to me
 
06:48:21.990 --> 06:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
the the question i have is around the
 
06:48:23.990 --> 06:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
how we will find somebody to head up the
 
06:48:25.830 --> 06:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
sec because
 
06:48:25.840 --> 06:48:26.868 align:start position:0%
sec because
um

06:48:26.868 --> 06:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:48:28.310 --> 06:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
it seems like
 
06:48:31.750 --> 06:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
that agency maybe more than any other
 
06:48:34.868 --> 06:48:34.878 align:start position:0%
is regulatory in nature in terms of
 
06:48:36.948 --> 06:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
being sort of the
 
06:48:38.628 --> 06:48:38.638 align:start position:0%
the gatekeeper
 
06:48:38.638 --> 06:48:39.430 align:start position:0%
the gatekeeper
for

06:48:39.430 --> 06:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:48:41.990 --> 06:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
sighting of projects and so
 
06:48:44.150 --> 06:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if there has been any
 
06:48:46.310 --> 06:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
discussion around how you find that
 
06:48:48.230 --> 06:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
person that's
 
06:48:51.190 --> 06:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
the right person because the bright red
 
06:48:53.350 --> 06:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
line which we talk about a lot
 
06:48:55.270 --> 06:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
since the doe came in trying to figure
 
06:48:58.070 --> 06:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
out what is that line between
 
06:49:00.230 --> 06:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
executive agency functions and
 
06:49:03.670 --> 06:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
regulatory burden
 
06:49:05.110 --> 06:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
if you could just say anything about
 
06:49:05.910 --> 06:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
whether there have been any
 
06:49:08.868 --> 06:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
conversations um in ges on that piece or
 
06:49:11.190 --> 06:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
in in you know in your work on this yeah
 
06:49:12.788 --> 06:49:12.798 align:start position:0%
sure um
 
06:49:15.510 --> 06:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
a couple points on that um number one as
 
06:49:18.708 --> 06:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
i admitted last time uh we've had a lot
 
06:49:21.750 --> 06:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
of challenges uh recruiting we we
 
06:49:24.868 --> 06:49:24.878 align:start position:0%
pursued a few folks who at the end
 
06:49:26.150 --> 06:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
thought there were better professional
 
06:49:29.270 --> 06:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:31.590 --> 06:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
for themselves
 
06:49:33.590 --> 06:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
i will say this
 
06:49:35.430 --> 06:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
the bright red line
 
06:49:37.910 --> 06:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
in for this position actually
 
06:49:40.788 --> 06:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
it's more about
 
06:49:40.798 --> 06:49:41.590 align:start position:0%
it's more about
the

06:49:41.590 --> 06:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:49:45.190 --> 06:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
puc and the sec commissioners
 
06:49:46.708 --> 06:49:46.718 align:start position:0%
not being able to
 
06:49:46.718 --> 06:49:48.070 align:start position:0%
not being able to
discuss

06:49:48.070 --> 06:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
06:49:49.910 --> 06:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
matters there uh
 
06:49:53.190 --> 06:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
anything before them versus between them
 
06:49:55.590 --> 06:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
and the doe because
 
06:49:57.350 --> 06:49:57.360 align:start position:0%
the sec
 
06:49:58.628 --> 06:49:58.638 align:start position:0%
is really
 
06:50:02.548 --> 06:50:02.558 align:start position:0%
attached to the um puc now it's it's not
 
06:50:04.628 --> 06:50:04.638 align:start position:0%
other than uh you know the department of
 
06:50:07.270 --> 06:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
energy i think being now one of the
 
06:50:08.708 --> 06:50:08.718 align:start position:0%
members um
 
06:50:08.718 --> 06:50:09.830 align:start position:0%
members um
uh

06:50:09.830 --> 06:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:50:12.070 --> 06:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
there isn't so much the the bright red
 
06:50:15.190 --> 06:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
line um that needs to exist between the
 
06:50:16.628 --> 06:50:16.638 align:start position:0%
p you see
 
06:50:18.788 --> 06:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
and the new department of energy
 
06:50:18.798 --> 06:50:19.670 align:start position:0%
and the new department of energy
um

06:50:19.670 --> 06:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:50:21.670 --> 06:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
because the the functions are so
 
06:50:21.680 --> 06:50:22.708 align:start position:0%
because the the functions are so
separate

06:50:22.708 --> 06:50:22.718 align:start position:0%
separate
 
06:50:24.230 --> 06:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
um that part of it's not really
 
06:50:26.310 --> 06:50:26.320 align:start position:0%
concerning what's concerning is
 
06:50:29.110 --> 06:50:29.120 align:start position:0%
uh i think to your broader point this is
 
06:50:31.190 --> 06:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
it requires um
 
06:50:32.948 --> 06:50:32.958 align:start position:0%
you know a lawyer is
 
06:50:35.350 --> 06:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
the best candidate a lawyer with energy
 
06:50:35.360 --> 06:50:36.468 align:start position:0%
the best candidate a lawyer with energy
background

06:50:36.468 --> 06:50:36.478 align:start position:0%
background
 
06:50:39.350 --> 06:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
it would be the most ideal candidate um
 
06:50:41.350 --> 06:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
at its salary
 
06:50:44.468 --> 06:50:44.478 align:start position:0%
having one with a lot of experience
 
06:50:47.190 --> 06:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
is challenging giving private sector
 
06:50:49.510 --> 06:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
salaries right now for folks for
 
06:50:52.150 --> 06:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
equivalent folks
 
06:50:53.670 --> 06:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
and the other challenges is you're a
 
06:50:56.468 --> 06:50:56.478 align:start position:0%
staff of one yes you have the other
 
06:50:59.510 --> 06:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
commissioners and you do have some of
 
06:51:02.230 --> 06:51:02.240 align:start position:0%
the structure of the puc to to assist
 
06:51:05.590 --> 06:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
you but um you're you're a staff of one
 
06:51:05.600 --> 06:51:06.310 align:start position:0%
you but um you're you're a staff of one
so

06:51:06.310 --> 06:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:51:08.788 --> 06:51:08.798 align:start position:0%
um you do have to be you know in hiring
 
06:51:11.190 --> 06:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
you do have to find someone who um you
 
06:51:12.628 --> 06:51:12.638 align:start position:0%
have a lot of confidence in their
 
06:51:13.830 --> 06:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
06:51:17.030 --> 06:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh juggle all these balls you know uh
 
06:51:20.150 --> 06:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
with no staff assistance
 
06:51:20.160 --> 06:51:21.990 align:start position:0%
with no staff assistance
so

06:51:21.990 --> 06:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:51:23.030 --> 06:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
06:51:25.190 --> 06:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
and the follow-up would be i guess you
 
06:51:25.200 --> 06:51:26.150 align:start position:0%
and the follow-up would be i guess you
know

06:51:26.150 --> 06:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:51:28.868 --> 06:51:28.878 align:start position:0%
the concern i have uh i'm just being
 
06:51:31.830 --> 06:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
frank is independence right because if a
 
06:51:33.910 --> 06:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
person is an island if they're all by
 
06:51:36.310 --> 06:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
themselves as the head of a department
 
06:51:38.070 --> 06:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
and they're reliant on the department
 
06:51:40.788 --> 06:51:40.798 align:start position:0%
around them then the influence in the
 
06:51:43.590 --> 06:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
decision-making is
 
06:51:45.670 --> 06:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
seems like it could be
 
06:51:48.070 --> 06:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
it could become less independent than it
 
06:51:51.270 --> 06:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
might be if there were not
 
06:51:53.110 --> 06:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
that particular structure so i guess i'm
 
06:51:55.270 --> 06:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
just concerned about the structure
 
06:51:55.280 --> 06:51:56.150 align:start position:0%
just concerned about the structure
i

06:51:56.150 --> 06:51:56.160 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:51:58.548 --> 06:51:58.558 align:start position:0%
so all i can say is as i said in my
 
06:52:00.310 --> 06:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
testimony last week and i'll reiterate
 
06:52:03.190 --> 06:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
this week uh again this one i'm kind of
 
06:52:05.190 --> 06:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
speaking just as an individual involved
 
06:52:07.510 --> 06:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
in this um i too am very concerned about
 
06:52:09.830 --> 06:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
the structure which is why i was so
 
06:52:12.070 --> 06:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
supportive of last week's bill creating
 
06:52:14.548 --> 06:52:14.558 align:start position:0%
a study to look at totally reforming it
 
06:52:17.270 --> 06:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
um i i think given the nature of these
 
06:52:20.150 --> 06:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
and you know my experience now in the
 
06:52:23.830 --> 06:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
offshore wind um these regulatory
 
06:52:26.390 --> 06:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
responsibilities need a state agency not
 
06:52:29.590 --> 06:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
a ad hoc group of folks who this is
 
06:52:32.948 --> 06:52:32.958 align:start position:0%
a secondary responsibility with no staff
 
06:52:35.830 --> 06:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
no support so i i too the structure very
 
06:52:38.948 --> 06:52:38.958 align:start position:0%
much concerns me um i don't think it
 
06:52:42.708 --> 06:52:42.718 align:start position:0%
uh fits uh for 2002 and the importance
 
06:52:45.350 --> 06:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
of energy infrastructure and why
 
06:52:48.868 --> 06:52:48.878 align:start position:0%
uh i'll lend my voice on hopefully ideas
 
06:52:52.628 --> 06:52:52.638 align:start position:0%
of um of reforming the sec so that um
 
06:52:54.948 --> 06:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
energy infrastructure can be permitted
 
06:52:57.510 --> 06:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
and regulated uh similar to are the
 
06:53:00.830 --> 06:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
other regulatory functions of the
 
06:53:04.070 --> 06:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
state so i i to share your structure but
 
06:53:07.110 --> 06:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
i also i'm very concerned that groups of
 
06:53:09.510 --> 06:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
citizens have been waiting
 
06:53:12.468 --> 06:53:12.478 align:start position:0%
two years now for responses to their
 
06:53:15.270 --> 06:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
concerns of existing projects that have
 
06:53:17.430 --> 06:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
already been deployed and they haven't
 
06:53:19.430 --> 06:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
had any response so
 
06:53:21.430 --> 06:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
within the structure we have
 
06:53:24.390 --> 06:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh myself and commissioner scott as the
 
06:53:26.708 --> 06:53:26.718 align:start position:0%
vice chair we'll do everything we can to
 
06:53:28.390 --> 06:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
at least use what we have to try and
 
06:53:31.030 --> 06:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
address um our fellow citizens concerns
 
06:53:33.830 --> 06:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
out there thank you my concern was
 
06:53:35.430 --> 06:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
wasn't structured my concern was that
 
06:53:37.910 --> 06:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
the structure maintained independence of
 
06:53:40.310 --> 06:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
the decisions yeah so
 
06:53:42.150 --> 06:53:42.160 align:start position:0%
i i um
 
06:53:45.190 --> 06:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
again i too you are not the first person
 
06:53:47.030 --> 06:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
to point out that concern
 
06:53:49.270 --> 06:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
um other members of this committee have
 
06:53:50.548 --> 06:53:50.558 align:start position:0%
that concern
 
06:53:53.430 --> 06:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
um again which goes back to it still is
 
06:53:55.270 --> 06:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
kind of a structural question though
 
06:53:57.350 --> 06:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
because a better structure would
 
06:54:01.030 --> 06:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:03.350 --> 06:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
some of the legislation you'll see
 
06:54:03.360 --> 06:54:04.788 align:start position:0%
some of the legislation you'll see
is

06:54:04.788 --> 06:54:04.798 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:54:06.468 --> 06:54:06.478 align:start position:0%
geared around
 
06:54:09.270 --> 06:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
um a single individual not having so
 
06:54:11.030 --> 06:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
much autonomy to make a decision
 
06:54:11.040 --> 06:54:13.190 align:start position:0%
much autonomy to make a decision
themselves

06:54:13.190 --> 06:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
06:54:14.628 --> 06:54:14.638 align:start position:0%
again which
 
06:54:16.548 --> 06:54:16.558 align:start position:0%
short term we'll do the best we can with
 
06:54:18.628 --> 06:54:18.638 align:start position:0%
the structure we have and the dynamic we
 
06:54:20.628 --> 06:54:20.638 align:start position:0%
have and long term
 
06:54:20.638 --> 06:54:21.430 align:start position:0%
have and long term
uh

06:54:21.430 --> 06:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:54:23.110 --> 06:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
why improvements to the overall
 
06:54:28.310 --> 06:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:29.430 --> 06:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:54:31.510 --> 06:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
i'd like to
 
06:54:33.670 --> 06:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
advise members of the committee that i
 
06:54:36.628 --> 06:54:36.638 align:start position:0%
just forwarded to all of you
 
06:54:38.948 --> 06:54:38.958 align:start position:0%
a link to an article that was written by
 
06:54:41.590 --> 06:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
tom goetz in new hampshire business
 
06:54:41.600 --> 06:54:42.948 align:start position:0%
tom goetz in new hampshire business
review

06:54:42.948 --> 06:54:42.958 align:start position:0%
review
 
06:54:45.110 --> 06:54:45.120 align:start position:0%
about what a reorganization of the site
 
06:54:47.590 --> 06:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee might look like and
 
06:54:50.628 --> 06:54:50.638 align:start position:0%
he suggested in that article i
 
06:54:52.788 --> 06:54:52.798 align:start position:0%
urge you all to read it
 
06:54:52.798 --> 06:54:53.590 align:start position:0%
urge you all to read it
that

06:54:53.590 --> 06:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:54:56.468 --> 06:54:56.478 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
06:54:58.230 --> 06:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee might
 
06:55:01.110 --> 06:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
actually disappear altogether
 
06:55:02.150 --> 06:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
and that
 
06:55:04.468 --> 06:55:04.478 align:start position:0%
it would be replaced by
 
06:55:06.788 --> 06:55:06.798 align:start position:0%
an office of energy siting in the
 
06:55:08.948 --> 06:55:08.958 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
06:55:11.350 --> 06:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
and the adjudicative responsibility
 
06:55:14.230 --> 06:55:14.240 align:start position:0%
would be taken over by the puc
 
06:55:17.030 --> 06:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
so essentially the puc would become
 
06:55:19.110 --> 06:55:19.120 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation committee
 
06:55:21.910 --> 06:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
and with administrative support from the
 
06:55:23.510 --> 06:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
06:55:27.110 --> 06:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:27.120 --> 06:55:29.110 align:start position:0%
 
the

06:55:29.110 --> 06:55:29.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:55:31.910 --> 06:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
the course that the study committee
 
06:55:34.230 --> 06:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
should it be signed into law that looks
 
06:55:36.548 --> 06:55:36.558 align:start position:0%
at the future of the sec that's very
 
06:55:38.948 --> 06:55:38.958 align:start position:0%
likely the direction it will take
 
06:55:42.868 --> 06:55:42.878 align:start position:0%
to move toward a structure such as that
 
06:55:44.708 --> 06:55:44.718 align:start position:0%
that will be
 
06:55:47.110 --> 06:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
probably the first
 
06:55:49.030 --> 06:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
avenue that the study study committee
 
06:55:50.708 --> 06:55:50.718 align:start position:0%
will explore and if it looks like that
 
06:55:53.030 --> 06:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
will work then that's probably what will
 
06:55:55.750 --> 06:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
will be the recommendation for hb2 for
 
06:55:58.628 --> 06:55:58.638 align:start position:0%
next for 2023
 
06:56:00.310 --> 06:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
okay any further questions did you have
 
06:56:02.708 --> 06:56:02.718 align:start position:0%
a question representative callie pitts i
 
06:56:05.190 --> 06:56:05.200 align:start position:0%
didn't have a question i i had a comment
 
06:56:07.510 --> 06:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
and i i think probably it doesn't belong
 
06:56:09.190 --> 06:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
here neither did the last discussion
 
06:56:10.788 --> 06:56:10.798 align:start position:0%
wasn't part of the
 
06:56:13.510 --> 06:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
i i think that the fee structure that
 
06:56:15.270 --> 06:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
people were questioning
 
06:56:16.708 --> 06:56:16.718 align:start position:0%
was put in
 
06:56:19.990 --> 06:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
that the puc the sec was supposed to be
 
06:56:23.110 --> 06:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
autonomous and those fees were supposed
 
06:56:23.120 --> 06:56:24.548 align:start position:0%
autonomous and those fees were supposed
to

06:56:24.548 --> 06:56:24.558 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:56:26.788 --> 06:56:26.798 align:start position:0%
cover what it cost
 
06:56:26.798 --> 06:56:27.990 align:start position:0%
cover what it cost
to

06:56:27.990 --> 06:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:56:30.628 --> 06:56:30.638 align:start position:0%
investigate and study exactly what was
 
06:56:32.468 --> 06:56:32.478 align:start position:0%
going to happen with each project
 
06:56:34.948 --> 06:56:34.958 align:start position:0%
and if you took it each project and you
 
06:56:37.830 --> 06:56:37.840 align:start position:0%
looked at say the nuclear project
 
06:56:40.230 --> 06:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
that's 1200 megawatts
 
06:56:43.510 --> 06:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
so it's going to take more time
 
06:56:43.520 --> 06:56:45.670 align:start position:0%
so it's going to take more time
more

06:56:45.670 --> 06:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
more
 
06:56:48.708 --> 06:56:48.718 align:start position:0%
more looking into more consultants
 
06:56:51.270 --> 06:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
so i think that's was part of the basis
 
06:56:54.868 --> 06:56:54.878 align:start position:0%
that the the p the sec should be
 
06:56:56.788 --> 06:56:56.798 align:start position:0%
autonomous and that rate payers should
 
06:56:56.798 --> 06:56:58.628 align:start position:0%
autonomous and that rate payers should
not

06:56:58.628 --> 06:56:58.638 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:57:01.030 --> 06:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
bear that cost but the industries that
 
06:57:03.430 --> 06:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to pursue these projects should
 
06:57:06.548 --> 06:57:06.558 align:start position:0%
bear them and that was my understanding
 
06:57:08.150 --> 06:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
way back when
 
06:57:11.110 --> 06:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that's that's correct and
 
06:57:13.670 --> 06:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
what i'm going to investigate is
 
06:57:15.750 --> 06:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
what determined the
 
06:57:18.548 --> 06:57:18.558 align:start position:0%
the amounts for each type of
 
06:57:20.708 --> 06:57:20.718 align:start position:0%
activity where where
 
06:57:24.390 --> 06:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh how that was determined and um
 
06:57:26.868 --> 06:57:26.878 align:start position:0%
as you can tell from my testimony i to
 
06:57:28.788 --> 06:57:28.798 align:start position:0%
share uh
 
06:57:32.788 --> 06:57:32.798 align:start position:0%
the uh the suggestion of the article uh
 
06:57:35.430 --> 06:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
that the chairman mentioned is uh very
 
06:57:36.868 --> 06:57:36.878 align:start position:0%
much in line with what i would think
 
06:57:39.590 --> 06:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
would make a lot more sense in today's
 
06:57:42.708 --> 06:57:42.718 align:start position:0%
day um given uh
 
06:57:42.718 --> 06:57:43.430 align:start position:0%
day um given uh
just

06:57:43.430 --> 06:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
just
 
06:57:45.030 --> 06:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
quite frankly the broken structure of
 
06:57:47.990 --> 06:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:49.590 --> 06:57:49.600 align:start position:0%
okay representative callie pitts don't
 
06:57:51.110 --> 06:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
forget to turn your microphone off when
 
06:57:52.788 --> 06:57:52.798 align:start position:0%
you're no i don't i want to be heard
 
06:57:54.310 --> 06:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
because the puc
 
06:57:56.868 --> 06:57:56.878 align:start position:0%
is funded by the ratepayers and the sec
 
06:57:58.548 --> 06:57:58.558 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be
 
06:58:00.070 --> 06:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
it isn't
 
06:58:02.468 --> 06:58:02.478 align:start position:0%
it's funded by the application fees
 
06:58:06.548 --> 06:58:06.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:06.558 --> 06:58:08.150 align:start position:0%
 
pardoned

06:58:08.150 --> 06:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
pardoned
 
06:58:11.030 --> 06:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
no i mean there are parts of the
 
06:58:13.670 --> 06:58:13.680 align:start position:0%
many parts of the permitting process
 
06:58:16.150 --> 06:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
that des has funded is funded through
 
06:58:16.160 --> 06:58:17.110 align:start position:0%
that des has funded is funded through
fees

06:58:17.110 --> 06:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
fees
 
06:58:19.910 --> 06:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
um the fish and game
 
06:58:22.230 --> 06:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
permitting functions are permitted are
 
06:58:24.948 --> 06:58:24.958 align:start position:0%
funded through fees so the fees in the
 
06:58:27.910 --> 06:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
industry could even under the structure
 
06:58:30.468 --> 06:58:30.478 align:start position:0%
the chairman mentioned fees could still
 
06:58:32.868 --> 06:58:32.878 align:start position:0%
fund those activities and the burden
 
06:58:35.430 --> 06:58:35.440 align:start position:0%
still wouldn't go to the ratepayer so
 
06:58:38.230 --> 06:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
even even the puc functions you could
 
06:58:38.240 --> 06:58:39.110 align:start position:0%
even even the puc functions you could
fund

06:58:39.110 --> 06:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
fund
 
06:58:41.830 --> 06:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
anything related to the adjudicative to
 
06:58:44.390 --> 06:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
this to be paid for from the fund that
 
06:58:46.868 --> 06:58:46.878 align:start position:0%
is supported by industry fees so you
 
06:58:49.990 --> 06:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
could have all of the current activities
 
06:58:52.310 --> 06:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
put in better parts and better able
 
06:58:54.468 --> 06:58:54.478 align:start position:0%
parts of the state government and still
 
06:58:57.350 --> 06:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
all funded by industry applications and
 
06:58:58.548 --> 06:58:58.558 align:start position:0%
fees and not
 
06:59:03.030 --> 06:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:04.868 --> 06:59:04.878 align:start position:0%
representative loki you had a question
 
06:59:06.390 --> 06:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
or a comment um thank you
 
06:59:09.350 --> 06:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
might there be a point to all of this
 
06:59:09.360 --> 06:59:10.230 align:start position:0%
might there be a point to all of this
where

06:59:10.230 --> 06:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
where
 
06:59:12.468 --> 06:59:12.478 align:start position:0%
some of these activities cover an awful
 
06:59:14.708 --> 06:59:14.718 align:start position:0%
lot of real estate uh if you know for
 
06:59:17.110 --> 06:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
instance northern pass would impact
 
06:59:18.468 --> 06:59:18.478 align:start position:0%
most of the state
 
06:59:22.788 --> 06:59:22.798 align:start position:0%
and whereas if you put a uh
 
06:59:24.948 --> 06:59:24.958 align:start position:0%
combined cycle natural gas plant down
 
06:59:27.910 --> 06:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
kerplunk it's just you know a few acres
 
06:59:29.510 --> 06:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
and there's that would seem to be a
 
06:59:30.868 --> 06:59:30.878 align:start position:0%
significant variable that the site
 
06:59:32.948 --> 06:59:32.958 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee yeah i
 
06:59:35.510 --> 06:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
i i think everyone who's mentioned
 
06:59:37.190 --> 06:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
the reasoning are all
 
06:59:39.030 --> 06:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
you put them together and it's it's all
 
06:59:39.040 --> 06:59:39.990 align:start position:0%
you put them together and it's it's all
the

06:59:39.990 --> 06:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:59:41.910 --> 06:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
the answer was they figured out a
 
06:59:44.948 --> 06:59:44.958 align:start position:0%
formula of what the cost per megawatt
 
06:59:44.958 --> 06:59:45.910 align:start position:0%
formula of what the cost per megawatt
was

06:59:45.910 --> 06:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
was
 
06:59:49.270 --> 06:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
and associated the fee structure based
 
06:59:52.468 --> 06:59:52.478 align:start position:0%
on those and um i'm just what i'm going
 
06:59:54.390 --> 06:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
to do is confirm
 
06:59:56.548 --> 06:59:56.558 align:start position:0%
where those numbers came from and then
 
06:59:59.750 --> 06:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
i'll also confirm go back in our notes
 
07:00:02.390 --> 07:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
about why we came up with the number
 
07:00:07.910 --> 07:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:11.750 --> 07:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
okay anything further for mr sanborn
 
07:00:13.670 --> 07:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
we appreciate you being here assistant
 
07:00:17.110 --> 07:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner of des thank you very much
 
07:00:18.788 --> 07:00:18.798 align:start position:0%
we have one more person who would like
 
07:00:21.110 --> 07:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
to speak to us before we leave this
 
07:00:23.030 --> 07:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
public hearing and that's john tuthill
 
07:00:25.270 --> 07:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
so mr tuthill
 
07:00:30.788 --> 07:00:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:32.868 --> 07:00:32.878 align:start position:0%
john's hot hill awkward sullivan county
 
07:00:32.878 --> 07:00:33.670 align:start position:0%
john's hot hill awkward sullivan county
um

07:00:33.670 --> 07:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:00:35.110 --> 07:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
the parking meter is going to run out in
 
07:00:36.468 --> 07:00:36.478 align:start position:0%
about one and a half minutes so that's
 
07:00:38.150 --> 07:00:38.160 align:start position:0%
what i'm going to try to take
 
07:00:38.160 --> 07:00:39.590 align:start position:0%
what i'm going to try to take
um

07:00:39.590 --> 07:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:00:41.510 --> 07:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
this is perhaps non-germane but we were
 
07:00:43.190 --> 07:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
speaking earlier about landfills there's
 
07:00:45.350 --> 07:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
not a capacity crisis in new hampshire
 
07:00:46.948 --> 07:00:46.958 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire generated waste and
 
07:00:49.270 --> 07:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a good decade if not
 
07:00:51.830 --> 07:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
more it has occurred to me
 
07:00:54.070 --> 07:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
that with projects on the scale of a
 
07:00:56.468 --> 07:00:56.478 align:start position:0%
recent proposal in the north country
 
07:00:58.628 --> 07:00:58.638 align:start position:0%
on a 2 000 acre property
 
07:01:00.628 --> 07:01:00.638 align:start position:0%
uh where the first phase of that the
 
07:01:02.468 --> 07:01:02.478 align:start position:0%
first three phases in fact which are
 
07:01:04.548 --> 07:01:04.558 align:start position:0%
part of a incomplete permit application
 
07:01:06.390 --> 07:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
before des
 
07:01:08.070 --> 07:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
you'd be looking at revenues in excess
 
07:01:09.830 --> 07:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
of a billion dollars these are very very
 
07:01:12.150 --> 07:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
large projects and i think we've gotten
 
07:01:13.910 --> 07:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
to the point now
 
07:01:16.628 --> 07:01:16.638 align:start position:0%
where uh having something like the site
 
07:01:18.468 --> 07:01:18.478 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee
 
07:01:20.628 --> 07:01:20.638 align:start position:0%
with multiple agencies participating
 
07:01:20.638 --> 07:01:22.070 align:start position:0%
with multiple agencies participating
considering

07:01:22.070 --> 07:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
considering
 
07:01:23.990 --> 07:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
um citing of these
 
07:01:26.150 --> 07:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
these projects which are in essence
 
07:01:28.070 --> 07:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
utilities at this point i mean that's
 
07:01:29.590 --> 07:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
not how they're regulated in fact they
 
07:01:31.270 --> 07:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
really are not regulated from a business
 
07:01:32.548 --> 07:01:32.558 align:start position:0%
point of view
 
07:01:32.558 --> 07:01:33.590 align:start position:0%
point of view
um

07:01:33.590 --> 07:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:01:33.600 --> 07:01:34.390 align:start position:0%
um
but

07:01:34.390 --> 07:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:01:37.030 --> 07:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
i think we've gotten um to where there's
 
07:01:39.110 --> 07:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
a near monopoly monopoly on waste
 
07:01:41.030 --> 07:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
disposal services in the state with two
 
07:01:42.708 --> 07:01:42.718 align:start position:0%
two very very large corporations
 
07:01:44.548 --> 07:01:44.558 align:start position:0%
multi-billion dollar corporations one of
 
07:01:45.910 --> 07:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
them global
 
07:01:47.830 --> 07:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
um so that was just an idea i'd like to
 
07:01:49.110 --> 07:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
put out here if we're going to be doing
 
07:01:50.948 --> 07:01:50.958 align:start position:0%
some long long term thinking about the
 
07:01:52.948 --> 07:01:52.958 align:start position:0%
role of the sec
 
07:01:55.990 --> 07:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
i would be very interested in including
 
07:01:57.430 --> 07:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh the sighting of these major
 
07:01:59.750 --> 07:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
industrial facilities uh
 
07:02:01.510 --> 07:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
something for the sec to consider thank
 
07:02:03.190 --> 07:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
07:02:05.590 --> 07:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
07:02:07.190 --> 07:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah i hope you make your parking
 
07:02:08.708 --> 07:02:08.718 align:start position:0%
meter i'll send you the bill if i don't
 
07:02:08.718 --> 07:02:09.430 align:start position:0%
meter i'll send you the bill if i don't
know

07:02:09.430 --> 07:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
know
 
07:02:09.440 --> 07:02:11.190 align:start position:0%
know
okay

07:02:11.190 --> 07:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:02:13.670 --> 07:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
that exhausts the number of people who
 
07:02:15.510 --> 07:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
want to speak on this so representative
 
07:02:17.030 --> 07:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
mick williams can you give us the blue
 
07:02:17.040 --> 07:02:17.830 align:start position:0%
mick williams can you give us the blue
sheet

07:02:17.830 --> 07:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
sheet
 
07:02:19.670 --> 07:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
this is senate bill
 
07:02:23.910 --> 07:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
429 we had six in support 25 opposed
 
07:02:27.270 --> 07:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
zero neutral it's open until midnight
 
07:02:30.468 --> 07:02:30.478 align:start position:0%
okay thank you with that i will close
 
07:02:32.548 --> 07:02:32.558 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on house uh senate
 
07:02:34.868 --> 07:02:34.878 align:start position:0%
bill 429
 
07:02:37.990 --> 07:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
and now we will have a discussion about
 
07:02:41.510 --> 07:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
tomorrow's executive session
 
07:02:44.070 --> 07:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
i have identified nine bills that we can
 
07:02:45.990 --> 07:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
exact tomorrow
 
07:02:48.468 --> 07:02:48.478 align:start position:0%
and uh we will do so
 
07:02:50.868 --> 07:02:50.878 align:start position:0%
starting at the conclusion
 
07:02:53.590 --> 07:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
of the public hearing on the last bill
 
07:02:56.708 --> 07:02:56.718 align:start position:0%
tomorrow which i believe is senate bill
 
07:02:56.718 --> 07:02:58.548 align:start position:0%
tomorrow which i believe is senate bill
271.

07:02:58.548 --> 07:02:58.558 align:start position:0%
271.
 
07:03:01.270 --> 07:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
so the nine bills we will exec tomorrow
 
07:03:02.230 --> 07:03:02.240 align:start position:0%
will be
 
07:03:04.868 --> 07:03:04.878 align:start position:0%
senate bill 256
 
07:03:08.230 --> 07:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
senate bill 440 fn
 
07:03:11.110 --> 07:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
senate bill 259
 
07:03:14.708 --> 07:03:14.718 align:start position:0%
senate bill 261-fn
 
07:03:17.750 --> 07:03:17.760 align:start position:0%

07:03:19.200 --> 07:03:21.510 align:start position:0%
senate bill
268-fn

07:03:21.510 --> 07:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
268-fn
 
07:03:24.628 --> 07:03:24.638 align:start position:0%
senate bill 269-fn
 
07:03:26.948 --> 07:03:26.958 align:start position:0%
senate bill 270
 
07:03:28.830 --> 07:03:28.840 align:start position:0%
and senate bill
 
07:03:32.310 --> 07:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
424-f n
 
07:03:35.030 --> 07:03:35.040 align:start position:0%
but we will start that probably
 
07:03:37.910 --> 07:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
with a little bit of luck around
 
07:03:39.750 --> 07:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
3 30
 
07:03:41.270 --> 07:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
07:03:44.708 --> 07:03:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:03:46.230 --> 07:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
we'll go as late as we have to to get
 
07:03:47.350 --> 07:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
them all done
 
07:03:50.468 --> 07:03:50.478 align:start position:0%
because i want all of those bills to be
 
07:03:53.270 --> 07:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
heard or on the house floor on
 
07:03:56.468 --> 07:03:56.478 align:start position:0%
april 21st so when we exec them tomorrow
 
07:03:58.628 --> 07:03:58.638 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask that all
 
07:04:01.670 --> 07:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
majority and minority reports
 
07:04:03.430 --> 07:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
be ready to go
 
07:04:05.270 --> 07:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
by wednesday
 
07:04:06.468 --> 07:04:06.478 align:start position:0%
at noon
 
07:04:06.478 --> 07:04:07.990 align:start position:0%
at noon
okay

07:04:07.990 --> 07:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
07:04:10.548 --> 07:04:10.558 align:start position:0%
representative pimentel
 
07:04:13.190 --> 07:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um will you
 
07:04:13.200 --> 07:04:14.868 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um will you
consider

07:04:14.868 --> 07:04:14.878 align:start position:0%
consider
 
07:04:16.468 --> 07:04:16.478 align:start position:0%
like filling ins
 
07:04:17.910 --> 07:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
we we have
 
07:04:20.548 --> 07:04:20.558 align:start position:0%
four hearings tomorrow
 
07:04:20.558 --> 07:04:24.230 align:start position:0%
four hearings tomorrow
um

07:04:24.230 --> 07:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:27.030 --> 07:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
a fifth bill got added so there's bill
 
07:04:29.190 --> 07:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
got added okay
 
07:04:31.350 --> 07:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
and that's why it's going to three
 
07:04:32.230 --> 07:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
all right
 
07:04:33.910 --> 07:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
i was just wondering
 
07:04:35.830 --> 07:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh if you would be filling in on the
 
07:04:35.840 --> 07:04:37.190 align:start position:0%
uh if you would be filling in on the
execs

07:04:37.190 --> 07:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
execs
 
07:04:39.190 --> 07:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
well what we will do
 
07:04:39.200 --> 07:04:40.628 align:start position:0%
well what we will do
um

07:04:40.628 --> 07:04:40.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
07:04:43.670 --> 07:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
if if a bill scheduled for nine o'clock
 
07:04:46.868 --> 07:04:46.878 align:start position:0%
for example finishes at 9 45 we'll try
 
07:04:49.350 --> 07:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
to squeeze in an exact session on one
 
07:04:49.360 --> 07:04:50.628 align:start position:0%
to squeeze in an exact session on one
bill

07:04:50.628 --> 07:04:50.638 align:start position:0%
bill
 
07:04:53.110 --> 07:04:53.120 align:start position:0%
before the the next bill starts at 10
 
07:04:53.120 --> 07:04:54.230 align:start position:0%
before the the next bill starts at 10
o'clock

07:04:54.230 --> 07:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
07:04:54.240 --> 07:04:55.510 align:start position:0%
o'clock
but

07:04:55.510 --> 07:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
07:04:58.150 --> 07:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
i need the cooperation of all of you to
 
07:05:00.230 --> 07:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
make that happen you've got to reduce
 
07:05:02.390 --> 07:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
the number of questions you ask so that
 
07:05:03.990 --> 07:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
we can get through these public hearings

representative samsic
 
07:06:04.708 --> 07:06:04.718 align:start position:0%
uh yes mr chairman i think you mentioned
 
07:06:08.070 --> 07:06:08.080 align:start position:0%
that tomorrow our last bill would be 271
 
07:06:10.708 --> 07:06:10.718 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be 321
 
07:06:10.718 --> 07:06:11.590 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be 321
why

07:06:11.590 --> 07:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
why
 
07:06:15.990 --> 07:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
actually now i think 44.48 448 yeah okay
 
07:06:18.070 --> 07:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
that's right okay
 
07:06:20.708 --> 07:06:20.718 align:start position:0%
and you're right 321 does come after 271
 
07:06:22.788 --> 07:06:22.798 align:start position:0%
okay so thank you
 
07:06:22.798 --> 07:06:23.750 align:start position:0%

representative callie pitts
 
07:06:28.230 --> 07:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
i just want to say that i'm going to
 
07:06:30.948 --> 07:06:30.958 align:start position:0%
why i ask questions at the public
 
07:06:33.190 --> 07:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
hearing is because we know we're not
 
07:06:35.430 --> 07:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
going to have subcommittees or another
 
07:06:37.590 --> 07:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
chance or another opportunity
 
07:06:39.830 --> 07:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
to question and that's why i think some
 
07:06:42.948 --> 07:06:42.958 align:start position:0%
of the questions are a little protracted
 
07:06:47.590 --> 07:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:49.830 --> 07:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
okay that's fine
 
07:06:52.390 --> 07:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
