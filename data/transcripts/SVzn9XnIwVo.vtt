00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
okay the time being 10 I'm going to
 
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
convene this meeting of the commission
 
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 align:start position:0%
on worldwide combined reporting for the
 
00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 align:start position:0%
uh unitary businesses under the business
 
00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:58.750 align:start position:0%
uh unitary businesses under the business
profit

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
profit
 
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.270 align:start position:0%
profit
tax

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 align:start position:0%
um we
 
00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
have a draft of the Minority Report that
 
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
we received last week from
 
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
representative shamberg
 
00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 align:start position:0%
advocating uh in
 
00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 align:start position:0%
favor of moving to the worldwide
 
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
combined reporting and uh representative
 
00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 align:start position:0%
shamberg as we knew will not be here
 
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 align:start position:0%
today um and he has uh told us that he
 
00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 align:start position:0%
is likely to make revisions to that uh
 
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 align:start position:0%
draft so I'm sure we'll have an updated
 
00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 align:start position:0%
version from him when we meet next
 
00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.070 align:start position:0%
version from him when we meet next
Monday

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
um I've circulated uh to the members a
 
00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 align:start position:0%
draft of the report that goes so far as
 
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 align:start position:0%
uh laying out the process and procedure
 
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
that we've been through so
 
00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 align:start position:0%
far and the testimony and the record uh
 
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 align:start position:0%
reciting what we've heard from those
 
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:02.360 align:start position:0%
who've come before
 
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 align:start position:0%
us and uh I thought when I began
 
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
drafting that that it might be more
 
00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 align:start position:0%
brief uh but it turns out you can't be
 
00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
very cursory about these heavily nuanced
 
00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 align:start position:0%
um specific positions so it is actually
 
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
a pretty full-bodied
 
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
um synopsis of the actual position of
 
00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 align:start position:0%
each um each of our expert
 
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
Witnesses um so
 
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
so we will discuss
 
00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 align:start position:0%
that the we also have um the document
 
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
prepared by our two members Kevin
 
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
Kennedy and Matt
 
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
Foley which elaborates on the uh outline
 
00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 align:start position:0%
that they put before us last week into
 
00:04:54.749 --> 00:04:54.759 align:start position:0%
more of a a narrative and uh I know that
 
00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
I've just uh I'm just seeing that uh for
 
00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
um so I think that uh we should look at
 
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 align:start position:0%
the Kennedy Foley draft
 
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
section as the basis for the
 
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 align:start position:0%
findings um segment of our
 
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 align:start position:0%
report and during the coming week we can
 
00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639 align:start position:0%
flush out elaborate uh on any of the
 
00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:24.919 align:start position:0%
things that are in that and see whether
 
00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
it covered the
 
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
Waterfront so
 
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
the progression of the
 
00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 align:start position:0%
report U we've had a bit of a bumpy
 
00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:36.759 align:start position:0%
start and that's laid
 
00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 align:start position:0%
out we've had a very diverse uh set of
 
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh participate participants and comments
 
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
and I believe that that is well laid out
 
00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 align:start position:0%
in the finding in in the U testimony
 
00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:51.070 align:start position:0%
in the finding in in the U testimony
record

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 align:start position:0%
record
 
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
section but we may want to add a little
 
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
bit more in regards to some of the
 
00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639 align:start position:0%
written submissions we've received it's
 
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
very thorough at this moment
 
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of everybody who appeared
 
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.749 align:start position:0%
in terms of everybody who appeared
before

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:05.670 align:start position:0%
before
us

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 align:start position:0%
um and then I think the
 
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
findings should be as much as possible
 
00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
uh statements of fact as we understand
 
00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
them pros and cons the report is a very
 
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 align:start position:0%
balanced document I believe through
 
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
those sections doesn't take a stance for
 
00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 align:start position:0%
example in the synopsis of testimony uh
 
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
there's no commentary from the chair or
 
00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:35.479 align:start position:0%
from the members it's just trying to in
 
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
a very even way um State what their
 
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
position was so we'll then need uh to
 
00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
boil down our findings with
 
00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:48.919 align:start position:0%
recommendations and uh those are not yet
 
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
prepared as of today but I would say we
 
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.240 align:start position:0%
work on drafting the recommendations
 
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
during the week and when we meet next
 
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.230 align:start position:0%
during the week and when we meet next
Monday

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
Monday
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
morning uh I'd like to conclude the
 
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
report as much as possible there might
 
00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
be some eyes to do and teas to cross
 
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:05.960 align:start position:0%
after we leave next
 
00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
Monday so you'll be getting the things
 
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
that I'm talking about early in this
 
00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
week so that it's not a uh you know
 
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
Sunday night Monday morning U
 
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:20.639 align:start position:0%
surprise okay so we have we know that
 
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
representative shamberg will not be with
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
us today and Matt Foley advised he'll be
 
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:28.360 align:start position:0%
delayed to 10:30 I'd like to take any
 
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
questions or comments and then suggest
 
00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
perhaps we just recess briefly while we
 
00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
wait for Matt Foy will give us a chance
 
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
to read what's been put in front of us
 
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.589 align:start position:0%
to read what's been put in front of us
this

00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
questions okay the commission is in
 
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:47.080 align:start position:0%
recess till the call of the chair
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:58.319 --> 00:17:27.390 align:start position:0%
 
10:30

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:27.400 --> 00:22:13.430 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh as Mr fol has joined
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
us uh we have our Quorum uh this is a
 
00:22:22.669 --> 00:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
official meeting of the commission on
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting um drafting
 
00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:31.400 align:start position:0%
in progress up to this date uh has been
 
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh is not publicly disseminated but the
 
00:22:37.149 --> 00:22:37.159 align:start position:0%
drafts as of this date that are being
 
00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
considered by a quarum of the committee
 
00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
are now public documents and extra
 
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
table before we get into the substance I
 
00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
just want to uh observe that
 
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative shamberg has prepared
 
00:22:58.590 --> 00:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
minutes for both the October 10th and
 
00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
October 17th meetings as he's not here
 
00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
and I see a couple of small revisions
 
00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
I'd like to suggest we'll wait till we
 
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
meet next week at which point we'll look
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
at all of the minutes of the last
 
00:23:16.029 --> 00:23:16.039 align:start position:0%
several meetings including today's and
 
00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:18.559 align:start position:0%
we'll adopt minutes anticipating that
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
next Monday is our last
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
meeting um and I'm expecting that Mr
 
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
Kennedy is going to be unable to attend
 
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
next Monday at this time I'm won to okay
 
00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:34.360 align:start position:0%
but the the remaining six uh I'm
 
00:23:36.029 --> 00:23:36.039 align:start position:0%
expecting all of us to be here so we'll
 
00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
have the necessary Quorum and in
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative Schamberg's absence uh
 
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative Olie has graciously
 
00:23:47.789 --> 00:23:47.799 align:start position:0%
agreed to uh uh keep the record of
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
attendance and prepare
 
00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:55.390 align:start position:0%
attendance and prepare
minutes

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:58.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm very pleased
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
that uh I think the pieces are are
 
00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:03.320 align:start position:0%
fitting together and we're seeing what
 
00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
this is going to look like uh as I said
 
00:24:10.029 --> 00:24:10.039 align:start position:0%
uh when I opened and uh I'm going to
 
00:24:12.149 --> 00:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
repeat this just briefly for Mr Foley's
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
benefit the draft that I've
 
00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:18.799 align:start position:0%
prepared goes so far as to lay out the
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
process and
 
00:24:24.909 --> 00:24:24.919 align:start position:0%
procedures and to provide a pretty
 
00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:28.440 align:start position:0%
thorough uh granular synopsis of the
 
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
testimony and record of all of the
 
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
experts who appeared before us either in
 
00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
person or via video
 
00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
link and that includes
 
00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.950 align:start position:0%
link and that includes
also

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:24:47.909 --> 00:24:47.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
ago so I think that section is virtually
 
00:24:55.389 --> 00:24:55.399 align:start position:0%
complete I think the only addition that
 
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
I'm considering adding to it is with
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
there's been quite quite a bit of
 
00:25:03.149 --> 00:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
discussion of the itep study and the tax
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
found foundation's
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
rebuttal and if everybody else agrees
 
00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:09.240 align:start position:0%
even though they neither appeared in
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
front of us we have their reports
 
00:25:15.389 --> 00:25:15.399 align:start position:0%
they've um uh had
 
00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:18.200 align:start position:0%
a focus in our conversations and I think
 
00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:20.200 align:start position:0%
it would be good to include those in the
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
synopsis of the record the rest of the
 
00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:26.559 align:start position:0%
things that we have you know received or
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
received links to studies uh things that
 
00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:32.360 align:start position:0%
are online court cases etc etc will not
 
00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.310 align:start position:0%
are online court cases etc etc will not
be

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:25:39.669 --> 00:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
described in the uh record uh section
 
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
but we have a very extensive
 
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
bibliography that Gen 4 has prepared for
 
00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
us and I think everyone's seen that so
 
00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:49.480 align:start position:0%
it's a anybody who's coming back at this
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
issue at a later date doing research uh
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
has a very extensive uh guide of
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
resources um so to does everybody agree
 
00:26:02.669 --> 00:26:02.679 align:start position:0%
that it makes sense to include a brief
 
00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:06.679 align:start position:0%
synopsis of the itep estimate and the
 
00:26:12.029 --> 00:26:12.039 align:start position:0%
tax Foundation rebot okay I will do
 
00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
that so I think that uh that will be
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
appending that that will go into the uh
 
00:26:22.909 --> 00:26:22.919 align:start position:0%
section of testimony and
 
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
record um as additional documents that
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
commission added as agenda I see we
 
00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
could do that we could have them as
 
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:43.960 align:start position:0%
attachments any objection to that okay
 
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:56.600 --> 00:27:08.830 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
all right so again the purpose of the uh
 
00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
testimoni and record is to be fair and
 
00:27:17.549 --> 00:27:17.559 align:start position:0%
balanced to to make an accurate
 
00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
description of what we heard so please
 
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
as you read this more carefully during
 
00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
the coming week if you think there's
 
00:27:26.710 --> 00:27:26.720 align:start position:0%
anything there that's misstated
 
00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
mischaracterized out of balance let me
 
00:27:31.870 --> 00:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
know that
 
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
um and uh we'll do any massaging that we
 
00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
uh that we believe is
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
necessary I don't I think if you're
 
00:27:42.190 --> 00:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
going to send a comment to me copy the
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
other members but I don't anticipate a
 
00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:46.919 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion via email uh which is
 
00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
not a noticed meeting just rather you
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
know here's what I've seen and then let
 
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
me evaluate it and if there's questions
 
00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.519 --> 00:27:58.710 align:start position:0%
 
Monday

00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
Monday
 
00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
uh again I I know you've only gotten
 
00:28:03.909 --> 00:28:03.919 align:start position:0%
this last evening or in some cases this
 
00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
morning and have had Fairly scant
 
00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:09.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look at it but is there
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
anything that anybody wants to bring up
 
00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
at this
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
point about the draft on testimony and
 
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
record yes Mr
 
00:28:23.470 --> 00:28:23.480 align:start position:0%
Wong thank you chair uh just a quick
 
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
observation um on page five the uh first
 
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph the second last
 
00:28:35.269 --> 00:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
line onto the right so it says even the
 
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
rate on BPT and then Z 0 I'm not sure if
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
that was um typo or something like that
 
00:28:46.389 --> 00:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that is definitely a typo
 
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
and and I will read it closely and clean
 
00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
it up all right thank
 
00:28:53.549 --> 00:28:53.559 align:start position:0%
you good catch thank you that's exactly
 
00:28:55.549 --> 00:28:55.559 align:start position:0%
I need eagle
 
00:28:59.630 --> 00:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
eyes any other observations at this
 
00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
point right so please do not hold back
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
during the week and the earlier in the
 
00:29:07.389 --> 00:29:07.399 align:start position:0%
week you can get me your comments uh the
 
00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
better and I'll try to incorporate
 
00:29:11.830 --> 00:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
things rapidly as I receive
 
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
them okay so let's move on to the
 
00:29:19.509 --> 00:29:19.519 align:start position:0%
findings and
 
00:29:21.909 --> 00:29:21.919 align:start position:0%
recommendations I'm going to divide
 
00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
findings and recommendations so the
 
00:29:27.549 --> 00:29:27.559 align:start position:0%
caption that you see on page seven of
 
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
the draft
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
report uh comes from a uh a template
 
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
that Gen 4 provided me this next section
 
00:29:37.149 --> 00:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
findings and I think the findings should
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
be as close as possible to a declarative
 
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
statements of what we all um effectively
 
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
agree to that doesn't mean that there
 
00:29:53.149 --> 00:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
couldn't be a 61 divide of opinion but
 
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
it speaks for the Commission in other
 
00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
words and I think that uh
 
00:29:59.710 --> 00:29:59.720 align:start position:0%
what Mr Kennedy and Mr Foley have put
 
00:30:01.710 --> 00:30:01.720 align:start position:0%
forward is a
 
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
fantastic um foundation for the findings
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
we can elaborate on it massage on it a
 
00:30:09.389 --> 00:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
little bit but that I think is something
 
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
that we should uh discuss next so what
 
00:30:15.710 --> 00:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
you don't so you take the portion I've
 
00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
drafted the portion that they have
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
drafted and that brings us I think all
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
the way through a factual summary of
 
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
everything we've heard and concluded
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
what that then
 
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
leaves is the question is there any
 
00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:35.720 align:start position:0%
analysis and explanation that is more
 
00:30:40.269 --> 00:30:40.279 align:start position:0%
opinion based and I think there might be
 
00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:41.480 align:start position:0%
a bit of
 
00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
that but I don't have I want to get home
 
00:30:48.389 --> 00:30:48.399 align:start position:0%
sit down at my computer and think a
 
00:30:50.909 --> 00:30:50.919 align:start position:0%
little bit more about what if anything
 
00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
needs explanation to
 
00:30:56.669 --> 00:30:56.679 align:start position:0%
support the commission's ultimate
 
00:30:56.679 --> 00:30:58.070 align:start position:0%
support the commission's ultimate
recommendation

00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
00:31:00.509 --> 00:31:00.519 align:start position:0%
and then the recommendation we will take
 
00:31:00.519 --> 00:31:01.629 align:start position:0%
and then the recommendation we will take
a

00:31:01.629 --> 00:31:01.639 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:31:05.509 --> 00:31:05.519 align:start position:0%
position for or against advancing
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined reporting right I
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
would just um say that uh yes do we need
 
00:31:17.149 --> 00:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
to take a position saying that or or is
 
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
this is the charge of the commission
 
00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
more to analyze and provide uh
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
options um with
 
00:31:26.159 --> 00:31:27.750 align:start position:0%
options um with
a

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:29.919 align:start position:0%
determination as to what
 
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
the balances not recommend worldwide not
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
oppose worldwide but just say this is
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen if you do this
 
00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
and we don't know what's going to happen
 
00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
if you do
 
00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
that okay that's an excellent question
 
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
and I think that
 
00:31:50.269 --> 00:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
um the answer is that that is certainly
 
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
an option and I think we'll be in a
 
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
position to decide whether that's the
 
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
path we want to take next Monday um
 
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
here's here's my thoughts on uh
 
00:32:03.389 --> 00:32:03.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
question it depends what we believe
 
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
right our charge is to weighs weigh the
 
00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
advantages and the
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
disadvantages but there will be a
 
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
Minority Report that is clearly
 
00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
advocating that the New Hampshire
 
00:32:25.029 --> 00:32:25.039 align:start position:0%
legislature adopt worldwide combined
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
reporting so the question for the six of
 
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
us is do we agree with that or do we
 
00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
disagree with that if we disagree with
 
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
it then our
 
00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
recommendation I think is likely to come
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
down with a firm statement that we think
 
00:32:44.269 --> 00:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
it is not advisable to go forward what
 
00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
what this commission has not been
 
00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
charged to do has not taken testimony to
 
00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
do and is not prepared to do is to
 
00:32:56.269 --> 00:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
recommend some alternative so we're not
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
going to end up up with a report that
 
00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799 align:start position:0%
says instead of worldwide combined
 
00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:05.000 align:start position:0%
reporting let's you know I don't adopt
 
00:33:06.909 --> 00:33:06.919 align:start position:0%
pillar one and pillar two is proposed by
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
the oecd or what have you all right
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
we're either going to
 
00:33:14.909 --> 00:33:14.919 align:start position:0%
say yes we recommend going forward with
 
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
Worldwide combined reporting or no we
 
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
don't so I think the
 
00:33:21.789 --> 00:33:21.799 align:start position:0%
recommendation has to take a
 
00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
position at the
 
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
least whether it is appropriate at this
 
00:33:29.669 --> 00:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
time for the New Hampshire legislature
 
00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
to move ahead or
 
00:33:35.629 --> 00:33:35.639 align:start position:0%
not um I would also I this is a good
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
moment to um ask Mr
 
00:33:42.269 --> 00:33:42.279 align:start position:0%
Wong um we were having a sidebar
 
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
conversation before the meeting
 
00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.629 align:start position:0%
conversation before the meeting
[Music]

00:33:45.629 --> 00:33:45.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:33:45.639 --> 00:33:47.350 align:start position:0%
[Music]
began

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
began
 
00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:49.190 align:start position:0%
began
um

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
and you have to ask yourself even if
 
00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:56.120 align:start position:0%
even if the commission recommended in
 
00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:57.509 align:start position:0%
even if the commission recommended in
favor

00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
favor
 
00:33:59.470 --> 00:33:59.480 align:start position:0%
of implementing worldwide combined
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
reporting do we have a vehicle yet that
 
00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
would implement it adequately so for
 
00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:06.830 align:start position:0%
would implement it adequately so for
example

00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:09.560 align:start position:0%
hb21 will come before the Ways and Means
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
Committee within the next two three
 
00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919 align:start position:0%
weeks um and will be decided it's going
 
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
to be decided either uh OTP itl or
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
interim study so you would have to ask
 
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
yourself not just whether you think
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
worldwide combined report in is a good
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
move and appropriate but also whether
 
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
hp21 is
 
00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:36.919 align:start position:0%
drafted actually does what's necessary
 
00:34:39.629 --> 00:34:39.639 align:start position:0%
and Mr Juan could you just elaborate on
 
00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:41.560 align:start position:0%
what you think such a bill would have to
 
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
include in order to prepare the Dr for
 
00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
implementation right so um so just to re
 
00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
reiterate the dr's position we are
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
neutral on whether um the state takes up
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
legislation to go proceed with uh forde
 
00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
combine reporting or to uh remain as a
 
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
water AG um filing position uh however
 
00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
it it plays out the Dr would continue to
 
00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:11.800 align:start position:0%
uh try to implement the tax uh New
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's tax laws uh in terms of uh
 
00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
if there is a motion to move ahead with
 
00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
Worldwide combining filing reporting as
 
00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
it is current laws are written or
 
00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
designed for waterers Edge for fing and
 
00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
uh we definitely would need I think we
 
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
definitely would need additional
 
00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
guidance or new legislation in terms of
 
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh redrafting certain parts of uh uh the
 
00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
BPT statute to incorporate worldwide
 
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
filing um because right now all most of
 
00:35:49.069 --> 00:35:49.079 align:start position:0%
the most if not all definitions is
 
00:35:52.390 --> 00:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
related to worldwide uh sorry to uh
 
00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:54.200 align:start position:0%
waterers Edge and then that's the
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
taxation of uh foreign dividends and um
 
00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
um that kind of thing so all that
 
00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:01.079 align:start position:0%
probably will have to be changed um and
 
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
and be considered how best to
 
00:36:08.109 --> 00:36:08.119 align:start position:0%
um to to um I guess redraft it just to
 
00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
to re-engineer for worldwide combined
 
00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.829 align:start position:0%
to re-engineer for worldwide combined
filing

00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:12.839 align:start position:0%
filing
 
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
purposes so how to define a unitary
 
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
group for example exactly one of those
 
00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:19.240 align:start position:0%
things would be uh the definition of
 
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
unitary and undoubtedly others and I
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
would just uh comment that if one looks
 
00:36:27.309 --> 00:36:27.319 align:start position:0%
at um
 
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
hb21 thought I had it there in front of
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
me uh it it's probably 80% preperatory
 
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
language statements of purpose and uh
 
00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:42.200 align:start position:0%
intent uh a rationale for why it would
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
be you know a good a good bill when you
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
get to the guts of the implementing uh
 
00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
portion of the bill it's then a series
 
00:36:55.829 --> 00:36:55.839 align:start position:0%
of repeals and then it's one very brief
 
00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
statement that BAS basically says go
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
Implement worldwide combined reporting
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
so what what Mr Wong is saying is even
 
00:37:05.309 --> 00:37:05.319 align:start position:0%
if you were in favor of that
 
00:37:07.990 --> 00:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
bill you would want it elaborated so
 
00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
that the legislature gives guidance
 
00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:13.240 align:start position:0%
right prior to rul making Authority yes
 
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
um to implement the flush it out yeah
 
00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
okay important point so representative
 
00:37:23.069 --> 00:37:23.079 align:start position:0%
Olie did we uh come to a balanced
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
conclusion on your
 
00:37:25.599 --> 00:37:28.069 align:start position:0%
conclusion on your
question

00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:37:33.069 --> 00:37:33.079 align:start position:0%
proba okay and you know hey if if we uh
 
00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
find ourselves in a very ambiguous place
 
00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
then the the recommendation might
 
00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%
Express something that's ambiguous if we
 
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
find that we're pretty much in unison
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
and that we believe it is not a good
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
idea for the state to proceed then I
 
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
okay um Miss Mr Foley and Mr Kennedy um
 
00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
can you walk us through I've just had a
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
chance to read this I'm very impressed I
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
I like the structure and the
 
00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:08.109 align:start position:0%
I like the structure and the
approach

00:38:08.109 --> 00:38:08.119 align:start position:0%
approach
 
00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:11.480 align:start position:0%
um but why don't I turn it over to you
 
00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:12.589 align:start position:0%
um but why don't I turn it over to you
and

00:38:12.589 --> 00:38:12.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:21.069 --> 00:38:21.079 align:start position:0%
discussion Matt I've got him right here
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:29.069 align:start position:0%
 
off

00:38:29.069 --> 00:38:29.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
yes Mr Kennedy thank you uh Mr
 
00:38:36.829 --> 00:38:36.839 align:start position:0%
chairman in terms of the comments you
 
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
just made about what it is we're coming
 
00:38:43.309 --> 00:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
back with um I brought up the um house
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
bill I think it was 102 from 22 which
 
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
established this commission um just to
 
00:38:50.829 --> 00:38:50.839 align:start position:0%
see was there actually what the
 
00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
requirements were I don't know if you
 
00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
had that with you um and it it seems to
 
00:38:59.829 --> 00:38:59.839 align:start position:0%
me that that the guidance is is pretty
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
ambiguous meaning that it just for
 
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
clarity it seems to me it just says we
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
just have to report our findings back it
 
00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily say we make
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
recommendations um it doesn't
 
00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily say you know we issue this
 
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:16.280 align:start position:0%
type of report or that type of report so
 
00:39:18.829 --> 00:39:18.839 align:start position:0%
I just want to be clear that relative to
 
00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
what we're actually required to do under
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
this bill or law um is simply to report
 
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
back and the form of that report or the
 
00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
content um um presumably is is is not
 
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
concrete or set as to what what its
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
content needs to be would you agree I
 
00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
think that's absolutely correct and to
 
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
be more
 
00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
specific uh
 
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
12 colon 2 Roman numeral 3 says we shall
 
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
study the advantages and disadvantages
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
for the state economy and revenues of
 
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:54.839 align:start position:0%
replacement of the current Waters Edge
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
method by the worldwide combined report
 
00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
warning method M satisfied that we've
 
00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
done that and Roman umal
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
5 uh says a final report of its findings
 
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
and any recommendations for proposed
 
00:40:13.069 --> 00:40:13.079 align:start position:0%
legislation honor before November 1st so
 
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
you're correct uh it's at the discretion
 
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
commission it would make a difference if
 
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
we found that we uh you know had six
 
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
voices uh in unison and only one
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:32.589 --> 00:40:32.599 align:start position:0%
view or
 
00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.079 align:start position:0%
here um versus whether you know we may
 
00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
have several people who feel firmly that
 
00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:41.960 align:start position:0%
uh that there should be a recommendation
 
00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
against and several who are in a more
 
00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
neutral or nuanced position we can
 
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
articulate that if that's the case I
 
00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
think recommendations can include some
 
00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:53.960 align:start position:0%
indication of how strong the support was
 
00:40:55.589 --> 00:40:55.599 align:start position:0%
so I think we'll we'll have a feel for
 
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
that next Monday but not probably today
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um relative to
 
00:41:03.630 --> 00:41:03.640 align:start position:0%
recommendations um and again I think
 
00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:06.079 align:start position:0%
this is more as we move through this
 
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
week um potentially there is additional
 
00:41:12.270 --> 00:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
studies that could be done down the road
 
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:14.000 align:start position:0%
once information is made available to
 
00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
the Dr assuming the Dr is given
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
direction to study things like
 
00:41:20.030 --> 00:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
International reporting and the guilty
 
00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:21.800 align:start position:0%
and things like that would that be
 
00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
something we would want to recommend or
 
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
entertain or include in the report or is
 
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
that just kind of beyond the scope of of
 
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
what this committee is out to do well
 
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
we're all freethinkers and I and I would
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
encourage freethinking so please by all
 
00:41:41.069 --> 00:41:41.079 align:start position:0%
means as you think about this earlier in
 
00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
the week is
 
00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
better any proposed recommendations that
 
00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:49.640 align:start position:0%
any individual member wants to uh lob
 
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
over the side I would be very
 
00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
welcomed um and I I think that the idea
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
that a recommendation
 
00:42:00.109 --> 00:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
about future study or about an
 
00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
alternative or about something other
 
00:42:06.069 --> 00:42:06.079 align:start position:0%
than just yes or no uh could be very
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
helpful so if you could fashion a draft
 
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh along line as you're
 
00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:17.720 align:start position:0%
thinking um that would be great thank
 
00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:19.270 align:start position:0%
thinking um that would be great thank
you

00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:42:25.150 --> 00:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:26.710 align:start position:0%
 
Foy

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
Foy
 
00:42:29.069 --> 00:42:29.079 align:start position:0%
uh sure so just kind of walk through
 
00:42:31.309 --> 00:42:31.319 align:start position:0%
this I assume is the intention chair
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
yeah and just level or yeah what what I
 
00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:38.200 align:start position:0%
was thinking is you've done a great
 
00:42:41.829 --> 00:42:41.839 align:start position:0%
job of breaking this into four into into
 
00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
segments generally accepted
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
considerations where there is a
 
00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
consensus another section potential
 
00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:53.270 align:start position:0%
consensus another section potential
mitigating

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
mitigating
 
00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.829 align:start position:0%
mitigating
factors

00:42:54.829 --> 00:42:54.839 align:start position:0%
factors
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
excellent and then further items in
 
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.240 align:start position:0%
support and against the pros and the
 
00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
cons which you've
 
00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:06.760 align:start position:0%
separated what I think you might do
 
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:09.480 align:start position:0%
is take us one by one through the
 
00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:11.030 align:start position:0%
is take us one by one through the
numbered

00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
numbered
 
00:43:13.589 --> 00:43:13.599 align:start position:0%
statement without the narrative that
 
00:43:16.030 --> 00:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
follows it and let's just stop and pause
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
on each one of them and make sure we
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
agree absolutely yeah and so this is
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
just an expansion of the bullet point
 
00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:25.240 align:start position:0%
list that we went through when was our
 
00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
last meeting two weeks ago
 
00:43:30.549 --> 00:43:30.559 align:start position:0%
everyday's blending last week GH Yeah
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
Tuesday that's right yeah and thank you
 
00:43:34.349 --> 00:43:34.359 align:start position:0%
very much for we had a tax deadline I
 
00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:36.720 align:start position:0%
I'm feeling it now uh thank you for
 
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
developing it into a narrative yes yes
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
and so um so these should be familiar um
 
00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
there is obviously more color so
 
00:43:46.109 --> 00:43:46.119 align:start position:0%
generally accepted considerations the
 
00:43:49.270 --> 00:43:49.280 align:start position:0%
first one um constitutionally moving to
 
00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
worldwide reporting should be allowed
 
00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:54.680 align:start position:0%
okay we can just stop there
 
00:43:56.589 --> 00:43:56.599 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:43:56.599 --> 00:43:57.910 align:start position:0%
um the
the

00:43:57.910 --> 00:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
only passage that I've drafted already
 
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
in the findings is one specifically that
 
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
reviews the Constitutional and I would
 
00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
simply suggest that we take what I've
 
00:44:12.069 --> 00:44:12.079 align:start position:0%
drafted and plug it right in there as
 
00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
statement and I would make one other
 
00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.510 align:start position:0%
statement and I would make one other
suggestion

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
00:44:24.630 --> 00:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
um constitutionally moving to worldwide
 
00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
reporting should be allowed I just want
 
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
to change the phrasing so that that
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound should be allowed sounds
 
00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
like an endorsement what I think I'd
 
00:44:35.790 --> 00:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
like to say
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
is um moving to worldwide
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.960 --> 00:45:03.910 align:start position:0%
 
barriers

00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
does that make sense absolutely so we're
 
00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:09.640 align:start position:0%
just simply saying there's nothing that
 
00:45:15.589 --> 00:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:19.640 align:start position:0%
level all right right um the second
 
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
generally accepted consideration
 
00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:25.240 align:start position:0%
transfer pricing exists um it's a very
 
00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:29.240 align:start position:0%
simple overview of transfer pricing here
 
00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
um so hopefully that provides some
 
00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
context without going into hundreds of
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
pages of
 
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
explanations I think it's very succinct
 
00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
and well put yeah Jordan actually me
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
representative Valerie yeah uh the first
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
question you just answered the second
 
00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
question I I mentioned earlier to Mr
 
00:45:52.349 --> 00:45:52.359 align:start position:0%
Kennedy um we're using two different
 
00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
terms to discuss the same item and we
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
had need to find either a common
 
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
terminology or or something to describe
 
00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
what what we're talking about you're
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
talking about price transfer it's really
 
00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
not price transfer but although that may
 
00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:13.240 align:start position:0%
be the terminology used um in in the
 
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
jargon if you will within the CPA
 
00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
language where and my friend is going to
 
00:46:24.549 --> 00:46:24.559 align:start position:0%
use transfer wealth or uh profit taking
 
00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
or profit hiding or some other type of
 
00:46:30.589 --> 00:46:30.599 align:start position:0%
language that that uh he uses so I think
 
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
we need to have a common terminology
 
00:46:36.069 --> 00:46:36.079 align:start position:0%
that it's merely the transfer of funds
 
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
from one entity to another for whatever
 
00:46:42.109 --> 00:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
purpose whether it's to hide it from
 
00:46:46.109 --> 00:46:46.119 align:start position:0%
taxation legally uh or whether it's to
 
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
help build something else up I I I I
 
00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
think that distinction needs to be made
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
when we're describing what does take
 
00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:00.040 align:start position:0%
place we not we're not creating the um
 
00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
appearance that this is
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
legal um tax evasion which is you know
 
00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
that's the second American P so we don't
 
00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
want to create a
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
pejorative yes um implication that
 
00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
transfer pricing is somehow inherently
 
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
bad I think transfer pricing is in fact
 
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
a term of art that is used by the tax
 
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
authorities by accountants and
 
00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:27.440 align:start position:0%
universally uh does describe what we're
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
talking about um and Jordan if you see
 
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
other examples again whether you bring
 
00:47:33.549 --> 00:47:33.559 align:start position:0%
them up this morning which would be
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
great or whether you uh um shoot a out
 
00:47:38.069 --> 00:47:38.079 align:start position:0%
in an email it it would
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
be General word smithing for sure and if
 
00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
you have specific uh something that uh
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
um you know gives you reservations
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
please point it out yeah and and what
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
we've tried transfer pricing itself is
 
00:47:55.710 --> 00:47:55.720 align:start position:0%
just a terminology used to describe
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
related party transfers and the pric is
 
00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:01.160 align:start position:0%
you know ascribed there too so that
 
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:04.280 align:start position:0%
whether it's abusive or not is a second
 
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
conversation that is just the accounting
 
00:48:09.309 --> 00:48:09.319 align:start position:0%
process for related party transfers and
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
so I understand what you're saying so
 
00:48:14.109 --> 00:48:14.119 align:start position:0%
what we've try to do here is to the
 
00:48:16.349 --> 00:48:16.359 align:start position:0%
extent that there is seemed to be an
 
00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
abuse we've tried to say abuse right so
 
00:48:22.109 --> 00:48:22.119 align:start position:0%
we've we've put abusive transfer pricing
 
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
and that's the next bullet where it
 
00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
creates an uneven playing field and I
 
00:48:27.750 --> 00:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
would just recommend transfer pricing
 
00:48:30.349 --> 00:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
itself is the terminology and
 
00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:33.160 align:start position:0%
phraseology used globally you know for
 
00:48:36.109 --> 00:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
related party transfers um and
 
00:48:38.750 --> 00:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
transactions from there where we we find
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
bad parties right you know maybe taking
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
legal or unlegal abusive positions I
 
00:48:45.069 --> 00:48:45.079 align:start position:0%
think we should just classify as such as
 
00:48:47.589 --> 00:48:47.599 align:start position:0%
that's the risk so this is this is a
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
very good discussion it illustrates the
 
00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
value of having uh qualified CPAs on the
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
commission and uh taking a lead in
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
drafting this portion there is a
 
00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
the testimony
 
00:49:06.510 --> 00:49:06.520 align:start position:0%
records where I'm attempting to recount
 
00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:09.640 align:start position:0%
what individual presenters
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
said and in many cases they may have
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
said something in fact intending you
 
00:49:17.910 --> 00:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
know that it's
 
00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
pejorative um but I think in this
 
00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
section of the
 
00:49:26.349 --> 00:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
report uh the fact that we're grounded
 
00:49:29.789 --> 00:49:29.799 align:start position:0%
in neutral terminology and uh the
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
experience of accountants who practice
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
in the area is valuable this should be a
 
00:49:34.079 --> 00:49:36.150 align:start position:0%
in the area is valuable this should be a
neutral

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
neutral
 
00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
section yes Mr Kennedy um if I may
 
00:49:44.349 --> 00:49:44.359 align:start position:0%
because Mr shar's not here I think we're
 
00:49:46.349 --> 00:49:46.359 align:start position:0%
we referring to transfer pricing and
 
00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:49.720 align:start position:0%
then abusive transfer pricing um and of
 
00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
course the abusive transfer pricing is
 
00:49:54.069 --> 00:49:54.079 align:start position:0%
just something that the US government or
 
00:49:57.309 --> 00:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
some government agency would take uh
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
issue with in terms of transfer pricing
 
00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
we're talking about items that are
 
00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:03.880 align:start position:0%
acceptable or allowable under the law
 
00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:07.720 align:start position:0%
and the taxing rules however um what
 
00:50:10.349 --> 00:50:10.359 align:start position:0%
worldwide reporting would do would
 
00:50:12.950 --> 00:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
address more the transfer pricing versus
 
00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
the abusive transfer pricing which is to
 
00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:18.079 align:start position:0%
say that even though it's allowed and
 
00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
legal and um uh provided for under the
 
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh code and the
 
00:50:26.710 --> 00:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
regulations that the transfer pricing
 
00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:30.200 align:start position:0%
still has a mechanism with which
 
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
rightfully so funds are transferred to a
 
00:50:34.789 --> 00:50:34.799 align:start position:0%
lower taxing jurisdiction because of the
 
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
use of of patents or trademarks or what
 
00:50:40.309 --> 00:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
have you and that the worldwide
 
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:43.720 align:start position:0%
reporting would essentially remove that
 
00:50:46.510 --> 00:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
function of allowable transfer pricing
 
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm just trying to make sure that it
 
00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:51.160 align:start position:0%
there's a distinction that um this
 
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
worldwide reporting is not really
 
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
looking to um look at abusive transfer
 
00:50:58.589 --> 00:50:58.599 align:start position:0%
pricing but to look at transfer pricing
 
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
entire it effectively neutralizes any
 
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
intra affiliate transfer by pooling them
 
00:51:08.829 --> 00:51:08.839 align:start position:0%
um that's a valuable explanation you
 
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
might want to jot that down and
 
00:51:14.549 --> 00:51:14.559 align:start position:0%
incorporate it can I get a recording of
 
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
today's meeting and I'll just we are
 
00:51:19.109 --> 00:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
recorded again so the answer is yes on
 
00:51:22.150 --> 00:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
the YouTube um by the way for anybody
 
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
who's not familiar with it because we're
 
00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:26.680 align:start position:0%
not all legislators but if you go to the
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh open page of the general Court's
 
00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:32.599 align:start position:0%
website and you scroll all the way to
 
00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
the bottom in the band at the bottom
 
00:51:38.069 --> 00:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
you'll see house streaming Senate
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
streaming if you click on house
 
00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
streaming it brings up the YouTube
 
00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
channel for the general
 
00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
court and um that can sometimes be a
 
00:51:52.990 --> 00:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
little obscure I find but you have to go
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
up to the top menu and hit at home to
 
00:51:59.470 --> 00:51:59.480 align:start position:0%
get the most recent hearings and this
 
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
will be viewable as soon as this
 
00:52:06.430 --> 00:52:06.440 align:start position:0%
evening um I I I would say further you
 
00:52:10.349 --> 00:52:10.359 align:start position:0%
know profit shifting right now now we're
 
00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
moving into another term which is
 
00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:13.880 align:start position:0%
suggesting a
 
00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:19.079 align:start position:0%
motive for the transfer
 
00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:21.640 align:start position:0%
pricing and you know I think that
 
00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
there's actually another Nugget In what
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
you were just saying and that is that
 
00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
The Proposal of worldwide combined
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
reporting is arguably over
 
00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
broad relative to its Target which is
 
00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
abusive practices and interestingly
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
that's what the whole arms length
 
00:52:42.349 --> 00:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
guidelines and regulations in the
 
00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:44.839 align:start position:0%
separate accounting is all about it's
 
00:52:48.589 --> 00:52:48.599 align:start position:0%
about zeroing in on
 
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
unjustifiable transfer pricing so it is
 
00:52:53.470 --> 00:52:53.480 align:start position:0%
a weakness in the worldwide combined
 
00:52:58.270 --> 00:52:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
Brad okay back to Mr
 
00:53:06.349 --> 00:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
Foley oh representative thank you yeah
 
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
that brings up two points i' really do
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
like your the last phraseology that with
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
that and discussion and explanation uh
 
00:53:18.789 --> 00:53:18.799 align:start position:0%
that was that was concise um I just
 
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
remind remind the people that are going
 
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
to use
 
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
this some of them have little to know
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
economic knowledge I mean as far as
 
00:53:33.069 --> 00:53:33.079 align:start position:0%
having taken any uh serious economic
 
00:53:36.670 --> 00:53:36.680 align:start position:0%
courses um they do have e economic
 
00:53:38.910 --> 00:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
Knowledge from whatever background they
 
00:53:42.750 --> 00:53:42.760 align:start position:0%
are but the except from Dr homy uh who's
 
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
got quite a bit of it but
 
00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:51.400 align:start position:0%
um when we talk about one phrase and uh
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chair just uh Terry you just brought
 
00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:56.559 align:start position:0%
it out uh there's a diff there's three
 
00:53:58.589 --> 00:53:58.599 align:start position:0%
differences there one is profit taking
 
00:54:02.549 --> 00:54:02.559 align:start position:0%
one is abusive uh uh transfer pricing
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
and one is uh necessary transferred
 
00:54:09.789 --> 00:54:09.799 align:start position:0%
pricing for the uh operation of the U
 
00:54:11.789 --> 00:54:11.799 align:start position:0%
the business I've mentioned this several
 
00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
times during the discussion uh you have
 
00:54:16.270 --> 00:54:16.280 align:start position:0%
a large corporation and it needs extra
 
00:54:18.109 --> 00:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
money over here that's not abusive
 
00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
that's just taking money from where
 
00:54:22.750 --> 00:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
because money is fungible moving it from
 
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
point A to point B I think that needs to
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
be clear in in uh that there are two
 
00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:31.640 align:start position:0%
different types of transfer pricing
 
00:54:36.309 --> 00:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
um and we and on the uh the general side
 
00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
of the discussion rather than using a
 
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
bunch of different language we need to
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
use the same phrase so that we know that
 
00:54:46.589 --> 00:54:46.599 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the same
 
00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:49.880 align:start position:0%
action on both neutral side the
 
00:54:52.309 --> 00:54:52.319 align:start position:0%
legislative side and the opposition side
 
00:54:55.630 --> 00:54:55.640 align:start position:0%
that tell that I think Tom ought to
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh representing shamberg ought to be
 
00:55:01.589 --> 00:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
made aware that that's the the goal is
 
00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:04.280 align:start position:0%
to use the same language
 
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
everywhere uh so that when he's talking
 
00:55:09.549 --> 00:55:09.559 align:start position:0%
about something he he uses the same
 
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
language that we're talking about it so
 
00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
we don't wind up with different words
 
00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
saying the same
 
00:55:17.910 --> 00:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
thing I'm okay these are very valid
 
00:55:20.670 --> 00:55:20.680 align:start position:0%
points I think to um see what you are
 
00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
saying through into the draft will
 
00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
require some
 
00:55:28.789 --> 00:55:28.799 align:start position:0%
specific at its suggestions um I think
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
we're all mindful of this but by all
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
means if you catch some of these things
 
00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
that uh you think
 
00:55:42.190 --> 00:55:42.200 align:start position:0%
are it's a valuable comment um one of
 
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
the things that I want to be mindful of
 
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
is that representative shamberg has made
 
00:55:48.430 --> 00:55:48.440 align:start position:0%
it clear he is going to file a Minority
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
Report recommending worldwide combined
 
00:55:52.789 --> 00:55:52.799 align:start position:0%
reporting I've read his
 
00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:55.720 align:start position:0%
draft and I don't want to Tamper with it
 
00:55:58.670 --> 00:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
I think it's his expression of what he
 
00:56:02.589 --> 00:56:02.599 align:start position:0%
believes um the fact is it's very
 
00:56:05.109 --> 00:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
passionate and there are things that he
 
00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:08.200 align:start position:0%
says that I don't personally believe can
 
00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
be backed up or maybe are a bit
 
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
overstated or a bit argumentative or a
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
bit shrill but I don't know that I want
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
to um we could suggest to him how he
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:30.109 align:start position:0%
 
document

00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:33.750 --> 00:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
okay and and so the the third one uh
 
00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
third bullet here and I I do think it's
 
00:56:38.589 --> 00:56:38.599 align:start position:0%
attempting to address your concerns
 
00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:41.240 align:start position:0%
um representative rry is transfer
 
00:56:43.549 --> 00:56:43.559 align:start position:0%
pricing exists and maybe we can
 
00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
emphasize the point that it's a
 
00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
necessary business multinational it's a
 
00:56:50.589 --> 00:56:50.599 align:start position:0%
requirement it's not it's not good bad
 
00:56:52.589 --> 00:56:52.599 align:start position:0%
or indifferent it's a requirement in an
 
00:56:54.589 --> 00:56:54.599 align:start position:0%
integrated vertical business so there's
 
00:56:57.309 --> 00:56:57.319 align:start position:0%
no choice you know an analogy occurred
 
00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:00.280 align:start position:0%
to me during this past week and that is
 
00:57:03.549 --> 00:57:03.559 align:start position:0%
franchises correct so a franchise is
 
00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
very much of an arms length relationship
 
00:57:07.789 --> 00:57:07.799 align:start position:0%
you have a corporate parent and you have
 
00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
a FR franchisee who has uh uh qualified
 
00:57:13.829 --> 00:57:13.839 align:start position:0%
and made an investment and entered into
 
00:57:18.349 --> 00:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
a contractual relationship if I own 14
 
00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
Subways and I'm dealing with the parent
 
00:57:24.069 --> 00:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
Corporation there will be a whole set of
 
00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
understandings about how much I have to
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
contribute for marketing how much I have
 
00:57:30.510 --> 00:57:30.520 align:start position:0%
to contribute for brand recognition how
 
00:57:33.309 --> 00:57:33.319 align:start position:0%
much I have to contribute for all kinds
 
00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
of things this these are
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
examples of how you wouldn't necessarily
 
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
call that an affiliate but in a
 
00:57:44.750 --> 00:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
franchise arms length relationship you
 
00:57:47.029 --> 00:57:47.039 align:start position:0%
have the very same kinds of transfers
 
00:57:50.589 --> 00:57:50.599 align:start position:0%
it's just customary business practice to
 
00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:54.520 align:start position:0%
share Investments made on behalf of your
 
00:57:58.349 --> 00:57:58.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
partners and so that that is the the
 
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
second bullet just kind of acknowledging
 
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
it exists and again maybe we can
 
00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
emphasize that it's a requirement it's a
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
need it's not an option and and the
 
00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
third one is to acknowledge the fact
 
00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:13.960 align:start position:0%
that there is um you know we say
 
00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
perceived because you know who are we to
 
00:58:19.510 --> 00:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
you know full full-heartedly upon um
 
00:58:21.069 --> 00:58:21.079 align:start position:0%
abusive transfer
 
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
pricing uh practices out there that
 
00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
result in and um you know truly uh
 
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
trying to uh take advantage of uh kind
 
00:58:33.069 --> 00:58:33.079 align:start position:0%
of misalignments in the tax code right
 
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
it's been the old play where they can
 
00:58:37.829 --> 00:58:37.839 align:start position:0%
you can shift profits to low tax or no
 
00:58:37.839 --> 00:58:38.670 align:start position:0%
you can shift profits to low tax or no
tax

00:58:38.670 --> 00:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:58:42.589 --> 00:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions um and then um also kind
 
00:58:42.599 --> 00:58:43.670 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions um and then um also kind
of

00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
acknowledging uh the efforts to curb
 
00:58:49.069 --> 00:58:49.079 align:start position:0%
that activity all right so that's that's
 
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
what the third part takes address of in
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
in we do also kind of Prelude into into
 
00:58:57.789 --> 00:58:57.799 align:start position:0%
the fourth part which is the state uh
 
00:58:59.950 --> 00:58:59.960 align:start position:0%
and I can pause after this but does tax
 
00:59:03.549 --> 00:59:03.559 align:start position:0%
foreign income um already generated by
 
00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
businesses subject to the business
 
00:59:05.119 --> 00:59:06.270 align:start position:0%
businesses subject to the business
profits

00:59:06.270 --> 00:59:06.280 align:start position:0%
profits
 
00:59:09.270 --> 00:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
tax um these would be multinationals
 
00:59:11.309 --> 00:59:11.319 align:start position:0%
with foreign subsidiary investments in
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
foreign subsidiaries so this is not your
 
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
foreign entity with us subsidiaries just
 
00:59:18.990 --> 00:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
to highlight that fact I know that is a
 
00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
distinction we're going to make in The
 
00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:21.390 align:start position:0%
distinction we're going to make in The
Wider

00:59:21.390 --> 00:59:21.400 align:start position:0%
Wider
 
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
report um but it does talk through kind
 
00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
of the the two instances when foreign
 
00:59:30.109 --> 00:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
Dividends are received um or when these
 
00:59:33.950 --> 00:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
deemed foreign dividend rules um arise
 
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
from a US federal tax perspective and
 
00:59:38.230 --> 00:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
included in the tax
 
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
base all right so that's number four I
 
00:59:42.270 --> 00:59:42.280 align:start position:0%
thought that was excellent and then
 
00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:45.640 align:start position:0%
number five um just you know one of the
 
00:59:48.430 --> 00:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
things we were assigned with here is um
 
00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:50.680 align:start position:0%
the revenue impact of the change that's
 
00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
one of the things we were charged with
 
00:59:55.750 --> 00:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
studying um and as we all no one
 
00:59:58.270 --> 00:59:58.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate it's it's unknown good bad
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
and different um and just kind of
 
01:00:03.029 --> 01:00:03.039 align:start position:0%
highlighted the the three points which
 
01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
are all the points but the three points
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
on making that determination the current
 
01:00:11.109 --> 01:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
tax a foreign income the expansion in
 
01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
the tax base which would be unknown
 
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
unknowable probably and then the impact
 
01:00:17.349 --> 01:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
on the apportionment
 
01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:20.200 align:start position:0%
Factor um which would impact
 
01:00:23.190 --> 01:00:23.200 align:start position:0%
that I think the Dr would fully stand
 
01:00:25.309 --> 01:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
behind that statement that it's
 
01:00:31.109 --> 01:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
estimate that is correct we currently do
 
01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
not collect all the um the worldwide um
 
01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
information to make an estimate of of
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
what it would be if we would be
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
switching to worldwide and I think
 
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
that's probably um consistent with with
 
01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
the other state reports or state studies
 
01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:52.359 align:start position:0%
done by or the studies done by the other
 
01:00:54.910 --> 01:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
states when they're contemplating over I
 
01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:55.910 align:start position:0%
states when they're contemplating over I
combine

01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
combine
 
01:00:58.470 --> 01:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
fing that's an interesting observation I
 
01:01:00.029 --> 01:01:00.039 align:start position:0%
would I would concur with that I hadn't
 
01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:02.920 align:start position:0%
thought about it previously but uh in
 
01:01:05.789 --> 01:01:05.799 align:start position:0%
reading the studies uh and and what I've
 
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
seen of Indiana Minnesota uh Maine and
 
01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island four states that have
 
01:01:13.029 --> 01:01:13.039 align:start position:0%
recently considered this within the last
 
01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
half dozen years they may have had
 
01:01:18.109 --> 01:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
submissions like we have
 
01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
had um making estimates but in none of
 
01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
those reports was there an estimate that
 
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
is cor I think that the state officials
 
01:01:28.270 --> 01:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
behind those reports concluded that they
 
01:01:31.230 --> 01:01:31.240 align:start position:0%
were um that there was no methodology
 
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
and no data that would support an
 
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
estimate right like Thee the I think the
 
01:01:38.670 --> 01:01:38.680 align:start position:0%
latest report was from Maine and um the
 
01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:40.760 align:start position:0%
main Revenue I think they were charged
 
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
with performing a study and they they
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
were according to the report that I read
 
01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
uh they didn't were not able to come up
 
01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
with uh definitive numbers uh for
 
01:01:52.109 --> 01:01:52.119 align:start position:0%
estimation um I think that would be
 
01:01:53.549 --> 01:01:53.559 align:start position:0%
consistent with with New Hampshire as
 
01:01:55.710 --> 01:01:55.720 align:start position:0%
well um um because we just don't have
 
01:01:59.269 --> 01:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
the data to to make that estimation um
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
and then I guess similarly with
 
01:02:06.029 --> 01:02:06.039 align:start position:0%
um I think was was Minnesota that was um
 
01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the tax Foundation
 
01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
report where um you know they actually
 
01:02:15.870 --> 01:02:15.880 align:start position:0%
adopted or modified numbers from the
 
01:02:20.309 --> 01:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
iTab report versus having their own um
 
01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
study I suppose their own analysis or
 
01:02:31.349 --> 01:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:34.069 --> 01:02:34.079 align:start position:0%
you uh we we shift from there I don't
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
know if there was any you know and I
 
01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:37.559 align:start position:0%
know Kevin you went through those were
 
01:02:40.109 --> 01:02:40.119 align:start position:0%
it for generally accepted considerations
 
01:02:42.029 --> 01:02:42.039 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there's a desire to add
 
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
any more um well I think we should all
 
01:02:47.789 --> 01:02:47.799 align:start position:0%
uh think about that as we digest this
 
01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
during the week but I I was very
 
01:02:52.029 --> 01:02:52.039 align:start position:0%
impressed with that choice of five uh
 
01:02:53.789 --> 01:02:53.799 align:start position:0%
elements to hit and I think I'm going to
 
01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:55.480 align:start position:0%
have to be in the weeds again before I
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
can even think whether there's
 
01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:00.680 align:start position:0%
another and and then so for mitigating
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
factors you know the the one thing we
 
01:03:04.349 --> 01:03:04.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to acknowledge well the two
 
01:03:07.309 --> 01:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
things one is is the US federal tax
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
landscape um and how it has um
 
01:03:14.829 --> 01:03:14.839 align:start position:0%
disincentivized to some extent the you
 
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
know potential abusive profit shifting
 
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
just with a lower federal tax rate um a
 
01:03:22.349 --> 01:03:22.359 align:start position:0%
more encompassing anti- deferral
 
01:03:24.430 --> 01:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
provision guilty everyone's favorite I'm
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
sure you guys are talking about it at
 
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
home at this point um and then also the
 
01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:31.160 align:start position:0%
fact that the oecd beeps project which
 
01:03:34.349 --> 01:03:34.359 align:start position:0%
has been going on for 10 years now uh
 
01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
does continue and and again it is
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
targeting abusive transfer pricing
 
01:03:41.349 --> 01:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
schemes amongst other
 
01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
things um and so that that's really the
 
01:03:47.789 --> 01:03:47.799 align:start position:0%
key mitigating factors as you know the
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
focus of this is abusive transfer
 
01:03:53.549 --> 01:03:53.559 align:start position:0%
pricing um and out bounding of profits
 
01:03:56.910 --> 01:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
um those are the ones we identified we
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
thought of going much further on this
 
01:04:01.109 --> 01:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
but we didn't want to overwhelm on
 
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
either do you think that any of the tax
 
01:04:10.789 --> 01:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
developments within the state of New
 
01:04:10.799 --> 01:04:12.269 align:start position:0%
developments within the state of New
Hampshire

01:04:12.269 --> 01:04:12.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:04:15.269 --> 01:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
itself would also constitute mitigating
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
1986 I don't know what you think Kevin I
 
01:04:28.950 --> 01:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
mean single sales would be the that's a
 
01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:31.160 align:start position:0%
local right so it's not going to help
 
01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:33.630 align:start position:0%
local right so it's not going to help
outside

01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:33.640 align:start position:0%
outside
 
01:04:37.349 --> 01:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'd have to think about
 
01:04:41.029 --> 01:04:41.039 align:start position:0%
it as a mitigating Factor it uh lo I
 
01:04:42.589 --> 01:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
mean other than of course and it's
 
01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
referenced later on the um uh taking the
 
01:04:49.589 --> 01:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
guilty income and applying it to New
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxation which isn't really a
 
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
mitigating factor in this report board
 
01:04:56.789 --> 01:04:56.799 align:start position:0%
it's really the fact that it's one of
 
01:05:01.349 --> 01:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
the uh um uh arguments against is that
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire already taxes it so we
 
01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
didn't really put it in so much as a
 
01:05:07.390 --> 01:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
mitigating Factor um other than that I
 
01:05:10.109 --> 01:05:10.119 align:start position:0%
can't think of anything offand I think
 
01:05:12.990 --> 01:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
that distinction makes good sense um you
 
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
are addressing New Hampshire's use of
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
guilty in the context in a different
 
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
context in a different in the context of
 
01:05:21.549 --> 01:05:21.559 align:start position:0%
the fact that we are generating tax
 
01:05:23.269 --> 01:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
revenue right not as so much as a
 
01:05:25.230 --> 01:05:25.240 align:start position:0%
mitigating Factor is that that there's
 
01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
already some taxation of of foreign
 
01:05:30.069 --> 01:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
income by so here what you're basically
 
01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
getting at when you say mitigating
 
01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
measures is mitigating the
 
01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:37.799 align:start position:0%
Temptation or desirability to use
 
01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
transfer pricing in an abusive way yeah
 
01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
mitigating elaborate that SL mitigating
 
01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:45.640 align:start position:0%
transfer pricing in general um not
 
01:05:48.309 --> 01:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily for New Hampshire but but
 
01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
transfer because let let's tease that
 
01:05:53.789 --> 01:05:53.799 align:start position:0%
out right so the so your point here is
 
01:05:58.230 --> 01:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
that this segment is
 
01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
mitigating the Temptation for
 
01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
undesirable behavior on the tax
 
01:06:08.069 --> 01:06:08.079 align:start position:0%
filer whereas there's a different
 
01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
mitigation going on in the other group
 
01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:14.920 align:start position:0%
and that is mitigating the impact on the
 
01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
state of New
 
01:06:20.670 --> 01:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's tax revenue right so for New
 
01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to apply guilty income does
 
01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
probably does not mitigate someone's
 
01:06:31.390 --> 01:06:31.400 align:start position:0%
desire for transfer pricing uh activity
 
01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
however the other items the fact that
 
01:06:36.349 --> 01:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
the corporate rate is lower that these
 
01:06:39.470 --> 01:06:39.480 align:start position:0%
other uh things were put into place to
 
01:06:43.430 --> 01:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
tax foreign income means that companies
 
01:06:46.589 --> 01:06:46.599 align:start position:0%
are no are less
 
01:06:49.549 --> 01:06:49.559 align:start position:0%
um encouraged to do that because there
 
01:06:51.269 --> 01:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
are these other mitigating factors that
 
01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
says well we can bring we've already
 
01:06:54.829 --> 01:06:54.839 align:start position:0%
been taxed on our dividend so we can
 
01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
bring that back into the us because it's
 
01:06:58.910 --> 01:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
already been taxed it's not going to get
 
01:07:01.349 --> 01:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
taxed again they're already taxing us on
 
01:07:03.789 --> 01:07:03.799 align:start position:0%
guilty so we can bring these things in
 
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
and those things though I'm not sure
 
01:07:09.309 --> 01:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
there's any evidence to show this in
 
01:07:13.150 --> 01:07:13.160 align:start position:0%
theory would reduce um the desire for
 
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
companies to have these perceived
 
01:07:19.390 --> 01:07:19.400 align:start position:0%
abusive uh transfer pricing items the
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
fact that New Hampshire has guilty
 
01:07:23.349 --> 01:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
probably doesn't have any sort of
 
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
influence in that regard so it's a it's
 
01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
a valid a very I think a very
 
01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
significant distinction let's just make
 
01:07:32.109 --> 01:07:32.119 align:start position:0%
sure our captions make that
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
distinction so treating them separately
 
01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
why and and then we go into the for and
 
01:07:47.599 --> 01:07:50.029 align:start position:0%
why and and then we go into the for and
against

01:07:50.029 --> 01:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
against
 
01:07:55.230 --> 01:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
um uh discussion and in the four and you
 
01:07:57.430 --> 01:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
know perhaps we should shoot a note to
 
01:07:59.630 --> 01:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
um representative shamberg to just to
 
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
see if he he would have feedback here to
 
01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
expand on it right I think that's only
 
01:08:09.349 --> 01:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
fair and what we should do um is if I
 
01:08:13.309 --> 01:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
understand is his position it is um it
 
01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
would eliminate any perceived Advantage
 
01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
received by multinational businesses due
 
01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
to their transer pricing policies with
 
01:08:21.070 --> 01:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
foreign related parties right so they
 
01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:22.839 align:start position:0%
have the ability the
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
availability to undertake transfer
 
01:08:27.789 --> 01:08:27.799 align:start position:0%
pricing um as I've said before they have
 
01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
a requirement to undertake transfer
 
01:08:32.709 --> 01:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
pricing um however it could be abusive
 
01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
or perceived abusive and as a result
 
01:08:37.309 --> 01:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
that would be mitigated through the
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
proposal so um I will shoot him a note
 
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
later today or tomorrow just to make
 
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
sure that at a minimum he reads that
 
01:08:45.789 --> 01:08:45.799 align:start position:0%
paragraph so that if he would like to
 
01:08:48.510 --> 01:08:48.520 align:start position:0%
bolster it in the neutral or at least
 
01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
provide feedback now I've only seen this
 
01:08:54.189 --> 01:08:54.199 align:start position:0%
uh in paper on arrival but did you say
 
01:08:56.030 --> 01:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
it's already been circulated yeah we
 
01:08:57.789 --> 01:08:57.799 align:start position:0%
sent an I sent an email hopefully it
 
01:08:59.269 --> 01:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
came through this morning this morning
 
01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
good so representative shamberg does
 
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
have it correct and and I would
 
01:09:04.110 --> 01:09:04.120 align:start position:0%
anticipate it's very likely he'll sit
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
and watch the video of this meeting as
 
01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
well well
 
01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
respond um against these were the ones
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
that um we had identified here um again
 
01:09:20.829 --> 01:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
change as needed enhance um States
 
01:09:23.789 --> 01:09:23.799 align:start position:0%
removal of the worldwide combined method
 
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
in 1986 ensured that businesses with a
 
01:09:27.789 --> 01:09:27.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire tax presence were treated
 
01:09:30.430 --> 01:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
equally um this kind of pulls on the
 
01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
thread that you had emphasized um
 
01:09:35.789 --> 01:09:35.799 align:start position:0%
chairman in last week's
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
meeting um I trust your uh Position will
 
01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
expand on that um yes definitely yeah
 
01:09:46.829 --> 01:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a very interesting thing
 
01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:49.640 align:start position:0%
it's this is not effectively The
 
01:09:51.309 --> 01:09:51.319 align:start position:0%
Proposal is not a return to what
 
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
happened in 81 to 886 that
 
01:09:56.189 --> 01:09:56.199 align:start position:0%
by itself doesn't make it either good or
 
01:10:01.229 --> 01:10:01.239 align:start position:0%
bad but in 81 to 86 the uneven
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
enforcement created exactly the kind of
 
01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
e of inequity that for example Mr gar
 
01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
highlighted um and uh the move to W's
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
hedge was an effort to end that kind of
 
01:10:19.229 --> 01:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
discrimination between uh us-based
 
01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
multinationals and foreign-based so it's
 
01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
then interesting to see that
 
01:10:26.910 --> 01:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
even the water's edge in in some
 
01:10:30.669 --> 01:10:30.679 align:start position:0%
people's minds um may be fundamentally
 
01:10:34.750 --> 01:10:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
inequitable we'll yes we'll address that
 
01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
all right um the second one I I think is
 
01:10:43.110 --> 01:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
one that we're all conscious of but New
 
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would be an outlier and that
 
01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
the only true mandatory worldwide is for
 
01:10:50.910 --> 01:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
oil and gas producers in Alaska every
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
other state is elective um
 
01:10:58.510 --> 01:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
um third um potential decrease in
 
01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:00.199 align:start position:0%
foreign direct investment in New
 
01:11:03.149 --> 01:11:03.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire business Community um you know
 
01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
emphasis on potential no one would
 
01:11:08.350 --> 01:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
know uh whether that would occur uh but
 
01:11:09.870 --> 01:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
that has been highlighted and
 
01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
communicated to us
 
01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
um notable increase in administrative
 
01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
and compliance burden on businesses tax
 
01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
practitioners in New Hampshire
 
01:11:21.790 --> 01:11:21.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue um a quick
 
01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
summation of of some of the challenges
 
01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
that those three parties would face on
 
01:11:29.470 --> 01:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
this move
 
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
um and the fifth one uh again
 
01:11:37.229 --> 01:11:37.239 align:start position:0%
re-emphasizing uh the revenue impact
 
01:11:40.629 --> 01:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
good or bad um of a move to worldwide
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:55.229 align:start position:0%
 
state

01:11:55.229 --> 01:11:55.239 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:11:57.950 --> 01:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
okay and and uh I think that's a good
 
01:11:59.950 --> 01:11:59.960 align:start position:0%
succinct list of the five primary
 
01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:01.960 align:start position:0%
reasons as I think about it more during
 
01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
the week I might want to flush a couple
 
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
of those out a little further
 
01:12:08.229 --> 01:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
yes makes
 
01:12:08.239 --> 01:12:10.470 align:start position:0%
yes makes
sense

01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:12:10.480 --> 01:12:13.149 align:start position:0%
sense
okay

01:12:13.149 --> 01:12:13.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:12:15.790 --> 01:12:15.800 align:start position:0%
um I just want to thank you both again I
 
01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
think this is a very very
 
01:12:22.229 --> 01:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
valuable structure and approach for
 
01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
organizing uh the information in a
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
so we
 
01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:43.830 align:start position:0%
so we
have

01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:12:46.189 --> 01:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
mostly a you know it's it's not a
 
01:12:48.189 --> 01:12:48.199 align:start position:0%
finished product but but we have in
 
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
front of us The Narrative of the
 
01:12:54.669 --> 01:12:54.679 align:start position:0%
testimony and The Narrative of the uh
 
01:12:56.470 --> 01:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
generally accepted
 
01:12:59.470 --> 01:12:59.480 align:start position:0%
considerations um the potential
 
01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
mitigating factors the pros and the
 
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
cons how much
 
01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
analysis or explanation do we think this
 
01:13:12.629 --> 01:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
report needs to have before it leaps to
 
01:13:12.639 --> 01:13:21.910 align:start position:0%
report needs to have before it leaps to
a

01:13:21.910 --> 01:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:24.990 --> 01:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation I have a feeling that
 
01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
even for myself in answering my own
 
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
question I practically have to sit at a
 
01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
computer and see what flows off the
 
01:13:34.270 --> 01:13:34.280 align:start position:0%
fingers as I try to make sure that you
 
01:13:37.390 --> 01:13:37.400 align:start position:0%
know we've really
 
01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
addressed everything that we need
 
01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:43.960 align:start position:0%
to so but the answer to my question may
 
01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
also depend on whether you've come down
 
01:13:48.669 --> 01:13:48.679 align:start position:0%
with a firm conclusion or whether you're
 
01:13:50.590 --> 01:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
in a more
 
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
equivocal um stance
 
01:13:58.590 --> 01:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
anybody want to H how much analysis
 
01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
before we just leap to a
 
01:14:04.229 --> 01:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
recommendation or does this pretty much
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:09.149 --> 01:14:09.159 align:start position:0%
out Mr chairman I can speak for myself I
 
01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
mean I'm I'm on a very firm conclusion I
 
01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
know where I stand on the issue and I
 
01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
have to say that I've served on several
 
01:14:16.350 --> 01:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
of these over my years in the
 
01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:19.400 align:start position:0%
legislature this has been the most
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
thoroughly um uh talked about hammered
 
01:14:27.790 --> 01:14:27.800 align:start position:0%
out batted around proposal I've ever or
 
01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
consideration I've ever T had had a
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
privilege to sit upon you've done a very
 
01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
thorough job of looking at the issue um
 
01:14:37.750 --> 01:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
but I I know where I stand and I I think
 
01:14:40.270 --> 01:14:40.280 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:41.910 align:start position:0%
we have a
consensus

01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
consensus
 
01:14:45.550 --> 01:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:50.669 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:14:50.669 --> 01:14:50.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:53.310 --> 01:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
others I I think the the answer that
 
01:14:55.149 --> 01:14:55.159 align:start position:0%
that question is just it depends on if
 
01:14:58.790 --> 01:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
if if you're stepping in as a an outside
 
01:15:03.189 --> 01:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
reader and would all the content of the
 
01:15:03.199 --> 01:15:03.870 align:start position:0%
reader and would all the content of the
uh

01:15:03.870 --> 01:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
report um support the the
 
01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:09.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations that's being laid out
 
01:15:12.149 --> 01:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
and if the answer is yes then I don't
 
01:15:13.470 --> 01:15:13.480 align:start position:0%
think there's any any need for any
 
01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:16.760 align:start position:0%
additional analysis or any uh to be
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
Implement to be incorporated into the
 
01:15:22.189 --> 01:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
report uh but if if you think that once
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
you're reading it um
 
01:15:27.629 --> 01:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
as an outside reader they say okay yeah
 
01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
somehow the uh the findings or the uh
 
01:15:34.189 --> 01:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
the presentations of of the context
 
01:15:36.510 --> 01:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
somehow this doesn't connect with the
 
01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:38.840 align:start position:0%
recommendation then maybe some some
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
links some bridges might need to be
 
01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
built in that sense um I I mean it's
 
01:15:47.229 --> 01:15:47.239 align:start position:0%
probably a bit challenging for us
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
because we've been in this commission um
 
01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
and so we've seen it um all
 
01:15:58.189 --> 01:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
internally um I I would think it I think
 
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
it's we have enough I do think so but um
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
I I think if maybe a neutral party if
 
01:16:06.750 --> 01:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
they would read it I'm not sure they
 
01:16:08.669 --> 01:16:08.679 align:start position:0%
might also have the same conclusion but
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
it's just something that I'm I'm
 
01:16:11.669 --> 01:16:11.679 align:start position:0%
bringing up to to to your attention
 
01:16:11.679 --> 01:16:12.590 align:start position:0%
bringing up to to to your attention
that's

01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
all okay thank you and uh staying
 
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:24.149 --> 01:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
challenging any other thought
 
01:16:24.159 --> 01:16:25.510 align:start position:0%
challenging any other thought
Mr

01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
Kennedy so
 
01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
um I think again largely staying neutral
 
01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
and neutral being that conceptually I
 
01:16:39.189 --> 01:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
understand the idea of the transfer
 
01:16:42.270 --> 01:16:42.280 align:start position:0%
pricing issue and Mr Schamberg's um
 
01:16:45.790 --> 01:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
position that there is this perceived
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
idea of an unlevel playing field and I
 
01:16:53.629 --> 01:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody really wants to
 
01:16:55.149 --> 01:16:55.159 align:start position:0%
would want to leave thinking yes we've
 
01:16:56.629 --> 01:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
agreed there's an unlevel playing field
 
01:16:58.149 --> 01:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
but we're going to leave it as it is
 
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
anyway I think that the information
 
01:17:04.709 --> 01:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
provided simply um is insufficient to
 
01:17:07.430 --> 01:17:07.440 align:start position:0%
determine that that actually exists and
 
01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
because of that comp
 
01:17:12.990 --> 01:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
um going
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
along with that and considering the
 
01:17:20.229 --> 01:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
complications to move to an alternative
 
01:17:22.830 --> 01:17:22.840 align:start position:0%
method to move to worldwide reporting
 
01:17:25.990 --> 01:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
that that um there's there just isn't
 
01:17:29.189 --> 01:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
enough available to us relative to
 
01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:31.679 align:start position:0%
making a change of this
 
01:17:34.390 --> 01:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
magnitude and
 
01:17:38.669 --> 01:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
that if the desire is to potentially
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
move to worldwide reporting and to level
 
01:17:42.629 --> 01:17:42.639 align:start position:0%
the playing field because it's perceived
 
01:17:45.030 --> 01:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
that it exists that steps would need to
 
01:17:47.629 --> 01:17:47.639 align:start position:0%
be taken in order to better
 
01:17:51.070 --> 01:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
quantify well what is the unle does a
 
01:17:53.110 --> 01:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
unlevel playing field exist and I don't
 
01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
think that that information is available
 
01:17:58.830 --> 01:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
and I think the Dr or something would
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
need to be done to collect information
 
01:18:02.669 --> 01:18:02.679 align:start position:0%
to determine well how do we quantify
 
01:18:04.629 --> 01:18:04.639 align:start position:0%
that U which would certainly be I
 
01:18:06.550 --> 01:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
imagine a significant burden on the on
 
01:18:10.270 --> 01:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
the Dr as well but I think without um
 
01:18:12.390 --> 01:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
enough information the the burden of
 
01:18:17.229 --> 01:18:17.239 align:start position:0%
moving to a change um it just isn't
 
01:18:20.550 --> 01:18:20.560 align:start position:0%
supported I I agree with you um and you
 
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
don't have to become an advocate for a
 
01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:24.550 align:start position:0%
don't have to become an advocate for a
different

01:18:24.550 --> 01:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:18:27.310 --> 01:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
alternative to get to the point of
 
01:18:30.110 --> 01:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
concluding that this particular approach
 
01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
is not a good idea un unwise on balance
 
01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:35.910 align:start position:0%
is not a good idea un unwise on balance
you

01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:18:39.390 --> 01:18:39.400 align:start position:0%
know um Mr Foley want to add
 
01:18:43.390 --> 01:18:43.400 align:start position:0%
anything um not not a ton I I think your
 
01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
question is how expansive does the
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
report have to be at its core and um I
 
01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
guess having not read many of these in
 
01:18:53.149 --> 01:18:53.159 align:start position:0%
my life we've had a 90 pager that's been
 
01:18:56.189 --> 01:18:56.199 align:start position:0%
provided to us in a seven pager I think
 
01:18:58.669 --> 01:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
right and kind of I know which one I
 
01:19:02.110 --> 01:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
opted for um and so I I you know I
 
01:19:04.750 --> 01:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
somewhat defer to you as as primary
 
01:19:07.470 --> 01:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
drafter of this on what level of context
 
01:19:09.669 --> 01:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
it's all there how much color do you
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
want to provide to help someone get to
 
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
it is really uh the question I think the
 
01:19:18.189 --> 01:19:18.199 align:start position:0%
core stuff we've framed uh there is an
 
01:19:21.669 --> 01:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
impassioned Minority Report um that does
 
01:19:24.189 --> 01:19:24.199 align:start position:0%
have to be IGN knowledged in some sense
 
01:19:27.510 --> 01:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
right so um but yeah I don't I don't
 
01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
know beyond that okay that's uh very
 
01:19:36.350 --> 01:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
good as I said I I don't suggest in any
 
01:19:39.310 --> 01:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
way that we tamper with or put pressure
 
01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:41.320 align:start position:0%
on The Minority
 
01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:43.709 align:start position:0%
on The Minority
Report

01:19:43.709 --> 01:19:43.719 align:start position:0%
Report
 
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
um I'll have another comment about that
 
01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
in a moment uh representative ly is
 
01:19:50.189 --> 01:19:50.199 align:start position:0%
there anything that you want to add
 
01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
no no and keeping the minority report
 
01:19:56.470 --> 01:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
them um that that is the sole arthor
 
01:19:59.070 --> 01:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
authorship of Representative shamberg is
 
01:20:02.270 --> 01:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
a good idea he does have strongly held
 
01:20:04.510 --> 01:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
and I can understand where they're
 
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
coming from I disagree with them but I
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
understand where they're coming from and
 
01:20:10.990 --> 01:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
what he's attempting to do I just don't
 
01:20:13.870 --> 01:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
think this is the vehicle to do it okay
 
01:20:18.189 --> 01:20:18.199 align:start position:0%
very fair um so with that in
 
01:20:22.189 --> 01:20:22.199 align:start position:0%
mind because we do have an articulated
 
01:20:22.199 --> 01:20:23.950 align:start position:0%
mind because we do have an articulated
passionate

01:20:23.950 --> 01:20:23.960 align:start position:0%
passionate
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
um Minority Report there's at least a
 
01:20:29.550 --> 01:20:29.560 align:start position:0%
temptation to want to have a
 
01:20:32.709 --> 01:20:32.719 align:start position:0%
full-throated rebuttal I think we should
 
01:20:34.189 --> 01:20:34.199 align:start position:0%
resist that
 
01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
temptation but what I'm thinking is this
 
01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
um I think that uh the final
 
01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation should be very succinctly
 
01:20:49.870 --> 01:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
stated so I'm going to draft a brief
 
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
interlude that I'll call majority analys
 
01:20:56.470 --> 01:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
is just to
 
01:20:59.350 --> 01:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
summarize um what the key points are
 
01:21:02.950 --> 01:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
driving us to disagree that worldwide
 
01:21:04.910 --> 01:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
combined reporting should be implemented
 
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
by the state of New Hampshire at this
 
01:21:10.709 --> 01:21:10.719 align:start position:0%
time that might include there's
 
01:21:13.629 --> 01:21:13.639 align:start position:0%
insufficient evidence it's too radical a
 
01:21:17.229 --> 01:21:17.239 align:start position:0%
change it creates administrative burdens
 
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
both for the Filer and for the uh Tax
 
01:21:24.189 --> 01:21:24.199 align:start position:0%
Administration brief but just to pull
 
01:21:27.310 --> 01:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
together that these are the
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
conclusions of the majority and take it
 
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
beyond what was I think quite well done
 
01:21:37.270 --> 01:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
and deliberately a neutral set of
 
01:21:41.629 --> 01:21:41.639 align:start position:0%
statements in the findings okay not
 
01:21:43.950 --> 01:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
argumentative not a rebuttal but a
 
01:21:48.030 --> 01:21:48.040 align:start position:0%
succinct statement of why we disagree in
 
01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:50.189 align:start position:0%
succinct statement of why we disagree in
going

01:21:50.189 --> 01:21:50.199 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:21:54.030 --> 01:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
forward I'll hold till next Monday to
 
01:21:58.310 --> 01:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
ask whether everybody uh is
 
01:22:01.189 --> 01:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
comfortable uh signing on to that report
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
I would hope that all six of us would be
 
01:22:06.350 --> 01:22:06.360 align:start position:0%
in a position to sign on to it but
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
you'll speak next
 
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
Monday and I'd rather have a draft in
 
01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
front of you that you can subtract from
 
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
draft okay
 
01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
good anything further that advances the
 
01:22:27.030 --> 01:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:29.189 --> 01:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
morning all right well thank you very
 
01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
much and again thank you drafters that
 
01:22:33.550 --> 01:22:33.560 align:start position:0%
was excellent you've done something I
 
01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't prepared to do in in in that
 
01:22:37.030 --> 01:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
degree at
 
01:22:39.990 --> 01:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
all okay that concludes the meeting and
 
01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
adjourned
