00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
here on this uh for the public uh this
 
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
is the uh oversight committee
 
00:13:12.389 --> 00:13:12.399 align:start position:0%
responsible The Joint oversight
 
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
committee responsible for the
 
00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:14.920 align:start position:0%
Improvement and assessment we're dealing
 
00:13:18.269 --> 00:13:18.279 align:start position:0%
with the Ed 306 rules uh we met last
 
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
week and we're continuing to meet today
 
00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:23.560 align:start position:0%
we've met numerous times I can count the
 
00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:25.399 align:start position:0%
number of times we've met dealing with
 
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
306 is either by this committee or
 
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
another and what we want to do is uh
 
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
look through these write down some of
 
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:35.240 align:start position:0%
our our
 
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
recommendations uh and pass those
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
recommendations on to Jael car and to uh
 
00:13:42.590 --> 00:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
the Department of
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
Education so with that uh I have handed
 
00:13:49.389 --> 00:13:49.399 align:start position:0%
out to the committee here a sheet which
 
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
I did yesterday try to capsulize some of
 
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
the uh areas that I've spoken to
 
00:13:59.790 --> 00:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
regarding the 306s and then if you look
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
at the top of the sheet you can see
 
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:05.720 align:start position:0%
where it says page number so I used
 
00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:09.320 align:start position:0%
reference back to the 991224 conditional
 
00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
approval of
 
00:14:14.949 --> 00:14:14.959 align:start position:0%
the of the um uh Department of State
 
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
Board of Education the Ed rule number
 
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
whether it be 306.000 2 or whatever uh
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
going on down through and the change
 
00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:25.959 align:start position:0%
rationale is it statutory or is it
 
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
policy at n stands for statutory change
 
00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:29.550 align:start position:0%
policy at n stands for statutory change
reference

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:29.560 align:start position:0%
reference
 
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
P would be a policy um reference or
 
00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
recommendation and jel car just remind
 
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
jel car cannot deal with policy they
 
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
deal with the
 
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
statute and and so that we as a
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
committee that is a policy committee can
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
deal with the areas of policy as well
 
00:14:49.949 --> 00:14:49.959 align:start position:0%
and make those recommendations to the
 
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
state board and then on the uh rightand
 
00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:55.720 align:start position:0%
side of that you can see in that column
 
00:15:00.030 --> 00:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh comments that support are the
 
00:15:03.509 --> 00:15:03.519 align:start position:0%
proposed um change does do people back
 
00:15:06.110 --> 00:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
there have copies of this uh I do have
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
some extras right here so why don't you
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
there let me know if there's not enough
 
00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:16.759 align:start position:0%
there because I do have an extra copy
 
00:15:20.230 --> 00:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
here uh represent Pell said she would be
 
00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
here a little late and Ruth Ward Senator
 
00:15:27.629 --> 00:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
Ward had a meeting going on in uh maybe
 
00:15:27.639 --> 00:15:33.269 align:start position:0%
Ward had a meeting going on in uh maybe
here

00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
so with that we need to try to get
 
00:15:41.949 --> 00:15:41.959 align:start position:0%
something down and and express our uh
 
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
responses to any areas of the 306 rules
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
and so that we can communicate with
 
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
others on Jael car and others on the
 
00:15:54.189 --> 00:15:54.199 align:start position:0%
State Board of
 
00:15:54.199 --> 00:15:56.110 align:start position:0%
State Board of
Education

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:56.120 align:start position:0%
Education
 
00:15:59.230 --> 00:15:59.240 align:start position:0%
so if we walk through these rules from
 
00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
the start to front front half to the
 
00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
back half as we've done so many times
 
00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
but we should have already starred
 
00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:08.440 align:start position:0%
certain areas where there are concerns
 
00:16:10.189 --> 00:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
that's what I've done with this right
 
00:16:10.199 --> 00:16:11.629 align:start position:0%
that's what I've done with this right
here

00:16:11.629 --> 00:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
so as a starting point I'll mention the
 
00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
first one I have and then we can walk
 
00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
continue to walk seeing the first one is
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
one of those definitions which is how
 
00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
right the front side of the
 
00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
306s and the definition has to do with
 
00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
which I I believe has uh references
 
00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:36.079 align:start position:0%
later on when we talk about other
 
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
aspects of the
 
00:16:40.949 --> 00:16:40.959 align:start position:0%
three6 the definition of educator as I
 
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:44.680 align:start position:0%
see it is that it's a statutory
 
00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
definition and the definition which we
 
00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.910 align:start position:0%
definition and the definition which we
have

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
here let's see let me get
 
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
my first
 
00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
half I referenced it back to page two
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
two of the conditional
 
00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:05.039 align:start position:0%
approval and the conditional approval on
 
00:17:08.429 --> 00:17:08.439 align:start position:0%
page two identifies educator means
 
00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
administrators educational Specialists
 
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
instructional Specialists teachers par
 
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
Educators educator interpreter and trans
 
00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.829 align:start position:0%
Educators educator interpreter and trans
literate

00:17:20.829 --> 00:17:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
literator I never had Trans literator in
 
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
a school I don't know what that
 
00:17:31.029 --> 00:17:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
yeah okay a translator okay and School
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
nurses and any other individuals
 
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
credentialed by the state
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
board uh the statutory reference that
 
00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at is RSA 21 n8-
 
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
DC and we talked about and that means a
 
00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
teacher or certified par par
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
professional period then there's another
 
00:18:00.669 --> 00:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
reference in RSA 18914 a Roman
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
5 that means any professional employee
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
of any school district whose position
 
00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
requires certification as a professional
 
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
engaged in
 
00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
teaching the term teacher shall also
 
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
include principes Librarians and
 
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
guidance counselors so that's also in
 
00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.909 align:start position:0%
guidance counselors so that's also in
statutory

00:18:18.909 --> 00:18:18.919 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
law so my my uh rationale or suggestion
 
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
is that the definition that's in the
 
00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
306s reflects
 
00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:32.230 align:start position:0%
306s reflects
statutory

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
statutory
 
00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
lock K we have two two sheets I handed
 
00:18:38.669 --> 00:18:38.679 align:start position:0%
out we're looking at the one that's got
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
the columns on it underneath that one
 
00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
yeah right we just started thank you
 
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:43.990 align:start position:0%
yeah right we just started thank you
you're

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
welcome so let's open up the comments on
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
question sure sure Mr chair I I agree
 
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
with that um that um that tightening up
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
on that definition to reflect um
 
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
statutory language makes a lot of sense
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
and I think one of the concerns I had
 
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
following the uh commissioner's
 
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
testimony last week was um was when the
 
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
term educator I think was being used in
 
00:19:17.149 --> 00:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
the context of the um the the student
 
00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
teacher uh ratios where uh where the
 
00:19:23.149 --> 00:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner said um said oh no only
 
00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
Educators that were certified to teach
 
00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
those classes would be used in the
 
00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
calculation of the ratios but the
 
00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
language in the proposed rules doesn't
 
00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't provide for that limitation so
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
um so if if there is going to be a
 
00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:40.360 align:start position:0%
limitation that's intended there as the
 
00:19:42.029 --> 00:19:42.039 align:start position:0%
commissioner spoke to I think that
 
00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:43.799 align:start position:0%
limitation should be articulated
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
specifically in the rules thank you and
 
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
you notice on the second page of the
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
sheet I handed out to you at the base on
 
00:19:53.909 --> 00:19:53.919 align:start position:0%
page 12 the conditional report it speaks
 
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
to student educator ratios and there's a
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
lot of rationale for are saying
 
00:20:05.149 --> 00:20:05.159 align:start position:0%
teacher um uh or educator ratios based
 
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
upon the
 
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
definition um my perspective is that the
 
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
the ratio we use for classrooms is not
 
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
does not involve
 
00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
just the teacher that's assigned that
 
00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
classroom there's other Educators that
 
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
come in and make up that ratio as was
 
00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
defined back in 2007 and 2008
 
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh in the uh oversight
 
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the uh costing of an
 
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
adequate education and we'll get into
 
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
that um so let's stick with the top part
 
00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:43.400 align:start position:0%
first and get down to the student
 
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
teacher ratio when we get that location
 
00:20:50.029 --> 00:20:50.039 align:start position:0%
so um back to the first definition here
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
the we've looked at other definitions
 
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
which we've communicated with the
 
00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
department and they they've Bas they've
 
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
come out agreed that definition should
 
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
reflect statutory
 
00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:04.520 align:start position:0%
language so is there any problem with us
 
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:06.200 align:start position:0%
moving forward with a recommendation of
 
00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
both gelar and to the department that
 
00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
the term educator reflect 21 in da da da
 
00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
da or and possibly the 18914 AV Roman 5
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
but 21 n8- d parentheses C specifically
 
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
says and means a teacher or certified
 
00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
par professional
 
00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
okay let's march on then so is that the
 
00:21:34.909 --> 00:21:34.919 align:start position:0%
21n definition or was that the other one
 
00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
that's the 21n definition the other one
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
too speaks to and it goes further which
 
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
I think is very very important means any
 
00:21:44.669 --> 00:21:44.679 align:start position:0%
professional employee of any school
 
00:21:46.149 --> 00:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
district whose position requires
 
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
certification as a professional engaged
 
00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.470 align:start position:0%
certification as a professional engaged
in

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:49.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
teaching the term teacher also shall
 
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
also include principes Librarians and
 
00:21:56.669 --> 00:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
guidance counselors there's another
 
00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
place in the statutes where the guidance
 
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
counsel has been left out and so this
 
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
now if we reference that that statutory
 
00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
language as well it means that the
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
guidance counselor has to have you know
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
be certified as well well so what's
 
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
what's currently being used then in the
 
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
calculation of the student teacher ratio
 
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
is it the 21n definition or is it the
 
00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
18939 is it 189 what what did you say it
 
00:22:27.669 --> 00:22:27.679 align:start position:0%
was I I think what's referencing that
 
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
ratio our our rules no no no it's not
 
00:22:34.909 --> 00:22:34.919 align:start position:0%
even mentioned within statute okay no my
 
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
my my point is our um are our certified
 
00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
professionals such as library media
 
00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:44.200 align:start position:0%
Specialists and principles currently
 
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
being used in the calculation of student
 
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
teacher ratios because I think the no no
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
ratios this is a you got to look at that
 
00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:01.039 align:start position:0%
second set of paperwork that I gave you
 
00:23:04.149 --> 00:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
um which talks about the student to
 
00:23:06.870 --> 00:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
Personnel ratios which is you'll find
 
00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
that and the report for costing of a
 
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
public education put out by that
 
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
committee back in 2007 and
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
8 and in that they have a number of
 
00:23:22.029 --> 00:23:22.039 align:start position:0%
ratios make up the total Personnel
 
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
ratios and this is used right now in the
 
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
calculation of Base cost in our adequacy
 
00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:31.880 align:start position:0%
formula and so you have the student
 
00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:33.750 align:start position:0%
formula and so you have the student
teacher

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
ratio specialty teachers you know
 
00:23:39.149 --> 00:23:39.159 align:start position:0%
there's like teachers come in for about
 
00:23:42.070 --> 00:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
20% of that time as as during teacher
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
preps music PE M library art um
 
00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:49.799 align:start position:0%
depending upon the individual School how
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
they do it and so that's in that
 
00:23:54.669 --> 00:23:54.679 align:start position:0%
calculation as specialist teachers
 
00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
specialty teachers then others that come
 
00:23:59.630 --> 00:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
in is the principal ratio that's based
 
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
upon number of students in the school
 
00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:05.720 align:start position:0%
and administrative assistant ratio
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
library media specialist ra ratio so you
 
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
see there's where the that is technology
 
00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:15.640 align:start position:0%
uh ratio uh custodian ratio and and
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
deals with Personnel not included and it
 
00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:20.200 align:start position:0%
the formula goes on and mentions things
 
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
like equipment is all yeah so I so I
 
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
think this is where um where obviously
 
00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
it it gets
 
00:24:29.789 --> 00:24:29.799 align:start position:0%
used in in different in different ways
 
00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
whether it's being used to calculate the
 
00:24:34.389 --> 00:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
um the um uh cost of inadequate
 
00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
education there is a a ratio used there
 
00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
I think that tends to be more of a
 
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
class-size number as opposed to a
 
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
District student teacher ratio and then
 
00:24:47.149 --> 00:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
when the commissioner was here last week
 
00:24:49.669 --> 00:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
he talked about a um a student teacher
 
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
ratio that I think probably included
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
library media Specialists and principles
 
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
and other credential things uh
 
00:24:59.789 --> 00:24:59.799 align:start position:0%
credential positions that to a ratio of
 
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
and I forgot what he said but it was
 
00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:06.360 align:start position:0%
around um uh 12:1 or 12.7 to1 it was
 
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
something like that and so so so I I
 
00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
think if we're going to uh be using that
 
00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
12.7 or whatever it is in some elements
 
00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
and then a 25 to one in some other
 
00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:26.440 align:start position:0%
things that we need to uh just make sure
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
what that that the you know how that
 
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
diff definition is is
 
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know maybe it's not maybe
 
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
it's two different definitions for two
 
00:25:40.669 --> 00:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
different um ratio uses of ratios or
 
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
numbers U because I you know we don't we
 
00:25:48.590 --> 00:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
certainly don't use 12.7 to1 in the cost
 
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm seeing nods because I I think
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
I'm what I'm saying is correct I think
 
00:25:53.909 --> 00:25:53.919 align:start position:0%
we we don't use it in the cost of
 
00:25:53.919 --> 00:25:55.029 align:start position:0%
we we don't use it in the cost of
inadequate

00:25:55.029 --> 00:25:55.039 align:start position:0%
inadequate
 
00:25:58.990 --> 00:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
education um calculation
 
00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
yeah we we've used that student to
 
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
Personnel ratios and underneath that the
 
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
student teacher ratio in regard to the
 
00:26:09.269 --> 00:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
classes yeah oh you know and that's
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
stated under student teacher ratio it
 
00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
talks about 25 to1 K through 2 it talks
 
00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
about the 30 to1 for the other levels it
 
00:26:23.549 --> 00:26:23.559 align:start position:0%
talks about the um uh uh what's see um
 
00:26:25.389 --> 00:26:25.399 align:start position:0%
to meet the school approval standards
 
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
are 25 to1 in kindergarten through grade
 
00:26:30.029 --> 00:26:30.039 align:start position:0%
two and third yeah yeah and and I
 
00:26:32.029 --> 00:26:32.039 align:start position:0%
misspoke it's not the cost ofac it's the
 
00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
base cost calculation isn't that yeah
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
but see the the all these ratios go
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
together to make the universal yeah cost
 
00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:45.320 align:start position:0%
M which is which becomes our base cost
 
00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
that's where it's coming from from the
 
00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
inputs the the the the 31 30 to1 25 to1
 
00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
those numbers that that that's those
 
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
what contribute to the F how the base
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
cost is figured out right but that's a
 
00:26:59.789 --> 00:26:59.799 align:start position:0%
different those rely on a different
 
00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
definition of educator than the than the
 
00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
definition that gets you to the 12.7 to
 
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
one well they rely upon that student
 
00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
teacher ratio that's in that costing
 
00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:13.799 align:start position:0%
report that's what they do there then
 
00:27:15.909 --> 00:27:15.919 align:start position:0%
the specialty teachers and all that come
 
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
on to that
 
00:27:20.389 --> 00:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
formula uh this was driven by that group
 
00:27:22.389 --> 00:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
that put it together years and years ago
 
00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
and it hasn't been touched since we have
 
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
changed base cost but we've never really
 
00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
reflected That Base cost in terms of the
 
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
we haven't changed that K through 2 or
 
00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
three grades 3 through 12 and there's
 
00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
been discussion of it there was
 
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:40.840 align:start position:0%
discussion on on on the Karen umberger
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
report I can recall uh when I brought up
 
00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
the recommendation to reduce it to 20 to
 
00:27:49.029 --> 00:27:49.039 align:start position:0%
one and they that's not where we're
 
00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
going in this committee so that stopped
 
00:27:54.909 --> 00:27:54.919 align:start position:0%
right there um there was even thoughts
 
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
of of of when we were looking at last
 
00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
year when I was looking at and trying to
 
00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
work with the the research people
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
upstairs of recognizing the elementary
 
00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
education was K through two I was taking
 
00:28:10.509 --> 00:28:10.519 align:start position:0%
and I was staying with a statory if you
 
00:28:12.269 --> 00:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
ask me what elementary education is it
 
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
goes a lot higher than you know right up
 
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
about grade six or five um the middle
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
school is come in there but I would
 
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
suggest that it go k through three and
 
00:28:26.669 --> 00:28:26.679 align:start position:0%
grades four
 
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
through 8 are the middle school grades
 
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
identified in
 
00:28:36.509 --> 00:28:36.519 align:start position:0%
statute represent Celli uh thank you um
 
00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:40.320 align:start position:0%
getting back to uh M on the proposed
 
00:28:43.389 --> 00:28:43.399 align:start position:0%
rules where it has the definition for
 
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
educator um I think uh what we need to
 
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
do here is tie it to statute as was
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
indicated um if you look at the
 
00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
definition for curriculum it just says
 
00:28:58.830 --> 00:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
as defined in RSA Etc
 
00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
so don't we here just have to say
 
00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
educator um uh means as defined in RSA
 
00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:11.720 align:start position:0%
218 a d Etc and if we want to change the
 
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
educator definition we change it in 21
 
00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.230 align:start position:0%
educator definition we change it in 21
and

00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
8 okay so you're saying
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
to do it the definition would be
 
00:29:30.029 --> 00:29:30.039 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the the yeah the 21 and8
 
00:29:30.039 --> 00:29:34.029 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the the yeah the 21 and8
yeah

00:29:34.029 --> 00:29:34.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
definition and if we need and if we want
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
to change the definition of educator we
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:46.909 --> 00:29:46.919 align:start position:0%
and8 why would we not also reference
 
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:55.640 align:start position:0%
areas which is um on your sheet yeah
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
number two yeah correct yes
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah we can do that requires
 
00:30:03.230 --> 00:30:03.240 align:start position:0%
certification I'm primarily concerned
 
00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
that in the classroom the classroom
 
00:30:11.590 --> 00:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:15.310 --> 00:30:15.320 align:start position:0%
teacher now it's you can have people
 
00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:17.480 align:start position:0%
that come in see then we have the issue
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
well we dealt with on the committee of
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
conference last year with the uh people
 
00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:24.440 align:start position:0%
coming out of the University system to
 
00:30:26.509 --> 00:30:26.519 align:start position:0%
teach at
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
Franklin that were paid by Franklin but
 
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
they came in and they didn't have
 
00:30:35.509 --> 00:30:35.519 align:start position:0%
teacher certification they had some of
 
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
them had phds in education they were
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
coming in and doing the Dual concurrent
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
enrollment so that b Bill basically said
 
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:46.120 align:start position:0%
that they're
 
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
authorized it wasn't dealing with
 
00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:52.200 align:start position:0%
certification this is a is this a big
 
00:30:53.789 --> 00:30:53.799 align:start position:0%
area here we're dealing with and I think
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
that before we try to delve down into
 
00:30:57.549 --> 00:30:57.559 align:start position:0%
some of the policy issues we make a
 
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
reference directly to a
 
00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:02.360 align:start position:0%
statute that's what Jael car's going to
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
have to do they can't change policy and
 
00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
those are the issues that we need to
 
00:31:08.789 --> 00:31:08.799 align:start position:0%
address as policy
 
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
people we got there's a lot of
 
00:31:14.909 --> 00:31:14.919 align:start position:0%
definitions and lot of this whole
 
00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:20.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:20.799 --> 00:31:22.470 align:start position:0%
 
work

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:25.799 align:start position:0%
um go ah so so yeah Mr chair I was just
 
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
trying to pull up the digital version of
 
00:31:30.629 --> 00:31:30.639 align:start position:0%
the of the front and back half side by
 
00:31:34.269 --> 00:31:34.279 align:start position:0%
sides um to do a quick search on where
 
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
the word where the term I don't want to
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
say word where the defined term educator
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
is being used in the um in the proposed
 
00:31:46.269 --> 00:31:46.279 align:start position:0%
rules because um how how you define that
 
00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
is going to affect obviously the ratios
 
00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:50.549 align:start position:0%
is going to affect obviously the ratios
but

00:31:50.549 --> 00:31:50.559 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
also a lot of
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
other yeah see initially when I was
 
00:31:58.750 --> 00:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
looking at this when I was looking at
 
00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:00.830 align:start position:0%
looking at this when I was looking at
the

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
ratios I had the word class in there too
 
00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
class pupil teacher ratios but then
 
00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
that's you know that's it's it's a
 
00:32:10.269 --> 00:32:10.279 align:start position:0%
bigger issue than that there's other
 
00:32:12.509 --> 00:32:12.519 align:start position:0%
Personnel that come in are involved that
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
are certified staff that it's not just
 
00:32:18.669 --> 00:32:18.679 align:start position:0%
your classroom teacher it's other
 
00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:26.200 align:start position:0%
well and I I you know to deal with this
 
00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
I think we really need to have to look
 
00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
back back at this report which was done
 
00:32:33.669 --> 00:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
by Senator estherbrook and Senator
 
00:32:36.549 --> 00:32:36.559 align:start position:0%
Styles and senator now it was
 
00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
representative Carson back then and
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
um Emma Rouse representative Rouse I
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
can't remember who else was on that but
 
00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:47.320 align:start position:0%
those were the people that were on that
 
00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
um Mary Heath was involved with some of
 
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
this back when she was assistant
 
00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:58.669 --> 00:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
time so
 
00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
we can we can talk this forever but I
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
think what we got to do is just say for
 
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
right now and then we may make some
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations ourselves for where we
 
00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
need to go with some of this is that we
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
statute everybody good with that MH and
 
00:33:26.029 --> 00:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
we'll get into discussion ratios at the
 
00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:27.880 align:start position:0%
next when we get down to that right
 
00:33:29.909 --> 00:33:29.919 align:start position:0%
right my only my only you know point
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
there is that is that when when looking
 
00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
at the the definition of educator it it
 
00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:40.360 align:start position:0%
affects other things in the um in the in
 
00:33:42.909 --> 00:33:42.919 align:start position:0%
the proposed rules and ratios being one
 
00:33:47.149 --> 00:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
of them uh but um um but there there may
 
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
be others as well and you know I just
 
00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:53.240 align:start position:0%
noticed one one section that that says
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
educator or other staff so so that
 
00:33:59.669 --> 00:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
that's even a a you know a broader use
 
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:02.440 align:start position:0%
of of um and this was under INR the
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
current definition of instructional time
 
00:34:07.789 --> 00:34:07.799 align:start position:0%
so so I just want to be conscious of
 
00:34:09.430 --> 00:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
that as we move through this that's a
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
big definitional change thanks so going
 
00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
down through are there any other
 
00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
definitions that I I I mentioned one
 
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:24.430 --> 00:34:24.440 align:start position:0%
opportunities and and why I did that
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
because it's both statutory but it's
 
00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
um in the current rule references
 
00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
acquisition of Knowledge and Skills
 
00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:38.200 align:start position:0%
through instruction or study outside the
 
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919 align:start position:0%
traditional classroom that goes
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
on current rule is based upon exact
 
00:34:47.869 --> 00:34:47.879 align:start position:0%
statatory language taken from RSA 193
 
00:34:47.879 --> 00:34:49.950 align:start position:0%
statatory language taken from RSA 193
col

00:34:49.950 --> 00:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
col
 
00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
one uh see that's Roman
 
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
1h1 and which says these plans may
 
00:34:58.990 --> 00:34:59.000 align:start position:0%
include but are not limited to such
 
00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:01.640 align:start position:0%
components or combination of components
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
of extended uh uh components of Extended
 
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
Learning opportunities as independent
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
study private instruction performing
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
groups internships community service
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
apprenticeships and online
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
courses should the new rule again
 
00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
reference those policy statements which
 
00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
are statutory too it's in in writing or
 
00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
should we just leave it where the El L's
 
00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
elos so the way that they've got here in
 
00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:47.829 --> 00:35:47.839 align:start position:0%
us in the in the uh proposal they have
 
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
means a personalized learning process
 
00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:52.280 align:start position:0%
that allows for achievement of compeny
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:00.870 --> 00:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
that that's awfully vague don't you
 
00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:10.510 --> 00:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
classroom well we have you know it a lot
 
00:36:13.069 --> 00:36:13.079 align:start position:0%
of times the classroom the classroom now
 
00:36:16.589 --> 00:36:16.599 align:start position:0%
is larger just than the brick and mortar
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh it goes into community service some
 
00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:21.400 align:start position:0%
high schools require community
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
service um they have Capstone projects
 
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
um the online um teaching now is
 
00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
extremely important internship programs
 
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
are done in conjunction with the teacher
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
in the school that's teaching
 
00:36:39.359 --> 00:36:40.670 align:start position:0%
in the school that's teaching
mathematics

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
mathematics
 
00:36:46.829 --> 00:36:46.839 align:start position:0%
maybe um so yes I I think that uh uh
 
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
elos at the district level uh can vary
 
00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
from District to District in terms of
 
00:36:56.309 --> 00:36:56.319 align:start position:0%
what they um will uh offer as ELO
 
00:36:59.349 --> 00:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
opportunities so I I'm fine with it in
 
00:37:02.109 --> 00:37:02.119 align:start position:0%
the proposed rules um and then we get
 
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
into learning opportunities um which
 
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:17.870 --> 00:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
page any other points on that I I think
 
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
the elos can go can occur inside and
 
00:37:22.829 --> 00:37:22.839 align:start position:0%
outside of the
 
00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
classroom you know in or a school or
 
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
within a district
 
00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
is that out if you if you're doing
 
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.510 align:start position:0%
is that out if you if you're doing
something

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
outside your classroom or your school
 
00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
and doing it elsewhere let's say in the
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
curriculum office at the
 
00:37:43.950 --> 00:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
district is
 
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
classroom fruit for thought
 
00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:01.400 align:start position:0%
so Ju Just Another thought on um on on
 
00:38:04.589 --> 00:38:04.599 align:start position:0%
elos when um when when what's being
 
00:38:07.589 --> 00:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
proposed is you know
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
replacing this exemplary
 
00:38:13.630 --> 00:38:13.640 align:start position:0%
list in the existing rules independent
 
00:38:15.309 --> 00:38:15.319 align:start position:0%
studies private instruction on because
 
00:38:18.069 --> 00:38:18.079 align:start position:0%
it says including but not limited to so
 
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
these are examples yeah and now the in
 
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
the proposed rule the only example is
 
00:38:26.349 --> 00:38:26.359 align:start position:0%
means a personalized learning process
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
that's right it's taken all the the such
 
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
as or not you know not limited to right
 
00:38:35.309 --> 00:38:35.319 align:start position:0%
right but but the for example helps I
 
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:37.640 align:start position:0%
mean it gives it gives people I think a
 
00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
structure uh behind what that definition
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
I mean um as opposed to no structure
 
00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
behind the definition and um uh I mean
 
00:38:48.829 --> 00:38:48.839 align:start position:0%
it's not ruling out things outside of
 
00:38:52.589 --> 00:38:52.599 align:start position:0%
these seven areas but uh personalized
 
00:38:52.599 --> 00:38:53.990 align:start position:0%
these seven areas but uh personalized
learning

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
learning
 
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:56.720 align:start position:0%
process you know I think like what what
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
what what Patty was what representative
 
00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
Cornell was suggesting is
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:38.240 align:start position:0%
yeah I have no idea I have no objection
 
00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
to adding uh the list under uh including
 
00:39:50.349 --> 00:39:50.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
to did you all look at the um reference
 
00:39:58.750 --> 00:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
93 colon one
 
00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh it goes down to Roman
 
00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:05.720 align:start position:0%
1H and then one where it says these
 
00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:09.400 align:start position:0%
plans may include but are not limited to
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
such components or a combination of
 
00:40:12.829 --> 00:40:12.839 align:start position:0%
components of Extended Learning
 
00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
opportunities as independent study
 
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
Etc that's the part that I thought was
 
00:40:22.349 --> 00:40:22.359 align:start position:0%
helpful so that's 1931
 
00:40:26.829 --> 00:40:26.839 align:start position:0%
H not 193 one colon one yeah is that a
 
00:40:30.829 --> 00:40:30.839 align:start position:0%
one or is that Roman one that's Ro it's
 
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
a one yeah Roman
 
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
one H number
 
00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:41.720 align:start position:0%
one yeah so there again we would say
 
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
pursuant to or as defined in yeah
 
00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:48.079 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't know why it's going the
 
00:40:50.349 --> 00:40:50.359 align:start position:0%
other way and taking some of the
 
00:40:54.630 --> 00:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
suggested oh maybe it's superus I don't
 
00:40:59.230 --> 00:40:59.240 align:start position:0%
know but it's what's in statute right
 
00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
once again I go back to something that's
 
00:41:04.109 --> 00:41:04.119 align:start position:0%
in statute should it should reflect what
 
00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
statute is in instead of changing it in
 
00:41:07.119 --> 00:41:08.670 align:start position:0%
statute is in instead of changing it in
the

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
rule and that's going to save work down
 
00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
the road in terms of rule making and gel
 
00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
car and everything else that's
 
00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:17.720 align:start position:0%
right so on that when I handed out to
 
00:41:19.069 --> 00:41:19.079 align:start position:0%
you I think
 
00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
the the rationale for the change is
 
00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
and it's up it it helps with the policy
 
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
so so when so
 
00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:41.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:44.589 --> 00:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
one R
 
00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
H1 refers to these seven things what
 
00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
does it refer to in the language leading
 
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
up to that
 
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
list well it's underneath the compulsory
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
attendance for by pup right right but
 
00:41:58.270 --> 00:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
does it essentially follow what's in the
 
00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
current rule um I Extended Learning
 
00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:02.680 align:start position:0%
means the primary acquisition Knowledge
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
adopting see ex if you look at the way
 
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
it's in the the book right now MH it
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
says Extended Learning means the primary
 
00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
acquisition of Knowledge and Skills
 
00:42:30.470 --> 00:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
through instruction or study outside the
 
00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
traditional classroom
 
00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:35.800 align:start position:0%
methodology including but not limited to
 
00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
independent study private instruction
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
performing groups internships community
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
service apprenticeships and online
 
00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
now and
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
so I I I feel comfortable the way it's
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
written in statute right now yes statute
 
00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
or in rule in Rule and Statute in in
 
00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
current rule in current Rule and statute
 
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
it's aligns more like with this that's
 
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:17.950 --> 00:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
306 yeah
 
00:43:20.109 --> 00:43:20.119 align:start position:0%
um yeah I was
 
00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:23.720 align:start position:0%
just I I agree with that are we all on
 
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
the same page on this just to reflect
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
again statutory language m yes it
 
00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
maintains consistency what we're doing
 
00:43:32.589 --> 00:43:32.599 align:start position:0%
throughout this so we would be
 
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
recommending to
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
revise o in in the proposed rules to be
 
00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
what I in the current rules yeah which
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
follows in St yeah
 
00:43:47.790 --> 00:43:47.800 align:start position:0%
yeah but don't we want to refer to the
 
00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
statute as well yes yeah yeah right yeah
 
00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah we could re you know
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
yeah pursuant too right yeah yeah yeah
 
00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
basically just adding on to what's
 
00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:05.720 align:start position:0%
currently in I pursuant to 193 one yeah
 
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
okay okay going down through the we're
 
00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:17.480 align:start position:0%
still in
 
00:44:20.069 --> 00:44:20.079 align:start position:0%
definitions the other area which I had a
 
00:44:20.079 --> 00:44:22.670 align:start position:0%
definitions the other area which I had a
concern

00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
concern
 
00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
um and this is kind of a picky one too
 
00:44:37.390 --> 00:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
but um our reference to again 193e con
 
00:44:41.309 --> 00:44:41.319 align:start position:0%
one Roman 2 school districts then have
 
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility and flexibility and
 
00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:44.440 align:start position:0%
implementing diverse educational
 
00:44:46.109 --> 00:44:46.119 align:start position:0%
approaches to instruction and curriculum
 
00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
tailor to meet student
 
00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:51.920 align:start position:0%
needs um and I also
 
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
mention uh RSA 189 colon 1- a rment to
 
00:44:59.349 --> 00:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
duty provide
 
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
education um instructional time means
 
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
the period of time during which
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
instructions offered which is a function
 
00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
of school schedule classroom management
 
00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:09.960 align:start position:0%
and local school board approved
 
00:45:11.710 --> 00:45:11.720 align:start position:0%
curriculum I I've written a lot into
 
00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
that I'm not hung up on this as
 
00:45:18.109 --> 00:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
much but it's some you know I
 
00:45:21.069 --> 00:45:21.079 align:start position:0%
instructional time there's been efforts
 
00:45:24.549 --> 00:45:24.559 align:start position:0%
in the past to say to schools X Y and Z
 
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
you will teach
 
00:45:30.549 --> 00:45:30.559 align:start position:0%
social studies 60 minutes per week in
 
00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
the grade
 
00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:33.790 align:start position:0%
the grade
school

00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:33.800 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
and and then some are saying well I
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
teach that in conjunction with my
 
00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
reading I teach this in conjunction with
 
00:45:42.549 --> 00:45:42.559 align:start position:0%
that or I want to teach 90 minutes per
 
00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
week um and and and that's what our
 
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
curriculum directs instruction directs
 
00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
are do in this school I think that we're
 
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
getting into some dangerous area when we
 
00:45:55.390 --> 00:45:55.400 align:start position:0%
start to identify specific number of
 
00:45:57.390 --> 00:45:57.400 align:start position:0%
minutes and I don't think they're doing
 
00:45:58.829 --> 00:45:58.839 align:start position:0%
it in
 
00:45:58.839 --> 00:46:02.710 align:start position:0%
it in
this

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
proposal I don't have any problem
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
leaving it General as in yeah as
 
00:46:12.109 --> 00:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
got instruction means you know that's
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:28.109 --> 00:46:28.119 align:start position:0%
one so so Ju Just for example um if um
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
if a student was was doing a
 
00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:33.870 align:start position:0%
if a student was was doing a
reading

00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
reading
 
00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:36.839 align:start position:0%
um you know free reading inside of a
 
00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
English class would that be considered
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
instructional time under the current
 
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
definition and would it be considered
 
00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
definition somebody else barking on that
 
00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:02.230 --> 00:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
yeah and the the only reason I'm asking
 
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
because the under the current definition
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's um working towards achieving
 
00:47:09.390 --> 00:47:09.400 align:start position:0%
educational objectives which I think
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
reading could be you know you know could
 
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
be doing that whereas under the new
 
00:47:16.829 --> 00:47:16.839 align:start position:0%
definitions period of time which
 
00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
and I I just don't know the answer to to
 
00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:35.670 align:start position:0%
and I I just don't know the answer to to
that

00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
so is recess and the grade school
 
00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:40.910 align:start position:0%
so is recess and the grade school
instructional

00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
instructional
 
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
time can anybody out there answer that
 
00:47:46.109 --> 00:47:46.119 align:start position:0%
question to me is recess period for a
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
grade two grade three
 
00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:53.160 align:start position:0%
student recess I believe it
 
00:47:55.589 --> 00:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
is it's not typically done in the
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
classroom but there's instruction going
 
00:47:58.510 --> 00:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
on is
 
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
supervised often times maybe not even by
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
a teacher it might be a pair of
 
00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
professional out there or maybe somebody
 
00:48:08.829 --> 00:48:08.839 align:start position:0%
that's hired to take care of recess
 
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
duties that's the other stuff pardon me
 
00:48:13.630 --> 00:48:13.640 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't call that
 
00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
instruction not well but under the under
 
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
the current definition though under the
 
00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:21.069 align:start position:0%
the current definition though under the
current

00:48:21.069 --> 00:48:21.079 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
definition means the period of time
 
00:48:24.990 --> 00:48:25.000 align:start position:0%
during which pups are actively working
 
00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
toward achieving educational objectives
 
00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
under the supervision of an educator or
 
00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:31.160 align:start position:0%
other staff member that might be
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
instruction I I don't know the answer
 
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
but maybe that qualifies for first grade
 
00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
I I've seen the in the lower grades that
 
00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
that counts as instructional time recess
 
00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
does if we expanded uh or we changed
 
00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
kindergarten so we have play based
 
00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:50.670 align:start position:0%
kindergarten so we have play based
instruction

00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:50.680 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:58.789 --> 00:48:58.799 align:start position:0%
so so that I think that fits in the
 
00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:07.789 --> 00:49:07.799 align:start position:0%
well so
 
00:49:07.799 --> 00:49:09.510 align:start position:0%
well so
so

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:19.030 align:start position:0%
so
[Music]

00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:20.910 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
yeah can they can you can other words is
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
this being recorded yeah we're being
 
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
then nobody could
 
00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:30.309 align:start position:0%
then nobody could
hear

00:49:30.309 --> 00:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
hear
 
00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:33.400 align:start position:0%
chrisa if you want to come up and read
 
00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
that again in front of the mic yeah we
 
00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
so red red light on light all right
 
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
there Christina pretorius a policy
 
00:49:48.030 --> 00:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
director with reaching higher New
 
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um the current uh rules do say
 
00:49:54.109 --> 00:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
that elementary schools May count up to
 
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
30 minutes of recess per day as
 
00:49:57.789 --> 00:49:57.799 align:start position:0%
instruction time for pupils in
 
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
so so would that be considered
 
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
instructional time under the proposed
 
00:50:16.549 --> 00:50:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:18.829 --> 00:50:18.839 align:start position:0%
yeah means the period of time during
 
00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
is so I let me ask you different is
 
00:50:33.670 --> 00:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
there anything that that would qualify
 
00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
as instructional time under the current
 
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
definition that would not qualify as
 
00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
instructional time under the new
 
00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:42.599 align:start position:0%
definition or vice
 
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
versa No actually they're not changing
 
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
that definition they're proposing is
 
00:50:49.789 --> 00:50:49.799 align:start position:0%
it's the proposal that's currently in
 
00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
rule no yeah my oh excuse me I'm I'm
 
00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
looking at the wrong book here yeah
 
00:51:07.549 --> 00:51:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:15.309 --> 00:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:17.069 --> 00:51:17.079 align:start position:0%
objectives that could be just about
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
school kindergarten socialization
 
00:51:25.829 --> 00:51:25.839 align:start position:0%
they're learning how to behave with each
 
00:51:29.030 --> 00:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
other learning how to respect
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
rules according to what we just heard
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
about recess time I would think the
 
00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
proposed um rule uh fits uh encompasses
 
00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:41.720 align:start position:0%
that better than the current
 
00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:51.870 align:start position:0%
that better than the current
rule

00:51:51.870 --> 00:51:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
MH yeah but in the under the new
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
proposal instruction time means the
 
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
period of time which instruction is
 
00:52:03.549 --> 00:52:03.559 align:start position:0%
offered um now take that phrase
 
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
instruction and is offered and plug in
 
00:52:08.069 --> 00:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
the definition of instruction from right
 
00:52:10.510 --> 00:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
above means deliberate and strategic
 
00:52:13.069 --> 00:52:13.079 align:start position:0%
approaches to facilitate student
 
00:52:16.589 --> 00:52:16.599 align:start position:0%
learning I I don't know if that's
 
00:52:18.789 --> 00:52:18.799 align:start position:0%
instruction if facilitating student
 
00:52:18.799 --> 00:52:20.870 align:start position:0%
instruction if facilitating student
learning

00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
learning
 
00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:23.480 align:start position:0%
is it's do we have a current definition
 
00:52:28.750 --> 00:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:34.589 --> 00:52:34.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:40.030 --> 00:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
so so I I I guess what I'm trying to get
 
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
at is in the current definition of
 
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
instructional time talks about the
 
00:53:50.829 --> 00:53:50.839 align:start position:0%
period of time during which pupils are
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
actively working towards achieving
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
educational objectives under the
 
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
supervision of an educator or other
 
00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:59.510 align:start position:0%
supervision of an educator or other
staff

00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:03.069 --> 00:54:03.079 align:start position:0%
member so that would I I guess means the
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
period of time and then basically all
 
00:54:07.710 --> 00:54:07.720 align:start position:0%
the words in the current
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
definition I guess are defining what
 
00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:11.950 align:start position:0%
definition I guess are defining what
instruction

00:54:11.950 --> 00:54:11.960 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
means pupils are actively working
 
00:54:16.109 --> 00:54:16.119 align:start position:0%
towards achieving educational objectives
 
00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839 align:start position:0%
under the supervision of an educator or
 
00:54:19.789 --> 00:54:19.799 align:start position:0%
other staff member that appears to be
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
the what what the definition of
 
00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:24.280 align:start position:0%
instruction is in the current rules in
 
00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
the proposed rules the def definition of
 
00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:28.109 align:start position:0%
the proposed rules the def definition of
instruction

00:54:28.109 --> 00:54:28.119 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
00:54:30.670 --> 00:54:30.680 align:start position:0%
changes to being instruction means
 
00:54:33.309 --> 00:54:33.319 align:start position:0%
deliberate and strategic approaches so
 
00:54:36.549 --> 00:54:36.559 align:start position:0%
it's an approach to F to facilitate
 
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:44.309 --> 00:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
um instruction is an approach that's the
 
00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:52.829 --> 00:54:52.839 align:start position:0%
instruction well that's also reflected
 
00:54:57.470 --> 00:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
in statute of 193 E1 Roman 2
 
00:54:59.190 --> 00:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
where say school districts then have
 
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility and flexibility in
 
00:55:03.069 --> 00:55:03.079 align:start position:0%
implementing diverse educational
 
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
approaches to instruction approaches to
 
00:55:09.069 --> 00:55:09.079 align:start position:0%
instruction but that's
 
00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
not and tailored to meet student
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
needs other words instruction policies
 
00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:19.240 align:start position:0%
is School Board
 
00:55:21.309 --> 00:55:21.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility right right but I think
 
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:28.349 --> 00:55:28.359 align:start position:0%
rather than an approach to do
 
00:55:30.549 --> 00:55:30.559 align:start position:0%
instruction it's now saying instruction
 
00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
is an approach it's it's just turn
 
00:55:39.029 --> 00:55:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:41.549 --> 00:55:41.559 align:start position:0%
around I
 
00:55:43.829 --> 00:55:43.839 align:start position:0%
I yeah what what what I mean what does
 
00:55:47.549 --> 00:55:47.559 align:start position:0%
it mean to you Mr chair well it it it
 
00:55:50.349 --> 00:55:50.359 align:start position:0%
caught my attention that's why I wrote
 
00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:53.359 align:start position:0%
this down as there there's a question on
 
00:55:57.829 --> 00:55:57.839 align:start position:0%
this I I've always gotten concerned
 
00:56:01.549 --> 00:56:01.559 align:start position:0%
when the state gets in the
 
00:56:04.549 --> 00:56:04.559 align:start position:0%
business of trying to tell us here's
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
your instructional time I guess I'm a
 
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
local control guy that believes that my
 
00:56:13.109 --> 00:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
high school issues the the diploma based
 
00:56:15.789 --> 00:56:15.799 align:start position:0%
upon our curriculum and our instruction
 
00:56:18.029 --> 00:56:18.039 align:start position:0%
conforming with this academic standards
 
00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:20.520 align:start position:0%
or the old carige unit numbers and all
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
that but uh I I I I really concern that
 
00:56:28.910 --> 00:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
we don't get in the point where
 
00:56:30.910 --> 00:56:30.920 align:start position:0%
we're I think the state has
 
00:56:32.430 --> 00:56:32.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility to ensure that when
 
00:56:34.589 --> 00:56:34.599 align:start position:0%
you're at school 5 hours and a half 5
 
00:56:39.309 --> 00:56:39.319 align:start position:0%
hours 75 whatever it might be that is
 
00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
on however you know that there's some
 
00:56:50.029 --> 00:56:50.039 align:start position:0%
kids that are in high school that
 
00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
maybe only taking three courses or three
 
00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
credits or three whatever that and the
 
00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
other two it's a five block schedule may
 
00:57:01.309 --> 00:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
be done with a study hall or
 
00:57:05.829 --> 00:57:05.839 align:start position:0%
some offline type online type program
 
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
and that that that could be an ELO that
 
00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
could be that could be an independent
 
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
study yeah anything right right and so
 
00:57:18.109 --> 00:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
um so that would all be I think we need
 
00:57:20.190 --> 00:57:20.200 align:start position:0%
flexibility and that was what's in
 
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
statute there in
 
00:57:26.190 --> 00:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
193e it has to maintain re flexibility
 
00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:32.710 align:start position:0%
193e it has to maintain re flexibility
in

00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:34.990 --> 00:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
implementing you know but does that have
 
00:57:39.390 --> 00:57:39.400 align:start position:0%
to be in rules also no it's in statute
 
00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:41.589 align:start position:0%
to be in rules also no it's in statute
right

00:57:41.589 --> 00:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
right but are you saying then that the
 
00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:53.829 --> 00:57:53.839 align:start position:0%
flexibility I think we're getting down
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:03.789 --> 00:58:03.799 align:start position:0%
if we propose something to Jael car
 
00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to really say Okay
 
00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
Jael car
 
00:58:12.029 --> 00:58:12.039 align:start position:0%
it's it's a statutory issue
 
00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
policy is they're not interested in
 
00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
that so how do how does the stat how
 
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
does the statute um treat instructional
 
00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:36.109 align:start position:0%
does the statute um treat instructional
time

00:58:36.109 --> 00:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:52.309 --> 00:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:02.670 --> 00:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:43.789 --> 00:59:43.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:43.799 --> 00:59:44.789 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
189 one Roman 2 does not speak
 
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
specifically to educational time it just
 
00:59:56.190 --> 00:59:56.200 align:start position:0%
says that the school board
 
00:59:58.349 --> 00:59:58.359 align:start position:0%
is is responsible for establishing
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
structure accountability advocacy and
 
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
delivery of instruction in each School
 
01:00:55.710 --> 01:00:55.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:55.720 --> 01:01:02.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:05.549 --> 01:01:05.559 align:start position:0%
so all I did with the suggestion on the
 
01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:08.200 align:start position:0%
bottom of the sheet that I have I have
 
01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
the the recommendation that's being put
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
forth by the state board instruct time
 
01:01:14.829 --> 01:01:14.839 align:start position:0%
means the period of time during which
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
instruction is offered then I add in
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
which is a function of school schedule
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
classroom management and local school
 
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
board approved
 
01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
curriculum that was all
 
01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
my thoughts it's not based on any kind
 
01:01:29.359 --> 01:01:30.190 align:start position:0%
my thoughts it's not based on any kind
of

01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:30.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
Statute I
 
01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
I I think that would work yeah I don't
 
01:01:37.549 --> 01:01:37.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
that of adding that latter part or just
 
01:01:43.589 --> 01:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
correct so that would be we're
 
01:01:48.029 --> 01:01:48.039 align:start position:0%
suggesting to the department then this
 
01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
policy added to their
 
01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
definition could you repeat that it's on
 
01:01:57.029 --> 01:01:57.039 align:start position:0%
the bottom of page one on the right hand
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
side there representative Cornell where
 
01:02:01.470 --> 01:02:01.480 align:start position:0%
you see a parentheses at the very bottom
 
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
in the right hand column instructional
 
01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
time means the period of time during
 
01:02:07.029 --> 01:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
which instruction is offered that's what
 
01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
the state board's recommending there the
 
01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:12.349 align:start position:0%
the state board's recommending there the
which

01:02:12.349 --> 01:02:12.359 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:02:15.549 --> 01:02:15.559 align:start position:0%
is or that is a function of school
 
01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
schedule classroom management and local
 
01:02:21.269 --> 01:02:21.279 align:start position:0%
school board approved
 
01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
curriculum it's a reflection of a lot of
 
01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:29.910 align:start position:0%
curriculum it's a reflection of a lot of
things

01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
well what so one of the one of the
 
01:02:36.309 --> 01:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
um it's a little bit of a stretch but
 
01:02:39.109 --> 01:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
well not really the the um the term
 
01:02:42.430 --> 01:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
instruction in the current rules
 
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
reflects under the supervision of an
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:55.480 align:start position:0%
member but that would not apply to an
 
01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:56.990 align:start position:0%
member but that would not apply to an
ELO

01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
ELO
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily well it it it does because
 
01:03:03.269 --> 01:03:03.279 align:start position:0%
you I think even in an ELO you you
 
01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
generally have like your school to
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
Career coordinator that's overseeing the
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh the ELO even though they may not be
 
01:03:17.269 --> 01:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:20.269 --> 01:03:20.279 align:start position:0%
ELO event
 
01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
maybe we're going too far with this
 
01:03:32.109 --> 01:03:32.119 align:start position:0%
maybe what the stateboard has stopping
 
01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
at offered and not getting into the wise
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
who's because I put down a couple
 
01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:47.240 align:start position:0%
rationale but then you're bringing up
 
01:03:50.150 --> 01:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
another one you know and and who's
 
01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
responsible for providing that
 
01:03:53.789 --> 01:03:53.799 align:start position:0%
instruction well the classroom teacher
 
01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
or the certified teacher
 
01:04:00.349 --> 01:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
or it maybe not it it may be a pair of
 
01:04:01.829 --> 01:04:01.839 align:start position:0%
professional underneath the supervision
 
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
of a certified teacher or it maybe a
 
01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:07.829 align:start position:0%
of a certified teacher or it maybe a
certified

01:04:07.829 --> 01:04:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:11.230 --> 01:04:11.240 align:start position:0%
pair those are all other staff members
 
01:04:14.069 --> 01:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I agree well could be a
 
01:04:17.549 --> 01:04:17.559 align:start position:0%
contracted service too yeah Speech
 
01:04:20.829 --> 01:04:20.839 align:start position:0%
Pathology yeah yeah yeah other staff M
 
01:04:22.510 --> 01:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
so so should we just leave it the way
 
01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
they had
 
01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:26.920 align:start position:0%
it I think so okay let's just leave it
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
that now are there any other areas
 
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
within definitions
 
01:04:51.630 --> 01:04:51.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:57.630 --> 01:04:57.640 align:start position:0%
we want to make note of or recommend
 
01:04:59.589 --> 01:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
not we could jump to the next one I had
 
01:05:03.870 --> 01:05:03.880 align:start position:0%
but you know I'm jumping to another page
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
page six
 
01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
from page two there's 3 four five in
 
01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
okay if if we want to go to the the
 
01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
policy development portion it's under
 
01:06:13.309 --> 01:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
basic learning standards
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
including it goes into the homework
 
01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:17.789 align:start position:0%
including it goes into the homework
digital

01:06:17.789 --> 01:06:17.799 align:start position:0%
digital
 
01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
literacy all
 
01:06:24.029 --> 01:06:24.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
had suggest here
 
01:06:32.109 --> 01:06:32.119 align:start position:0%
that uh a five number five be put in
 
01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
there when we're talking how students
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
can pursue various learning
 
01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
opportunities including we have virtual
 
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
learning let's see the virtual learning
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
academy career related credentials and
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
certification I put down Career
 
01:06:50.029 --> 01:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
Technical education courses and programs
 
01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
and then I also put in there math
 
01:06:55.750 --> 01:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
learning communities pursuant to RSA 193
 
01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:57.269 align:start position:0%
learning communities pursuant to RSA 193
-

01:06:57.269 --> 01:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
-
 
01:06:59.870 --> 01:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
one those are some programs which we put
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
in place that since the old rules were
 
01:07:04.269 --> 01:07:04.279 align:start position:0%
put in
 
01:07:06.670 --> 01:07:06.680 align:start position:0%
place the math learning communities we
 
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
funded this year there's been an a
 
01:07:13.069 --> 01:07:13.079 align:start position:0%
program at nhti bringing in over 38 40
 
01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
Math teachers from across the
 
01:07:18.269 --> 01:07:18.279 align:start position:0%
state they're implementing the the math
 
01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:20.200 align:start position:0%
high school
 
01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
programs C education courses and
 
01:07:25.549 --> 01:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
programs have significantly changed
 
01:07:30.750 --> 01:07:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
things we also have separate rules for
 
01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:37.789 align:start position:0%
things we also have separate rules for
the

01:07:37.789 --> 01:07:37.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
CCH but should they be referenced here
 
01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:57.190 align:start position:0%
CCH but should they be referenced here
too

01:07:57.190 --> 01:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:59.789 --> 01:07:59.799 align:start position:0%
if if we are you know not going there
 
01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
one want to leave that area as it
 
01:08:23.950 --> 01:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
is okay we'll leave that as is without
 
01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
having to add on anything meaning as is
 
01:08:32.910 --> 01:08:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:39.870 align:start position:0%
 
proposed

01:08:39.870 --> 01:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:49.719 align:start position:0%
is and going down to the next one which
 
01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:02.719 --> 01:09:03.990 align:start position:0%
 
school

01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
facilities I brought this up at the last
 
01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
time we
 
01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:10.829 align:start position:0%
time we
met

01:09:10.829 --> 01:09:10.839 align:start position:0%
met
 
01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
um the local school board shall require
 
01:09:15.550 --> 01:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
that facilities operated by the school
 
01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
district for K through 12 and I injected
 
01:09:22.789 --> 01:09:22.799 align:start position:0%
in there the latter part there and for
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
prek children purum to RSA 190 186 and
 
01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
RSA 186 C9 those are both in C purposes
 
01:09:39.189 --> 01:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:42.149 --> 01:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
education it's not necessarily what I
 
01:09:44.110 --> 01:09:44.120 align:start position:0%
you know referenced last time nutrition
 
01:09:47.669 --> 01:09:47.679 align:start position:0%
programs which is also reason
 
01:09:51.390 --> 01:09:51.400 align:start position:0%
why um facility support
 
01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:54.199 align:start position:0%
but they've got to be able to support
 
01:09:57.630 --> 01:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
these children at age three through age
 
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
five and we're doing that in every
 
01:10:05.189 --> 01:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
District now I understand we don't have
 
01:10:09.189 --> 01:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
prek kindergarten some districts do and
 
01:10:11.229 --> 01:10:11.239 align:start position:0%
they're doing that on their own
 
01:10:13.229 --> 01:10:13.239 align:start position:0%
nickel but we don't fund it in the
 
01:10:16.590 --> 01:10:16.600 align:start position:0%
funding formula we go k through
 
01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:26.669 --> 01:10:26.679 align:start position:0%
support ages three through 5 that have a
 
01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
handicapping condition an
 
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
IEP and that's done in the schools in
 
01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:33.470 align:start position:0%
IEP and that's done in the schools in
the

01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:10:35.790 --> 01:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
facilities so what what's wrong with the
 
01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
current definition of
 
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
facilities it it says basically K
 
01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
through 12 no no I'm talking about in
 
01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
the current
 
01:10:48.149 --> 01:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
rules the current rules yeah just
 
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:03.950 --> 01:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
that's on page 16 of the side by side on
 
01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
the side by side so I mean did Ed 320
 
01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:35.630 --> 01:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
well n320 is the those the school
 
01:11:40.669 --> 01:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
buildings right so does ed3 so the the
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.390 --> 01:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
30607 does not reference Ed
 
01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:55.960 align:start position:0%
320 the current rule references
 
01:12:01.709 --> 01:12:01.719 align:start position:0%
is um various building codes and ventil
 
01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
you know building code requirements and
 
01:12:08.350 --> 01:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
things like that what does Ed 320
 
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
reference uh
 
01:12:14.350 --> 01:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
the the approval
 
01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:15.990 align:start position:0%
the the approval
process

01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:27.870 --> 01:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
purposes um what has to be
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
submitted uh maintenance plans
 
01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:39.629 align:start position:0%
submitted uh maintenance plans
Etc

01:12:39.629 --> 01:12:39.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.709 --> 01:12:46.719 align:start position:0%
process so why would the approval
 
01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
process be in there as opposed to a sort
 
01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
of a structural requirement um for
 
01:12:55.629 --> 01:12:55.639 align:start position:0%
school fa you know the local school or
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
shall you know require the facilities
 
01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
for each School provide the following
 
01:13:03.790 --> 01:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
you know lays down the um the hard
 
01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
requirements for for that as opposed to
 
01:13:07.990 --> 01:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
the application
 
01:13:11.149 --> 01:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
process I mean the application Pro you
 
01:13:16.149 --> 01:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:20.350 --> 01:13:20.360 align:start position:0%
facility Well it does go into uh air
 
01:13:25.149 --> 01:13:25.159 align:start position:0%
quality um you know much of just
 
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
glancing at it you know what's what's
 
01:13:30.149 --> 01:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
included in current rule is in in
 
01:13:32.990 --> 01:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
320 health and safety
 
01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.910 align:start position:0%
320 health and safety
inspections

01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
inspections
 
01:13:36.910 --> 01:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
um that's all the stuff that comes
 
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
underneath Amy Clark and the engineering
 
01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
department over there
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
um my my the reason why I put that here
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
is that I've said
 
01:13:51.229 --> 01:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
it is that we do have children that are
 
01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
younger than
 
01:13:57.910 --> 01:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:01.149 --> 01:14:01.159 align:start position:0%
mhm and if I'm following this correctly
 
01:14:01.159 --> 01:14:04.270 align:start position:0%
mhm and if I'm following this correctly
it

01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
320 um
 
01:14:10.470 --> 01:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
o2d I believe it could be um it says a
 
01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
school facility that meets all of the
 
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
applicable application requirements of
 
01:14:16.750 --> 01:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
Ed 302
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
3202 shall be approved for operation so
 
01:14:23.310 --> 01:14:23.320 align:start position:0%
I think that sums it up in that one
 
01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
sentence the ref the reference back to
 
01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:34.390 --> 01:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
rule can you read a l part of that again
 
01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
please from the rule yeah it's a a a
 
01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:39.560 align:start position:0%
school facility that meets all of the
 
01:14:42.590 --> 01:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
applicable application requirements of
 
01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:55.669 align:start position:0%
applicable application requirements of
Ed

01:14:55.669 --> 01:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:02.110 --> 01:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
operation yeah it
 
01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
say in the new proposed rule that says
 
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
are approved to operate or are
 
01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
conditionally approved to operate in
 
01:15:12.750 --> 01:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
accordance with 8320 and circles back if
 
01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
I'm not mistaken so we should we leave
 
01:15:17.189 --> 01:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
it the way they
 
01:15:17.199 --> 01:15:19.830 align:start position:0%
it the way they
proposed

01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
y yeah up and down so so no no so I'm
 
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just trying to see what we've
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
lost here so does 320 talk about
 
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
um uh you know lack of specialized
 
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
spaces for Arts science technology
 
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
education does it talk about that or
 
01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
does it talk is it a school is it a
 
01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:45.080 align:start position:0%
facility approval
 
01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:47.480 align:start position:0%
process does it actually say you have to
 
01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
have certain spaces to do certain things
 
01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
or is it an approval process for
 
01:15:56.070 --> 01:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
facilities cuz a current rule talks
 
01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:36.510 --> 01:16:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:39.709 --> 01:16:39.719 align:start position:0%
so set said another way Mr chair why are
 
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
we changing what why why is the why is
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
there a proposal to change the current
 
01:16:50.669 --> 01:16:50.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:53.189 --> 01:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
facilities because isn't most that other
 
01:16:55.550 --> 01:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
stuff in 320
 
01:16:58.350 --> 01:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not looking at I'm looking at
 
01:17:00.430 --> 01:17:00.440 align:start position:0%
lighting and
 
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
at when I looked at it I thought I saw
 
01:17:11.229 --> 01:17:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
it is no one from the Department coming
 
01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
today to answer questions no they were
 
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
here I know no I don't think we're going
 
01:17:23.189 --> 01:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:39.390 --> 01:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
long certainly addresses uh safety
 
01:17:39.400 --> 01:17:42.310 align:start position:0%
long certainly addresses uh safety
ventilation

01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
ventilation
 
01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:45.149 align:start position:0%
ventilation
um

01:17:45.149 --> 01:17:45.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:21.870 --> 01:18:21.880 align:start position:0%
Health inspections by the department air
 
01:18:40.229 --> 01:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
and in the appendix 320
 
01:18:56.430 --> 01:18:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
yeah but it doesn't say that um that for
 
01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:01.350 align:start position:0%
yeah but it doesn't say that um that for
example

01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
um you know uh you know addressing a
 
01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:08.520 align:start position:0%
lack of of specialized spaces for for
 
01:19:11.709 --> 01:19:11.719 align:start position:0%
science I just I just looked at the
 
01:19:14.629 --> 01:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
looked for the um occurrence of the word
 
01:19:17.950 --> 01:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
science in Ed 320 and it comes in two
 
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
places and it just says that if you have
 
01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
a science lab you need chemical hoods
 
01:19:24.270 --> 01:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
and I mean it doesn't actually say you
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
lab emergency shower and eyewash shall
 
01:19:32.350 --> 01:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
be available in all science
 
01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
labs but it doesn't say what you need it
 
01:19:38.229 --> 01:19:38.239 align:start position:0%
just it's a it's a um it's a building
 
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
it's a facility approval
 
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
process I mean I think we're losing
 
01:19:55.950 --> 01:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:40.990 --> 01:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:44.470 --> 01:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
well I think that the old 306.97 is is
 
01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:48.830 align:start position:0%
well I think that the old 306.97 is is
is

01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
stronger and the singular sentence we
 
01:21:01.110 --> 01:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:04.189 --> 01:21:04.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yeah I think 320 is for initial
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:15.709 --> 01:21:15.719 align:start position:0%
um approved but then the 306.97 is the
 
01:21:18.870 --> 01:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
continuing requirements to keep yeah
 
01:21:18.880 --> 01:21:25.950 align:start position:0%
continuing requirements to keep yeah
going

01:21:25.950 --> 01:21:25.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:28.360 align:start position:0%
that's a good
 
01:21:32.350 --> 01:21:32.360 align:start position:0%
catch but 320 does include renewals as
 
01:21:38.910 --> 01:21:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:42.510 --> 01:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
approvals well the the 320 does deal
 
01:21:45.430 --> 01:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
with initial approval and all the
 
01:21:47.350 --> 01:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
conditions which are like fire and
 
01:21:50.350 --> 01:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
health and safety codes that's all
 
01:21:53.149 --> 01:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
320 this right here I think represent
 
01:22:00.629 --> 01:22:00.639 align:start position:0%
Cornell is is on that course is is the
 
01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
current rule specifies that you got to
 
01:22:07.070 --> 01:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
address things like Lighting and Sound
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
Acoustics and you got to look at air
 
01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:16.270 align:start position:0%
Acoustics and you got to look at air
ventilation

01:22:16.270 --> 01:22:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
um and there's a lot of data out there
 
01:22:20.910 --> 01:22:20.920 align:start position:0%
saying that schools are current with
 
01:22:22.629 --> 01:22:22.639 align:start position:0%
that stuff their achievement scores will
 
01:22:32.390 --> 01:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
so do we want to make a recommendation
 
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:44.189 --> 01:22:44.199 align:start position:0%
3067 maybe with a reference to the 320
 
01:22:49.750 --> 01:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
to yes
 
01:22:55.110 --> 01:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
yes with a reference or
 
01:22:57.470 --> 01:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
I think we have to I don't know if we
 
01:22:59.870 --> 01:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
have to refer to the 320 cuz that's a
 
01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
it's already there it's administrative
 
01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:03.750 align:start position:0%
it's already there it's administrative
rule

01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
rule
 
01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
right are you on that Katie fine okay
 
01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:43.510 --> 01:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
I had if we go to the next one does
 
01:23:45.070 --> 01:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
anybody else have anything
 
01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
30608 learning and instructional
 
01:23:55.840 --> 01:24:42.270 align:start position:0%
30608 learning and instructional
resources

01:24:42.270 --> 01:24:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:44.390 --> 01:24:44.400 align:start position:0%
okay this this the language that I
 
01:24:46.189 --> 01:24:46.199 align:start position:0%
reference here is the new stuff that we
 
01:24:48.669 --> 01:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
put in the law this past
 
01:24:51.149 --> 01:24:51.159 align:start position:0%
year the quium shall present broad
 
01:24:52.910 --> 01:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
pedagogical approach no that's the
 
01:24:54.990 --> 01:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
sentence prior to what we put
 
01:24:57.750 --> 01:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
in called by the minum standards Public
 
01:25:00.070 --> 01:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
School Pro and acum for each area of the
 
01:25:41.229 --> 01:25:41.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:42.350 --> 01:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
people good with the learning and
 
01:25:44.310 --> 01:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
instructional resource the way it
 
01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:46.030 align:start position:0%
instructional resource the way it
is

01:25:46.030 --> 01:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:25:50.109 --> 01:25:50.119 align:start position:0%
no um why why was the um the part about
 
01:25:52.310 --> 01:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
cataloged and classified according to
 
01:25:54.669 --> 01:25:54.679 align:start position:0%
practices accepted by the American which
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
one are you on now I'm I'm right on
 
01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
30608 and the the A2
 
01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:03.669 align:start position:0%
30608 and the the A2
a

01:26:03.669 --> 01:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:26:03.679 --> 01:26:05.310 align:start position:0%
a
a

01:26:05.310 --> 01:26:05.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:26:10.109 --> 01:26:10.119 align:start position:0%
3068 08 current rule yeah
 
01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:27.189 --> 01:26:27.199 align:start position:0%
I mean I I don't know why that was
 
01:26:30.350 --> 01:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
dropped I mean that seems like a
 
01:26:36.790 --> 01:26:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:39.790 --> 01:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
organizational what if that gets updated
 
01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
yeah well it would be
 
01:26:45.109 --> 01:26:45.119 align:start position:0%
Up's actually talking about 2005 yeah
 
01:26:46.189 --> 01:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
you know what you could probably take
 
01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
out the reference to 2005 and just um
 
01:26:51.149 --> 01:26:51.159 align:start position:0%
and that that way it would be updated as
 
01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:58.030 --> 01:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
so do you feel comfortable in some other
 
01:26:59.550 --> 01:26:59.560 align:start position:0%
organization that's not part of the
 
01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire telling
 
01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:12.149 --> 01:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
do I I I I'm not so sure about that a
 
01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
lot of organizations
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
change uh in the direction they're going
 
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
and I have a wife who is a library I
 
01:27:20.790 --> 01:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
mean we're we're already doing that with
 
01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
facilities I mean we talk about we talk
 
01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
about you know National Electric Code
 
01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
mean so why are we going to be
 
01:27:36.350 --> 01:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
cataloging in accordance with 2005 data
 
01:27:39.070 --> 01:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
which you know computers hardly existed
 
01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
well they they certainly existed they
 
01:27:44.629 --> 01:27:44.639 align:start position:0%
exist I got you where we are
 
01:27:44.639 --> 01:27:46.189 align:start position:0%
exist I got you where we are
now

01:27:46.189 --> 01:27:46.199 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
I'm I'd be all right letting that float
 
01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
with with with updated requirements but
 
01:27:53.430 --> 01:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm trying to figure out is
 
01:27:55.709 --> 01:27:55.719 align:start position:0%
what what do we lose when we lose a I
 
01:27:58.030 --> 01:27:58.040 align:start position:0%
mean you know all schools are doing it
 
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
right now would they would they stop
 
01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
doing it would we lose some sort of
 
01:28:04.830 --> 01:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
organization of of how instructional
 
01:28:08.189 --> 01:28:08.199 align:start position:0%
materials are currently being being um
 
01:28:09.510 --> 01:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
cataloged and
 
01:28:13.470 --> 01:28:13.480 align:start position:0%
classified um I you know um I don't know
 
01:28:15.149 --> 01:28:15.159 align:start position:0%
if there's anybody here that could say
 
01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:21.390 --> 01:28:21.400 align:start position:0%
lose instructional resources are you
 
01:28:22.709 --> 01:28:22.719 align:start position:0%
talking about are you talking about
 
01:28:24.109 --> 01:28:24.119 align:start position:0%
what's in the media center in the
 
01:28:25.590 --> 01:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
library or you talking about what's
 
01:28:27.709 --> 01:28:27.719 align:start position:0%
being used as an instructional
 
01:28:31.910 --> 01:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
resource which it's so broad
 
01:28:34.669 --> 01:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
now just writing the Civics curriculum
 
01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
which is coming from the Historical
 
01:28:38.189 --> 01:28:38.199 align:start position:0%
Society here in
 
01:28:38.199 --> 01:28:39.830 align:start position:0%
Society here in
town

01:28:39.830 --> 01:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:28:42.510 --> 01:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
um I Civics and everything
 
01:28:46.350 --> 01:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
else right yeah so so I mean so I mean
 
01:28:48.510 --> 01:28:48.520 align:start position:0%
do we know do we I don't know if we have
 
01:28:50.430 --> 01:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
the answer cataloging what's that isn't
 
01:28:52.669 --> 01:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
it just cataloging cataloging
 
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
classifying so you know how to find
 
01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:57.470 align:start position:0%
classifying so you know how to find
stuff

01:28:57.470 --> 01:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
right um why why wouldn't we want to
 
01:29:03.669 --> 01:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:08.350 --> 01:29:08.360 align:start position:0%
requirement um the um New
 
01:29:12.629 --> 01:29:12.639 align:start position:0%
3068 a um includes not just printed
 
01:29:16.830 --> 01:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
materials but online materials as well
 
01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
um you know I was um involved in some
 
01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:21.590 align:start position:0%
um you know I was um involved in some
Library

01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
Library
 
01:29:24.550 --> 01:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
Automation and um we got
 
01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
um away from some of that um requirement
 
01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of new um online cataloges
 
01:29:35.910 --> 01:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
because of search capabilities for
 
01:29:38.590 --> 01:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
certain terms and so forth so some of
 
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
the old catalog um uh sections were no
 
01:29:54.189 --> 01:29:54.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
I I'd like to know why it was taken out
 
01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:08.109 --> 01:30:08.119 align:start position:0%
out well I can understand why A1 2A was
 
01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
taken up because referencing a very
 
01:30:13.270 --> 01:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
narrow organiz you know a narrow scope
 
01:30:16.430 --> 01:30:16.440 align:start position:0%
they the Library Association does not
 
01:30:20.109 --> 01:30:20.119 align:start position:0%
necessarily have catalog all the
 
01:30:21.470 --> 01:30:21.480 align:start position:0%
instructional materials that are being
 
01:30:23.590 --> 01:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
used in a school today a lot of that
 
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
comes from
 
01:30:26.950 --> 01:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
online uh some of it might be Career
 
01:30:29.830 --> 01:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
Tech stuff which is coming from
 
01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:32.310 align:start position:0%
Tech stuff which is coming from
industry

01:30:32.310 --> 01:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
industry
 
01:30:35.590 --> 01:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
um I can understand why you know I I
 
01:30:37.350 --> 01:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
think it's important that things be
 
01:30:40.109 --> 01:30:40.119 align:start position:0%
cataloged and classified or I don't know
 
01:30:43.950 --> 01:30:43.960 align:start position:0%
even that um be provided and that's what
 
01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:49.189 align:start position:0%
even that um be provided and that's what
they

01:30:49.189 --> 01:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:51.470 --> 01:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
have local school should require that
 
01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
each School provide and available a
 
01:30:56.790 --> 01:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
developmentally appropriate when as
 
01:30:56.800 --> 01:31:26.510 align:start position:0%
developmentally appropriate when as
requested

01:31:26.510 --> 01:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:31.189 --> 01:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:34.629 --> 01:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
one yeah I'm good with the
 
01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
proposed I also support the proposed new
 
01:31:39.870 --> 01:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
rule yeah I mean I think we're talking
 
01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
about the library here isn't that what
 
01:31:46.430 --> 01:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
this section is about I don't know see
 
01:31:49.229 --> 01:31:49.239 align:start position:0%
that that that if we're just talking a
 
01:31:51.510 --> 01:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
narrow scope of where we
 
01:31:55.109 --> 01:31:55.119 align:start position:0%
are and so I'm libraries or media
 
01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
centers or whatever they're calling them
 
01:31:59.149 --> 01:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
nowadays it may not even be located in
 
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
that building it may be all online sure
 
01:32:04.030 --> 01:32:04.040 align:start position:0%
well um I I mean I'm just sort of you
 
01:32:05.790 --> 01:32:05.800 align:start position:0%
know look looking at a couple of the
 
01:32:07.950 --> 01:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
other references that are in that
 
01:32:10.430 --> 01:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
actually what one of that's in both
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
managed through circulation policies and
 
01:32:16.669 --> 01:32:16.679 align:start position:0%
procedures that are designed to maximize
 
01:32:17.950 --> 01:32:17.960 align:start position:0%
the use of the
 
01:32:20.750 --> 01:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
resources so that's in both the proposed
 
01:32:24.550 --> 01:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
and the original rules and D the prop on
 
01:32:26.910 --> 01:32:26.920 align:start position:0%
the original rules rules utilize
 
01:32:28.590 --> 01:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
Community Resources and that could be
 
01:32:30.270 --> 01:32:30.280 align:start position:0%
the town or city
 
01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
library they took that out they took
 
01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
that out and that's been removed so
 
01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:42.270 --> 01:32:42.280 align:start position:0%
concern isn't there a school that
 
01:32:43.950 --> 01:32:43.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a library and they go
 
01:32:45.390 --> 01:32:45.400 align:start position:0%
across the street and use a public
 
01:32:47.709 --> 01:32:47.719 align:start position:0%
library as their Library so they they no
 
01:32:52.189 --> 01:32:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:54.510 --> 01:32:54.520 align:start position:0%
that I I don't know what situation they
 
01:32:57.550 --> 01:32:57.560 align:start position:0%
used to have though a certified School
 
01:33:01.350 --> 01:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
librarian running the public library so
 
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
when they're just from here to the other
 
01:33:05.629 --> 01:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
in the hallway across the street Route
 
01:33:08.310 --> 01:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
10 yeah and so the kids said Library
 
01:33:10.709 --> 01:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
class they went over there back and
 
01:33:10.719 --> 01:33:12.350 align:start position:0%
class they went over there back and
forth

01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
forth
 
01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
MH which
 
01:33:17.149 --> 01:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
is probably the you
 
01:33:20.030 --> 01:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
know cost effective
 
01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah if the library is Right town
 
01:33:27.470 --> 01:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
yeah but we're talking about learn
 
01:33:32.270 --> 01:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
learning and instructional resources
 
01:33:35.629 --> 01:33:35.639 align:start position:0%
including online materials and I think
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's um uh really the uh a in the
 
01:33:44.830 --> 01:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
proposed uh is maybe outdated with
 
01:33:48.629 --> 01:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
online access to materials and I think
 
01:33:54.669 --> 01:33:54.679 align:start position:0%
um the uh proposed um really reflects Uh
 
01:34:01.390 --> 01:34:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:03.790 --> 01:34:03.800 align:start position:0%
well it includes not knowing where
 
01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
technology will go in the next 10 years
 
01:34:08.350 --> 01:34:08.360 align:start position:0%
before the rules are re
 
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
Revisited yeah yeah I mean I'm I'm I I
 
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
would be I would be really careful about
 
01:34:18.669 --> 01:34:18.679 align:start position:0%
um um you know you
 
01:34:23.870 --> 01:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
know sliding where where Public Library
 
01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
and school libraries and professional
 
01:34:28.910 --> 01:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
library media Specialists are when it
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
comes to the use of new technologies in
 
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
their field because I think they're very
 
01:34:35.709 --> 01:34:35.719 align:start position:0%
well equipped and very well trained in
 
01:34:37.629 --> 01:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
uh in the incorporation of those those
 
01:34:40.109 --> 01:34:40.119 align:start position:0%
Technologies as part of instructional
 
01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
resources so so uh while while while I
 
01:34:47.030 --> 01:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
I'll certainly admit I'm
 
01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:49.270 align:start position:0%
I'll certainly admit I'm
not

01:34:49.270 --> 01:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
uh I'm I'm I I don't know what what all
 
01:34:55.870 --> 01:34:55.880 align:start position:0%
this specifics are behind anglo-american
 
01:34:59.590 --> 01:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
cataloging rule second edition 2005 uh
 
01:35:02.590 --> 01:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a newer reference that uh
 
01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
that goes there or that could be used
 
01:35:07.390 --> 01:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
there and that is commonly used in
 
01:35:11.430 --> 01:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
library and and um media
 
01:35:14.350 --> 01:35:14.360 align:start position:0%
centers but it seems to be that
 
01:35:18.590 --> 01:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
eliminating it would be um a real step
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
backward because I think this this is
 
01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
probably one of the things that that um
 
01:35:25.870 --> 01:35:25.880 align:start position:0%
that makes Library professional and
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
makes a library something that that
 
01:35:32.870 --> 01:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
anybody trained and how to access
 
01:35:37.229 --> 01:35:37.239 align:start position:0%
materials in libraries like is done
 
01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
beginning I think in first grade second
 
01:35:43.149 --> 01:35:43.159 align:start position:0%
grade that that you can walk into any
 
01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
library and be able to access materials
 
01:35:48.510 --> 01:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
and I think if there's anything I I mean
 
01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
I I think this is directly tied with
 
01:35:53.629 --> 01:35:53.639 align:start position:0%
with with Civics and that if we remove
 
01:35:56.030 --> 01:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
move this requirement we're we're taking
 
01:35:58.990 --> 01:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
a major step back so you know for
 
01:36:01.270 --> 01:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
example if the library at Maple Street
 
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
were cataloged according
 
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
to I don't know somebody somebody's
 
01:36:11.590 --> 01:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
local cataloging um design and then you
 
01:36:14.189 --> 01:36:14.199 align:start position:0%
go to the high school uh which is using
 
01:36:16.590 --> 01:36:16.600 align:start position:0%
the American Library Association uh
 
01:36:18.109 --> 01:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
cataloging system you wouldn't be able
 
01:36:21.510 --> 01:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
to find anything and um or if you moov
 
01:36:22.669 --> 01:36:22.679 align:start position:0%
to a different School District you
 
01:36:24.550 --> 01:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to find it anything
 
01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
because you wouldn't have been you
 
01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have had that experience in
 
01:36:30.510 --> 01:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
your earlier School uh or then you go to
 
01:36:33.470 --> 01:36:33.480 align:start position:0%
the town library City library or Library
 
01:36:35.390 --> 01:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
Congress yeah yeah I mean you're you're
 
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
looking at it though
 
01:36:40.950 --> 01:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
through a scope that's narrowing as the
 
01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
years go by here in terms
 
01:36:47.229 --> 01:36:47.239 align:start position:0%
of you read in media which I there was
 
01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
an article not too long ago in the Wall
 
01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
Street Journal
 
01:36:54.830 --> 01:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
how people are reading less books
 
01:36:57.310 --> 01:36:57.320 align:start position:0%
they're on the web they're doing their
 
01:36:58.669 --> 01:36:58.679 align:start position:0%
research and everything through
 
01:37:01.950 --> 01:37:01.960 align:start position:0%
Electronics now and there's fewer people
 
01:37:04.070 --> 01:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
actually going and taking a book out and
 
01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:05.109 align:start position:0%
actually going and taking a book out and
reading

01:37:05.109 --> 01:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
reading
 
01:37:08.470 --> 01:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
it uh they're turning the TV set on they
 
01:37:11.070 --> 01:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
forget their information or whatever or
 
01:37:13.350 --> 01:37:13.360 align:start position:0%
looking at the screen in the computer
 
01:37:16.870 --> 01:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm just an antique trying to I I
 
01:37:21.030 --> 01:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
think that the whole nature of the we
 
01:37:23.149 --> 01:37:23.159 align:start position:0%
used to say the library media center was
 
01:37:25.709 --> 01:37:25.719 align:start position:0%
the center of the school in terms of
 
01:37:28.189 --> 01:37:28.199 align:start position:0%
educational resource
 
01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
and is it now or is that because the
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
machine is on Glenn's desk right now is
 
01:37:35.109 --> 01:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:37:37.629 --> 01:37:37.639 align:start position:0%
center of what we've got going on right
 
01:37:38.910 --> 01:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
now how many people are going to the
 
01:37:40.669 --> 01:37:40.679 align:start position:0%
library to get a book in fact they're
 
01:37:42.470 --> 01:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
not ordering those
 
01:37:47.310 --> 01:37:47.320 align:start position:0%
books they are just some but you know
 
01:37:50.550 --> 01:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
the it's changed world I think we got to
 
01:37:53.470 --> 01:37:53.480 align:start position:0%
make is this policy dealing with media
 
01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:55.679 align:start position:0%
Library centers or is it going Beyond it
 
01:37:57.350 --> 01:37:57.360 align:start position:0%
talks about circulation and all that
 
01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
stuff that seems to make me think we're
 
01:38:02.950 --> 01:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
thinking library but are we now talk
 
01:38:05.430 --> 01:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
about all the directional resources used
 
01:38:09.030 --> 01:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
by by the career Tax Center or the the
 
01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
high school Civics physics class or the
 
01:38:16.709 --> 01:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
engineering department yeah yeah I know
 
01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
I I hear what you're think saying but I
 
01:38:20.470 --> 01:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
think I think these this section is
 
01:38:22.709 --> 01:38:22.719 align:start position:0%
talking Library just looking at the
 
01:38:25.149 --> 01:38:25.159 align:start position:0%
language in the original rules and even
 
01:38:27.189 --> 01:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
in some of the language from the uh from
 
01:38:28.990 --> 01:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
the proposed rules managed through
 
01:38:31.870 --> 01:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
circulation processes and procedures
 
01:38:34.030 --> 01:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
designed to maximize the use of the
 
01:38:35.790 --> 01:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
resources you say I think this is
 
01:38:37.030 --> 01:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
Library should we be asking the
 
01:38:39.070 --> 01:38:39.080 align:start position:0%
department is this SE I think we should
 
01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
okay so we let's skip over this and get
 
01:38:44.510 --> 01:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
that answer okay be but but if this is
 
01:38:47.189 --> 01:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
Li if this is library then I think we
 
01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely need to maintain the uh the
 
01:38:52.109 --> 01:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
standards for libraries if this is
 
01:38:55.430 --> 01:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
adding on to library then we need to at
 
01:38:57.229 --> 01:38:57.239 align:start position:0%
least maintain the standards for
 
01:39:00.589 --> 01:39:00.599 align:start position:0%
existing library and then provide some
 
01:39:05.470 --> 01:39:05.480 align:start position:0%
you know rational um
 
01:39:08.189 --> 01:39:08.199 align:start position:0%
um I don't know rules surrounding
 
01:39:10.750 --> 01:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
surrounding non- library media access
 
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
and we've had those discussions around
 
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
this see the title for 306.000 is
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
instructional resources
 
01:39:23.629 --> 01:39:23.639 align:start position:0%
MH that goes beyond library or is this
 
01:39:26.030 --> 01:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
if it is going to be media library
 
01:39:29.669 --> 01:39:29.679 align:start position:0%
Orient oriented do we do we say that in
 
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
the the header here maybe that's maybe
 
01:39:34.870 --> 01:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
it needs to be more clear yeah yeah
 
01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
that's I think that's a really good
 
01:39:40.750 --> 01:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
question yeah but in a also you see uh
 
01:39:44.990 --> 01:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
technologies that shall be necessary to
 
01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.629 align:start position:0%
technologies that shall be necessary to
support

01:39:46.629 --> 01:39:46.639 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:39:50.350 --> 01:39:50.360 align:start position:0%
um decades ago I was involved in
 
01:39:53.669 --> 01:39:53.679 align:start position:0%
automating major university libraries in
 
01:39:56.510 --> 01:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
the New York area getting rid of card
 
01:39:59.229 --> 01:39:59.239 align:start position:0%
cataloges there you had you know you're
 
01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
referring back to the American Library
 
01:40:03.510 --> 01:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
Association card catalog system Dewey
 
01:40:05.550 --> 01:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
Decimal System and all that and we went
 
01:40:08.350 --> 01:40:08.360 align:start position:0%
to online systems where you could put in
 
01:40:11.189 --> 01:40:11.199 align:start position:0%
Search terms you know you could put in
 
01:40:14.350 --> 01:40:14.360 align:start position:0%
teacher you didn't have to go to a a
 
01:40:18.589 --> 01:40:18.599 align:start position:0%
specific uh category um and structures
 
01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:21.360 align:start position:0%
of categories um in order to find what
 
01:40:24.350 --> 01:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
you were looking for so I I think that
 
01:40:27.950 --> 01:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
um you know we're looking at online and
 
01:40:31.390 --> 01:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
Technologies and you know you know we're
 
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
involved in AI these days like it or not
 
01:40:38.270 --> 01:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
so I I think that um you know the
 
01:40:43.790 --> 01:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
today and see what we we address
 
01:40:49.589 --> 01:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
curriculum this last year and what I had
 
01:40:52.350 --> 01:40:52.360 align:start position:0%
in parentheses there is right out of
 
01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:54.070 align:start position:0%
in parentheses there is right out of
statute

01:40:54.070 --> 01:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
statute
 
01:40:56.270 --> 01:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
the curriculum shall
 
01:40:59.390 --> 01:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
present and it references then the
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for public school
 
01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
approval and the academic standards for
 
01:41:04.830 --> 01:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
each area of the subst educational
 
01:41:07.629 --> 01:41:07.639 align:start position:0%
content of an adequate
 
01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
education should that be inserted into
 
01:41:14.709 --> 01:41:14.719 align:start position:0%
a uh you in the
 
01:41:19.149 --> 01:41:19.159 align:start position:0%
new yeah so I I um I I think you may be
 
01:41:21.990 --> 01:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
mixing two different things on on that I
 
01:41:23.709 --> 01:41:23.719 align:start position:0%
I I think maybe we need to find out if
 
01:41:25.589 --> 01:41:25.599 align:start position:0%
this is talking about library and media
 
01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
centers and uh and what other resources
 
01:41:31.910 --> 01:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
are being folded into this I I I think
 
01:41:33.270 --> 01:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
we're having a hard time yeah I think
 
01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's the threshold question on this
 
01:41:38.910 --> 01:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
so okay the title may not be clear as to
 
01:41:43.589 --> 01:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:43.599 --> 01:41:46.430 align:start position:0%
 
here

01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:41:49.350 --> 01:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
okay well that gets us down to the next
 
01:41:52.229 --> 01:41:52.239 align:start position:0%
one I have and I I'm only taking where I
 
01:41:53.550 --> 01:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
you know had looked at some of this
 
01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
stuff there may be other things that you
 
01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
have but if the next one if we go down
 
01:42:06.430 --> 01:42:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:23.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:25.950 --> 01:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
jumps over quite a bit of
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:02.350 --> 01:43:02.360 align:start position:0%
I handed out those sheets to you
 
01:43:06.629 --> 01:43:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:15.149 --> 01:43:15.159 align:start position:0%
about student teacher
 
01:43:19.629 --> 01:43:19.639 align:start position:0%
ratios and the proposal I had was
 
01:43:23.870 --> 01:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
to change educator to teacher
 
01:43:27.189 --> 01:43:27.199 align:start position:0%
which is also supported when and under
 
01:43:30.589 --> 01:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
educator it also talks about
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
teaching uh it says means a teacher or
 
01:44:07.030 --> 01:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:10.109 --> 01:44:10.119 align:start position:0%
there was another component of the old
 
01:44:11.830 --> 01:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
of this this
 
01:44:17.390 --> 01:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
one comes from any class size no let's
 
01:44:21.310 --> 01:44:21.320 align:start position:0%
see yeah it was in the old class size
 
01:45:01.629 --> 01:45:01.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:04.510 --> 01:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
there was one other change that they did
 
01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
make and that was the last part in the
 
01:45:08.990 --> 01:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
interest of safety the maximum number of
 
01:45:11.189 --> 01:45:11.199 align:start position:0%
students in laboratory classes in such
 
01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
areas as science and Career Technical
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
education shall be determined by the
 
01:45:17.550 --> 01:45:17.560 align:start position:0%
number of work stations and the size and
 
01:45:21.550 --> 01:45:21.560 align:start position:0%
design of the area that's been
 
01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
kept but it also goes on in no case
 
01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
shall the number of students in
 
01:45:29.709 --> 01:45:29.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:33.109 --> 01:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
24 I have suggested that that be changed
 
01:45:34.830 --> 01:45:34.840 align:start position:0%
to say in no case shall the number of
 
01:45:37.669 --> 01:45:37.679 align:start position:0%
students in a laboratory class extend
 
01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
exceed 24 unless permission to exceed is
 
01:45:45.709 --> 01:45:45.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:48.390 --> 01:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
board then the local school boards it's
 
01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
on them uh they should be looking at
 
01:45:53.950 --> 01:45:53.960 align:start position:0%
safety and the building and
 
01:46:05.070 --> 01:46:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:07.990 --> 01:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
it and I've also suggested student
 
01:46:09.709 --> 01:46:09.719 align:start position:0%
teacher ratio rather than student
 
01:46:41.589 --> 01:46:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:45.510 --> 01:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
but I thought earlier we talked about um
 
01:46:47.589 --> 01:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
the definition of educator and
 
01:46:54.030 --> 01:46:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
I I don't know how you don't think we
 
01:46:57.510 --> 01:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
have to change it to because we've
 
01:46:59.950 --> 01:46:59.960 align:start position:0%
already done it right under the
 
01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:10.189 align:start position:0%
already done it right under the
definition

01:47:10.189 --> 01:47:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:14.430 --> 01:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
right so what's what's the impact of the
 
01:47:19.310 --> 01:47:19.320 align:start position:0%
the change from size to ratio class size
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:29.709 --> 01:47:29.719 align:start position:0%
well we've always been Staffing based
 
01:47:32.310 --> 01:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
upon ratios
 
01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:34.470 align:start position:0%
upon ratios
right

01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
Staffing yeah you know employing
 
01:47:39.870 --> 01:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
basically you're
 
01:47:42.109 --> 01:47:42.119 align:start position:0%
funding it's been based upon that
 
01:47:44.070 --> 01:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
formula you see in that sheet I handed
 
01:47:45.550 --> 01:47:45.560 align:start position:0%
out to you that's the well the the
 
01:47:47.910 --> 01:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
calculation of the base yeah yeah no no
 
01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:50.639 align:start position:0%
that's that's correct but but that's
 
01:47:52.990 --> 01:47:53.000 align:start position:0%
different than this this is class size
 
01:47:57.390 --> 01:47:57.400 align:start position:0%
so this is what um what a school would
 
01:48:01.390 --> 01:48:01.400 align:start position:0%
have to comply with to make sure that um
 
01:48:04.709 --> 01:48:04.719 align:start position:0%
kindergarten through grades grade two 25
 
01:48:13.629 --> 01:48:13.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:17.229 --> 01:48:17.239 align:start position:0%
um and so I'm trying
 
01:48:20.669 --> 01:48:20.679 align:start position:0%
to 20 students
 
01:48:25.109 --> 01:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
so so for the the proposed rule is
 
01:48:28.270 --> 01:48:28.280 align:start position:0%
titled ratios but then in it it has
 
01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:33.430 align:start position:0%
titled ratios but then in it it has
class

01:48:33.430 --> 01:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:35.870 --> 01:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
size I guess I'm trying to figure out
 
01:48:38.189 --> 01:48:38.199 align:start position:0%
whether using ratio yeah how how the how
 
01:48:40.189 --> 01:48:40.199 align:start position:0%
the ratio
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:10.990 --> 01:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
so so ju just looking at
 
01:49:13.350 --> 01:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
kindergarten kindergart or looking at
 
01:49:15.629 --> 01:49:15.639 align:start position:0%
the proposed A1 kindergarten through
 
01:49:18.589 --> 01:49:18.599 align:start position:0%
grades 2 25 students or fewer per
 
01:49:23.950 --> 01:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
educator so that would be a ratio of
 
01:49:28.149 --> 01:49:28.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:30.669 --> 01:49:30.679 align:start position:0%
fewer per
 
01:49:32.990 --> 01:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
educator so if you
 
01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:35.430 align:start position:0%
educator so if you
had

01:49:35.430 --> 01:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
had
 
01:49:38.750 --> 01:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
four sections of kindergart or four
 
01:49:41.070 --> 01:49:41.080 align:start position:0%
sections of grade two let's say you
 
01:49:44.830 --> 01:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
could have um two at 20 and two at
 
01:49:47.189 --> 01:49:47.199 align:start position:0%
30 and you'd have that you'd achieve
 
01:49:54.550 --> 01:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:57.070 --> 01:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm just just testing I think
 
01:49:57.080 --> 01:49:58.950 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm just just testing I think
that's

01:49:58.950 --> 01:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:50:02.669 --> 01:50:02.679 align:start position:0%
that yeah yeah as opposed to the current
 
01:50:05.550 --> 01:50:05.560 align:start position:0%
rule which would say 25 students or
 
01:50:07.109 --> 01:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
fewer per educator you're talking about
 
01:50:09.790 --> 01:50:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:12.310 --> 01:50:12.320 align:start position:0%
size so that means that if you have four
 
01:50:15.030 --> 01:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
sections of grade two um none of the
 
01:50:16.750 --> 01:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
sections would be able to be more than
 
01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:32.149 align:start position:0%
sections would be able to be more than
25

01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:35.990 --> 01:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
right doesn't the same apply under the
 
01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.229 align:start position:0%
right doesn't the same apply under the
current

01:50:38.229 --> 01:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:50:41.069 --> 01:50:41.079 align:start position:0%
30617 because it is based as we've said
 
01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
on a ratio that's not what not not not
 
01:50:47.310 --> 01:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
current 30617 it says class
 
01:50:50.109 --> 01:50:50.119 align:start position:0%
size right 25 students or fewer per
 
01:50:50.119 --> 01:50:52.830 align:start position:0%
size right 25 students or fewer per
educator

01:50:52.830 --> 01:50:52.840 align:start position:0%
educator
 
01:50:54.430 --> 01:50:54.440 align:start position:0%
right which
 
01:50:58.669 --> 01:50:58.679 align:start position:0%
is as opposed to a ratio right but the
 
01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
wording in kindergarten and grades 3
 
01:51:03.589 --> 01:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
through five one and two is exactly the
 
01:51:05.589 --> 01:51:05.599 align:start position:0%
same isn't it the wording the the
 
01:51:08.990 --> 01:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
wording is the same but but but the
 
01:51:13.830 --> 01:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
first part of one and two in the current
 
01:51:17.109 --> 01:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
rule referred to class size 25 students
 
01:51:21.109 --> 01:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
or fewer per educator in a class in the
 
01:51:24.510 --> 01:51:24.520 align:start position:0%
in the new one in the proposed one 25
 
01:51:27.149 --> 01:51:27.159 align:start position:0%
students or fewer per educator in the
 
01:51:31.229 --> 01:51:31.239 align:start position:0%
ratio so that would apply to all grades
 
01:51:33.910 --> 01:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
in a actually you could apply to the
 
01:51:36.229 --> 01:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
entire block of grades into kindergarten
 
01:51:38.830 --> 01:51:38.840 align:start position:0%
through grade two so if you had
 
01:51:42.270 --> 01:51:42.280 align:start position:0%
um you know if you had um you know two
 
01:51:44.510 --> 01:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
kindergartens two first grades and two
 
01:51:48.069 --> 01:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
second grades uh you could have so you
 
01:51:51.189 --> 01:51:51.199 align:start position:0%
know if if your you know kindergarten
 
01:51:53.430 --> 01:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
counts were
 
01:51:57.030 --> 01:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
you know say 15 you could have a a count
 
01:52:01.790 --> 01:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
of say 30 or 35 in grade too as long as
 
01:52:05.589 --> 01:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
you are over that over that BL over that
 
01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
that that grade range um achieving a
 
01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
ratio of 25 students or
 
01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
fewer that I mean that's how I read that
 
01:52:16.950 --> 01:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
so it's not limited to the class it's
 
01:52:20.669 --> 01:52:20.679 align:start position:0%
limited to the but the way I read it
 
01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
both are dealing with
 
01:52:26.390 --> 01:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
ratios and both have the exact same
 
01:52:29.310 --> 01:52:29.320 align:start position:0%
wording and that they shall stri strive
 
01:52:32.750 --> 01:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
to achieve the class size of 20 or
 
01:52:36.470 --> 01:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
however many um students or fewer per
 
01:52:40.750 --> 01:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
educator so I I I think um you know I'm
 
01:52:44.589 --> 01:52:44.599 align:start position:0%
not bothered by the fact that the title
 
01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
of um the section is changed from class
 
01:52:50.910 --> 01:52:50.920 align:start position:0%
size to educator ratios because it is
 
01:52:53.790 --> 01:52:53.800 align:start position:0%
based on ratios well then then given
 
01:52:55.270 --> 01:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
that why don't we go why don't we stick
 
01:52:58.470 --> 01:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
with the original language and then add
 
01:53:01.310 --> 01:53:01.320 align:start position:0%
um chair lad's suggestion to the end of
 
01:53:04.669 --> 01:53:04.679 align:start position:0%
of C going unless approved by the local
 
01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
you know unless um you know in you know
 
01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
higher number in a in a lab is approved
 
01:53:12.870 --> 01:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:15.910 --> 01:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
board they do use ratio again though in
 
01:53:18.550 --> 01:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
a the local school board shall establish
 
01:53:20.470 --> 01:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
student and will change it to teacher
 
01:53:23.229 --> 01:53:23.239 align:start position:0%
ratios that promote student but a and
 
01:53:25.069 --> 01:53:25.079 align:start position:0%
the original is class size for
 
01:53:26.990 --> 01:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
instructional purposes so they are
 
01:53:29.069 --> 01:53:29.079 align:start position:0%
changing it to ratio which means you can
 
01:53:30.510 --> 01:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
add up all the kids and grades
 
01:53:33.109 --> 01:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
kindergarten through two and divide them
 
01:53:34.910 --> 01:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
by the number of teachers and come out
 
01:53:36.870 --> 01:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
with a different number than what they
 
01:53:40.350 --> 01:53:40.360 align:start position:0%
really are in CL ratio instead of size
 
01:53:43.030 --> 01:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
yeah but they shall strive to achieve
 
01:53:45.430 --> 01:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
the class size of 20 students or fewer
 
01:53:47.350 --> 01:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
per educator but that's aspirational
 
01:53:48.830 --> 01:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
that's not that's not a request right
 
01:53:51.270 --> 01:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
but it's still aspirational and
 
01:53:53.950 --> 01:53:53.960 align:start position:0%
current yeah the the 20 number is
 
01:53:57.189 --> 01:53:57.199 align:start position:0%
aspiration the 25 number in the current
 
01:54:00.550 --> 01:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
rule is a hard maximum for the number of
 
01:54:04.550 --> 01:54:04.560 align:start position:0%
students per per educator in a classroom
 
01:54:08.069 --> 01:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
in the new rule it means averaged over
 
01:54:11.669 --> 01:54:11.679 align:start position:0%
the entire uh group of of classrooms
 
01:54:15.109 --> 01:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
kindergarten through grades two um just
 
01:54:17.229 --> 01:54:17.239 align:start position:0%
like what what represent Cornell said
 
01:54:18.990 --> 01:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
you add up all the kids and you divide
 
01:54:22.030 --> 01:54:22.040 align:start position:0%
it by the number of teachers in those 10
 
01:54:24.750 --> 01:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
classes rooms and it has to be 25 or
 
01:54:26.189 --> 01:54:26.199 align:start position:0%
less but it doesn't mean that any
 
01:54:29.830 --> 01:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
classroom couldn't necessarily have 40
 
01:54:33.030 --> 01:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:35.589 --> 01:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
it that's the difference between ratio
 
01:54:39.870 --> 01:54:39.880 align:start position:0%
and and hard stop class
 
01:54:42.990 --> 01:54:43.000 align:start position:0%
size but if you're talking about let's
 
01:54:47.270 --> 01:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
say uh three sections of 60 students uh
 
01:54:49.510 --> 01:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
do you think that the um administration
 
01:54:53.270 --> 01:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
of the school is going to put um 40 in
 
01:54:55.830 --> 01:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
one class and 10 in each of the other
 
01:54:55.840 --> 01:54:57.149 align:start position:0%
one class and 10 in each of the other
two

01:54:57.149 --> 01:54:57.159 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:54:59.870 --> 01:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
classes yeah yeah I mean I'm not this is
 
01:55:02.550 --> 01:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
this is a rule this um this why we have
 
01:55:04.669 --> 01:55:04.679 align:start position:0%
rules you know
 
01:55:06.870 --> 01:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
um that's why we have minimum standard
 
01:55:08.470 --> 01:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
it's not that I think a principle is
 
01:55:10.669 --> 01:55:10.679 align:start position:0%
going to going to do this but if we're
 
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
going to have a rule that that where
 
01:55:15.069 --> 01:55:15.079 align:start position:0%
you're expecting that class sizes are
 
01:55:17.790 --> 01:55:17.800 align:start position:0%
not going to be greater than 25 then
 
01:55:25.350 --> 01:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:27.990 --> 01:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
but class sizes change during the course
 
01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
of the Year depending on students coming
 
01:55:34.470 --> 01:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
and going as well so mid year or in uh
 
01:55:38.709 --> 01:55:38.719 align:start position:0%
December um if three kids who are in um
 
01:55:40.470 --> 01:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
section A
 
01:55:44.390 --> 01:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
leave um do you have to rebalance then
 
01:55:46.950 --> 01:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
um all the uh class
 
01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
sizes I I actually I think that's a
 
01:55:53.669 --> 01:55:53.679 align:start position:0%
great question and how is that
 
01:55:55.550 --> 01:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
I mean we've got some Educators here in
 
01:55:58.470 --> 01:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
the room that probably could answer
 
01:56:02.470 --> 01:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
that you know the the issue of this
 
01:56:05.870 --> 01:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
issue as a school principal for
 
01:56:09.910 --> 01:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
years was always a tough one from the
 
01:56:13.109 --> 01:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
standpoint that class and we had four at
 
01:56:14.830 --> 01:56:14.840 align:start position:0%
each grade level in this particular
 
01:56:17.430 --> 01:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
building I'm talking about but the
 
01:56:20.189 --> 01:56:20.199 align:start position:0%
fluctuations in students went anywhere
 
01:56:23.830 --> 01:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
from a 100 students per grade level mhm
 
01:56:27.830 --> 01:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
to maybe 65 70 depending upon the year
 
01:56:30.790 --> 01:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
mhm and so then you end up having to
 
01:56:32.229 --> 01:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
make these
 
01:56:33.950 --> 01:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
decisions are you going to have a
 
01:56:37.109 --> 01:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
combination classroom now of A and B at
 
01:56:40.270 --> 01:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
grade level grade one and two
 
01:56:44.149 --> 01:56:44.159 align:start position:0%
um and you know it it really impacted
 
01:56:47.030 --> 01:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
your instruction and your curriculum oh
 
01:56:50.310 --> 01:56:50.320 align:start position:0%
yeah for you had have people that were
 
01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
real good at being able to work
 
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
individually with students or had a good
 
01:56:57.470 --> 01:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
handle on especially when you I always
 
01:56:59.430 --> 01:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
found that really tough when I started
 
01:57:03.310 --> 01:57:03.320 align:start position:0%
getting um in the Upper Elementary
 
01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
grades the intermediate levels and above
 
01:57:07.390 --> 01:57:07.400 align:start position:0%
when we were starting to have some
 
01:57:08.629 --> 01:57:08.639 align:start position:0%
subjects that
 
01:57:08.639 --> 01:57:10.550 align:start position:0%
subjects that
were

01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:57:13.149 --> 01:57:13.159 align:start position:0%
pre we were using saxs and math we get
 
01:57:17.629 --> 01:57:17.639 align:start position:0%
pre-algebra MH and and so it it's it's
 
01:57:21.030 --> 01:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
it's a huge issue and you know you're
 
01:57:23.229 --> 01:57:23.239 align:start position:0%
going to have a huge class piling in
 
01:57:27.270 --> 01:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
after this one class goes through do you
 
01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
do you can people or do you try to make
 
01:57:32.550 --> 01:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
it work well I think what what what we
 
01:57:35.550 --> 01:57:35.560 align:start position:0%
saw when I was on the board was um was
 
01:57:39.629 --> 01:57:39.639 align:start position:0%
if you had say u a large um uh
 
01:57:42.030 --> 01:57:42.040 align:start position:0%
enrollment in in grade two let's say
 
01:57:44.709 --> 01:57:44.719 align:start position:0%
there was 100 kids and then in grade one
 
01:57:47.629 --> 01:57:47.639 align:start position:0%
maybe there were 80 kids that um that
 
01:57:51.270 --> 01:57:51.280 align:start position:0%
you had um you had you know uh four
 
01:57:54.790 --> 01:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
sections and grades two and well say
 
01:57:56.870 --> 01:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
five sections in grade two four sections
 
01:57:59.470 --> 01:57:59.480 align:start position:0%
in in grade one and
 
01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%
then the following year you would you
 
01:58:05.990 --> 01:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
would you would you know increase maybe
 
01:58:07.629 --> 01:58:07.639 align:start position:0%
have an additional section in grade
 
01:58:10.350 --> 01:58:10.360 align:start position:0%
three and have one less section in grade
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
two to correspond to the the popul the
 
01:58:17.669 --> 01:58:17.679 align:start position:0%
enrollment moving through um but but I
 
01:58:19.870 --> 01:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
hear what you're saying too about about
 
01:58:22.430 --> 01:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
midyear changes people move in people
 
01:58:24.830 --> 01:58:24.840 align:start position:0%
move out and if you're right at the
 
01:58:27.910 --> 01:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
right at the limit um that could um
 
01:58:30.589 --> 01:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
create some problems I don't remember
 
01:58:32.510 --> 01:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
what I mean I'm sure we had these things
 
01:58:37.149 --> 01:58:37.159 align:start position:0%
come to the board um uh I'm I'm I'm
 
01:58:38.550 --> 01:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
actually sort of looking at Becky
 
01:58:40.229 --> 01:58:40.239 align:start position:0%
because she was at a lot of these board
 
01:58:43.109 --> 01:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
meetings and and I don't recall what
 
01:58:45.589 --> 01:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
what we did if we if the board had the
 
01:58:50.390 --> 01:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
authority to Grant the superintendent um
 
01:58:53.750 --> 01:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh space there I I don't remember what
 
01:59:22.669 --> 01:59:22.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:26.109 --> 01:59:26.119 align:start position:0%
start in SEP with 25 students all
 
01:59:30.189 --> 01:59:30.199 align:start position:0%
classes do liity
 
01:59:33.030 --> 01:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
toate so I think that is why
 
01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
mosts take the
 
01:59:39.870 --> 01:59:39.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:42.990 --> 01:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
number okay great no that that helps a
 
01:59:45.510 --> 01:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
lot and I was a principal in a community
 
01:59:48.470 --> 01:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
where we had a large Coast Guard
 
01:59:50.390 --> 01:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
contingency and we had these folks
 
01:59:52.669 --> 01:59:52.679 align:start position:0%
moving in at those weird weird times in
 
01:59:56.189 --> 01:59:56.199 align:start position:0%
a school year and we could see six or
 
01:59:58.470 --> 01:59:58.480 align:start position:0%
seven eight kids leave just like that
 
02:00:01.669 --> 02:00:01.679 align:start position:0%
and and come in and we might have 15 new
 
02:00:04.149 --> 02:00:04.159 align:start position:0%
ones coming in so you you have to have
 
02:00:06.870 --> 02:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
some flexibility you strive to do these
 
02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:09.679 align:start position:0%
things but
 
02:00:12.470 --> 02:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
um you know that's why you know being a
 
02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
teacher is so important you know that
 
02:00:18.149 --> 02:00:18.159 align:start position:0%
you you know there are are some teachers
 
02:00:20.030 --> 02:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
that can handle larger numbers others
 
02:00:23.510 --> 02:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
cannot that's a given and because of
 
02:00:25.870 --> 02:00:25.880 align:start position:0%
their experience and quote
 
02:00:25.880 --> 02:00:27.510 align:start position:0%
their experience and quote
wisdom

02:00:27.510 --> 02:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
wisdom
 
02:00:31.189 --> 02:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
um and discipline all all that comes in
 
02:00:34.709 --> 02:00:34.719 align:start position:0%
hand and as a principle you know where
 
02:00:36.350 --> 02:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
where your strengths and weaknesses are
 
02:00:38.990 --> 02:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
within the school I there's got to be
 
02:00:41.350 --> 02:00:41.360 align:start position:0%
flexibility here that we're going to
 
02:00:43.910 --> 02:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
give the school I don't I don't know if
 
02:00:47.189 --> 02:00:47.199 align:start position:0%
that having a class size is a firm
 
02:00:47.199 --> 02:00:48.990 align:start position:0%
that having a class size is a firm
boom

02:00:48.990 --> 02:00:49.000 align:start position:0%
boom
 
02:00:52.550 --> 02:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
um unless there is some exception
 
02:01:01.790 --> 02:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:05.470 --> 02:01:05.480 align:start position:0%
size teacher education ratios I can't
 
02:01:08.229 --> 02:01:08.239 align:start position:0%
imagine any Elementary principle loading
 
02:01:12.030 --> 02:01:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:14.790 --> 02:01:14.800 align:start position:0%
kindergarten what that would do
 
02:01:19.229 --> 02:01:19.239 align:start position:0%
that it if it's it may not be
 
02:01:22.310 --> 02:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
well depends on if your budget gets cut
 
02:01:22.320 --> 02:01:24.990 align:start position:0%
well depends on if your budget gets cut
10%

02:01:24.990 --> 02:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
10%
 
02:01:27.830 --> 02:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
yeah well then it's on the school board
 
02:01:34.350 --> 02:01:34.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:39.629 --> 02:01:39.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:42.390 --> 02:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
this I was coming from the standpoint I
 
02:01:44.629 --> 02:01:44.639 align:start position:0%
want to make sure absolutely sure that
 
02:01:46.510 --> 02:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
the person that's teaching that class is
 
02:01:48.109 --> 02:01:48.119 align:start position:0%
a certified
 
02:01:50.550 --> 02:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
teacher one so that's why I wanted to
 
02:01:53.629 --> 02:01:53.639 align:start position:0%
use the student teacher ratio and change
 
02:01:56.189 --> 02:01:56.199 align:start position:0%
it from educator to teacher and
 
02:01:58.430 --> 02:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
duplicate what we did in that committee
 
02:02:00.709 --> 02:02:00.719 align:start position:0%
report and how we're funding education
 
02:02:00.719 --> 02:02:02.350 align:start position:0%
report and how we're funding education
be

02:02:02.350 --> 02:02:02.360 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:02:04.990 --> 02:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
consistent um I wasn't looking at you
 
02:02:07.109 --> 02:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
know I did look at class size and at one
 
02:02:08.790 --> 02:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
point in time I even tried to change the
 
02:02:11.310 --> 02:02:11.320 align:start position:0%
title when I was looking at this student
 
02:02:13.870 --> 02:02:13.880 align:start position:0%
teacher classroom
 
02:02:16.709 --> 02:02:16.719 align:start position:0%
ratios uh but then there's a lot of
 
02:02:18.149 --> 02:02:18.159 align:start position:0%
people that are working in those
 
02:02:20.350 --> 02:02:20.360 align:start position:0%
classrooms that aren't the primary
 
02:02:22.750 --> 02:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
classroom teacher mhm that you got to
 
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
count to the music teacher the PE
 
02:02:27.069 --> 02:02:27.079 align:start position:0%
teacher and etc
 
02:02:29.629 --> 02:02:29.639 align:start position:0%
etc the
 
02:02:33.550 --> 02:02:33.560 align:start position:0%
nurse so so
 
02:02:37.109 --> 02:02:37.119 align:start position:0%
um in the um in in in both the current
 
02:02:39.750 --> 02:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
rule class size in the proposed rule
 
02:02:42.629 --> 02:02:42.639 align:start position:0%
ratio there's there's a there's a
 
02:02:44.870 --> 02:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
paragraph B which is sort of a circuit
 
02:02:47.950 --> 02:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
breaker um class size requirements may
 
02:02:51.830 --> 02:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
be exceeded or ratios may be exceeded uh
 
02:02:53.550 --> 02:02:53.560 align:start position:0%
study halls band course other types of
 
02:02:54.830 --> 02:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
large group
 
02:02:57.589 --> 02:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
instruction um so you know you've got a
 
02:02:59.790 --> 02:02:59.800 align:start position:0%
high school teacher that that says Hey I
 
02:03:03.950 --> 02:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
want to do a class on this and uh 40
 
02:03:06.830 --> 02:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
kids sign up you know what Full Speed
 
02:03:08.790 --> 02:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
Ahead so
 
02:03:14.629 --> 02:03:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:17.149 --> 02:03:17.159 align:start position:0%
I you're reading that for which grade
 
02:03:19.030 --> 02:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
for high school right well I think
 
02:03:20.990 --> 02:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
that's where you're going to see large
 
02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
group instruct
 
02:03:24.990 --> 02:03:25.000 align:start position:0%
lectures things like that Larry bford
 
02:03:26.910 --> 02:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
used to say give me 100 kids that want
 
02:03:28.350 --> 02:03:28.360 align:start position:0%
to take calculus and we'll teach it in
 
02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:48.030 --> 02:03:48.040 align:start position:0%
um so I think you've got that circuit
 
02:03:51.790 --> 02:03:51.800 align:start position:0%
breaker that applies at the at the older
 
02:03:55.910 --> 02:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
raade levels uh but for the uh the the
 
02:04:00.030 --> 02:04:00.040 align:start position:0%
K what's the range the sort of K5 K2 and
 
02:04:04.390 --> 02:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:08.189 --> 02:04:08.199 align:start position:0%
five the class size thing works pretty
 
02:04:10.310 --> 02:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
well and I like the explanation that
 
02:04:13.790 --> 02:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
that principles are striving towards
 
02:04:16.270 --> 02:04:16.280 align:start position:0%
that towards the recommended number and
 
02:04:18.189 --> 02:04:18.199 align:start position:0%
that provides that flexibility I mean
 
02:04:22.109 --> 02:04:22.119 align:start position:0%
you you'd have to see a u 25% increase
 
02:04:24.709 --> 02:04:24.719 align:start position:0%
in your student enrollment to over a
 
02:04:37.629 --> 02:04:37.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:41.910 --> 02:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
budget well maybe um as in the uh
 
02:04:41.920 --> 02:04:43.790 align:start position:0%
budget well maybe um as in the uh
current

02:04:43.790 --> 02:04:43.800 align:start position:0%
current
 
02:04:46.310 --> 02:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
30617 uh class size for instructional
 
02:05:07.229 --> 02:05:07.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:11.790 --> 02:05:11.800 align:start position:0%
see on the on uh the class size side
 
02:05:15.390 --> 02:05:15.400 align:start position:0%
30617 which is there and the what's
 
02:05:18.870 --> 02:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
being proposed in 314 it says grades 3
 
02:05:22.189 --> 02:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
through five then it goes on then over
 
02:05:24.910 --> 02:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
here it says middle and Senior High
 
02:05:27.470 --> 02:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
School does that include grades four
 
02:05:30.030 --> 02:05:30.040 align:start position:0%
five that are down below can I go either
 
02:05:32.790 --> 02:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
way with my you know I have a school
 
02:05:36.189 --> 02:05:36.199 align:start position:0%
that's K through or you know up to grade
 
02:05:39.510 --> 02:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
eight and the wing is fourth grade
 
02:05:43.390 --> 02:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
through 8th grade is the Middle School
 
02:05:46.270 --> 02:05:46.280 align:start position:0%
Wing how many kids do I have to have my
 
02:05:49.310 --> 02:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
my classrooms in the fourth
 
02:05:52.510 --> 02:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
grade can I have the ratio or am I going
 
02:05:54.270 --> 02:05:54.280 align:start position:0%
to get the class size but I'm going to
 
02:05:58.950 --> 02:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
choose to do the class size for grade
 
02:06:01.510 --> 02:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
four and another guy down the road or
 
02:06:03.109 --> 02:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
gal might say well I'm going to take the
 
02:06:07.069 --> 02:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
Middle School ratio which is 30 m for
 
02:06:10.069 --> 02:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:13.510 --> 02:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
mhm yeah I I don't know I don't think
 
02:06:16.549 --> 02:06:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:18.990 --> 02:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
that I mean how's that done how's that
 
02:06:21.870 --> 02:06:21.880 align:start position:0%
done today put that as a question yeah I
 
02:06:21.880 --> 02:06:24.069 align:start position:0%
done today put that as a question yeah I
mean

02:06:24.069 --> 02:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
mean
 
02:06:26.709 --> 02:06:26.719 align:start position:0%
yeah because we do we do provide
 
02:06:35.990 --> 02:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:38.709 --> 02:06:38.719 align:start position:0%
levels so does anybody there have any
 
02:06:40.910 --> 02:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
help for us those those that are in you
 
02:06:44.950 --> 02:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
know the middle school grades but also
 
02:06:47.229 --> 02:06:47.239 align:start position:0%
considered grades at the elementary
 
02:06:50.149 --> 02:06:50.159 align:start position:0%
which ratio do they go by or which class
 
02:07:04.990 --> 02:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:11.270 --> 02:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:11.280 --> 02:07:18.149 align:start position:0%
 
that's

02:07:18.149 --> 02:07:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:20.229 --> 02:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
imagine yeah
 
02:07:22.510 --> 02:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
02:07:25.549 --> 02:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
so you Beck you know hail middle school
 
02:07:29.750 --> 02:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
and that is grades 4 through eight
 
02:07:32.109 --> 02:07:32.119 align:start position:0%
separate building from K through three
 
02:07:34.990 --> 02:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
down in Woodsville so grade four they
 
02:07:45.310 --> 02:07:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:52.990 --> 02:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:55.149 --> 02:07:55.159 align:start position:0%
yeah do we need more discussion on this
 
02:07:58.669 --> 02:07:58.679 align:start position:0%
one with them
 
02:08:01.470 --> 02:08:01.480 align:start position:0%
doe as we did there there's going to be
 
02:08:03.109 --> 02:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
a couple areas here which are going to
 
02:08:06.030 --> 02:08:06.040 align:start position:0%
require this is one of the conflict
 
02:08:08.669 --> 02:08:08.679 align:start position:0%
areas right here I I I think so too and
 
02:08:10.669 --> 02:08:10.679 align:start position:0%
and and you know I think better
 
02:08:12.750 --> 02:08:12.760 align:start position:0%
understanding why why they're why
 
02:08:14.709 --> 02:08:14.719 align:start position:0%
they're suggesting moving from size to
 
02:08:18.229 --> 02:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
ratio I mean what's what's the the the
 
02:08:21.109 --> 02:08:21.119 align:start position:0%
rationale for making that change cuz I
 
02:08:22.790 --> 02:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
you know seems like a lot of the
 
02:08:24.830 --> 02:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
feedback we've got is you're changing
 
02:08:29.390 --> 02:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
class size um we I would need to hear a
 
02:08:32.069 --> 02:08:32.079 align:start position:0%
really really compelling reason to move
 
02:08:36.069 --> 02:08:36.079 align:start position:0%
from class size to ratio and I'm I I'm
 
02:08:37.950 --> 02:08:37.960 align:start position:0%
not hearing any around this table and I
 
02:08:40.030 --> 02:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
think we sort of keep getting back to
 
02:08:43.510 --> 02:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that that that you can the
 
02:08:45.510 --> 02:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
flexibility that princip that building
 
02:08:48.270 --> 02:08:48.280 align:start position:0%
principles need is inherent in the
 
02:08:52.350 --> 02:08:52.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:55.189 --> 02:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
strive to 20 you've got the flexibility
 
02:08:59.149 --> 02:08:59.159 align:start position:0%
to get to 25 if you know you you see a
 
02:09:02.830 --> 02:09:02.840 align:start position:0%
25% or yeah 25% increase in your
 
02:09:06.189 --> 02:09:06.199 align:start position:0%
four classrooms
 
02:09:09.430 --> 02:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
so and and again midd Senior High School
 
02:09:11.750 --> 02:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
30 students or fewer per educator it
 
02:09:15.069 --> 02:09:15.079 align:start position:0%
doesn't say per class per class size it
 
02:09:16.430 --> 02:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
says Ed per
 
02:09:18.589 --> 02:09:18.599 align:start position:0%
educator so does that mean that it could
 
02:09:20.310 --> 02:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
be the teacher and the par professional
 
02:09:23.830 --> 02:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:26.350 --> 02:09:26.360 align:start position:0%
your well that's exactly why I wanted to
 
02:09:29.510 --> 02:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
have a say teacher
 
02:09:32.589 --> 02:09:32.599 align:start position:0%
ratio that's exactly why I was going
 
02:09:34.709 --> 02:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
over there with that
 
02:09:39.030 --> 02:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
one and the and the teacher referenc in
 
02:09:42.030 --> 02:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
those statutes we re referenc for
 
02:09:42.040 --> 02:09:43.910 align:start position:0%
those statutes we re referenc for
defining

02:09:43.910 --> 02:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
defining
 
02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
educator and there's good rationale
 
02:09:47.990 --> 02:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
behind saying student teacher ratio
 
02:09:52.390 --> 02:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:54.510 --> 02:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
so let's let's
 
02:09:56.990 --> 02:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
um I'll put the communication out with
 
02:09:59.189 --> 02:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
them that we want to
 
02:10:01.709 --> 02:10:01.719 align:start position:0%
discuss size to
 
02:10:06.229 --> 02:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
ratio um and get the rationale for
 
02:10:09.549 --> 02:10:09.559 align:start position:0%
it uh more can we all agree though on
 
02:10:13.109 --> 02:10:13.119 align:start position:0%
one other thing that um that the last
 
02:10:17.030 --> 02:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
wording in that last item there uh
 
02:10:20.629 --> 02:10:20.639 align:start position:0%
regarding the Laboratories that the if
 
02:10:22.350 --> 02:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
there's except that has to be approved
 
02:10:25.069 --> 02:10:25.079 align:start position:0%
by the local school board I'm fine with
 
02:10:28.109 --> 02:10:28.119 align:start position:0%
that yeah they're responsible for safety
 
02:10:30.830 --> 02:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
and all that yeah I'd be okay okay we're
 
02:10:32.910 --> 02:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
okay with that so that so we got talk
 
02:10:35.310 --> 02:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
about class size and student ratio still
 
02:10:38.350 --> 02:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
and also I think we talked about 30608
 
02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
whether that's uh related directly to uh
 
02:10:48.910 --> 02:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
libraries media centers or yeah y yeah
 
02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
and I just checked in with Manchester
 
02:10:53.629 --> 02:10:53.639 align:start position:0%
while we talking and they keep the ratio
 
02:10:56.830 --> 02:10:56.840 align:start position:0%
or the class size K through 4 is 20 and
 
02:11:03.030 --> 02:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:07.149 --> 02:11:07.159 align:start position:0%
Manchester Manchester is what okay 20
 
02:11:10.790 --> 02:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
okay K through 4 is 20 students per
 
02:11:14.350 --> 02:11:14.360 align:start position:0%
class yeah and K through 12 is
 
02:11:17.750 --> 02:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
25 and that's the way it is that's what
 
02:11:19.629 --> 02:11:19.639 align:start position:0%
they I hear all the time from your
 
02:11:22.109 --> 02:11:22.119 align:start position:0%
Senator that we're talking and 28 kids
 
02:11:23.750 --> 02:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
in a
 
02:11:26.990 --> 02:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
classroom no in
 
02:11:32.629 --> 02:11:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:36.430 --> 02:11:36.440 align:start position:0%
news so Mr chairman I'm hearing that uh
 
02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
we'll need another meeting with the
 
02:11:42.549 --> 02:11:42.559 align:start position:0%
Department staff yeah on the several
 
02:11:48.189 --> 02:11:48.199 align:start position:0%
issues right um and um given that we
 
02:11:49.750 --> 02:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
have another meeting at
 
02:11:52.470 --> 02:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
1:00 could we
 
02:11:56.510 --> 02:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
um maybe call it for this meeting and
 
02:11:58.549 --> 02:11:58.559 align:start position:0%
schedule that I'd like to yes I think
 
02:12:01.510 --> 02:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
it's wise but there's one other major
 
02:12:03.310 --> 02:12:03.320 align:start position:0%
issue which is going to come up here and
 
02:12:05.669 --> 02:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
that's the last portion
 
02:12:08.229 --> 02:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
here um dealing
 
02:12:12.790 --> 02:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
with the issue of academic
 
02:12:16.030 --> 02:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
standards and Frameworks curriculum
 
02:12:19.350 --> 02:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
Frameworks where are the academic
 
02:12:22.109 --> 02:12:22.119 align:start position:0%
standards is my question question are
 
02:12:26.189 --> 02:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
the Frameworks academic standards or are
 
02:12:31.229 --> 02:12:31.239 align:start position:0%
the Frameworks built upon the academic
 
02:12:34.669 --> 02:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:39.589 --> 02:12:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:42.390 --> 02:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
be I went and asked people across the
 
02:12:44.870 --> 02:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
street regarding
 
02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:47.229 align:start position:0%
street regarding
this

02:12:47.229 --> 02:12:47.239 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:12:49.270 --> 02:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
and they're going to have to reference
 
02:12:51.350 --> 02:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
these curriculum Frameworks which were
 
02:12:53.510 --> 02:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
in place prior
 
02:12:58.950 --> 02:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
to our changing a funding back in 20072
 
02:13:02.069 --> 02:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
2008 and before we had the substantive
 
02:13:04.310 --> 02:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
criteria for an adequate education that
 
02:13:08.229 --> 02:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
was defined first time in Statute in
 
02:13:11.709 --> 02:13:11.719 align:start position:0%
2008 as a result of the recommendation
 
02:13:13.669 --> 02:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
that came out of that committee and the
 
02:13:15.470 --> 02:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
bill which was introduced in the session
 
02:13:15.480 --> 02:13:18.229 align:start position:0%
bill which was introduced in the session
of

02:13:18.229 --> 02:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:21.470 --> 02:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
2007 so that's when adequacy came in
 
02:13:25.350 --> 02:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
place and the ad the academic standards
 
02:13:30.149 --> 02:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
are referencing those paragraph one of
 
02:13:31.790 --> 02:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
RSA 193
 
02:13:36.270 --> 02:13:36.280 align:start position:0%
e2a which are those 11 subject
 
02:13:39.270 --> 02:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
areas so the academic standards
 
02:13:42.270 --> 02:13:42.280 align:start position:0%
reference those but those didn't come
 
02:13:44.589 --> 02:13:44.599 align:start position:0%
into being until
 
02:13:48.589 --> 02:13:48.599 align:start position:0%
2008 so curriculum Frameworks were in
 
02:13:52.390 --> 02:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
place well before that
 
02:13:57.589 --> 02:13:57.599 align:start position:0%
um so were the Frameworks built upon
 
02:14:00.709 --> 02:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
what academic
 
02:14:00.719 --> 02:14:03.629 align:start position:0%
what academic
standards

02:14:03.629 --> 02:14:03.639 align:start position:0%
standards
 
02:14:07.390 --> 02:14:07.400 align:start position:0%
I I I we were talking about this earlier
 
02:14:12.750 --> 02:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
this morning um last week uh I think I
 
02:14:16.390 --> 02:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
heard the commissioner refer
 
02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
to the curriculum
 
02:14:22.790 --> 02:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
Frameworks as as synonymous with
 
02:14:25.149 --> 02:14:25.159 align:start position:0%
academic standards that that you could
 
02:14:29.229 --> 02:14:29.239 align:start position:0%
interchange those those two terms but I
 
02:14:32.750 --> 02:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
think on on further conversation with
 
02:14:35.830 --> 02:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
with you um chair lad uh is that there
 
02:14:37.990 --> 02:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
are two different things the Frameworks
 
02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:38.950 align:start position:0%
are two different things the Frameworks
actually

02:14:38.950 --> 02:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:14:42.149 --> 02:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
include uh a
 
02:14:45.910 --> 02:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
um like how to build a curriculum um or
 
02:14:48.189 --> 02:14:48.199 align:start position:0%
or a certain type of curriculum onto it
 
02:14:51.549 --> 02:14:51.559 align:start position:0%
and include academic standards so uh
 
02:14:56.870 --> 02:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
I'll be honest I'm I I don't know either
 
02:15:00.109 --> 02:15:00.119 align:start position:0%
um still have I guess haven't found
 
02:15:03.189 --> 02:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
where the academic standards are okay on
 
02:15:04.629 --> 02:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
the bottom page three in that right hand
 
02:15:06.390 --> 02:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
column we have about five or 10 minutes
 
02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
here it says right down the bottom there
 
02:15:14.470 --> 02:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
it says during the 2007 session HB
 
02:15:17.589 --> 02:15:17.599 align:start position:0%
927 relative to the specific criteria in
 
02:15:19.589 --> 02:15:19.599 align:start position:0%
substitute education program that
 
02:15:23.189 --> 02:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
defines an adequate education was
 
02:15:25.270 --> 02:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
written and signed in law identifying
 
02:15:27.109 --> 02:15:27.119 align:start position:0%
that the curriculum framework shall
 
02:15:28.390 --> 02:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
present the
 
02:15:32.629 --> 02:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
goals skills competencies and knowledge
 
02:15:34.950 --> 02:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
called for by the academic standards for
 
02:15:36.390 --> 02:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
each area of
 
02:15:39.069 --> 02:15:39.079 align:start position:0%
Education the goals reference in the
 
02:15:42.430 --> 02:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
Frameworks are the academic standards
 
02:15:45.750 --> 02:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
that now that's my assumption what I'm
 
02:15:48.470 --> 02:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
hearing therefore Frameworks are used as
 
02:15:50.750 --> 02:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
ghouls to guide classroom instruction
 
02:15:53.149 --> 02:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
and assessments and to ensure that all
 
02:15:56.030 --> 02:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
students learn the same core skills it
 
02:15:57.589 --> 02:15:57.599 align:start position:0%
is then understood that through
 
02:15:59.549 --> 02:15:59.559 align:start position:0%
reference the curriculum Frameworks are
 
02:16:02.589 --> 02:16:02.599 align:start position:0%
an integral part to proposed 306 rules
 
02:16:06.270 --> 02:16:06.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:09.669 --> 02:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
process this is a huge
 
02:16:12.589 --> 02:16:12.599 align:start position:0%
change because if you're going to
 
02:16:17.069 --> 02:16:17.079 align:start position:0%
change Frameworks are you in impacting
 
02:16:21.750 --> 02:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:23.589 --> 02:16:23.599 align:start position:0%
so where where did this where did this
 
02:16:25.390 --> 02:16:25.400 align:start position:0%
text that you just read come from I
 
02:16:29.510 --> 02:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
wrote it okay but goals sometimes what
 
02:16:32.469 --> 02:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
your goal is is all sometimes if you
 
02:16:36.070 --> 02:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
look it up academic standards are a
 
02:16:40.830 --> 02:16:40.840 align:start position:0%
goal well you Frameworks you yeah I mean
 
02:16:42.589 --> 02:16:42.599 align:start position:0%
we need more about Frameworks yeah yeah
 
02:16:45.790 --> 02:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
and you said HB 927 basically had the
 
02:16:48.669 --> 02:16:48.679 align:start position:0%
the the um the goals referenced by the
 
02:16:51.910 --> 02:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
Frameworks are the academic standards
 
02:16:56.910 --> 02:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
no that's not from 9:27 what is in that
 
02:16:59.030 --> 02:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
is the sentence
 
02:16:59.040 --> 02:17:01.070 align:start position:0%
is the sentence
that

02:17:01.070 --> 02:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:17:03.830 --> 02:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
um the curriculum framework shall
 
02:17:06.110 --> 02:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
present the goals
 
02:17:08.629 --> 02:17:08.639 align:start position:0%
skills competencies and knowledge called
 
02:17:11.389 --> 02:17:11.399 align:start position:0%
for by the academic standards for each
 
02:17:13.790 --> 02:17:13.800 align:start position:0%
area of Education that you know they're
 
02:17:15.509 --> 02:17:15.519 align:start position:0%
talking about paragraph
 
02:17:18.750 --> 02:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
one the rest is your the rest is my
 
02:17:21.950 --> 02:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
commentary okay and my thinking
 
02:17:26.070 --> 02:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
but the the goals it says the goals
 
02:17:29.549 --> 02:17:29.559 align:start position:0%
skills competencies and
 
02:17:32.750 --> 02:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
knowledge are any one of those areas
 
02:17:35.990 --> 02:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
that we just I talked about are those
 
02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
called academic standards I don't think
 
02:17:41.589 --> 02:17:41.599 align:start position:0%
competencies are I would say no uh
 
02:17:45.990 --> 02:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge no skills no goals
 
02:17:48.709 --> 02:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
possibly as part of the framework as
 
02:17:50.990 --> 02:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
academic standards
 
02:17:53.589 --> 02:17:53.599 align:start position:0%
okay they're part of the framework now
 
02:17:55.830 --> 02:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
if if that's the interpretation now I
 
02:17:58.150 --> 02:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
went over the research and I said okay
 
02:18:01.230 --> 02:18:01.240 align:start position:0%
give me as much as you have on 97 what
 
02:18:06.790 --> 02:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
is it HB 978 927 927 they did but then
 
02:18:10.030 --> 02:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
the next question is when did curriculum
 
02:18:13.270 --> 02:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
Frameworks come to be were they in
 
02:18:15.549 --> 02:18:15.559 align:start position:0%
statute prior to that and what was the
 
02:18:17.790 --> 02:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
rationale or the intent of curriculum
 
02:18:20.190 --> 02:18:20.200 align:start position:0%
Frameworks to be built on academic
 
02:18:21.910 --> 02:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
standards that they are academic
 
02:18:24.790 --> 02:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:27.150 --> 02:18:27.160 align:start position:0%
know I've never been able to find
 
02:18:29.910 --> 02:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
academic standards written
 
02:18:36.709 --> 02:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:38.870 --> 02:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
Frameworks but that needs clarification
 
02:18:41.030 --> 02:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
but they are referenced independent of
 
02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:42.070 align:start position:0%
but they are referenced independent of
the

02:18:42.070 --> 02:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:18:45.070 --> 02:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
Frameworks academic standards they are
 
02:18:45.080 --> 02:18:46.830 align:start position:0%
Frameworks academic standards they are
in

02:18:46.830 --> 02:18:46.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:18:49.190 --> 02:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
law they're rep they're called academic
 
02:18:54.110 --> 02:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:56.629 --> 02:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
Frameworks it says the
 
02:19:00.190 --> 02:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
goals skipping all the other stuff
 
02:19:03.629 --> 02:19:03.639 align:start position:0%
goals are called for by the academic
 
02:19:06.589 --> 02:19:06.599 align:start position:0%
standards for each area of Education the
 
02:19:09.230 --> 02:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
goal skills competencies
 
02:19:12.110 --> 02:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
knowledge that's all that's in in the
 
02:19:14.830 --> 02:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
that bill that was back in
 
02:19:17.389 --> 02:19:17.399 align:start position:0%
2007 and now we've echoed that and put
 
02:19:19.230 --> 02:19:19.240 align:start position:0%
it back in the
 
02:19:23.349 --> 02:19:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:26.309 --> 02:19:26.319 align:start position:0%
mhm but I don't I don't know if if you
 
02:19:28.429 --> 02:19:28.439 align:start position:0%
have these academic standards separate
 
02:19:31.950 --> 02:19:31.960 align:start position:0%
from and they align they direct what
 
02:19:34.030 --> 02:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to do in your
 
02:19:36.750 --> 02:19:36.760 align:start position:0%
curriculum your curriculum has you might
 
02:19:38.150 --> 02:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
have a curriculum that's way different
 
02:19:40.549 --> 02:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
than his curriculum in his school but
 
02:19:44.309 --> 02:19:44.319 align:start position:0%
it's built around those academic
 
02:19:46.750 --> 02:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
standards so the guidelines and the
 
02:19:51.270 --> 02:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
Frameworks are sort of like that guide
 
02:19:53.389 --> 02:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
that incorporate academic
 
02:19:55.830 --> 02:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
standards but what are the academic
 
02:19:57.990 --> 02:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
standards in there are they listed
 
02:19:58.000 --> 02:19:59.389 align:start position:0%
standards in there are they listed
somewhere

02:19:59.389 --> 02:19:59.399 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
02:20:02.710 --> 02:20:02.720 align:start position:0%
separately or or do they or is the guide
 
02:20:04.349 --> 02:20:04.359 align:start position:0%
the academic
 
02:20:08.030 --> 02:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:11.309 --> 02:20:11.319 align:start position:0%
goal right and the academic standard
 
02:20:13.870 --> 02:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
would also Drive assessment wouldn't it
 
02:20:16.550 --> 02:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
yes not the curriculum right the stand
 
02:20:19.070 --> 02:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
the academic standard drives assessment
 
02:20:19.080 --> 02:20:26.270 align:start position:0%
the academic standard drives assessment
yeah

02:20:26.270 --> 02:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:28.349 --> 02:20:28.359 align:start position:0%
hopefully yeah your instruction your
 
02:20:31.230 --> 02:20:31.240 align:start position:0%
curriculum and your assessment all have
 
02:20:36.309 --> 02:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:38.750 --> 02:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
right so we have about three things we
 
02:20:40.830 --> 02:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
got to ask them to come over and impart
 
02:20:44.190 --> 02:20:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:46.389 --> 02:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
discuss maybe we can get clarification
 
02:20:50.469 --> 02:20:50.479 align:start position:0%
on it m so so is there a good time or a
 
02:20:53.270 --> 02:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
B bad time there's all bad times to meet
 
02:20:55.870 --> 02:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
now after November 5th is a better time
 
02:20:55.880 --> 02:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
now after November 5th is a better time
for

02:20:57.280 --> 02:20:57.290 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:20:57.290 --> 02:21:00.270 align:start position:0%
for
[Laughter]

02:21:00.270 --> 02:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:21:02.630 --> 02:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
me but
 
02:21:06.070 --> 02:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
remember that Jael car meets the middle
 
02:21:06.080 --> 02:21:06.950 align:start position:0%
remember that Jael car meets the middle
of

02:21:06.950 --> 02:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:21:10.429 --> 02:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
November and anything that would be
 
02:21:13.389 --> 02:21:13.399 align:start position:0%
these are conditionally or approved they
 
02:21:17.030 --> 02:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
can change this approval process or the
 
02:21:21.070 --> 02:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
deal we can do it if we do it prior to
 
02:21:27.990 --> 02:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:36.429 --> 02:21:36.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:38.710 --> 02:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
time do it
 
02:21:40.950 --> 02:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
after pardon me if we could do it I
 
02:21:40.960 --> 02:21:41.830 align:start position:0%
after pardon me if we could do it I
agree

02:21:41.830 --> 02:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
agree
 
02:21:47.429 --> 02:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:50.190 --> 02:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
5th so then the department won't have an
 
02:21:52.110 --> 02:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity do anything we'll be able to
 
02:21:54.830 --> 02:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
get some work to jel
 
02:22:00.230 --> 02:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:02.950 --> 02:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
yeah well the department could still do
 
02:22:04.389 --> 02:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
well they could at least get us the
 
02:22:06.550 --> 02:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
information that that we wish they had
 
02:22:08.750 --> 02:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
been here today to
 
02:22:11.469 --> 02:22:11.479 align:start position:0%
answer well I didn't I didn't ask them
 
02:22:13.950 --> 02:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
to attend today though and I'll honest
 
02:22:13.960 --> 02:22:30.710 align:start position:0%
to attend today though and I'll honest
today

02:22:30.710 --> 02:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:32.550 --> 02:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
can you believe it or not I got a Civics
 
02:22:36.590 --> 02:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
meeting on October 31st that starts at 2
 
02:22:39.790 --> 02:22:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:41.790 --> 02:22:41.800 align:start position:0%
afternoon that's great for the kids
 
02:22:44.429 --> 02:22:44.439 align:start position:0%
coming to the house trick- or
 
02:22:53.150 --> 02:22:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:56.710 --> 02:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
so um do do we anybody have are are the
 
02:23:00.510 --> 02:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
28th 29th and 30th all really sliced up
 
02:23:03.510 --> 02:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
for you guys could we come
 
02:23:06.510 --> 02:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
in if we had them here with specific
 
02:23:08.070 --> 02:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
questions answer we might be able to get
 
02:23:14.670 --> 02:23:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:20.990 --> 02:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:26.550 --> 02:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:28.710 --> 02:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
possibility do we do it like fearly
 
02:23:32.269 --> 02:23:32.279 align:start position:0%
early in the morning yeah
 
02:23:34.550 --> 02:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
9:30 you got to change your haircut no
 
02:23:36.349 --> 02:23:36.359 align:start position:0%
that I don't want to mess with I mess
 
02:23:39.269 --> 02:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
with that I I'm out I'm in the
 
02:23:44.230 --> 02:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
dogghouse I can change it so and and um
 
02:23:48.670 --> 02:23:48.680 align:start position:0%
and Rick to be clear we're looking at um
 
02:23:52.870 --> 02:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
at uh uh getting some clarification on 8
 
02:23:54.990 --> 02:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
which is sort of like the questions
 
02:23:59.429 --> 02:23:59.439 align:start position:0%
about library and media center let me on
 
02:24:03.630 --> 02:24:03.640 align:start position:0%
eight yes eight on 12 which is class
 
02:24:06.030 --> 02:24:06.040 align:start position:0%
size versus ratios why why are we making
 
02:24:08.750 --> 02:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
the change and then um and then you know
 
02:24:12.309 --> 02:24:12.319 align:start position:0%
what if what you know overlap and 456 to
 
02:24:16.469 --> 02:24:16.479 align:start position:0%
Elementary versus middle yeah and then
 
02:24:19.870 --> 02:24:19.880 align:start position:0%
uh 28 29 um where are the academic
 
02:24:21.429 --> 02:24:21.439 align:start position:0%
standards what are the differences
 
02:24:22.870 --> 02:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
between academic standards and
 
02:24:22.880 --> 02:24:24.590 align:start position:0%
between academic standards and
Frameworks

02:24:24.590 --> 02:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
Frameworks
 
02:24:26.750 --> 02:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
yeah and we might be able to get some
 
02:24:29.630 --> 02:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
research from people across street on
 
02:24:31.750 --> 02:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
the when curriculum Frameworks came into
 
02:24:32.950 --> 02:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
being I think it would be good to get
 
02:24:35.670 --> 02:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
some statutory yeah stuff on that too
 
02:24:38.110 --> 02:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
that's a great
 
02:24:43.110 --> 02:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
idea just if you read this uh that bill
 
02:24:46.670 --> 02:24:46.680 align:start position:0%
927 you can just go up to you know in
 
02:24:48.510 --> 02:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
the web and you can pick that up put
 
02:24:50.950 --> 02:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
down 2007 you can
 
02:24:54.550 --> 02:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
it specifies very clearly the minimum
 
02:24:56.790 --> 02:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
Public School approval standards and
 
02:24:58.870 --> 02:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
curriculum Frameworks there's no mention
 
02:25:12.190 --> 02:25:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:16.070 --> 02:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
standards okay so we have three
 
02:25:17.990 --> 02:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
areas got
 
02:25:21.990 --> 02:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
it if we is 9 10:00 too early for you
 
02:25:25.309 --> 02:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
guys I can do
 
02:25:29.230 --> 02:25:29.240 align:start position:0%
that it's early in it yeah okay
 
02:25:32.830 --> 02:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
9:30 it's all right per me it's
 
02:25:35.910 --> 02:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
fine that way we could get out of here
 
02:25:38.670 --> 02:25:38.680 align:start position:0%
by 10 yeah
 
02:25:41.990 --> 02:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully hopefully
 
02:25:48.070 --> 02:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
no 9 to 11 maybe 10:30 yeah okay 9:00 so
 
02:25:50.950 --> 02:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to do 1028
 
02:25:58.550 --> 02:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:03.389 --> 02:26:03.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:05.469 --> 02:26:05.479 align:start position:0%
1029 Jen can you get that in the
 
02:26:05.479 --> 02:26:06.990 align:start position:0%
1029 Jen can you get that in the
calendar

02:26:06.990 --> 02:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
02:26:17.469 --> 02:26:17.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:25.830 --> 02:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:28.469 --> 02:26:28.479 align:start position:0%
okay we're all good with the definition
 
02:26:32.230 --> 02:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
educator so we made some progress today
 
02:26:38.790 --> 02:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:45.710 --> 02:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:49.230 --> 02:26:49.240 align:start position:0%
o00 you know what
