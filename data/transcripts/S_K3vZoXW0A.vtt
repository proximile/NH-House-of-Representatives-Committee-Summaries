um
 
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 align:start position:0%
any other one Founders up in the apple
 
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 align:start position:0%
um good morning I'd like to reopen the
 
00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 align:start position:0%
committee of conference on House Bill
 
00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.770 align:start position:0%
committee of conference on House Bill
610

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 align:start position:0%
610
 
00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
um there's still some discussions and
 
00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 align:start position:0%
some work going on and we wanted to talk
 
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 align:start position:0%
as house countries for a little bit
 
00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.170 align:start position:0%
as house countries for a little bit
longer

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 align:start position:0%
longer
 
00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 align:start position:0%
um with that and with the timing I'd
 
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
like to take a break until 10 o'clock so
 
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
we can come back after we have
 
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
have some other discussions if that
 
00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 align:start position:0%
would be all right
 
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
if not we can proceed but I know that
 
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
there's some desire just to make sure
 
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
many of us have that same one at 11. yes
 
00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 align:start position:0%
it's I had actually uh thought it mixed
 
00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 align:start position:0%
up my times and I thought we were
 
00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 align:start position:0%
meeting at 10 for the other so I thought
 
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:04.860 align:start position:0%
we'd have to break until later but we'll
 
00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 align:start position:0%
break until 10. so thank you I apologize
 
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
everybody has a chance to go get a
 
00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:47.639 --> 01:07:38.089 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:07:38.089 --> 01:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
um uh thank you everybody for waiting
 
01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
with us um I'd like to reopen the
 
01:07:44.809 --> 01:07:44.819 align:start position:0%
committee of conference on House Bill
 
01:07:44.819 --> 01:07:52.430 align:start position:0%
committee of conference on House Bill
610.

01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
so House Bill 610
 
01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
um obviously deals with the the bail the
 
01:08:00.529 --> 01:08:00.539 align:start position:0%
changes to the bail reform structure and
 
01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
that's something that we are working on
 
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
in the house this is something where I
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
would like to make sure that our members
 
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
of this committee conference who are on
 
01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
criminal justice are able to speak to
 
01:08:11.930 --> 01:08:11.940 align:start position:0%
what our intentions and plans are
 
01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
regarding bail reform
 
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Oscar
 
01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:19.010 align:start position:0%
thank you Oscar
um

01:08:19.010 --> 01:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:21.650 --> 01:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
the bill that the Senate is putting
 
01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:23.940 align:start position:0%
forward to us today is actually a mirror
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
of a bill that I co-sponsored with
 
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
Senator Abbas
 
01:08:30.729 --> 01:08:30.739 align:start position:0%
um and I actually retained my own bill
 
01:08:33.769 --> 01:08:33.779 align:start position:0%
and the reason being based on the the
 
01:08:36.169 --> 01:08:36.179 align:start position:0%
numbers after the election it became
 
01:08:37.789 --> 01:08:37.799 align:start position:0%
apparent that the electorate wanted us
 
01:08:40.189 --> 01:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
to work together in a bipartisan fashion
 
01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:43.380 align:start position:0%
I made that commitment to the um
 
01:08:45.169 --> 01:08:45.179 align:start position:0%
Democrats on my committee and in the
 
01:08:46.849 --> 01:08:46.859 align:start position:0%
house that we would work together to
 
01:08:48.410 --> 01:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
come up with a comprehensive piece of
 
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
legislation that could pass the house
 
01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
pass the Senate and be signed by the
 
01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:55.010 align:start position:0%
pass the Senate and be signed by the
governor

01:08:55.010 --> 01:08:55.020 align:start position:0%
governor
 
01:08:58.249 --> 01:08:58.259 align:start position:0%
um having said that
 
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
um the piece of legislation before us
 
01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:03.000 align:start position:0%
very well could in some form or fashion
 
01:09:05.749 --> 01:09:05.759 align:start position:0%
end up in that legislation but as a
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
standalone bill I myself cannot go back
 
01:09:12.349 --> 01:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
on the commitment I made to work
 
01:09:14.329 --> 01:09:14.339 align:start position:0%
together to come up with a comprehensive
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation that had input from
 
01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
everyone all the stakeholders that was
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
inclusive and open to everyone in
 
01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:23.769 align:start position:0%
inclusive and open to everyone in
transparent

01:09:23.769 --> 01:09:23.779 align:start position:0%
transparent
 
01:09:27.349 --> 01:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
I spoke to several people since we last
 
01:09:27.359 --> 01:09:28.570 align:start position:0%
I spoke to several people since we last
met

01:09:28.570 --> 01:09:28.580 align:start position:0%
met
 
01:09:30.890 --> 01:09:30.900 align:start position:0%
and it was raised to my attention that
 
01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
the bill before us could have unintended
 
01:09:36.410 --> 01:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
consequences such as someone could be
 
01:09:38.689 --> 01:09:38.699 align:start position:0%
charged with domestic assault for a
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
simple bump
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
and be held 36 hours
 
01:09:46.669 --> 01:09:46.679 align:start position:0%
someone could be charged for a sexual
 
01:09:49.249 --> 01:09:49.259 align:start position:0%
assault that was 10 years old and be
 
01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:51.900 align:start position:0%
arrested and held 36 hours and in that
 
01:09:53.090 --> 01:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
time frame there's a very good
 
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
possibility that they could lose their
 
01:09:57.070 --> 01:09:57.080 align:start position:0%
job if a single mother
 
01:10:00.650 --> 01:10:00.660 align:start position:0%
has her father come over the children's
 
01:10:02.630 --> 01:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
father come over and he charges her that
 
01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
he hit her
 
01:10:06.770 --> 01:10:06.780 align:start position:0%
she could lose her children to the state
 
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
while she's in custody for 36 hours
 
01:10:11.209 --> 01:10:11.219 align:start position:0%
I spoke to some people at the county
 
01:10:14.930 --> 01:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
level this would be an unfunded mandate
 
01:10:16.970 --> 01:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
there's no money included in this to pay
 
01:10:18.890 --> 01:10:18.900 align:start position:0%
for whatever it would cost and there is
 
01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:20.880 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note I believe attached
 
01:10:23.209 --> 01:10:23.219 align:start position:0%
to the counties to reimburse them for
 
01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
the expenses so there's a lot of a lot
 
01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
of stuff that look goes into this Beyond
 
01:10:30.770 --> 01:10:30.780 align:start position:0%
just the actual offenses so that that's
 
01:10:32.930 --> 01:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
where I from the criminal justice
 
01:10:35.090 --> 01:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
committee stand and I would let David
 
01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:38.050 align:start position:0%
committee stand and I would let David
speak

01:10:38.050 --> 01:10:38.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
and basically what I want to say is is
 
01:10:44.209 --> 01:10:44.219 align:start position:0%
what he said and and
 
01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
um uh what I'd like to say in addition
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
though is in criminal justice we have
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
the opportunity uh to to basically sit
 
01:10:57.470 --> 01:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
in and hear uh all of the bills that
 
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
come before us that are related to bail
 
01:11:03.169 --> 01:11:03.179 align:start position:0%
um and I think it's hard to sit through
 
01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
some of those hearings without being
 
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
affected by some of the things that you
 
01:11:06.239 --> 01:11:07.070 align:start position:0%
affected by some of the things that you
hear

01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
hear
 
01:11:10.010 --> 01:11:10.020 align:start position:0%
but one of the other things that uh that
 
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
strikes you as you sit through hearing
 
01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
after hearing after hearing uh is that
 
01:11:16.310 --> 01:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
we have problems with the bail system
 
01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
that just go beyond the way our laws are
 
01:11:22.130 --> 01:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
written uh there are systemic issues in
 
01:11:24.470 --> 01:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice system
 
01:11:26.209 --> 01:11:26.219 align:start position:0%
um that actually are contributing
 
01:11:28.430 --> 01:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
factors to the failure of our current
 
01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
law to be as effective as we would like
 
01:11:32.570 --> 01:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
it to be
 
01:11:35.450 --> 01:11:35.460 align:start position:0%
um one of those factors is the fact that
 
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
police officers right now have no way of
 
01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:40.140 align:start position:0%
knowing if the person that they're
 
01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
arresting is actually out on bail
 
01:11:45.110 --> 01:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
um and one of the things that's part of
 
01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:48.300 align:start position:0%
um uh this before us today would
 
01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
actually help us address that situation
 
01:11:53.330 --> 01:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
now it would take probably a year for a
 
01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
system like that to get built
 
01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
um but if we were able to agree that
 
01:11:59.810 --> 01:11:59.820 align:start position:0%
that was something that we would want to
 
01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
do today then that you know then that
 
01:12:04.669 --> 01:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
would be that would be relatively sooner
 
01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
but as representative Roy said uh there
 
01:12:10.669 --> 01:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
are issues with the other bail component
 
01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:13.140 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
01:12:16.729 --> 01:12:16.739 align:start position:0%
um that are they're constitutional uh
 
01:12:18.890 --> 01:12:18.900 align:start position:0%
number one and these are things that
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
need to be addressed
 
01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
um and they need to be and I think one
 
01:12:25.970 --> 01:12:25.980 align:start position:0%
of the things that we would like to do
 
01:12:29.090 --> 01:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
is have the opportunity to put all of
 
01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:30.780 align:start position:0%
these things on the table and come back
 
01:12:33.050 --> 01:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
with the best legislation that we that
 
01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
we can that has the best opportunity of
 
01:12:39.229 --> 01:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
addressing uh the issues that have
 
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
brought us here today in a in a
 
01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
comprehensive way now I I'm not sure
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
we're always we're going to be a hundred
 
01:12:48.649 --> 01:12:48.659 align:start position:0%
percent on the same page after you know
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
after that process concludes
 
01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:54.780 align:start position:0%
but um I my hope is is that we can get
 
01:12:57.649 --> 01:12:57.659 align:start position:0%
to a similar place to where we got on
 
01:12:59.510 --> 01:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
the budget just last week
 
01:13:02.930 --> 01:13:02.940 align:start position:0%
where there can be components that we
 
01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:05.100 align:start position:0%
um you know that we work on to make as
 
01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
good as we can uh and we essentially do
 
01:13:10.370 --> 01:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
the best job we can for the people of
 
01:13:11.630 --> 01:13:11.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to put our best foot
 
01:13:14.270 --> 01:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
forward and actually create the best
 
01:13:17.090 --> 01:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to solve this problem and
 
01:13:18.890 --> 01:13:18.900 align:start position:0%
I think that's that's really I know what
 
01:13:21.050 --> 01:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
what I'm looking to do and to get out of
 
01:13:25.130 --> 01:13:25.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:28.189 --> 01:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
say that when we met on Monday I was
 
01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
very much of the opinion that every
 
01:13:33.229 --> 01:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
single bail provision in the bill was
 
01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
should not be under discussion because
 
01:13:38.229 --> 01:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
that's what I believed I had understood
 
01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
but we have discussed
 
01:13:44.530 --> 01:13:44.540 align:start position:0%
significantly and
 
01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:48.600 align:start position:0%
the the provision in section four uh or
 
01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:50.340 align:start position:0%
the provision that Senator Bradley
 
01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:51.590 align:start position:0%
the provision that Senator Bradley
suggested

01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
suggested
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh for the bail tracking system either
 
01:13:59.110 --> 01:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
one of those would be a great start to
 
01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:02.460 align:start position:0%
addressing the systemic issues that
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about and so I think
 
01:14:07.970 --> 01:14:07.980 align:start position:0%
that's something that perhaps we could
 
01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
all agree on and take away is a good
 
01:14:13.490 --> 01:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
first step to getting the information
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
that people need to the people who need
 
01:14:18.410 --> 01:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
it so I just want to make it clear that
 
01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:19.390 align:start position:0%
it so I just want to make it clear that
I've

01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:19.400 align:start position:0%
I've
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
revised my opinion on that piece of the
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
bill and would be glad to agree to that
 
01:14:26.450 --> 01:14:26.460 align:start position:0%
if we could take that away as a as a
 
01:14:28.250 --> 01:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
useful first step
 
01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator Carson thank you madam
 
01:14:31.199 --> 01:14:32.330 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator Carson thank you madam
chair

01:14:32.330 --> 01:14:32.340 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
you know as I mentioned on Monday when
 
01:14:36.890 --> 01:14:36.900 align:start position:0%
we met we've been trying this is the
 
01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:39.719 align:start position:0%
third biennium to try to fix which I
 
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
think I heard you say this this morning
 
01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
that you finally realize that this is a
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
really flawed law that has been the
 
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
Senate's premise since practically a few
 
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
months after this law was passed it is
 
01:14:56.990 --> 01:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
flawed and we have tried over and over
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
and over again to fix those flaws
 
01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
much of what you've said we've heard
 
01:15:05.930 --> 01:15:05.940 align:start position:0%
before and they have all been false
 
01:15:07.850 --> 01:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
promises we're going to fix this we're
 
01:15:10.729 --> 01:15:10.739 align:start position:0%
gonna fix this nothing has happened the
 
01:15:13.490 --> 01:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
Senate has led on this issue to try to
 
01:15:17.689 --> 01:15:17.699 align:start position:0%
get this law fixed but every time the
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
house comes up with something else now
 
01:15:22.130 --> 01:15:22.140 align:start position:0%
we're hearing about systemic problems
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
within the system
 
01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:26.699 align:start position:0%
I mean enough is enough the time has
 
01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
come to say we need to fix this law
 
01:15:33.250 --> 01:15:33.260 align:start position:0%
we have compromised over the past three
 
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
bienniums over and over and over again
 
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
with the house but it's always something
 
01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
else and I'm going to predict that if we
 
01:15:43.970 --> 01:15:43.980 align:start position:0%
walk away from this it's going to be
 
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
something else and we will be sitting
 
01:15:49.189 --> 01:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
here next year having the same arguments
 
01:15:51.530 --> 01:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
over and over and over again
 
01:15:54.709 --> 01:15:54.719 align:start position:0%
the time to do something is now we have
 
01:15:56.570 --> 01:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
stripped this down
 
01:15:59.630 --> 01:15:59.640 align:start position:0%
to felonies I mean excuse me to violent
 
01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:01.070 align:start position:0%
to felonies I mean excuse me to violent
crimes

01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
crimes
 
01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about crimes against
 
01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
property we're talking about crimes
 
01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
against our fellow human beings
 
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
and you can't even agree
 
01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
that we need to fix this
 
01:16:17.149 --> 01:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
I I don't understand let me ask you this
 
01:16:19.610 --> 01:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
we have a list of these crimes which
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
ones do you want to throw out of this
 
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
we've heard domestic violence uh
 
01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
representative Roy talked about issues
 
01:16:28.370 --> 01:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
with domestic violence do you want us to
 
01:16:30.590 --> 01:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
throw that out of this list of violent
 
01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
crimes would that make the house feel
 
01:16:34.130 --> 01:16:34.140 align:start position:0%
much more comfortable
 
01:16:37.070 --> 01:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
what else in here don't you like let's
 
01:16:40.189 --> 01:16:40.199 align:start position:0%
put it out loud on the table let's hear
 
01:16:42.410 --> 01:16:42.420 align:start position:0%
what you have to say instead of putting
 
01:16:45.709 --> 01:16:45.719 align:start position:0%
it off until next year where we're going
 
01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
to be allowing more criminals to walk
 
01:16:51.050 --> 01:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
our streets the police are angry and
 
01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:53.219 align:start position:0%
frustrated because they catch these guys
 
01:16:54.830 --> 01:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
and they're turned around on their
 
01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
release right back out on the street to
 
01:16:59.090 --> 01:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
commit more crimes we're making their
 
01:17:01.490 --> 01:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
jobs harder we're putting the public at
 
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
risk what is it in this list that you
 
01:17:07.610 --> 01:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
disagree with the most and let's talk
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
about that and if we have to pare it
 
01:17:11.930 --> 01:17:11.940 align:start position:0%
down let's pare it down but I would like
 
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
to hear what you don't like about this
 
01:17:16.610 --> 01:17:16.620 align:start position:0%
list because this is this is in statute
 
01:17:19.850 --> 01:17:19.860 align:start position:0%
so I would actually like for us to take
 
01:17:21.709 --> 01:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
another break until 10 30 the house
 
01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:23.960 align:start position:0%
would like to confer sure whatever
 
01:19:47.090 --> 01:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:47.100 --> 01:21:14.209 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:21:14.209 --> 01:21:14.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:14.219 --> 01:30:12.290 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:30:12.290 --> 01:30:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:13.729 --> 01:30:13.739 align:start position:0%
um thank you and welcome back to the
 
01:30:15.709 --> 01:30:15.719 align:start position:0%
committee of conference on how spell 610
 
01:30:19.129 --> 01:30:19.139 align:start position:0%
I recognize representative Laurie
 
01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:22.260 align:start position:0%
Madam chairman I'd like to first I'm
 
01:30:25.250 --> 01:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
going to respond to Senator Carson's
 
01:30:28.129 --> 01:30:28.139 align:start position:0%
comments um
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
frankly I'm I'm pleased that you see
 
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
some urgency in getting this done right
 
01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:35.110 align:start position:0%
some urgency in getting this done right
now

01:30:35.110 --> 01:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
in fixing a bill that I believe that you
 
01:30:41.689 --> 01:30:41.699 align:start position:0%
support it and you said it's been bad
 
01:30:44.770 --> 01:30:44.780 align:start position:0%
since day one well I didn't support it
 
01:30:48.350 --> 01:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
what you're saying now is save my bacon
 
01:30:52.189 --> 01:30:52.199 align:start position:0%
we did this we made this mess fix it
 
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
and well we've gone to the house this
 
01:30:56.750 --> 01:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
time that time that time my telephone
 
01:30:58.850 --> 01:30:58.860 align:start position:0%
works and it didn't ring once from
 
01:31:01.070 --> 01:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
anyone on your in your organization and
 
01:31:04.070 --> 01:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
in your in the Senate to say hey would
 
01:31:06.110 --> 01:31:06.120 align:start position:0%
you like to work together on a bill that
 
01:31:07.250 --> 01:31:07.260 align:start position:0%
we could get through the house and send
 
01:31:09.350 --> 01:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
it together not once
 
01:31:12.229 --> 01:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
now at the last minute what's wrong with
 
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
this bill why don't you fix this bill I
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
listed what's wrong with the bill it
 
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
needs work it's not a standalone bill
 
01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
that's good it's just an odds we made
 
01:31:21.890 --> 01:31:21.900 align:start position:0%
commitments to come up with a piece of
 
01:31:23.629 --> 01:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
legislation in the house and we intend
 
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
01:31:26.810 --> 01:31:26.820 align:start position:0%
um your fortune telling regarding
 
01:31:27.770 --> 01:31:27.780 align:start position:0%
whether or not we're going to be here
 
01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
again next year
 
01:31:30.890 --> 01:31:30.900 align:start position:0%
um I would predict not but who knows
 
01:31:34.010 --> 01:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
that's just the way it works so the the
 
01:31:36.890 --> 01:31:36.900 align:start position:0%
comments for the Press aside we are
 
01:31:39.649 --> 01:31:39.659 align:start position:0%
concerned with what's going on we do
 
01:31:43.010 --> 01:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
want to fix it and we're happy to work
 
01:31:46.010 --> 01:31:46.020 align:start position:0%
with you to fix it but coming at the
 
01:31:47.450 --> 01:31:47.460 align:start position:0%
last minute saying we're not interested
 
01:31:49.250 --> 01:31:49.260 align:start position:0%
in fixing it or that we keep making up
 
01:31:52.189 --> 01:31:52.199 align:start position:0%
excuses there's no excuses this is
 
01:31:55.550 --> 01:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
constitutional law and I'm not going to
 
01:31:57.890 --> 01:31:57.900 align:start position:0%
put citizens at risk of unnecessary
 
01:32:00.770 --> 01:32:00.780 align:start position:0%
detainment with a broad swath without
 
01:32:02.270 --> 01:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
looking at it to make sure that it
 
01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't have unintended consequences and
 
01:32:07.370 --> 01:32:07.380 align:start position:0%
this does we need to do it not with
 
01:32:10.370 --> 01:32:10.380 align:start position:0%
slapping Band-Aids on leaks we need to
 
01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
fix the entire piece
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
so in my position is that
 
01:32:18.290 --> 01:32:18.300 align:start position:0%
everything you said is incorrect as far
 
01:32:20.090 --> 01:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
as the House's position goes
 
01:32:23.330 --> 01:32:23.340 align:start position:0%
and that's it
 
01:32:25.189 --> 01:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
um thank you I'm not sure my question
 
01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
would be about whether we're going to be
 
01:32:28.129 --> 01:32:28.139 align:start position:0%
able to come to any agreement on this
 
01:32:30.590 --> 01:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
section three I think what I would
 
01:32:32.930 --> 01:32:32.940 align:start position:0%
suggest is that we do have agreement on
 
01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
the on the electronic bail system and
 
01:32:38.510 --> 01:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
the house position now would be that we
 
01:32:40.850 --> 01:32:40.860 align:start position:0%
take the house the house position and
 
01:32:43.850 --> 01:32:43.860 align:start position:0%
amend Senator Bradley's section four as
 
01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
amended onto that and that that would be
 
01:32:48.169 --> 01:32:48.179 align:start position:0%
what the house physician is so my
 
01:32:49.370 --> 01:32:49.380 align:start position:0%
question would be whether or not that's
 
01:32:51.410 --> 01:32:51.420 align:start position:0%
acceptable or if it's uh just time to
 
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
end the committee of conference uh first
 
01:32:55.490 --> 01:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
of all I'd like to respond to
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative Roy he is exactly right
 
01:33:01.070 --> 01:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
but no one's bacon is being saved here I
 
01:33:03.410 --> 01:33:03.420 align:start position:0%
made it very clear when I spoke on
 
01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
Monday that we were misled the
 
01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
legislature in fact I'll go as far as
 
01:33:11.209 --> 01:33:11.219 align:start position:0%
saying the legislature was lied to
 
01:33:14.090 --> 01:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
we were told that this would not apply
 
01:33:16.490 --> 01:33:16.500 align:start position:0%
to violent crimes and we were assured of
 
01:33:19.490 --> 01:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
that over and over and over again we've
 
01:33:21.530 --> 01:33:21.540 align:start position:0%
heard the term systemic racism here
 
01:33:21.540 --> 01:33:22.610 align:start position:0%
heard the term systemic racism here
today

01:33:22.610 --> 01:33:22.620 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:33:25.310 --> 01:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
one of the things I'm not excuse me not
 
01:33:27.470 --> 01:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
systemic racism but systemic issues
 
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
within our criminal justice system
 
01:33:32.689 --> 01:33:32.699 align:start position:0%
we were told that this bill I mean the
 
01:33:35.450 --> 01:33:35.460 align:start position:0%
the bail system reform was going to take
 
01:33:38.209 --> 01:33:38.219 align:start position:0%
care of that that we didn't want to see
 
01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
people held who were who couldn't afford
 
01:33:45.050 --> 01:33:45.060 align:start position:0%
to pay for bail or anything else that
 
01:33:46.610 --> 01:33:46.620 align:start position:0%
they were not going to lose their jobs
 
01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
they were not going to lose their
 
01:33:50.689 --> 01:33:50.699 align:start position:0%
Apartments over small crimes and we
 
01:33:53.689 --> 01:33:53.699 align:start position:0%
agreed to that we were assured over and
 
01:33:55.910 --> 01:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
over and over again that it was not
 
01:33:58.610 --> 01:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
going to apply to Violent criminals only
 
01:34:01.310 --> 01:34:01.320 align:start position:0%
after it was passed did we start to see
 
01:34:03.169 --> 01:34:03.179 align:start position:0%
it being applied to Violent criminals
 
01:34:05.870 --> 01:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
and we tried to fix it and that's what
 
01:34:08.689 --> 01:34:08.699 align:start position:0%
the Senate has tried to do for the past
 
01:34:12.830 --> 01:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
three bienniums and each time we run
 
01:34:14.629 --> 01:34:14.639 align:start position:0%
into a roadblock when it comes to the
 
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
house now I'm not going to be rude I'm
 
01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
not going to be
 
01:34:20.990 --> 01:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
inappropriate here
 
01:34:23.390 --> 01:34:23.400 align:start position:0%
but we have to face the reality of the
 
01:34:27.410 --> 01:34:27.420 align:start position:0%
situation this law is broken and it
 
01:34:29.930 --> 01:34:29.940 align:start position:0%
needs to be fixed
 
01:34:33.770 --> 01:34:33.780 align:start position:0%
we have tried with the house
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
five years we're now in the third
 
01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:37.070 align:start position:0%
five years we're now in the third
biennium

01:34:37.070 --> 01:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
01:34:39.950 --> 01:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
and we've heard all of this before so
 
01:34:42.169 --> 01:34:42.179 align:start position:0%
the Senate has listened to the house
 
01:34:44.570 --> 01:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
what the complaints from the house were
 
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
and we stripped it down
 
01:34:51.890 --> 01:34:51.900 align:start position:0%
to only violent crimes only violent
 
01:34:51.900 --> 01:34:52.970 align:start position:0%
to only violent crimes only violent
crimes

01:34:52.970 --> 01:34:52.980 align:start position:0%
crimes
 
01:34:56.149 --> 01:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
we're talking about victims here
 
01:34:58.970 --> 01:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
they don't have a voice and we're trying
 
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:06.830 --> 01:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
at this point I'm just going to turn it
 
01:35:09.169 --> 01:35:09.179 align:start position:0%
over to Senator Bradley Senator Bradley
 
01:35:09.179 --> 01:35:12.169 align:start position:0%
over to Senator Bradley Senator Bradley
so

01:35:12.169 --> 01:35:12.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:17.090 --> 01:35:17.100 align:start position:0%
a guess in response uh chairman Roy
 
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
um and I apologize I do not have a copy
 
01:35:24.110 --> 01:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
of Senate Bill 248 in front of me
 
01:35:28.090 --> 01:35:28.100 align:start position:0%
but I believe it is identical language
 
01:35:31.070 --> 01:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
identical to section three
 
01:35:36.229 --> 01:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
so both Senator Susie and Senator Abbas
 
01:35:39.290 --> 01:35:39.300 align:start position:0%
sponsored those two bills and thank you
 
01:35:42.169 --> 01:35:42.179 align:start position:0%
for co-sponsoring it so I think the
 
01:35:42.179 --> 01:35:43.850 align:start position:0%
for co-sponsoring it so I think the
cooperation

01:35:43.850 --> 01:35:43.860 align:start position:0%
cooperation
 
01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
you know between
 
01:35:49.850 --> 01:35:49.860 align:start position:0%
the sponsors at least between the Senate
 
01:35:52.629 --> 01:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
and the house was there
 
01:35:57.890 --> 01:35:57.900 align:start position:0%
and we chose to move Center Susie's Bill
 
01:35:59.990 --> 01:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
and that was in consultation with
 
01:36:03.189 --> 01:36:03.199 align:start position:0%
Senator Abbas because
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
we just thought it would generate the
 
01:36:09.110 --> 01:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
most enthusiasm to get bipartisan
 
01:36:11.810 --> 01:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
support for now maybe that was a mistake
 
01:36:15.229 --> 01:36:15.239 align:start position:0%
maybe it wasn't a mistake but I guess I
 
01:36:18.770 --> 01:36:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:22.129 --> 01:36:22.139 align:start position:0%
you co-sponsored the identical language
 
01:36:26.810 --> 01:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:29.870 --> 01:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
there might be some issues at this point
 
01:36:33.169 --> 01:36:33.179 align:start position:0%
in your mind but you know back when you
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
put your name on it you thought it was
 
01:36:37.430 --> 01:36:37.440 align:start position:0%
okay enough to put your name on so there
 
01:36:40.970 --> 01:36:40.980 align:start position:0%
are 12 listed crimes here and I think
 
01:36:42.590 --> 01:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
it's important
 
01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
to highlight what they are homicide
 
01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
first degree assault second-degree
 
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
assault domestic violence aggravated
 
01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
felonious sexual assault felonious
 
01:36:56.110 --> 01:36:56.120 align:start position:0%
sexual assault kidnapping stalking
 
01:36:59.930 --> 01:36:59.940 align:start position:0%
trafficking robbery
 
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
possession manufacturer distribution of
 
01:37:05.450 --> 01:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
child sexual abuse image or computer
 
01:37:05.460 --> 01:37:09.590 align:start position:0%
child sexual abuse image or computer
pornography

01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:12.290 --> 01:37:12.300 align:start position:0%
I've sponsored the two earlier
 
01:37:16.250 --> 01:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
iterations of what's now Senate Bill 252
 
01:37:18.649 --> 01:37:18.659 align:start position:0%
and Senate bill 248.
 
01:37:20.990 --> 01:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
Senator Susie's Bill and Senator abbasis
 
01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:22.729 align:start position:0%
Senator Susie's Bill and Senator abbasis
Bill

01:37:22.729 --> 01:37:22.739 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:37:25.129 --> 01:37:25.139 align:start position:0%
when I sponsored those I think there was
 
01:37:30.530 --> 01:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
a 72-hour window we dropped it back to
 
01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
um 36. when I sponsored it
 
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
we also winnowed down to the crimes I
 
01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:38.530 align:start position:0%
we also winnowed down to the crimes I
just

01:37:38.530 --> 01:37:38.540 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:37:42.290 --> 01:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
talked about the number of crimes to try
 
01:37:46.910 --> 01:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
to make it surgical because I'm always
 
01:37:48.770 --> 01:37:48.780 align:start position:0%
somebody that tries to learn from my
 
01:37:51.169 --> 01:37:51.179 align:start position:0%
past mistakes failures whatever you want
 
01:37:54.169 --> 01:37:54.179 align:start position:0%
to call it and not being able to get
 
01:37:56.750 --> 01:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
what I think is necessary legislation
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
into the end zone that's always the goal
 
01:38:04.550 --> 01:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
I support the bail tracker
 
01:38:06.470 --> 01:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
I was the one that moved to the finance
 
01:38:08.330 --> 01:38:08.340 align:start position:0%
committee to put it into this bill so
 
01:38:09.950 --> 01:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
that we would have
 
01:38:12.590 --> 01:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
the wherewithal to get you folks to be
 
01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
able to say yup gotta have it it's a
 
01:38:17.149 --> 01:38:17.159 align:start position:0%
good idea I'm putting Amendment on the
 
01:38:18.590 --> 01:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
table that doubles the amount of money
 
01:38:20.090 --> 01:38:20.100 align:start position:0%
for it because
 
01:38:22.669 --> 01:38:22.679 align:start position:0%
the court system said they need that
 
01:38:24.350 --> 01:38:24.360 align:start position:0%
amount of money to implement it so I
 
01:38:27.189 --> 01:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
think in terms of good faith
 
01:38:30.970 --> 01:38:30.980 align:start position:0%
we've generated that so
 
01:38:30.980 --> 01:38:32.510 align:start position:0%
we've generated that so
also

01:38:32.510 --> 01:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:38:36.110 --> 01:38:36.120 align:start position:0%
trying to get with good faith
 
01:38:39.770 --> 01:38:39.780 align:start position:0%
if there are some of those 12 crimes
 
01:38:42.350 --> 01:38:42.360 align:start position:0%
which we've windowed down because in our
 
01:38:44.629 --> 01:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
view they're the worst of the worst
 
01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
they're the ones that people put people
 
01:38:50.930 --> 01:38:50.940 align:start position:0%
most at risk the most vulnerable people
 
01:38:52.570 --> 01:38:52.580 align:start position:0%
at risk
 
01:38:56.450 --> 01:38:56.460 align:start position:0%
but I'm always a half glass full guy and
 
01:38:59.149 --> 01:38:59.159 align:start position:0%
if there are several of those that you
 
01:39:01.390 --> 01:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
can list for us
 
01:39:06.290 --> 01:39:06.300 align:start position:0%
that should be struck from the bill
 
01:39:08.689 --> 01:39:08.699 align:start position:0%
I think we would consider that in
 
01:39:10.189 --> 01:39:10.199 align:start position:0%
combination with everything else in the
 
01:39:11.750 --> 01:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
bill including the two million dollars
 
01:39:14.990 --> 01:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
to the bail tracker but we're we're at a
 
01:39:16.850 --> 01:39:16.860 align:start position:0%
point that
 
01:39:19.129 --> 01:39:19.139 align:start position:0%
um I think everybody in this room knows
 
01:39:20.450 --> 01:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
there's a problem
 
01:39:22.729 --> 01:39:22.739 align:start position:0%
you folks have admitted it
 
01:39:24.890 --> 01:39:24.900 align:start position:0%
everybody out here knows there's a
 
01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:26.530 align:start position:0%
everybody out here knows there's a
problem

01:39:26.530 --> 01:39:26.540 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
so I would ask that you know and I know
 
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
where time's getting a little short I
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
get that
 
01:39:37.910 --> 01:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
um but if you could go back and tell us
 
01:39:41.570 --> 01:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
which of the 12 should be struck
 
01:39:44.810 --> 01:39:44.820 align:start position:0%
and we'll do the bail tracker with your
 
01:39:46.850 --> 01:39:46.860 align:start position:0%
good faith commitment to come back next
 
01:39:48.790 --> 01:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
year with a more comprehensive solution
 
01:39:53.090 --> 01:39:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:56.330 --> 01:39:56.340 align:start position:0%
so having said that I'd ask Madam chair
 
01:39:58.250 --> 01:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
if we could take a recess until a
 
01:40:01.729 --> 01:40:01.739 align:start position:0%
mutually convenient time and see if we
 
01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
can get it done well thank you what I
 
01:40:06.649 --> 01:40:06.659 align:start position:0%
was looking to do is as somebody who has
 
01:40:08.330 --> 01:40:08.340 align:start position:0%
called the police on somebody I thought
 
01:40:11.450 --> 01:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
was stalking me who actually was a pack
 
01:40:14.570 --> 01:40:14.580 align:start position:0%
uh door knocker for me which is why they
 
01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
were looking at me funny I think that
 
01:40:19.010 --> 01:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of these refinements and I
 
01:40:20.689 --> 01:40:20.699 align:start position:0%
I believe that the correct place to do
 
01:40:22.970 --> 01:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
this is in these retained bills and I
 
01:40:24.290 --> 01:40:24.300 align:start position:0%
would like to make sure that there is
 
01:40:25.850 --> 01:40:25.860 align:start position:0%
strong Senate involvement when we do
 
01:40:28.490 --> 01:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
that this is more than can be handled
 
01:40:30.590 --> 01:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
before four o'clock tomorrow with
 
01:40:32.750 --> 01:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
hammering out those details so I would
 
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
actually like to move that we take the
 
01:40:36.410 --> 01:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
house position amend on Senator
 
01:40:38.750 --> 01:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
Bradley's Amendment for the bail and
 
01:40:40.430 --> 01:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
take a vote on that to see if we have
 
01:40:43.250 --> 01:40:43.260 align:start position:0%
agreement we will work with you in the
 
01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
retained bills but this is not something
 
01:40:46.729 --> 01:40:46.739 align:start position:0%
that can be done by four o'clock and
 
01:40:49.010 --> 01:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
just to be clear that would be just to
 
01:40:51.530 --> 01:40:51.540 align:start position:0%
be clear that would be sections one two
 
01:40:54.890 --> 01:40:54.900 align:start position:0%
and of the the bill as it exists and
 
01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley's Amendment correct and
 
01:41:00.890 --> 01:41:00.900 align:start position:0%
if I may respond um you are correct
 
01:41:02.750 --> 01:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley I did correspond to that
 
01:41:04.250 --> 01:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
and that was
 
01:41:07.010 --> 01:41:07.020 align:start position:0%
um that was prior to the election
 
01:41:09.110 --> 01:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
the reality once the election occurred
 
01:41:12.169 --> 01:41:12.179 align:start position:0%
was we have a mathematical problem that
 
01:41:14.510 --> 01:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
will not pass the floor there's not a
 
01:41:15.770 --> 01:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
single crime in there that I don't think
 
01:41:17.570 --> 01:41:17.580 align:start position:0%
is serious and warrants a second look
 
01:41:20.570 --> 01:41:20.580 align:start position:0%
but but regardless it's not going to
 
01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
pass the house it will not pass the flow
 
01:41:25.490 --> 01:41:25.500 align:start position:0%
we do not have a republican majority
 
01:41:28.490 --> 01:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
um and and I I'd love to help you but
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
when I can it's not going to pass and
 
01:41:32.930 --> 01:41:32.940 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a risk of of losing it
 
01:41:34.490 --> 01:41:34.500 align:start position:0%
and not being able to discuss it further
 
01:41:37.250 --> 01:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
and it's it's to me it would be an
 
01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
exercising futility which is why I
 
01:41:40.850 --> 01:41:40.860 align:start position:0%
retain my own bill that had that
 
01:41:43.209 --> 01:41:43.219 align:start position:0%
language in it
 
01:41:46.430 --> 01:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
yes Senator Bradley
 
01:41:49.129 --> 01:41:49.139 align:start position:0%
you know the speaker and I were the
 
01:41:51.310 --> 01:41:51.320 align:start position:0%
governor and 100 other people yesterday
 
01:41:53.870 --> 01:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
signing a budget
 
01:41:56.450 --> 01:41:56.460 align:start position:0%
and if you told me and I bet if you had
 
01:41:58.010 --> 01:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
told the speaker two months ago that
 
01:41:59.510 --> 01:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
we'd be doing that
 
01:42:01.430 --> 01:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
you'd have said it was an exercise in
 
01:42:05.149 --> 01:42:05.159 align:start position:0%
futility the most dangerous word
 
01:42:09.109 --> 01:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
in the English language is can't
 
01:42:12.290 --> 01:42:12.300 align:start position:0%
okay so when people are at risk for
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
their personal safety I don't think we
 
01:42:17.390 --> 01:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
should be saying we can't get a past
 
01:42:20.450 --> 01:42:20.460 align:start position:0%
I would hope that you would take a
 
01:42:23.390 --> 01:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
recess Madam chair and come back to us
 
01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:25.310 align:start position:0%
recess Madam chair and come back to us
with

01:42:25.310 --> 01:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:42:29.090 --> 01:42:29.100 align:start position:0%
the bare minimum number of these 12
 
01:42:31.970 --> 01:42:31.980 align:start position:0%
listed crimes that you can pass today
 
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
and we would accept the more
 
01:42:37.490 --> 01:42:37.500 align:start position:0%
comprehensive solution down the road I
 
01:42:40.129 --> 01:42:40.139 align:start position:0%
would that would be at least you know
 
01:42:41.810 --> 01:42:41.820 align:start position:0%
without having consulted with my two
 
01:42:45.169 --> 01:42:45.179 align:start position:0%
colleagues my position where we're at at
 
01:42:48.109 --> 01:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
quarter of 11. and we still have 24
 
01:42:51.050 --> 01:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
hours and as Speaker Packard and I know
 
01:42:53.810 --> 01:42:53.820 align:start position:0%
there is no such thing as camp and
 
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
futility we we put together a great
 
01:42:59.450 --> 01:42:59.460 align:start position:0%
budget and I think that
 
01:43:02.030 --> 01:43:02.040 align:start position:0%
is a testament to people being able to
 
01:43:04.609 --> 01:43:04.619 align:start position:0%
work together and I think we have 27
 
01:43:07.070 --> 01:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
hours or so left we should try to get it
 
01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:08.270 align:start position:0%
hours or so left we should try to get it
done

01:43:08.270 --> 01:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:43:10.790 --> 01:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative Weber with respect the
 
01:43:13.129 --> 01:43:13.139 align:start position:0%
budget was not put together in 27 hours
 
01:43:13.139 --> 01:43:15.169 align:start position:0%
budget was not put together in 27 hours
and

01:43:15.169 --> 01:43:15.179 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:43:15.179 --> 01:43:16.149 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:20.930 --> 01:43:20.940 align:start position:0%
we have been saying the same words over
 
01:43:22.510 --> 01:43:22.520 align:start position:0%
and over again
 
01:43:25.729 --> 01:43:25.739 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I I think that it would be
 
01:43:29.030 --> 01:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
a great gesture if we did not throw the
 
01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
baby out with the bathwater if we
 
01:43:35.689 --> 01:43:35.699 align:start position:0%
accepted the bail tracker language got
 
01:43:37.550 --> 01:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
that started because as we all know
 
01:43:40.189 --> 01:43:40.199 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a very long process
 
01:43:40.199 --> 01:43:41.709 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a very long process
and

01:43:41.709 --> 01:43:41.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:43:44.270 --> 01:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
put that on the first two sections of
 
01:43:46.490 --> 01:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
the house bill and we can walk away with
 
01:43:48.189 --> 01:43:48.199 align:start position:0%
something we've done good for the state
 
01:43:52.370 --> 01:43:52.380 align:start position:0%
but section three is not going to get
 
01:43:55.370 --> 01:43:55.380 align:start position:0%
through the house and picking and
 
01:43:58.910 --> 01:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
choosing when there's only four of us
 
01:44:01.209 --> 01:44:01.219 align:start position:0%
out of
 
01:44:05.629 --> 01:44:05.639 align:start position:0%
397 or whatever we're at at the moment
 
01:44:09.350 --> 01:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
we have strong opposition from both
 
01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
sides of the aisle from significant
 
01:44:15.169 --> 01:44:15.179 align:start position:0%
blocks of people it that I can't do the
 
01:44:20.450 --> 01:44:20.460 align:start position:0%
math and get to a yes so I would agree
 
01:44:22.850 --> 01:44:22.860 align:start position:0%
on the floor even if we were to pair out
 
01:44:24.050 --> 01:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
some of these this is something that's
 
01:44:26.149 --> 01:44:26.159 align:start position:0%
been a commitment to work towards a
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
solution this is the only the only
 
01:44:30.709 --> 01:44:30.719 align:start position:0%
option that we have is to offer that
 
01:44:32.750 --> 01:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
part of the the house bill so that we
 
01:44:34.729 --> 01:44:34.739 align:start position:0%
can have these providers have parity and
 
01:44:36.830 --> 01:44:36.840 align:start position:0%
include the bail conditions uh so the
 
01:44:38.990 --> 01:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
electronic Bill system
 
01:44:41.930 --> 01:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
um so it seems that there's no agreement
 
01:44:44.209 --> 01:44:44.219 align:start position:0%
is it possible to research recess to
 
01:44:45.890 --> 01:44:45.900 align:start position:0%
time uncertain and if there is some
 
01:44:47.390 --> 01:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
agreement come back later or would we
 
01:44:49.970 --> 01:44:49.980 align:start position:0%
need to set a specific time to reset you
 
01:44:57.790 --> 01:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that we're going to find
 
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
any agreement on this I think we
 
01:45:04.129 --> 01:45:04.139 align:start position:0%
probably should um at this point agree
 
01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
to disagree because I don't see any way
 
01:45:08.930 --> 01:45:08.940 align:start position:0%
to change section three to something
 
01:45:10.910 --> 01:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
that'll pass the house and if it won't
 
01:45:12.590 --> 01:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
pass the house it's an exercise in
 
01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:17.270 align:start position:0%
pass the house it's an exercise in
futility

01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:19.189 --> 01:45:19.199 align:start position:0%
well I thank everybody for their time
 
01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
and for their offered on this I hope
 
01:45:23.750 --> 01:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
that we can have a similar effort as the
 
01:45:25.669 --> 01:45:25.679 align:start position:0%
criminal justice committee Works through
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
these five routine bills so that we have
 
01:45:29.149 --> 01:45:29.159 align:start position:0%
something that not only has bipartisan
 
01:45:31.090 --> 01:45:31.100 align:start position:0%
agreement in the house but also has
 
01:45:33.530 --> 01:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
bipartisan agreement with the Senate so
 
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
that when the
 
01:45:39.890 --> 01:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:43.729 --> 01:45:43.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:46.189 --> 01:45:46.199 align:start position:0%
I recognize that but what we need to
 
01:45:47.810 --> 01:45:47.820 align:start position:0%
have is agreement in the house because
 
01:45:49.970 --> 01:45:49.980 align:start position:0%
the house um is are the ones that are
 
01:45:51.530 --> 01:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
that are closest to the people and we're
 
01:45:53.149 --> 01:45:53.159 align:start position:0%
hearing more from our specific
 
01:45:55.490 --> 01:45:55.500 align:start position:0%
constituents both those who need to make
 
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
sure that people are staying in and
 
01:45:58.250 --> 01:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
those who have experienced some of these
 
01:46:00.350 --> 01:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
Fringe cases that even though they're in
 
01:46:01.669 --> 01:46:01.679 align:start position:0%
Edge case they're the things that can
 
01:46:03.709 --> 01:46:03.719 align:start position:0%
lose a house or a family
 
01:46:06.290 --> 01:46:06.300 align:start position:0%
um I I ask for your involvement with the
 
01:46:08.270 --> 01:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
retained bills so that we have something
 
01:46:10.189 --> 01:46:10.199 align:start position:0%
that's acceptable to everybody so that
 
01:46:13.070 --> 01:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
in early January we have a bill pass on
 
01:46:15.229 --> 01:46:15.239 align:start position:0%
the floor and if it's a Senate Bill have
 
01:46:16.850 --> 01:46:16.860 align:start position:0%
a concurrence if that's a house bill
 
01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
move quickly in the Senate so that we
 
01:46:21.169 --> 01:46:21.179 align:start position:0%
are only six months behind but with a
 
01:46:22.910 --> 01:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
far better product as opposed to a
 
01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:23.990 align:start position:0%
far better product as opposed to a
Band-Aid

01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
Band-Aid
 
01:46:25.310 --> 01:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
so I would ask for your help and
 
01:46:27.109 --> 01:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
commitment on that and I would say that
 
01:46:28.850 --> 01:46:28.860 align:start position:0%
that would be what is different than the
 
01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
past three bienniums is that we could
 
01:46:34.129 --> 01:46:34.139 align:start position:0%
start with a change and actually work
 
01:46:36.410 --> 01:46:36.420 align:start position:0%
together from the beginning of a piece
 
01:46:38.810 --> 01:46:38.820 align:start position:0%
of legislation instead of in both
 
01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
separate houses and then trying to come
 
01:46:43.729 --> 01:46:43.739 align:start position:0%
together at the last minute it's just we
 
01:46:45.410 --> 01:46:45.420 align:start position:0%
need to be together from the beginning
 
01:46:47.330 --> 01:46:47.340 align:start position:0%
and then there's no surprises for
 
01:46:47.340 --> 01:46:49.370 align:start position:0%
and then there's no surprises for
anybody

01:46:49.370 --> 01:46:49.380 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
02:06:05.089 --> 02:06:05.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:07.070 --> 02:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you all I'd like to open the
 
02:06:08.750 --> 02:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
committee of conference on House Bill
 
02:06:08.760 --> 02:06:10.550 align:start position:0%
committee of conference on House Bill
611

02:06:10.550 --> 02:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
611
 
02:06:11.930 --> 02:06:11.940 align:start position:0%
um just to give a little bit of the
 
02:06:14.570 --> 02:06:14.580 align:start position:0%
landscape uh this this bill initially
 
02:06:16.609 --> 02:06:16.619 align:start position:0%
was around severe pain
 
02:06:18.830 --> 02:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
um in sections one and two are changes
 
02:06:20.810 --> 02:06:20.820 align:start position:0%
that were made that passed through the
 
02:06:25.010 --> 02:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
house on consent and basically this
 
02:06:27.050 --> 02:06:27.060 align:start position:0%
means that anybody who can prescribe
 
02:06:27.060 --> 02:06:29.209 align:start position:0%
means that anybody who can prescribe
opiates

02:06:29.209 --> 02:06:29.219 align:start position:0%
opiates
 
02:06:31.310 --> 02:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
um right now well sorry right now people
 
02:06:33.649 --> 02:06:33.659 align:start position:0%
can prescribe opiates for pain but if
 
02:06:35.089 --> 02:06:35.099 align:start position:0%
you're going to have severe pain and
 
02:06:37.370 --> 02:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
prescribe cannabis or do a certify for
 
02:06:38.750 --> 02:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis you need to try and fail
 
02:06:41.930 --> 02:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
opiates first which is a severe policy
 
02:06:43.850 --> 02:06:43.860 align:start position:0%
issue around the time that this was put
 
02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
in there weren't data around cannabis
 
02:06:48.589 --> 02:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
for pain there now are so it makes sense
 
02:06:51.250 --> 02:06:51.260 align:start position:0%
that in our current opioid
 
02:06:53.510 --> 02:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
crisis that we're not pushing people
 
02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
onto opioids before they can have other
 
02:06:56.689 --> 02:06:56.699 align:start position:0%
things that are not as physically
 
02:06:59.330 --> 02:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
addictive so this is this is an
 
02:07:00.709 --> 02:07:00.719 align:start position:0%
important bill in order to make sure
 
02:07:02.330 --> 02:07:02.340 align:start position:0%
that we're also not pushing people into
 
02:07:05.030 --> 02:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
surgery to correct problems with their
 
02:07:07.370 --> 02:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
actual spine for pain before they can
 
02:07:09.290 --> 02:07:09.300 align:start position:0%
try cannabis because cannabis is far
 
02:07:12.830 --> 02:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
more reversible than spinal fusion then
 
02:07:14.990 --> 02:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
we're also looking at the Cannabis
 
02:07:16.629 --> 02:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
legalization issue
 
02:07:19.430 --> 02:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
obviously there was a bill that failed
 
02:07:22.729 --> 02:07:22.739 align:start position:0%
and there's movement towards having a
 
02:07:25.010 --> 02:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
state model there was an attempt in
 
02:07:26.930 --> 02:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
Committee in order to bring forth a
 
02:07:29.570 --> 02:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
changed bill that would address this and
 
02:07:31.850 --> 02:07:31.860 align:start position:0%
I believe that the way that the
 
02:07:33.470 --> 02:07:33.480 align:start position:0%
commission to study the state-controlled
 
02:07:35.510 --> 02:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
sale of cannabis is to be able to make
 
02:07:37.250 --> 02:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
sure that we have a solid look at this
 
02:07:40.490 --> 02:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
so that legislation can be introduced so
 
02:07:42.109 --> 02:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
that we can actually find a solution to
 
02:07:44.990 --> 02:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
this that would meet stakeholders then
 
02:07:47.810 --> 02:07:47.820 align:start position:0%
that sunsets as well and there are two
 
02:07:49.609 --> 02:07:49.619 align:start position:0%
areas around the therapeutic cannabis
 
02:07:52.129 --> 02:07:52.139 align:start position:0%
medical oversight board basically that's
 
02:07:53.750 --> 02:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
codifying what they do already in
 
02:07:57.410 --> 02:07:57.420 align:start position:0%
section five and then in section six it
 
02:07:59.570 --> 02:07:59.580 align:start position:0%
is looking to correct What was seen to
 
02:08:01.970 --> 02:08:01.980 align:start position:0%
be an oversight around hemp products
 
02:08:04.669 --> 02:08:04.679 align:start position:0%
because the reading of it was that
 
02:08:07.430 --> 02:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
federally anything that's derived from
 
02:08:09.290 --> 02:08:09.300 align:start position:0%
the hemp would not be under the
 
02:08:11.689 --> 02:08:11.699 align:start position:0%
scheduled drugs we have some information
 
02:08:14.570 --> 02:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
for the U.S Department of Justice saying
 
02:08:16.550 --> 02:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
that any of the synthetic derivatives of
 
02:08:19.070 --> 02:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
hemp are not classified as hemp at the
 
02:08:20.990 --> 02:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
federal level and so any synthetic
 
02:08:22.970 --> 02:08:22.980 align:start position:0%
derivatives actually are schedule one
 
02:08:26.330 --> 02:08:26.340 align:start position:0%
drugs so
 
02:08:28.370 --> 02:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
it seems that the language we have
 
02:08:30.290 --> 02:08:30.300 align:start position:0%
probably already addresses that within
 
02:08:32.629 --> 02:08:32.639 align:start position:0%
our state because when federally hemp
 
02:08:34.729 --> 02:08:34.739 align:start position:0%
does not include synthetic derivatives
 
02:08:36.890 --> 02:08:36.900 align:start position:0%
it it's one of those areas that's
 
02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
already addressed at the federal level I
 
02:08:41.689 --> 02:08:41.699 align:start position:0%
would like to turn this over to Chairman
 
02:08:45.229 --> 02:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
hunt to speak about the the layout of
 
02:08:47.209 --> 02:08:47.219 align:start position:0%
the commission what he's been doing and
 
02:08:49.850 --> 02:08:49.860 align:start position:0%
working very hard on this process and
 
02:08:51.709 --> 02:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
what Insight he has and what he would
 
02:08:54.410 --> 02:08:54.420 align:start position:0%
like to see I'm sorry excuse me I just
 
02:08:57.890 --> 02:08:57.900 align:start position:0%
have a question yes is that in dispute I
 
02:09:00.530 --> 02:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
if it is I want to get it out here on
 
02:09:02.330 --> 02:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
the table
 
02:09:05.089 --> 02:09:05.099 align:start position:0%
um I know chairman hunt has done a lot
 
02:09:08.390 --> 02:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
of work but we have proposed a commit a
 
02:09:10.669 --> 02:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
commission are you proposing something
 
02:09:10.679 --> 02:09:11.870 align:start position:0%
commission are you proposing something
different

02:09:11.870 --> 02:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:09:13.310 --> 02:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
would like to
 
02:09:15.169 --> 02:09:15.179 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:09:16.810 --> 02:09:16.820 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry
 
02:09:19.729 --> 02:09:19.739 align:start position:0%
a look at it in another light and that
 
02:09:21.890 --> 02:09:21.900 align:start position:0%
would be two two elements of it or three
 
02:09:23.870 --> 02:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
elements that we're concerned with first
 
02:09:25.910 --> 02:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
of all is that we don't want to be
 
02:09:28.070 --> 02:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
called a study commission we want it to
 
02:09:30.669 --> 02:09:30.679 align:start position:0%
be a commit a committee to create
 
02:09:34.370 --> 02:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
legislation for next year
 
02:09:36.470 --> 02:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
okay so just some clarification if
 
02:09:38.330 --> 02:09:38.340 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a committee
 
02:09:40.790 --> 02:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
what are you talking about so we would
 
02:09:43.129 --> 02:09:43.139 align:start position:0%
think that normally uh would be just
 
02:09:44.510 --> 02:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
legislators if you're creating
 
02:09:47.089 --> 02:09:47.099 align:start position:0%
legislation so that that is and I just
 
02:09:49.370 --> 02:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we're clear this is an
 
02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
issue that you would like to change it
 
02:09:54.770 --> 02:09:54.780 align:start position:0%
from being a commission to a committee
 
02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:57.599 align:start position:0%
to a committee of legislators legislator
 
02:09:59.750 --> 02:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of creating legislation
 
02:10:02.270 --> 02:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
okay so in terms of the task and then
 
02:10:04.010 --> 02:10:04.020 align:start position:0%
the only third item would be is the
 
02:10:05.629 --> 02:10:05.639 align:start position:0%
effective date should be
 
02:10:10.430 --> 02:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:13.430 --> 02:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I just and that's that issue I
 
02:10:15.290 --> 02:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
think you know I don't think there's
 
02:10:17.270 --> 02:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
agreement that this is the model and so
 
02:10:20.270 --> 02:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
that's why the commission was created to
 
02:10:21.950 --> 02:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
sort of study this I think if you're
 
02:10:24.169 --> 02:10:24.179 align:start position:0%
saying this is a committee to create
 
02:10:26.030 --> 02:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
legislation for State controlled I think
 
02:10:27.350 --> 02:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
you're putting the cart before the horse
 
02:10:31.070 --> 02:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
so uh the the whole point of this is to
 
02:10:32.689 --> 02:10:32.699 align:start position:0%
see if this is correct for New Hampshire
 
02:10:35.089 --> 02:10:35.099 align:start position:0%
this model and so I'm not sure we want
 
02:10:37.330 --> 02:10:37.340 align:start position:0%
to you know have a committee just
 
02:10:40.490 --> 02:10:40.500 align:start position:0%
already uh with the goal of creating
 
02:10:42.109 --> 02:10:42.119 align:start position:0%
legislation for this model I think we
 
02:10:43.550 --> 02:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
need to study it which is why all these
 
02:10:46.570 --> 02:10:46.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:48.830 --> 02:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
02:10:53.270 --> 02:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
I just with respect to the structure
 
02:10:56.930 --> 02:10:56.940 align:start position:0%
um I am thinking back to a wonderful
 
02:10:59.570 --> 02:10:59.580 align:start position:0%
lesson I learned from when then
 
02:11:03.530 --> 02:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
representative Nancy Styles uh chaired a
 
02:11:05.870 --> 02:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
legislative committee that was tasked
 
02:11:08.930 --> 02:11:08.940 align:start position:0%
with dealing with the issue of truancy
 
02:11:12.050 --> 02:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
and what I learned from her that was it
 
02:11:14.330 --> 02:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
was the year that she went from being a
 
02:11:17.390 --> 02:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
a representative to being a senator but
 
02:11:19.609 --> 02:11:19.619 align:start position:0%
she managed over the course of a number
 
02:11:23.870 --> 02:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
of meetings to include every single
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
possible constituent in the most
 
02:11:29.089 --> 02:11:29.099 align:start position:0%
inclusive way
 
02:11:31.850 --> 02:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
and because all of them were interested
 
02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
from homeschoolers Detroit officers and
 
02:11:36.490 --> 02:11:36.500 align:start position:0%
school boards and teachers and and
 
02:11:40.010 --> 02:11:40.020 align:start position:0%
therapists and community members
 
02:11:40.020 --> 02:11:40.790 align:start position:0%
therapists and community members
um

02:11:40.790 --> 02:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:44.350 --> 02:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
it was the most inclusive and
 
02:11:47.930 --> 02:11:47.940 align:start position:0%
comprehensive work I have ever seen
 
02:11:51.649 --> 02:11:51.659 align:start position:0%
and one of my concerns with creating a
 
02:11:54.050 --> 02:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
commission and one of the reasons the
 
02:11:55.609 --> 02:11:55.619 align:start position:0%
commissions have often grown bigger and
 
02:11:57.410 --> 02:11:57.420 align:start position:0%
bigger and bigger is people say well if
 
02:11:58.729 --> 02:11:58.739 align:start position:0%
they're on I want to be on and if
 
02:12:00.830 --> 02:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
they're on I get I want my voice to be
 
02:12:03.950 --> 02:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
heard and I think if you restrict the
 
02:12:07.729 --> 02:12:07.739 align:start position:0%
membership to legislators you are
 
02:12:11.149 --> 02:12:11.159 align:start position:0%
actually creating a forum in which
 
02:12:11.159 --> 02:12:13.330 align:start position:0%
actually creating a forum in which
everybody

02:12:13.330 --> 02:12:13.340 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
02:12:17.089 --> 02:12:17.099 align:start position:0%
gets to have their voice heard it's the
 
02:12:19.070 --> 02:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
person running the committee does it
 
02:12:21.350 --> 02:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
well and we have people who do it very
 
02:12:23.109 --> 02:12:23.119 align:start position:0%
well here
 
02:12:29.089 --> 02:12:29.099 align:start position:0%
so I I urge that as not less inclusive
 
02:12:31.310 --> 02:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
but more inclusive it means that
 
02:12:34.609 --> 02:12:34.619 align:start position:0%
everybody uh who is a stakeholder has an
 
02:12:35.930 --> 02:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
equal voice
 
02:12:39.229 --> 02:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
and I think that that's a positive thing
 
02:12:42.169 --> 02:12:42.179 align:start position:0%
in terms of the structure it also would
 
02:12:45.410 --> 02:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
allow us to get going immediately it's a
 
02:12:49.250 --> 02:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
large task to have done by
 
02:12:54.109 --> 02:12:54.119 align:start position:0%
The End by by December but in answer to
 
02:12:59.569 --> 02:12:59.579 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:03.950 --> 02:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate the focus being on
 
02:13:06.169 --> 02:13:06.179 align:start position:0%
creating legislation
 
02:13:09.890 --> 02:13:09.900 align:start position:0%
because it incorporates everything that
 
02:13:13.129 --> 02:13:13.139 align:start position:0%
you have said obviously they may not
 
02:13:15.589 --> 02:13:15.599 align:start position:0%
come to an agreement of some kind of
 
02:13:17.450 --> 02:13:17.460 align:start position:0%
legislation and they may decide the
 
02:13:19.629 --> 02:13:19.639 align:start position:0%
legislation is certainly not right for
 
02:13:23.169 --> 02:13:23.179 align:start position:0%
but and in which case they could say so
 
02:13:26.270 --> 02:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
and of course anything they create gets
 
02:13:27.770 --> 02:13:27.780 align:start position:0%
presented to the House and Senate
 
02:13:31.010 --> 02:13:31.020 align:start position:0%
afterwards anyway but I think that it
 
02:13:34.129 --> 02:13:34.139 align:start position:0%
gives a focus to the study
 
02:13:37.330 --> 02:13:37.340 align:start position:0%
so that we are
 
02:13:40.870 --> 02:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
remembering as a committee
 
02:13:45.709 --> 02:13:45.719 align:start position:0%
that the goal of this is going to be
 
02:13:48.530 --> 02:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
something that would be presented
 
02:13:50.870 --> 02:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
to the house and to the Senate at the
 
02:13:54.229 --> 02:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
end of it and I think that that's a
 
02:13:56.290 --> 02:13:56.300 align:start position:0%
focus that
 
02:14:00.649 --> 02:14:00.659 align:start position:0%
sharpens the way the issue is studied
 
02:14:04.010 --> 02:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
and and can take into account all of the
 
02:14:06.169 --> 02:14:06.179 align:start position:0%
points that you made about
 
02:14:06.179 --> 02:14:06.890 align:start position:0%
points that you made about
um

02:14:06.890 --> 02:14:06.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:09.109 --> 02:14:09.119 align:start position:0%
is is this right for New Hampshire are
 
02:14:10.370 --> 02:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
we are we going in the right direction
 
02:14:13.490 --> 02:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
but that's my my thought on it may I
 
02:14:16.490 --> 02:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
yeah just send it so um I just want to
 
02:14:18.830 --> 02:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
clarify that
 
02:14:18.840 --> 02:14:19.609 align:start position:0%
clarify that
um

02:14:19.609 --> 02:14:19.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:21.410 --> 02:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
you know I see where you're saying about
 
02:14:23.930 --> 02:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
it being more specific to drafting
 
02:14:26.270 --> 02:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
legislation and if I think if that's the
 
02:14:27.830 --> 02:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
case then I think it should be broader
 
02:14:31.430 --> 02:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
so you know it shouldn't be to create
 
02:14:33.649 --> 02:14:33.659 align:start position:0%
legislation for state-controlled sale of
 
02:14:36.050 --> 02:14:36.060 align:start position:0%
cannabis perhaps it should be broader so
 
02:14:38.030 --> 02:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
we're not saying in the legislation that
 
02:14:40.430 --> 02:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
we're creating a certain type of model
 
02:14:42.350 --> 02:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
which I don't think everyone well we're
 
02:14:45.050 --> 02:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
reading the letter of the way that it
 
02:14:48.350 --> 02:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
was written it is written for to address
 
02:14:52.430 --> 02:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
all the issues of a state operated
 
02:14:55.790 --> 02:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh facilities okay we're we're taking
 
02:14:57.350 --> 02:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
you're taking let's say the historic
 
02:14:59.330 --> 02:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
perspective here there's already been a
 
02:14:59.340 --> 02:15:00.709 align:start position:0%
perspective here there's already been a
commission

02:15:00.709 --> 02:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:15:03.109 --> 02:15:03.119 align:start position:0%
and they came back with legislation
 
02:15:04.970 --> 02:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
and that legislation failed in the
 
02:15:04.980 --> 02:15:05.810 align:start position:0%
and that legislation failed in the
Senate

02:15:05.810 --> 02:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
02:15:08.510 --> 02:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
and so we're now looking to you senators
 
02:15:12.169 --> 02:15:12.179 align:start position:0%
and say join with us we'll a legislative
 
02:15:15.350 --> 02:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
committee for that singular task
 
02:15:18.649 --> 02:15:18.659 align:start position:0%
to create this legislation that's going
 
02:15:21.050 --> 02:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
to have a state operated facility
 
02:15:23.569 --> 02:15:23.579 align:start position:0%
okay we know we now have the governor's
 
02:15:23.579 --> 02:15:25.310 align:start position:0%
okay we know we now have the governor's
blessing

02:15:25.310 --> 02:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
blessing
 
02:15:28.069 --> 02:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
not that that means much just means one
 
02:15:29.810 --> 02:15:29.820 align:start position:0%
last step in Easton to jump through hoop
 
02:15:32.450 --> 02:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
to jump through but we're taking that as
 
02:15:35.450 --> 02:15:35.460 align:start position:0%
on face value that what our task what we
 
02:15:37.069 --> 02:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
want to do tasks my experience with
 
02:15:39.109 --> 02:15:39.119 align:start position:0%
study committees is when you have big
 
02:15:42.770 --> 02:15:42.780 align:start position:0%
old commissions it it it's just a report
 
02:15:44.689 --> 02:15:44.699 align:start position:0%
comes out and nothing much comes out of
 
02:15:47.810 --> 02:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
it okay what I wanted to do is turn this
 
02:15:49.729 --> 02:15:49.739 align:start position:0%
into and I'm really taking this as what
 
02:15:51.950 --> 02:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
you guys were attending when you sent it
 
02:15:54.970 --> 02:15:54.980 align:start position:0%
over to us with this language which is
 
02:15:58.850 --> 02:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
focus in on just this concept
 
02:16:01.850 --> 02:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
would this work what is it going to look
 
02:16:04.970 --> 02:16:04.980 align:start position:0%
like can we address the issues of all
 
02:16:06.890 --> 02:16:06.900 align:start position:0%
the different concerns and you'll risk
 
02:16:08.390 --> 02:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
you list a myriad of them like the
 
02:16:10.189 --> 02:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
marijuana mile
 
02:16:13.010 --> 02:16:13.020 align:start position:0%
uh I think the one the most soluble one
 
02:16:15.950 --> 02:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
that's in here that I really like is the
 
02:16:18.890 --> 02:16:18.900 align:start position:0%
fact that we are determined to see if we
 
02:16:22.609 --> 02:16:22.619 align:start position:0%
can do this to actually underprice
 
02:16:24.950 --> 02:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
the illegal Market
 
02:16:27.649 --> 02:16:27.659 align:start position:0%
and that therefore would take that out
 
02:16:29.810 --> 02:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
and I would assume that that is
 
02:16:32.150 --> 02:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
something we all would hope any
 
02:16:35.209 --> 02:16:35.219 align:start position:0%
legislation we create would do which is
 
02:16:37.969 --> 02:16:37.979 align:start position:0%
to under is that can in the state
 
02:16:37.979 --> 02:16:39.410 align:start position:0%
to under is that can in the state
replace

02:16:39.410 --> 02:16:39.420 align:start position:0%
replace
 
02:16:42.230 --> 02:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
you know this illegal market and and and
 
02:16:44.450 --> 02:16:44.460 align:start position:0%
if it and if it if they can come up with
 
02:16:46.009 --> 02:16:46.019 align:start position:0%
that legislation they can accomplish
 
02:16:46.019 --> 02:16:47.450 align:start position:0%
that legislation they can accomplish
that

02:16:47.450 --> 02:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:16:49.549 --> 02:16:49.559 align:start position:0%
hopefully then those Senators who didn't
 
02:16:52.310 --> 02:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
vote for in the past which I see two of
 
02:16:55.009 --> 02:16:55.019 align:start position:0%
them here I feel that maybe this won't
 
02:16:57.530 --> 02:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
work and that's why I just am trying to
 
02:17:00.889 --> 02:17:00.899 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to focus the task on just
 
02:17:03.889 --> 02:17:03.899 align:start position:0%
this concept and and see if this would
 
02:17:05.929 --> 02:17:05.939 align:start position:0%
work and if not you know if it doesn't
 
02:17:08.629 --> 02:17:08.639 align:start position:0%
it doesn't but at the same time at least
 
02:17:11.870 --> 02:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
we know we gave the committee a specific
 
02:17:14.209 --> 02:17:14.219 align:start position:0%
charge my concern about putting these
 
02:17:16.310 --> 02:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
other people on the commission is that
 
02:17:19.370 --> 02:17:19.380 align:start position:0%
some of them are actually have maybe you
 
02:17:20.990 --> 02:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
know I mean I I guess the police Chiefs
 
02:17:22.370 --> 02:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
I've never heard of one say that they
 
02:17:24.349 --> 02:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
think it was a possible solution here
 
02:17:26.450 --> 02:17:26.460 align:start position:0%
okay I'm not saying that I don't believe
 
02:17:27.830 --> 02:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
that they would come to the table and
 
02:17:30.889 --> 02:17:30.899 align:start position:0%
help help us draft a compromise
 
02:17:33.830 --> 02:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
legislation but that we we really want
 
02:17:35.450 --> 02:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
the people who are on the committee this
 
02:17:37.429 --> 02:17:37.439 align:start position:0%
the the eight
 
02:17:40.009 --> 02:17:40.019 align:start position:0%
four reps and four centers are committed
 
02:17:42.889 --> 02:17:42.899 align:start position:0%
to to putting together legislation that
 
02:17:44.770 --> 02:17:44.780 align:start position:0%
they're willing to put their name to
 
02:17:46.969 --> 02:17:46.979 align:start position:0%
five five excuse me four four five
 
02:17:49.129 --> 02:17:49.139 align:start position:0%
whichever number so that's that's where
 
02:17:51.830 --> 02:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm why I'm proposing this it's just
 
02:17:53.450 --> 02:17:53.460 align:start position:0%
it's just this make sure they really
 
02:17:54.589 --> 02:17:54.599 align:start position:0%
accomplish something they get something
 
02:17:57.830 --> 02:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
that we all can can and and be able to
 
02:18:00.169 --> 02:18:00.179 align:start position:0%
level we can look at and not get bogged
 
02:18:02.030 --> 02:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
down with you know who who what the vote
 
02:18:04.330 --> 02:18:04.340 align:start position:0%
what to the commission okay
 
02:18:07.070 --> 02:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
I think you wanted to say something I
 
02:18:08.450 --> 02:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
don't wanna I don't want to step in
 
02:18:10.490 --> 02:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
because we can I was enjoy I was
 
02:18:12.650 --> 02:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
enjoying the bannering um yeah my
 
02:18:14.629 --> 02:18:14.639 align:start position:0%
primary focus here is to make sure that
 
02:18:16.610 --> 02:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
the underlying Bill gets passed I've
 
02:18:18.230 --> 02:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
seen too many patients that have had
 
02:18:20.330 --> 02:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
failed spinal surgeries that have just
 
02:18:22.129 --> 02:18:22.139 align:start position:0%
been an option available to them to have
 
02:18:24.290 --> 02:18:24.300 align:start position:0%
medical cannabis it would have been a
 
02:18:27.110 --> 02:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
lifesaver for them in many many ways
 
02:18:29.870 --> 02:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
um my understanding also is that the
 
02:18:31.669 --> 02:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
reason that we're revisiting the bill
 
02:18:34.610 --> 02:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
that we passed 20 to nothing in the
 
02:18:37.190 --> 02:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
um in the uh the committee is because
 
02:18:39.530 --> 02:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
there has been some movement
 
02:18:43.310 --> 02:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
uh higher up that would like to see this
 
02:18:46.790 --> 02:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
potentially a cabin and if it is state
 
02:18:48.830 --> 02:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
run which has never been done before in
 
02:18:50.870 --> 02:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
the country unlike our neighboring
 
02:18:52.849 --> 02:18:52.859 align:start position:0%
states then you know a committee
 
02:18:54.770 --> 02:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
commission somebody has to look at it to
 
02:18:57.169 --> 02:18:57.179 align:start position:0%
see how this would mechanically work if
 
02:18:58.549 --> 02:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
I'm reading the statue right from last
 
02:19:01.070 --> 02:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
year that was just fast we already have
 
02:19:03.169 --> 02:19:03.179 align:start position:0%
a problem with the committee makeup as
 
02:19:05.570 --> 02:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
it stands right now it's five over right
 
02:19:09.230 --> 02:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
so if that's the case then why wouldn't
 
02:19:12.530 --> 02:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
we want to be in in fact in HHS this
 
02:19:14.929 --> 02:19:14.939 align:start position:0%
year alone of all the many bills that we
 
02:19:17.690 --> 02:19:17.700 align:start position:0%
saw there were very few that had as much
 
02:19:20.330 --> 02:19:20.340 align:start position:0%
interest in participation as the
 
02:19:23.570 --> 02:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
Cannabis bills so having said that if I
 
02:19:25.849 --> 02:19:25.859 align:start position:0%
look at the statutes and the limits and
 
02:19:28.310 --> 02:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
the number of people and we want to get
 
02:19:30.290 --> 02:19:30.300 align:start position:0%
you know legislators involved which I
 
02:19:32.030 --> 02:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
think we want to do and if the end
 
02:19:34.790 --> 02:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
result is potentially a framework for
 
02:19:37.610 --> 02:19:37.620 align:start position:0%
legislation down the road then I would
 
02:19:40.429 --> 02:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
think we would want to have a committee
 
02:19:43.310 --> 02:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
we can start it sooner we can have you
 
02:19:46.009 --> 02:19:46.019 align:start position:0%
know dedicated people involved it would
 
02:19:48.349 --> 02:19:48.359 align:start position:0%
be terribly all-inclusive because a lot
 
02:19:49.849 --> 02:19:49.859 align:start position:0%
of people want to have their opinions
 
02:19:53.090 --> 02:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
made and I think that would get the
 
02:19:55.550 --> 02:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
majority of people but if we have a
 
02:19:57.889 --> 02:19:57.899 align:start position:0%
limit of 15 people on the commission and
 
02:20:00.410 --> 02:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
we cannot start for a period of time and
 
02:20:02.450 --> 02:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
we have 10 of them already designated as
 
02:20:05.090 --> 02:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
legislators we're leaving a lot of very
 
02:20:07.010 --> 02:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
important stakeholders out of the room
 
02:20:09.370 --> 02:20:09.380 align:start position:0%
with their voices needing to be heard so
 
02:20:13.190 --> 02:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
to me it doesn't either way I want to
 
02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
get the underlying bill passed but it
 
02:20:16.730 --> 02:20:16.740 align:start position:0%
would seem mechanically to get it
 
02:20:19.550 --> 02:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
forward with a state-run you know
 
02:20:22.610 --> 02:20:22.620 align:start position:0%
operation this would make no sense you
 
02:20:24.530 --> 02:20:24.540 align:start position:0%
know as far as the makeup and the
 
02:20:26.570 --> 02:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
participation nor the bill I think is
 
02:20:28.910 --> 02:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
going to get as much traction in the
 
02:20:31.730 --> 02:20:31.740 align:start position:0%
next session as probably one for
 
02:20:34.550 --> 02:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis so thank you madam chair thank
 
02:20:34.560 --> 02:20:35.570 align:start position:0%
cannabis so thank you madam chair thank
you

02:20:35.570 --> 02:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:20:37.450 --> 02:20:37.460 align:start position:0%
um you've heard
 
02:20:41.750 --> 02:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
everything that you folks have said
 
02:20:41.760 --> 02:20:42.889 align:start position:0%
everything that you folks have said
um

02:20:42.889 --> 02:20:42.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:45.710 --> 02:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
we strongly feel that a commission is
 
02:20:47.570 --> 02:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
the way to go we can change the
 
02:20:49.849 --> 02:20:49.859 align:start position:0%
effective date and I have had a
 
02:20:52.070 --> 02:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
conversation with Senator Bradley that
 
02:20:55.910 --> 02:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
we can get going on this immediately
 
02:20:58.370 --> 02:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
um it will bring everybody to the table
 
02:21:00.590 --> 02:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
and everyone at the table has an equal
 
02:21:00.600 --> 02:21:01.849 align:start position:0%
and everyone at the table has an equal
voice

02:21:01.849 --> 02:21:01.859 align:start position:0%
voice
 
02:21:03.469 --> 02:21:03.479 align:start position:0%
and that's what we need to hear
 
02:21:05.570 --> 02:21:05.580 align:start position:0%
especially from government because this
 
02:21:07.990 --> 02:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
is going to be a government-run
 
02:21:11.330 --> 02:21:11.340 align:start position:0%
program we need the folks that are
 
02:21:13.730 --> 02:21:13.740 align:start position:0%
actually going to be in charge of doing
 
02:21:17.330 --> 02:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
this they need to be at the table
 
02:21:21.050 --> 02:21:21.060 align:start position:0%
so we're going to stick with the uh with
 
02:21:23.690 --> 02:21:23.700 align:start position:0%
a commission we can definitely talk
 
02:21:26.690 --> 02:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
about changing the effective date I
 
02:21:27.889 --> 02:21:27.899 align:start position:0%
think that
 
02:21:29.450 --> 02:21:29.460 align:start position:0%
um I think there is an agreement on the
 
02:21:32.750 --> 02:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
underlying bill which for me is a step
 
02:21:35.050 --> 02:21:35.060 align:start position:0%
forward because I usually do not support
 
02:21:38.510 --> 02:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
marijuana bills but even I can recognize
 
02:21:41.510 --> 02:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
that this is a problem that folks should
 
02:21:44.030 --> 02:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
not have to go through these courses of
 
02:21:46.490 --> 02:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
medication and even surgery which is
 
02:21:48.469 --> 02:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
really outrageous when there's something
 
02:21:50.929 --> 02:21:50.939 align:start position:0%
else that they can that can happen for
 
02:21:53.150 --> 02:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
them and I'm more than happy to support
 
02:21:57.429 --> 02:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
that and the other bill concerning hemp
 
02:22:00.770 --> 02:22:00.780 align:start position:0%
we received some information here I
 
02:22:02.570 --> 02:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
think we might do something a little
 
02:22:05.770 --> 02:22:05.780 align:start position:0%
surgical here and maybe just reference
 
02:22:08.170 --> 02:22:08.180 align:start position:0%
that one
 
02:22:13.070 --> 02:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
I think it's Delta 9 thco and we can
 
02:22:15.530 --> 02:22:15.540 align:start position:0%
figure out language to reflect that and
 
02:22:17.809 --> 02:22:17.819 align:start position:0%
I think that that's where we are I guess
 
02:22:19.490 --> 02:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
follow what do you mean by surgical
 
02:22:23.990 --> 02:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
let's let's look at the language
 
02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:25.849 align:start position:0%
let's let's look at the language
um

02:22:25.849 --> 02:22:25.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:27.710 --> 02:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
when we talk about
 
02:22:29.150 --> 02:22:29.160 align:start position:0%
oh God let me see if I can find it find
 
02:22:31.550 --> 02:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
it here yeah
 
02:22:33.889 --> 02:22:33.899 align:start position:0%
um it include Delta H
 
02:22:36.710 --> 02:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
um or any other THC isomal isonormal
 
02:22:36.720 --> 02:22:37.849 align:start position:0%
um or any other THC isomal isonormal
variant

02:22:37.849 --> 02:22:37.859 align:start position:0%
variant
 
02:22:39.590 --> 02:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
um I believe and just looking at this
 
02:22:41.870 --> 02:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
quickly the federal government has just
 
02:22:45.230 --> 02:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
talked about Delta 9 so we can we can
 
02:22:47.630 --> 02:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
cross out the Delta a
 
02:22:50.510 --> 02:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
um or any other THC no it says Delta 9
 
02:22:54.650 --> 02:22:54.660 align:start position:0%
and Delta eight are or any other yes
 
02:22:56.990 --> 02:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
anything that's synthetic anything that
 
02:23:00.429 --> 02:23:00.439 align:start position:0%
helps your synthetically taking hemp
 
02:23:03.170 --> 02:23:03.180 align:start position:0%
that that is illegal that's a schedule
 
02:23:05.809 --> 02:23:05.819 align:start position:0%
one drug so just like I'm told that
 
02:23:07.910 --> 02:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
sudafeds are made into Crystal methodine
 
02:23:11.510 --> 02:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
you know you know it's that process that
 
02:23:15.170 --> 02:23:15.180 align:start position:0%
turns changes you know that from a an
 
02:23:17.570 --> 02:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
over the QR was to be over counter you
 
02:23:18.650 --> 02:23:18.660 align:start position:0%
have to get from the pharmacists with
 
02:23:20.450 --> 02:23:20.460 align:start position:0%
your driver's license to something that
 
02:23:23.330 --> 02:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
is illegal in the name yes please go
 
02:23:25.490 --> 02:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
ahead I'm not sure that I read this
 
02:23:27.410 --> 02:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
letter the same way as you're reading it
 
02:23:29.090 --> 02:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
so we I think we need to take a beat on
 
02:23:31.429 --> 02:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
because I I think I I don't read it the
 
02:23:33.410 --> 02:23:33.420 align:start position:0%
same way that you're reading it so I
 
02:23:34.490 --> 02:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
think we need to because we just got
 
02:23:37.070 --> 02:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
this letter yeah I'm just reading it
 
02:23:40.490 --> 02:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
here because it looked to me like
 
02:23:40.500 --> 02:23:41.809 align:start position:0%
here because it looked to me like
um

02:23:41.809 --> 02:23:41.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:44.330 --> 02:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
that they're specifically talking about
 
02:23:46.849 --> 02:23:46.859 align:start position:0%
Delta 9 THC but I'm gonna have to go
 
02:23:50.210 --> 02:23:50.220 align:start position:0%
through this um we just received this so
 
02:23:52.309 --> 02:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
um we need to have it especially I guess
 
02:23:54.230 --> 02:23:54.240 align:start position:0%
I also want to reassure you that the
 
02:23:57.050 --> 02:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee has a Senate bill in
 
02:24:00.230 --> 02:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
our possession that we are working on
 
02:24:02.270 --> 02:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
and that we would be presenting that
 
02:24:04.190 --> 02:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
bill that would be coming out and we'll
 
02:24:05.809 --> 02:24:05.819 align:start position:0%
be working on it this fall and we will
 
02:24:07.910 --> 02:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
be sending it to the house for
 
02:24:11.150 --> 02:24:11.160 align:start position:0%
that's Senator evart's Bill so it's not
 
02:24:13.910 --> 02:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
like we were we you know this is not is
 
02:24:16.010 --> 02:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
not going to be addressed it we we need
 
02:24:19.010 --> 02:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
to address it but the the conservance of
 
02:24:20.990 --> 02:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
the Commerce Committee at the time and
 
02:24:22.670 --> 02:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
rightly wrongly because we did not know
 
02:24:25.550 --> 02:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
either that as any synthetic hemp is
 
02:24:27.230 --> 02:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
technically ill you know a schedule one
 
02:24:29.330 --> 02:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
drug we're learning that now but that
 
02:24:32.210 --> 02:24:32.220 align:start position:0%
having said that we uh we were kind of
 
02:24:35.090 --> 02:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
in the original amendment of 639 that
 
02:24:36.950 --> 02:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
was sent over that you guys killed the
 
02:24:40.130 --> 02:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
bill in there was a study committee on
 
02:24:42.349 --> 02:24:42.359 align:start position:0%
these synthetic drugs
 
02:24:44.809 --> 02:24:44.819 align:start position:0%
and so therefore it's that you know the
 
02:24:45.950 --> 02:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
fact that you're killed that that's the
 
02:24:47.990 --> 02:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
only reason why this issue is really now
 
02:24:51.230 --> 02:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
kind of bubbling itself up so
 
02:24:53.530 --> 02:24:53.540 align:start position:0%
um you know in terms of uh you know
 
02:24:56.030 --> 02:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
that's maybe you know you know whether
 
02:24:59.210 --> 02:24:59.220 align:start position:0%
we the idea of banning something and
 
02:25:01.190 --> 02:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
then making it legal
 
02:25:02.929 --> 02:25:02.939 align:start position:0%
would be problematic you know which
 
02:25:04.790 --> 02:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
would be defeating the purpose side but
 
02:25:06.170 --> 02:25:06.180 align:start position:0%
now that we find out that it really is
 
02:25:08.570 --> 02:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
illegal anyways
 
02:25:10.550 --> 02:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
um you know so putting in the statute
 
02:25:14.929 --> 02:25:14.939 align:start position:0%
that's fine uh you know we we often we
 
02:25:16.370 --> 02:25:16.380 align:start position:0%
often repeat ourselves in the
 
02:25:18.230 --> 02:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
legislature and I would just simply say
 
02:25:20.929 --> 02:25:20.939 align:start position:0%
that's uh let's put a sunset in it you
 
02:25:22.429 --> 02:25:22.439 align:start position:0%
know once we you know we find out that
 
02:25:24.349 --> 02:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be effective you know
 
02:25:27.410 --> 02:25:27.420 align:start position:0%
so and I like to say that with that is
 
02:25:28.910 --> 02:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
with it already being designated to
 
02:25:31.610 --> 02:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
schedule one federally then if we're
 
02:25:33.050 --> 02:25:33.060 align:start position:0%
dealing with this and specifically
 
02:25:35.450 --> 02:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
calling it out in our statutes I'm
 
02:25:36.950 --> 02:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
concerned about whether that would be
 
02:25:38.450 --> 02:25:38.460 align:start position:0%
the type of law that then would need to
 
02:25:39.950 --> 02:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
be effective January 1st of the
 
02:25:41.990 --> 02:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
following year if the state might then
 
02:25:44.690 --> 02:25:44.700 align:start position:0%
be going after somebody which to me
 
02:25:47.630 --> 02:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
brings the question because uh
 
02:25:49.910 --> 02:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
I don't understand criminal justice as
 
02:25:52.070 --> 02:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps we've already seen today because
 
02:25:55.130 --> 02:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
it's a very complicated field but if if
 
02:25:57.530 --> 02:25:57.540 align:start position:0%
we are saying that hemp does not include
 
02:25:59.330 --> 02:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
these synthetic cannabis
 
02:26:02.090 --> 02:26:02.100 align:start position:0%
does that then lose any perceived
 
02:26:03.889 --> 02:26:03.899 align:start position:0%
protection and does that mean that
 
02:26:05.389 --> 02:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
anybody who is selling these thinking
 
02:26:08.690 --> 02:26:08.700 align:start position:0%
that they are legal that have a
 
02:26:10.370 --> 02:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
inventory of them
 
02:26:12.050 --> 02:26:12.060 align:start position:0%
what do they do with that inventory if
 
02:26:13.730 --> 02:26:13.740 align:start position:0%
things have just changed on them I mean
 
02:26:15.349 --> 02:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
obviously the federal government can
 
02:26:16.910 --> 02:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
change on them but I don't really want
 
02:26:19.010 --> 02:26:19.020 align:start position:0%
to throw out some of our businesses if
 
02:26:20.450 --> 02:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
they thought that they were acting in
 
02:26:22.370 --> 02:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
good faith and if now there's
 
02:26:24.770 --> 02:26:24.780 align:start position:0%
potentially larger consequences and
 
02:26:27.710 --> 02:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
state legal consequences it's my
 
02:26:29.090 --> 02:26:29.100 align:start position:0%
understanding that whenever there's a
 
02:26:30.950 --> 02:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
change in in the criminality of
 
02:26:32.630 --> 02:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
something it goes into effect January
 
02:26:35.510 --> 02:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
1st that may just be a freshman move but
 
02:26:37.309 --> 02:26:37.319 align:start position:0%
I'm just I want to make sure that we're
 
02:26:40.010 --> 02:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
not acting out of our normal precedent
 
02:26:41.690 --> 02:26:41.700 align:start position:0%
and I do have one more piece of
 
02:26:41.700 --> 02:26:42.730 align:start position:0%
and I do have one more piece of
information

02:26:42.730 --> 02:26:42.740 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:26:45.650 --> 02:26:45.660 align:start position:0%
where I got this from is from The Liquor
 
02:26:47.929 --> 02:26:47.939 align:start position:0%
Commission okay and what happened was I
 
02:26:50.690 --> 02:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
was tasking because uh in past years we
 
02:26:53.570 --> 02:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
had the problem of vaping and so then
 
02:26:56.450 --> 02:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
the resolution was that vaping is really
 
02:26:58.429 --> 02:26:58.439 align:start position:0%
tobacco a lot of tobacco shops already
 
02:27:00.650 --> 02:27:00.660 align:start position:0%
had it right so that we would just moved
 
02:27:03.830 --> 02:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
it vaping into the enforcement by The
 
02:27:06.349 --> 02:27:06.359 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission the end of the day the
 
02:27:09.530 --> 02:27:09.540 align:start position:0%
problem of this THC product is there is
 
02:27:11.630 --> 02:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
no enforcement
 
02:27:14.030 --> 02:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
even if we were to pass this bill today
 
02:27:16.370 --> 02:27:16.380 align:start position:0%
we have not changed the enforcement not
 
02:27:18.530 --> 02:27:18.540 align:start position:0%
suddenly and because theoretically law
 
02:27:21.110 --> 02:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement today could be enforcing the
 
02:27:22.370 --> 02:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
federal stat you know this this Federal
 
02:27:26.090 --> 02:27:26.100 align:start position:0%
FDA but they but they're not and the
 
02:27:28.910 --> 02:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
reason they're not is unlike when we had
 
02:27:32.270 --> 02:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
uh the spice uh nobody's died from these
 
02:27:34.429 --> 02:27:34.439 align:start position:0%
things yet not saying that's right or
 
02:27:37.309 --> 02:27:37.319 align:start position:0%
wrong but that the issue that the
 
02:27:39.230 --> 02:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee had at the time was
 
02:27:42.950 --> 02:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
that if if at some point in time that
 
02:27:45.590 --> 02:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
this product was was okay it was going
 
02:27:47.450 --> 02:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
to be on the market wouldn't we want it
 
02:27:49.130 --> 02:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
to treat it same thing way we treat all
 
02:27:51.710 --> 02:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
tobacco products which is that we would
 
02:27:53.690 --> 02:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
license anyone who sells it in other
 
02:27:55.070 --> 02:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
words anyone who doesn't sell you know
 
02:27:57.349 --> 02:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
it would have to be licensed and then we
 
02:28:00.590 --> 02:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
would uh uh require of that license we
 
02:28:01.969 --> 02:28:01.979 align:start position:0%
would then have our liquor enforcement
 
02:28:03.770 --> 02:28:03.780 align:start position:0%
would be stopping in and checking on
 
02:28:04.969 --> 02:28:04.979 align:start position:0%
them like we do with all these other
 
02:28:07.490 --> 02:28:07.500 align:start position:0%
facilities and that at and make sure
 
02:28:08.750 --> 02:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
that they're not selling to anybody
 
02:28:11.690 --> 02:28:11.700 align:start position:0%
under 21. I mean that's that's the key
 
02:28:14.809 --> 02:28:14.819 align:start position:0%
didn't when it comes to Tobacco so
 
02:28:16.610 --> 02:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
um the only reason you know where is is
 
02:28:19.309 --> 02:28:19.319 align:start position:0%
is I'm saying we're working on this we
 
02:28:22.309 --> 02:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
understand that this is a uh some people
 
02:28:24.290 --> 02:28:24.300 align:start position:0%
think it was a a glitch in the stat
 
02:28:27.170 --> 02:28:27.180 align:start position:0%
their statutes we're seeing here it's
 
02:28:29.389 --> 02:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
not we've heard from the Department say
 
02:28:33.110 --> 02:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
our DEA is bound to create rules but
 
02:28:35.510 --> 02:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
they still haven't solved the problem
 
02:28:37.190 --> 02:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
of enforcement
 
02:28:39.349 --> 02:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
because there's not going to be any DEA
 
02:28:40.429 --> 02:28:40.439 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
02:28:42.889 --> 02:28:42.899 align:start position:0%
knocking on gas stations doors and
 
02:28:44.270 --> 02:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
telling me get this product off their
 
02:28:46.730 --> 02:28:46.740 align:start position:0%
shelf and so that if we really want to
 
02:28:48.590 --> 02:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
do something for this issue
 
02:28:50.929 --> 02:28:50.939 align:start position:0%
then we need we the state
 
02:28:53.690 --> 02:28:53.700 align:start position:0%
need to create a process to regulate it
 
02:28:56.630 --> 02:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
and clearly the DEA has decided that you
 
02:28:58.309 --> 02:28:58.319 align:start position:0%
can take a schedule one drug and you can
 
02:28:59.950 --> 02:28:59.960 align:start position:0%
create a licensed enforcement system
 
02:29:02.750 --> 02:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
they seem to look the other way
 
02:29:04.969 --> 02:29:04.979 align:start position:0%
so if that's what the attitude towards
 
02:29:06.950 --> 02:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
marijuana then why shouldn't we do the
 
02:29:09.650 --> 02:29:09.660 align:start position:0%
same thing with this product and say and
 
02:29:13.130 --> 02:29:13.140 align:start position:0%
and for maybe CBD too now maybe there's
 
02:29:14.330 --> 02:29:14.340 align:start position:0%
concerns out there about what's
 
02:29:16.130 --> 02:29:16.140 align:start position:0%
happening with CBD I don't know but
 
02:29:18.110 --> 02:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
maybe that these things are something
 
02:29:22.010 --> 02:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
that we should license and regulate just
 
02:29:24.670 --> 02:29:24.680 align:start position:0%
like we do with with alcohol and tobacco
 
02:29:26.990 --> 02:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
and actually I'd like to say one other
 
02:29:29.150 --> 02:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
thing on that I was looking at this and
 
02:29:31.670 --> 02:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
looking at our vaping laws on the
 
02:29:33.590 --> 02:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
E-Cigarettes that includes anything with
 
02:29:36.830 --> 02:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis in it and that prohibits any of
 
02:29:38.510 --> 02:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
these products that are vaping products
 
02:29:40.910 --> 02:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
from being sold legally to anybody under
 
02:29:43.490 --> 02:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
21 years old so we've had reports of
 
02:29:44.929 --> 02:29:44.939 align:start position:0%
these being sold in places where
 
02:29:46.849 --> 02:29:46.859 align:start position:0%
nobody's being carted and nobody's ages
 
02:29:48.469 --> 02:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
are being checked
 
02:29:50.210 --> 02:29:50.220 align:start position:0%
adding this into the statutes wouldn't
 
02:29:52.130 --> 02:29:52.140 align:start position:0%
change that existing fundamental flaw
 
02:29:53.809 --> 02:29:53.819 align:start position:0%
and I think that I think that it's more
 
02:29:55.490 --> 02:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
important to make sure that we're
 
02:29:57.349 --> 02:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
already that we are doing what we need
 
02:29:59.450 --> 02:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
to to protect our youth from these
 
02:30:02.450 --> 02:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
dangerous products and not allowing them
 
02:30:04.610 --> 02:30:04.620 align:start position:0%
to seep out the edges and be sold in
 
02:30:06.290 --> 02:30:06.300 align:start position:0%
places that that are not already
 
02:30:07.849 --> 02:30:07.859 align:start position:0%
involved in the process of selling
 
02:30:10.190 --> 02:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
tobacco and alcohol and being involved
 
02:30:12.830 --> 02:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
with age-restricted sales
 
02:30:14.690 --> 02:30:14.700 align:start position:0%
Senator Whitley yeah but wouldn't a
 
02:30:16.670 --> 02:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
Prohibition be protective of our youth
 
02:30:18.170 --> 02:30:18.180 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be more protective of our
 
02:30:20.570 --> 02:30:20.580 align:start position:0%
youth well evidently not because a probe
 
02:30:22.070 --> 02:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
Edition exists already
 
02:30:24.230 --> 02:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
and it would need enforcement well
 
02:30:26.090 --> 02:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
that's our problem so this letter stands
 
02:30:27.650 --> 02:30:27.660 align:start position:0%
for the preposition that those are
 
02:30:30.790 --> 02:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
already Controlled Substances
 
02:30:33.710 --> 02:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
it's already prohibited correct for the
 
02:30:36.050 --> 02:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
sale and New Hampshire is just throwing
 
02:30:37.730 --> 02:30:37.740 align:start position:0%
up our hands but what we're saying oh
 
02:30:39.590 --> 02:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
we're saying nobody's enforcing you let
 
02:30:41.929 --> 02:30:41.939 align:start position:0%
me finish so what we're saying is that
 
02:30:43.790 --> 02:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
we know these are harmful particularly
 
02:30:46.550 --> 02:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
for children completely unregulated feds
 
02:30:48.530 --> 02:30:48.540 align:start position:0%
aren't doing anything so why wouldn't we
 
02:30:50.150 --> 02:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
take the protective action in New
 
02:30:53.290 --> 02:30:53.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's what we're saying
 
02:30:55.969 --> 02:30:55.979 align:start position:0%
how would what have you changed to
 
02:30:57.710 --> 02:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
actually make thought I mean I mean how
 
02:30:58.910 --> 02:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
many times have you guys seen this where
 
02:31:00.590 --> 02:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
we already have a law and made someone
 
02:31:02.090 --> 02:31:02.100 align:start position:0%
pass another bill and they're saying
 
02:31:03.950 --> 02:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
well we we got to inform people where
 
02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
people don't know the law that exists or
 
02:31:07.490 --> 02:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
you know we got to do something that and
 
02:31:10.670 --> 02:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is what more if you
 
02:31:11.750 --> 02:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
haven't figured out who's going to
 
02:31:13.969 --> 02:31:13.979 align:start position:0%
enforce it right now law enforcement in
 
02:31:15.170 --> 02:31:15.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
02:31:17.210 --> 02:31:17.220 align:start position:0%
absolutely charge people with schedule
 
02:31:20.750 --> 02:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
one drugs they do but they are not
 
02:31:24.650 --> 02:31:24.660 align:start position:0%
choosing to enforce this one why passing
 
02:31:26.270 --> 02:31:26.280 align:start position:0%
this bill at this moment
 
02:31:29.150 --> 02:31:29.160 align:start position:0%
is going to change that at all
 
02:31:33.110 --> 02:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
may I respond right so I I hear your
 
02:31:35.630 --> 02:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
concerns with enforcement but we pass
 
02:31:38.270 --> 02:31:38.280 align:start position:0%
many laws in New Hampshire without a
 
02:31:40.309 --> 02:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
guaranteed enforcement structure right
 
02:31:41.870 --> 02:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
so what we're doing right here is a
 
02:31:44.230 --> 02:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
public health measure to say to our
 
02:31:46.429 --> 02:31:46.439 align:start position:0%
businesses you can't sell these things
 
02:31:48.770 --> 02:31:48.780 align:start position:0%
to kids it's dangerous so that's what
 
02:31:51.170 --> 02:31:51.180 align:start position:0%
we're coming from you know it's on the
 
02:31:54.650 --> 02:31:54.660 align:start position:0%
businesses to follow the law right and
 
02:31:56.809 --> 02:31:56.819 align:start position:0%
so just because we don't have like a
 
02:32:00.230 --> 02:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
full guaranteed level of enforcement I
 
02:32:01.910 --> 02:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
don't see that as a barrier to doing
 
02:32:04.250 --> 02:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
something protective of children it's
 
02:32:06.770 --> 02:32:06.780 align:start position:0%
not protecting anybody because it's not
 
02:32:06.780 --> 02:32:08.389 align:start position:0%
not protecting anybody because it's not
enforced

02:32:08.389 --> 02:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
enforced
 
02:32:11.809 --> 02:32:11.819 align:start position:0%
so let me ask you in in the spirit of
 
02:32:15.050 --> 02:32:15.060 align:start position:0%
negotiation if we were to cave on this
 
02:32:18.170 --> 02:32:18.180 align:start position:0%
commission would you be willing to just
 
02:32:21.650 --> 02:32:21.660 align:start position:0%
uh pass an effective date for this
 
02:32:25.550 --> 02:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
statute out Beyond this committee for
 
02:32:27.650 --> 02:32:27.660 align:start position:0%
the next legislative session so at that
 
02:32:29.570 --> 02:32:29.580 align:start position:0%
point in time that committee can take up
 
02:32:31.550 --> 02:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
this issue and resolve it at the same
 
02:32:34.990 --> 02:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
time are you talking about vaping
 
02:32:38.630 --> 02:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
this Delta this section of the bill just
 
02:32:41.210 --> 02:32:41.220 align:start position:0%
make the effective date of this uh push
 
02:32:42.770 --> 02:32:42.780 align:start position:0%
it out a year
 
02:32:47.030 --> 02:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
why can you why a year if you have it in
 
02:32:48.889 --> 02:32:48.899 align:start position:0%
the committee and you've retained it
 
02:32:51.650 --> 02:32:51.660 align:start position:0%
again I believe we will resolve it in
 
02:32:52.610 --> 02:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:32:54.530 --> 02:32:54.540 align:start position:0%
you're so you're going to have an
 
02:32:56.690 --> 02:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
enforcement piece we would do we would
 
02:32:58.250 --> 02:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
try to figure out what enforcement would
 
02:33:01.490 --> 02:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
be well that's true what we're saying is
 
02:33:04.309 --> 02:33:04.319 align:start position:0%
why pass this now if we know that that
 
02:33:05.809 --> 02:33:05.819 align:start position:0%
you're going to have a bill on the house
 
02:33:08.570 --> 02:33:08.580 align:start position:0%
floor come January
 
02:33:10.969 --> 02:33:10.979 align:start position:0%
why do we put this in why would we ban
 
02:33:14.150 --> 02:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
it and then come back and say oh now now
 
02:33:16.309 --> 02:33:16.319 align:start position:0%
that committee can then unchange the law
 
02:33:18.530 --> 02:33:18.540 align:start position:0%
that just got went into effect because
 
02:33:20.809 --> 02:33:20.819 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm looking at this representative
 
02:33:23.570 --> 02:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
and I'm going you're you're me one of
 
02:33:25.730 --> 02:33:25.740 align:start position:0%
your main arguments is enforcement
 
02:33:28.429 --> 02:33:28.439 align:start position:0%
there's we can pass it but there's no
 
02:33:29.990 --> 02:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
more enforcement
 
02:33:33.830 --> 02:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
but you can't commit to having abuse an
 
02:33:35.630 --> 02:33:35.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement piece with a bill you're
 
02:33:38.270 --> 02:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
going to come out with in January I can
 
02:33:40.429 --> 02:33:40.439 align:start position:0%
commit to that if you're asking me that
 
02:33:42.170 --> 02:33:42.180 align:start position:0%
if that's what you want me to do is to
 
02:33:45.230 --> 02:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:47.510 --> 02:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
but because I would just enforce the
 
02:33:50.570 --> 02:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
only enforcement is I guess somehow to
 
02:33:52.910 --> 02:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh be you know if if the enforcement is
 
02:33:54.950 --> 02:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
the ban
 
02:33:56.809 --> 02:33:56.819 align:start position:0%
this product we're Banning this product
 
02:33:58.190 --> 02:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
all together is that what enforcement
 
02:34:00.770 --> 02:34:00.780 align:start position:0%
you want yeah I mean it's it's illegal
 
02:34:03.050 --> 02:34:03.060 align:start position:0%
it's illegal it's a schedule one drug
 
02:34:05.450 --> 02:34:05.460 align:start position:0%
it's available for anybody who wants to
 
02:34:08.030 --> 02:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
buy it right now and what we're trying
 
02:34:09.590 --> 02:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
to do is we're trying to keep this stuff
 
02:34:12.230 --> 02:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
out of the hands of kids okay so how
 
02:34:13.790 --> 02:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
would you do that
 
02:34:15.770 --> 02:34:15.780 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I have an actual
 
02:34:19.490 --> 02:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
question I have an actual question here
 
02:34:19.500 --> 02:34:20.870 align:start position:0%
question I have an actual question here
um

02:34:20.870 --> 02:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:26.030 --> 02:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
is there a percentage in having
 
02:34:27.969 --> 02:34:27.979 align:start position:0%
the language
 
02:34:32.570 --> 02:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire statutes because
 
02:34:35.630 --> 02:34:35.640 align:start position:0%
there would be more of an impetus for
 
02:34:38.510 --> 02:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law enforcement to enforce
 
02:34:41.990 --> 02:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
it as opposed to waiting for federal law
 
02:34:44.630 --> 02:34:44.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement to come in
 
02:34:47.210 --> 02:34:47.220 align:start position:0%
I think and I'm just throwing that as a
 
02:34:48.770 --> 02:34:48.780 align:start position:0%
question I think that's correct and also
 
02:34:50.450 --> 02:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
it's it's New Hampshire a law so New
 
02:34:53.570 --> 02:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire businesses are more you know I
 
02:34:55.730 --> 02:34:55.740 align:start position:0%
would say paying more well if you if you
 
02:34:57.770 --> 02:34:57.780 align:start position:0%
guys really want that then then I think
 
02:34:59.870 --> 02:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
we should go back to this commission
 
02:35:01.490 --> 02:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
versus I mean we've got to have some
 
02:35:04.250 --> 02:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
compromise here I know and I mean we can
 
02:35:06.110 --> 02:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
we can talk which one which one you know
 
02:35:07.849 --> 02:35:07.859 align:start position:0%
in terms of how important this is to you
 
02:35:09.650 --> 02:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
to pass this statue okay well we'd like
 
02:35:11.809 --> 02:35:11.819 align:start position:0%
to versus is that that commission we'd
 
02:35:14.690 --> 02:35:14.700 align:start position:0%
like to disco yeah take a break to a
 
02:35:32.469 --> 02:35:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:35.690 --> 02:35:35.700 align:start position:0%
just a question before you leave um I I
 
02:35:37.309 --> 02:35:37.319 align:start position:0%
mean I'm okay with either commission or
 
02:35:39.290 --> 02:35:39.300 align:start position:0%
committee as long as the tent is large
 
02:35:41.450 --> 02:35:41.460 align:start position:0%
and inclusive of everybody so if it's a
 
02:35:42.889 --> 02:35:42.899 align:start position:0%
committee and everybody's invited their
 
02:35:44.450 --> 02:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
word is heard that sort of thing is fine
 
02:35:46.550 --> 02:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
with me and if we can expedite it to the
 
02:35:48.050 --> 02:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
point where we can move it forward as
 
02:35:51.110 --> 02:35:51.120 align:start position:0%
you've been told then I'm okay with that
 
02:35:52.670 --> 02:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
um but my question is when you're
 
02:35:54.710 --> 02:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
talking is how would you envision the
 
02:35:57.050 --> 02:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
the makeup of the commission then
 
02:35:58.969 --> 02:35:58.979 align:start position:0%
do you know how that would look well
 
02:36:01.670 --> 02:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
that's in the building right so so
 
02:36:03.650 --> 02:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
there's 50 yeah so the only thing I was
 
02:36:06.170 --> 02:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
doing here so the amendment that I was
 
02:36:07.309 --> 02:36:07.319 align:start position:0%
wondering you would change it because
 
02:36:08.870 --> 02:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
right now so the amendment I would
 
02:36:10.610 --> 02:36:10.620 align:start position:0%
propose would be after it says five
 
02:36:13.250 --> 02:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
members five and then if the word goes
 
02:36:14.809 --> 02:36:14.819 align:start position:0%
on all those other people
 
02:36:17.330 --> 02:36:17.340 align:start position:0%
um if I can we can also meet and discuss
 
02:36:19.849 --> 02:36:19.859 align:start position:0%
this part amongst ourselves I just want
 
02:36:21.650 --> 02:36:21.660 align:start position:0%
to put one more thing on the table for
 
02:36:23.210 --> 02:36:23.220 align:start position:0%
discussion within our respective
 
02:36:25.550 --> 02:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
caucuses is we could do a Prohibition
 
02:36:28.250 --> 02:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
with a potential year Sunset and that
 
02:36:29.870 --> 02:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
would give the house time to do their
 
02:36:31.130 --> 02:36:31.140 align:start position:0%
work so that's something we can put on
 
02:36:33.469 --> 02:36:33.479 align:start position:0%
the table and and just with respect to
 
02:36:35.990 --> 02:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
the committee commission question
 
02:36:41.150 --> 02:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:41.160 --> 02:36:42.130 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:36:42.130 --> 02:36:42.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:45.830 --> 02:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
statutory uh makeup that we've already
 
02:36:49.730 --> 02:36:49.740 align:start position:0%
adopted and we can always amend a
 
02:36:51.710 --> 02:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
statute that way by you know we're just
 
02:36:53.870 --> 02:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
accepting out one and I'm not commenting
 
02:36:56.210 --> 02:36:56.220 align:start position:0%
on the policy I'm just commenting on the
 
02:37:07.849 --> 02:37:07.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:11.090 --> 02:37:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:57.050 --> 02:47:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:59.389 --> 02:47:59.399 align:start position:0%
it's already effective upon passage
 
02:48:01.730 --> 02:48:01.740 align:start position:0%
which is fantastic we don't want to lose
 
02:48:03.710 --> 02:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
60 days and start work in the middle of
 
02:48:05.630 --> 02:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
October regardless of which way we go
 
02:48:08.030 --> 02:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
the only thing I would say is
 
02:48:10.849 --> 02:48:10.859 align:start position:0%
um I I know that usually the house the
 
02:48:14.690 --> 02:48:14.700 align:start position:0%
speaker doesn't want Representatives
 
02:48:17.330 --> 02:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
um in Concord in July and usually the
 
02:48:19.790 --> 02:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
commissions start up in August so if
 
02:48:22.450 --> 02:48:22.460 align:start position:0%
this passes I would hope that
 
02:48:25.010 --> 02:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
you would go to the house speaker and
 
02:48:27.050 --> 02:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
request that the representatives that
 
02:48:28.969 --> 02:48:28.979 align:start position:0%
are going to be on this that they be
 
02:48:30.950 --> 02:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
able to serve during there's actually an
 
02:48:32.389 --> 02:48:32.399 align:start position:0%
automatic waiver for commission okay
 
02:48:34.309 --> 02:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
good all right so I just want to make
 
02:48:36.349 --> 02:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
sure that that is clear and so if it
 
02:48:37.790 --> 02:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
does become a committee instead of a
 
02:48:39.290 --> 02:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
commission we'll make sure that that is
 
02:48:41.030 --> 02:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
authorized as well because the speaker
 
02:48:43.550 --> 02:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
has the ability to authorize during the
 
02:48:46.250 --> 02:48:46.260 align:start position:0%
summer months so this is a commitment to
 
02:48:48.290 --> 02:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
work on this so I I know I believe that
 
02:48:49.969 --> 02:48:49.979 align:start position:0%
we'll have that support
 
02:48:52.849 --> 02:48:52.859 align:start position:0%
um what we've we've discovered also that
 
02:48:55.550 --> 02:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
the commission is on passage so I think
 
02:48:57.550 --> 02:48:57.560 align:start position:0%
that issue is
 
02:49:00.050 --> 02:49:00.060 align:start position:0%
and with the
 
02:49:03.830 --> 02:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
um the THC where we will offer
 
02:49:06.050 --> 02:49:06.060 align:start position:0%
um a two-year sunset
 
02:49:07.849 --> 02:49:07.859 align:start position:0%
through your Sunset to see to your
 
02:49:10.250 --> 02:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
sunset on the law that will give the
 
02:49:12.770 --> 02:49:12.780 align:start position:0%
legislature time to do the things I
 
02:49:14.210 --> 02:49:14.220 align:start position:0%
think that chairman Hunt is talking
 
02:49:16.790 --> 02:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
about I think it gives the legislature
 
02:49:18.889 --> 02:49:18.899 align:start position:0%
things representative Leon that you're
 
02:49:21.770 --> 02:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
talking about for businesses as well and
 
02:49:23.389 --> 02:49:23.399 align:start position:0%
it will give law enforcement the
 
02:49:27.290 --> 02:49:27.300 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come in and work if
 
02:49:29.210 --> 02:49:29.220 align:start position:0%
another piece of legislation needs to be
 
02:49:29.220 --> 02:49:30.110 align:start position:0%
another piece of legislation needs to be
filed

02:49:30.110 --> 02:49:30.120 align:start position:0%
filed
 
02:49:32.630 --> 02:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
that's the the one part I would speak to
 
02:49:34.610 --> 02:49:34.620 align:start position:0%
is what the business is if they didn't
 
02:49:36.590 --> 02:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
realize that they were operating in not
 
02:49:38.270 --> 02:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
a great space but a prohibited space
 
02:49:40.969 --> 02:49:40.979 align:start position:0%
that if we put the the effective date
 
02:49:42.590 --> 02:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
further out so that they have a chance
 
02:49:44.330 --> 02:49:44.340 align:start position:0%
to clear that inventory it'd be good to
 
02:49:46.370 --> 02:49:46.380 align:start position:0%
start that on January 1st
 
02:49:48.469 --> 02:49:48.479 align:start position:0%
well I I don't know about clearing the
 
02:49:52.190 --> 02:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
inventory it's illegal so I mean that's
 
02:49:54.530 --> 02:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
that's a separate issue but I do think
 
02:49:57.950 --> 02:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
two years is going to give chairman
 
02:50:00.050 --> 02:50:00.060 align:start position:0%
Hunt's committee the opportunity to do
 
02:50:02.570 --> 02:50:02.580 align:start position:0%
that work and if as they're going
 
02:50:04.130 --> 02:50:04.140 align:start position:0%
through they discovered there's a lot of
 
02:50:06.410 --> 02:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
issues with enforcement it will give
 
02:50:08.330 --> 02:50:08.340 align:start position:0%
chairman hunts committee the opportunity
 
02:50:11.210 --> 02:50:11.220 align:start position:0%
to work with uh criminal justice your
 
02:50:12.950 --> 02:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
criminal justice committee to resolve
 
02:50:15.170 --> 02:50:15.180 align:start position:0%
those issues and I think that's that's a
 
02:50:19.309 --> 02:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:22.070 --> 02:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
okay do we want to discuss more of the
 
02:50:24.410 --> 02:50:24.420 align:start position:0%
commission versus committee chairman
 
02:50:27.349 --> 02:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh so so where were you on the we we
 
02:50:29.809 --> 02:50:29.819 align:start position:0%
want to retain the commission okay how
 
02:50:31.550 --> 02:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
about the changing the language to
 
02:50:34.250 --> 02:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
ensure that that their focus is on
 
02:50:38.330 --> 02:50:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:40.090 --> 02:50:40.100 align:start position:0%
another yeah
 
02:50:42.830 --> 02:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
if I were to look at the wording section
 
02:50:46.730 --> 02:50:46.740 align:start position:0%
four we could all always add a duty
 
02:50:48.830 --> 02:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
um no I wasn't thinking in terms of
 
02:50:52.010 --> 02:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
energy I'm looking at what's this okay
 
02:50:52.020 --> 02:50:54.530 align:start position:0%
energy I'm looking at what's this okay
section

02:50:54.530 --> 02:50:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:56.929 --> 02:50:56.939 align:start position:0%
um okay so start out you started we have
 
02:50:58.250 --> 02:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
four starting with for the commission
 
02:50:59.570 --> 02:50:59.580 align:start position:0%
shall study the feasibility of
 
02:51:01.670 --> 02:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
establishing if they control system the
 
02:51:06.050 --> 02:51:06.060 align:start position:0%
commission shall create legislation
 
02:51:10.610 --> 02:51:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:13.510 --> 02:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to think
 
02:51:17.570 --> 02:51:17.580 align:start position:0%
legislation okay so commission to study
 
02:51:20.750 --> 02:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
State Control sales of cannabis and
 
02:51:24.410 --> 02:51:24.420 align:start position:0%
propose legislation well it starts to
 
02:51:26.150 --> 02:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
the commission sells study the
 
02:51:28.790 --> 02:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
feasibility this this commission shall
 
02:51:28.800 --> 02:51:31.250 align:start position:0%
feasibility this this commission shall
propose

02:51:31.250 --> 02:51:31.260 align:start position:0%
propose
 
02:51:34.610 --> 02:51:34.620 align:start position:0%
The Establishment I I promised myself
 
02:51:38.510 --> 02:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
legislation proposed legislation so I
 
02:51:40.610 --> 02:51:40.620 align:start position:0%
think so I think we as we mentioned
 
02:51:42.530 --> 02:51:42.540 align:start position:0%
before that would be an automatic
 
02:51:45.230 --> 02:51:45.240 align:start position:0%
endorsement of this and so I think we
 
02:51:47.090 --> 02:51:47.100 align:start position:0%
could say shall study the feasibility
 
02:51:51.170 --> 02:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
and then say we could say you know
 
02:51:53.929 --> 02:51:53.939 align:start position:0%
something like if if the committee feels
 
02:51:56.030 --> 02:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
like it is a feasible model then they
 
02:51:58.670 --> 02:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
shall develop legislation so it's a
 
02:52:00.710 --> 02:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
two-step so that's what I have problems
 
02:52:03.769 --> 02:52:03.779 align:start position:0%
with because that if leaves an opening
 
02:52:06.469 --> 02:52:06.479 align:start position:0%
for members of the of who are who are
 
02:52:08.830 --> 02:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
appointed that you're appointing
 
02:52:11.450 --> 02:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
to say and I know one of them on there
 
02:52:14.090 --> 02:52:14.100 align:start position:0%
he sent me an email today
 
02:52:17.090 --> 02:52:17.100 align:start position:0%
has said he knows this will not work
 
02:52:17.100 --> 02:52:18.110 align:start position:0%
has said he knows this will not work
period

02:52:18.110 --> 02:52:18.120 align:start position:0%
period
 
02:52:20.150 --> 02:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
and so therefore why would I want
 
02:52:22.370 --> 02:52:22.380 align:start position:0%
someone on this commission who is
 
02:52:25.550 --> 02:52:25.560 align:start position:0%
already predisposed to not falling
 
02:52:27.889 --> 02:52:27.899 align:start position:0%
through with what the intent of this
 
02:52:30.230 --> 02:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
legislation is
 
02:52:30.240 --> 02:52:31.190 align:start position:0%
legislation is
okay

02:52:31.190 --> 02:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:52:34.070 --> 02:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
Senator Evart you need to well I'm just
 
02:52:37.250 --> 02:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
concerned by by doing this are we is
 
02:52:40.309 --> 02:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
that an automatic endorsement then of of
 
02:52:42.950 --> 02:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
the legislation I'm I'm hoping that yes
 
02:52:45.349 --> 02:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
that I'm hoping that those five cents I
 
02:52:48.230 --> 02:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
I'm being frank with you yeah that we're
 
02:52:50.090 --> 02:52:50.100 align:start position:0%
looking we're looking for a buy-in here
 
02:52:52.429 --> 02:52:52.439 align:start position:0%
okay you know that you know that that in
 
02:52:54.889 --> 02:52:54.899 align:start position:0%
terms of you know you you uh the Senate
 
02:52:57.590 --> 02:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
killed Abacus Bill two years ago you
 
02:53:00.469 --> 02:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
killed this one so you killed both of
 
02:53:02.750 --> 02:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
them so now we're saying it's okay it's
 
02:53:04.030 --> 02:53:04.040 align:start position:0%
your turn
 
02:53:07.250 --> 02:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
it's your turn to put in a bill that's
 
02:53:07.260 --> 02:53:08.410 align:start position:0%
it's your turn to put in a bill that's
passable

02:53:08.410 --> 02:53:08.420 align:start position:0%
passable
 
02:53:12.650 --> 02:53:12.660 align:start position:0%
how about something that says um to
 
02:53:15.290 --> 02:53:15.300 align:start position:0%
study with the purpose of proposing
 
02:53:15.300 --> 02:53:16.910 align:start position:0%
study with the purpose of proposing
legislation

02:53:16.910 --> 02:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:53:18.830 --> 02:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
proposing a framework for legislation
 
02:53:18.840 --> 02:53:22.250 align:start position:0%
proposing a framework for legislation
yeah

02:53:22.250 --> 02:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:24.230 --> 02:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
framework would then be pushing it past
 
02:53:26.990 --> 02:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
this legislative session because if this
 
02:53:28.130 --> 02:53:28.140 align:start position:0%
is going to be finishing up and
 
02:53:29.750 --> 02:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
Reporting by November 1st they would
 
02:53:31.370 --> 02:53:31.380 align:start position:0%
need to have that legislation but it's
 
02:53:33.170 --> 02:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
also possible that with feasibility
 
02:53:35.210 --> 02:53:35.220 align:start position:0%
they're looking at that a state-run
 
02:53:36.769 --> 02:53:36.779 align:start position:0%
model which has never been done in this
 
02:53:38.450 --> 02:53:38.460 align:start position:0%
in this country does not really
 
02:53:40.370 --> 02:53:40.380 align:start position:0%
effectively work and that they have been
 
02:53:43.849 --> 02:53:43.859 align:start position:0%
in the state-run model for one of a more
 
02:53:43.859 --> 02:53:48.190 align:start position:0%
in the state-run model for one of a more
um

02:53:48.190 --> 02:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:50.389 --> 02:53:50.399 align:start position:0%
we're talking over each other um
 
02:53:51.830 --> 02:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy is still
 
02:53:53.330 --> 02:53:53.340 align:start position:0%
recognized that it'll be Senator Whitley
 
02:53:54.590 --> 02:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
and then it'll be representative Weber
 
02:53:56.809 --> 02:53:56.819 align:start position:0%
no no I'm all for studying it that's
 
02:53:58.730 --> 02:53:58.740 align:start position:0%
important to do this you know for a lot
 
02:54:01.670 --> 02:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
of reasons but on the other hand it's
 
02:54:04.130 --> 02:54:04.140 align:start position:0%
it's it's looking at specifically a
 
02:54:06.650 --> 02:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
state-run model so if you come in
 
02:54:08.570 --> 02:54:08.580 align:start position:0%
language and I agree with maybe language
 
02:54:11.330 --> 02:54:11.340 align:start position:0%
that proposes legislation but if it's
 
02:54:14.050 --> 02:54:14.060 align:start position:0%
specifically to have a state-run model
 
02:54:17.030 --> 02:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
then that may not work except for the
 
02:54:18.410 --> 02:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
fact that you're saying that we are
 
02:54:20.389 --> 02:54:20.399 align:start position:0%
looking at only a state-run model and it
 
02:54:29.170 --> 02:54:29.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:31.130 --> 02:54:31.140 align:start position:0%
representative Weber has a process
 
02:54:31.140 --> 02:54:33.769 align:start position:0%
representative Weber has a process
comment

02:54:33.769 --> 02:54:33.779 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:36.469 --> 02:54:36.479 align:start position:0%
this is I'm just going to remind you
 
02:54:38.750 --> 02:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
that this whatever this commission comes
 
02:54:42.110 --> 02:54:42.120 align:start position:0%
up with there are 400 members of the
 
02:54:44.090 --> 02:54:44.100 align:start position:0%
house and 24 members of the Senate every
 
02:54:46.990 --> 02:54:47.000 align:start position:0%
one of whom can and some of whom will
 
02:54:51.050 --> 02:54:51.060 align:start position:0%
propose different models because they
 
02:54:54.710 --> 02:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
have every year for forever and I think
 
02:54:57.889 --> 02:54:57.899 align:start position:0%
that the point of this
 
02:55:00.969 --> 02:55:00.979 align:start position:0%
study whatever we call it
 
02:55:04.210 --> 02:55:04.220 align:start position:0%
is specifically focused
 
02:55:06.650 --> 02:55:06.660 align:start position:0%
on this model
 
02:55:11.389 --> 02:55:11.399 align:start position:0%
we've we've studied other models and one
 
02:55:15.590 --> 02:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
of the reasons that I would prefer a
 
02:55:18.650 --> 02:55:18.660 align:start position:0%
committee to a commission is that
 
02:55:21.469 --> 02:55:21.479 align:start position:0%
particularly in the house
 
02:55:25.849 --> 02:55:25.859 align:start position:0%
uh it's a lot easier to have buy-in when
 
02:55:28.269 --> 02:55:28.279 align:start position:0%
the creating body
 
02:55:32.630 --> 02:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
is legislators rather than a named
 
02:55:35.750 --> 02:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
Commission because there is a perception
 
02:55:37.630 --> 02:55:37.640 align:start position:0%
in the house
 
02:55:42.110 --> 02:55:42.120 align:start position:0%
going back some years that some of the
 
02:55:43.910 --> 02:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
commissions that have created
 
02:55:46.570 --> 02:55:46.580 align:start position:0%
legislation in the past
 
02:55:50.269 --> 02:55:50.279 align:start position:0%
have been somehow stacked with people
 
02:55:54.290 --> 02:55:54.300 align:start position:0%
who are of one view or another view and
 
02:55:58.309 --> 02:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
therefore that the commission work is
 
02:56:02.870 --> 02:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
less valuable than it would be if we
 
02:56:04.490 --> 02:56:04.500 align:start position:0%
could create
 
02:56:07.370 --> 02:56:07.380 align:start position:0%
the perception that
 
02:56:11.450 --> 02:56:11.460 align:start position:0%
everybody who had a dog in the fight was
 
02:56:15.590 --> 02:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
listened to by legislators and that the
 
02:56:18.769 --> 02:56:18.779 align:start position:0%
resulting proposed legislation was
 
02:56:22.510 --> 02:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
created by legislators and what you want
 
02:56:26.090 --> 02:56:26.100 align:start position:0%
is a diversity and I think the five and
 
02:56:30.170 --> 02:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
five helps with this of legislators from
 
02:56:32.030 --> 02:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
different perspectives and different
 
02:56:36.830 --> 02:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
backgrounds and and unusually for a lot
 
02:56:38.870 --> 02:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
of the things we study five from the
 
02:56:41.570 --> 02:56:41.580 align:start position:0%
house and five from the Senate to make
 
02:56:43.969 --> 02:56:43.979 align:start position:0%
sure that there's buy-in legislatively
 
02:56:47.809 --> 02:56:47.819 align:start position:0%
for the product if there is a product we
 
02:56:49.070 --> 02:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
don't know if there's going to be a
 
02:56:51.769 --> 02:56:51.779 align:start position:0%
product because people may simply decide
 
02:56:54.050 --> 02:56:54.060 align:start position:0%
wow we can't figure out a way of making
 
02:56:56.570 --> 02:56:56.580 align:start position:0%
this work in which case that's worth
 
02:57:01.910 --> 02:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
knowing but I I see no problem I'll stop
 
02:57:03.469 --> 02:57:03.479 align:start position:0%
there because that was my process stuff
 
02:57:05.870 --> 02:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
and I'll stop arguing the stuff that and
 
02:57:08.269 --> 02:57:08.279 align:start position:0%
Senator is policy
 
02:57:11.990 --> 02:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
I I do think a
 
02:57:14.150 --> 02:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
um recognizing your concern about having
 
02:57:16.429 --> 02:57:16.439 align:start position:0%
an actual piece of legislation I think
 
02:57:18.889 --> 02:57:18.899 align:start position:0%
what Senator Carson has proposed is a
 
02:57:21.950 --> 02:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
good compromise so
 
02:57:23.990 --> 02:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
um I would like to say that um this is a
 
02:57:25.730 --> 02:57:25.740 align:start position:0%
process that the house is delivered year
 
02:57:28.250 --> 02:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
after year bills for legalization of
 
02:57:29.929 --> 02:57:29.939 align:start position:0%
cannabis it's something that's desired
 
02:57:31.610 --> 02:57:31.620 align:start position:0%
by the people of New Hampshire across
 
02:57:34.790 --> 02:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
the state I believe that we basically
 
02:57:36.469 --> 02:57:36.479 align:start position:0%
have the charge that if there's
 
02:57:37.910 --> 02:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
something that's going to pass and be
 
02:57:40.070 --> 02:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
able to make it all the way to law it
 
02:57:41.330 --> 02:57:41.340 align:start position:0%
needs to be a state-controlled model
 
02:57:43.610 --> 02:57:43.620 align:start position:0%
which is why I believe that trying to
 
02:57:45.590 --> 02:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
get to legislation with the state
 
02:57:47.330 --> 02:57:47.340 align:start position:0%
control model will let us see if that
 
02:57:49.550 --> 02:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
actually is a path forward or if it's
 
02:57:51.230 --> 02:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
just another attempt that's not going to
 
02:57:52.730 --> 02:57:52.740 align:start position:0%
go anywhere
 
02:57:55.130 --> 02:57:55.140 align:start position:0%
um in my view if we can't even agree on
 
02:57:56.870 --> 02:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
that charge of the committee and
 
02:57:58.610 --> 02:57:58.620 align:start position:0%
commission that kind of gives us our
 
02:58:01.550 --> 02:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
answer if we don't have enough enough
 
02:58:03.590 --> 02:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
confidence in a state-run model to even
 
02:58:05.809 --> 02:58:05.819 align:start position:0%
be able to agree that we're going to
 
02:58:08.030 --> 02:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
meet and draft this legislation perhaps
 
02:58:09.830 --> 02:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
that means that the efforts doomed in
 
02:58:12.429 --> 02:58:12.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:14.990 --> 02:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
answer thank you
 
02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:15.950 align:start position:0%
answer thank you
um

02:58:15.950 --> 02:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:18.230 --> 02:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
I think we just need to fine tune the
 
02:58:20.570 --> 02:58:20.580 align:start position:0%
title and I think that
 
02:58:22.910 --> 02:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
um I I would agree for proposing
 
02:58:26.510 --> 02:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
legislation because that really is the
 
02:58:28.610 --> 02:58:28.620 align:start position:0%
end point of it it's not going to keep
 
02:58:31.790 --> 02:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
going on we're going to look to see if
 
02:58:34.670 --> 02:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
this is going to work you're going to
 
02:58:36.769 --> 02:58:36.779 align:start position:0%
get the people at the table you're going
 
02:58:38.690 --> 02:58:38.700 align:start position:0%
to get the banking system you're going
 
02:58:40.849 --> 02:58:40.859 align:start position:0%
to get the Liquor Commission you're
 
02:58:42.410 --> 02:58:42.420 align:start position:0%
going to get all those folks that are
 
02:58:46.190 --> 02:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
going to be touched if we if we have a
 
02:58:48.349 --> 02:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
state controlled system and that's what
 
02:58:51.050 --> 02:58:51.060 align:start position:0%
this is if this was just to a commission
 
02:58:54.170 --> 02:58:54.180 align:start position:0%
to study the legalization of marijuana
 
02:58:57.830 --> 02:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
it you'd have everybody on that just
 
02:59:00.650 --> 02:59:00.660 align:start position:0%
like this but this is specific it is
 
02:59:03.830 --> 02:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
just to look at one possibility of a
 
02:59:07.030 --> 02:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
state controlled system and I understand
 
02:59:10.190 --> 02:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
a representative hunts
 
02:59:13.790 --> 02:59:13.800 align:start position:0%
um uh concern about this is just can go
 
02:59:16.730 --> 02:59:16.740 align:start position:0%
on and on and on no let's have this
 
02:59:19.610 --> 02:59:19.620 align:start position:0%
commission with the point of looking at
 
02:59:22.550 --> 02:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
this and proposing legislation and so
 
02:59:24.889 --> 02:59:24.899 align:start position:0%
let's see if we can get just something
 
02:59:27.950 --> 02:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
that we can agree upon in the title well
 
02:59:30.469 --> 02:59:30.479 align:start position:0%
commission to study I don't know with
 
02:59:32.330 --> 02:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
the purpose of proposing legislation
 
02:59:35.330 --> 02:59:35.340 align:start position:0%
State Control sales of cannabis it's the
 
02:59:38.210 --> 02:59:38.220 align:start position:0%
the purpose the purpose is to create to
 
02:59:40.670 --> 02:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
study and create so I think that's very
 
02:59:43.429 --> 02:59:43.439 align:start position:0%
clear you can put that both in the title
 
02:59:45.889 --> 02:59:45.899 align:start position:0%
so you can say commission to study with
 
02:59:47.450 --> 02:59:47.460 align:start position:0%
the purpose of proposing legislation
 
02:59:49.849 --> 02:59:49.859 align:start position:0%
then State controlled you can also put
 
02:59:52.250 --> 02:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
it in paragraph four the commission
 
02:59:54.110 --> 02:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
shall study with the purpose of
 
02:59:55.610 --> 02:59:55.620 align:start position:0%
proposing legislation the feasibility
 
02:59:56.929 --> 02:59:56.939 align:start position:0%
you can put that in two places yes
 
02:59:59.090 --> 02:59:59.100 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm looking for I do we
 
03:00:00.950 --> 03:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
actually actually already in six by the
 
03:00:04.190 --> 03:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
way yeah and and so I mean
 
03:00:08.750 --> 03:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:10.550 --> 03:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
a number of bills
 
03:00:12.410 --> 03:00:12.420 align:start position:0%
um and you're right they do tend to die
 
03:00:15.710 --> 03:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
in the Senate so let everybody come to
 
03:00:18.610 --> 03:00:18.620 align:start position:0%
the table and see what we can figure out
 
03:00:21.410 --> 03:00:21.420 align:start position:0%
and rather than
 
03:00:23.630 --> 03:00:23.640 align:start position:0%
um just something that's coming from
 
03:00:25.550 --> 03:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
somewhere and we really don't know and
 
03:00:27.349 --> 03:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
the information is constantly changing
 
03:00:29.630 --> 03:00:29.640 align:start position:0%
let's get our state folks to the table
 
03:00:31.670 --> 03:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
and see if we can even do this because
 
03:00:34.670 --> 03:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
if we decide if the commission decides
 
03:00:37.309 --> 03:00:37.319 align:start position:0%
we can't do this then guess what that's
 
03:00:39.769 --> 03:00:39.779 align:start position:0%
now off the table we don't need to
 
03:00:42.230 --> 03:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
discuss it anymore then we need to look
 
03:00:44.690 --> 03:00:44.700 align:start position:0%
at what other things are out there and
 
03:00:46.490 --> 03:00:46.500 align:start position:0%
see what we can come up with and
 
03:00:47.870 --> 03:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully by then the federal government
 
03:00:49.969 --> 03:00:49.979 align:start position:0%
will get its act together
 
03:00:52.070 --> 03:00:52.080 align:start position:0%
and they'll take care of this issue so
 
03:00:54.349 --> 03:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
we don't have to it ain't happening I
 
03:00:56.210 --> 03:00:56.220 align:start position:0%
actually have a suggestion for a change
 
03:00:58.010 --> 03:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
in the commission membership to better
 
03:01:00.110 --> 03:01:00.120 align:start position:0%
tailor to the need of hearing from
 
03:01:01.910 --> 03:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
people within the state
 
03:01:03.830 --> 03:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
um and then also staying within the RSA
 
03:01:05.690 --> 03:01:05.700 align:start position:0%
That was supposed to limit it
 
03:01:07.550 --> 03:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
um I I absolutely see the value of
 
03:01:09.230 --> 03:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
having the Attorney General the governor
 
03:01:12.469 --> 03:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
and the chair the liquor commissioner
 
03:01:13.969 --> 03:01:13.979 align:start position:0%
um that those would be very very
 
03:01:15.710 --> 03:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
important voices that need to have solid
 
03:01:19.130 --> 03:01:19.140 align:start position:0%
buy-in I'm concerned that there's voices
 
03:01:21.170 --> 03:01:21.180 align:start position:0%
that may not be heard by naming all the
 
03:01:23.150 --> 03:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
others specifically
 
03:01:24.710 --> 03:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
um and and so I think that perhaps a
 
03:01:26.870 --> 03:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
commission that has legislators and
 
03:01:29.809 --> 03:01:29.819 align:start position:0%
state agencies and state bodies involved
 
03:01:31.490 --> 03:01:31.500 align:start position:0%
on the commission but leave everybody
 
03:01:33.469 --> 03:01:33.479 align:start position:0%
who's not part of that state and would
 
03:01:35.630 --> 03:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
not be running that state model so that
 
03:01:37.370 --> 03:01:37.380 align:start position:0%
all those people who would be impacted
 
03:01:40.130 --> 03:01:40.140 align:start position:0%
and touched by this legislation can come
 
03:01:42.590 --> 03:01:42.600 align:start position:0%
be heard make sure that they are part of
 
03:01:44.690 --> 03:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
the process but they're not limited to
 
03:01:46.370 --> 03:01:46.380 align:start position:0%
just one representative from each of
 
03:01:48.710 --> 03:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
these groups because this is a very
 
03:01:50.690 --> 03:01:50.700 align:start position:0%
multifactorial issue you have the
 
03:01:52.670 --> 03:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
Growers you have the sellers you have
 
03:01:55.070 --> 03:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
the processors you have the testers and
 
03:01:56.929 --> 03:01:56.939 align:start position:0%
so by having one person as a
 
03:01:58.370 --> 03:01:58.380 align:start position:0%
representative it's hard to hear all of
 
03:02:02.210 --> 03:02:02.220 align:start position:0%
those voices so if if I may um these
 
03:02:04.309 --> 03:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
people were the members of this were
 
03:02:06.950 --> 03:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
chosen very carefully based upon the
 
03:02:10.190 --> 03:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
individuals that have come into us to
 
03:02:12.849 --> 03:02:12.859 align:start position:0%
the legislature that are here routinely
 
03:02:16.670 --> 03:02:16.680 align:start position:0%
and offer us testimony guidance on
 
03:02:20.090 --> 03:02:20.100 align:start position:0%
marijuana issues so you know we have a
 
03:02:21.889 --> 03:02:21.899 align:start position:0%
representative of the New Hampshire
 
03:02:25.730 --> 03:02:25.740 align:start position:0%
cannabis Association we've got a member
 
03:02:28.969 --> 03:02:28.979 align:start position:0%
from the ACLU we've got a representative
 
03:02:31.070 --> 03:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
from the alternate treatment centers
 
03:02:35.090 --> 03:02:35.100 align:start position:0%
we've got a medical professional that
 
03:02:37.370 --> 03:02:37.380 align:start position:0%
um appointed by the Senate President and
 
03:02:39.230 --> 03:02:39.240 align:start position:0%
a representative from the communities of
 
03:02:41.510 --> 03:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
alcohol and drug-free youth so we're
 
03:02:44.269 --> 03:02:44.279 align:start position:0%
getting both sides of the issue if there
 
03:02:46.610 --> 03:02:46.620 align:start position:0%
is someone else that you think should be
 
03:02:48.610 --> 03:02:48.620 align:start position:0%
on this commission please
 
03:02:52.490 --> 03:02:52.500 align:start position:0%
like you say it's adding is going the
 
03:02:53.929 --> 03:02:53.939 align:start position:0%
wrong direction for me right but I mean
 
03:02:55.490 --> 03:02:55.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not even sure a lot of that Bankers
 
03:02:57.309 --> 03:02:57.319 align:start position:0%
are still on here
 
03:03:00.769 --> 03:03:00.779 align:start position:0%
oh yeah well you know why because the
 
03:03:02.769 --> 03:03:02.779 align:start position:0%
bankers handle the money
 
03:03:07.010 --> 03:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
so I'm just saying it's more in some
 
03:03:08.690 --> 03:03:08.700 align:start position:0%
people the more the merrier but in my
 
03:03:10.610 --> 03:03:10.620 align:start position:0%
mind in every commission I've and I've
 
03:03:12.950 --> 03:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
been you know doing this as long as you
 
03:03:15.650 --> 03:03:15.660 align:start position:0%
have Sharon that the commissions are
 
03:03:17.450 --> 03:03:17.460 align:start position:0%
usually the more you I'll put on there
 
03:03:18.889 --> 03:03:18.899 align:start position:0%
the more it doesn't get anything done
 
03:03:21.530 --> 03:03:21.540 align:start position:0%
yeah okay that that the less less is
 
03:03:23.870 --> 03:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
better so that's why her proposal to say
 
03:03:25.910 --> 03:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
is why wouldn't we just limit it to
 
03:03:27.050 --> 03:03:27.060 align:start position:0%
people who are actual government
 
03:03:29.750 --> 03:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
government officials well if I
 
03:03:31.429 --> 03:03:31.439 align:start position:0%
Madam chair respond
 
03:03:34.010 --> 03:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
um I do think that these are individuals
 
03:03:37.730 --> 03:03:37.740 align:start position:0%
that voices are and the the variety of
 
03:03:39.349 --> 03:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
the industries and the people that are
 
03:03:42.710 --> 03:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
affected by this I think it needs to be
 
03:03:46.309 --> 03:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
what it is because we're dealing with a
 
03:03:49.190 --> 03:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
subject matter that is
 
03:03:52.490 --> 03:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
fraught with legal issues it is an
 
03:03:54.050 --> 03:03:54.060 align:start position:0%
illegal substance according to the
 
03:03:55.550 --> 03:03:55.560 align:start position:0%
federal government the federal
 
03:03:58.130 --> 03:03:58.140 align:start position:0%
government tends to turn a little bit of
 
03:04:00.650 --> 03:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
a blind eye towards it and that's the
 
03:04:03.950 --> 03:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
framework we need to operate with so we
 
03:04:07.130 --> 03:04:07.140 align:start position:0%
need to have someone from the police we
 
03:04:09.650 --> 03:04:09.660 align:start position:0%
need to have the bankers there we need
 
03:04:11.450 --> 03:04:11.460 align:start position:0%
and especially if we're talking about a
 
03:04:13.910 --> 03:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
state control system you need to have
 
03:04:15.830 --> 03:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission there because the
 
03:04:18.050 --> 03:04:18.060 align:start position:0%
governor has said I agree you 100 they
 
03:04:19.910 --> 03:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
should have it we also need but they're
 
03:04:21.290 --> 03:04:21.300 align:start position:0%
government employees they're all
 
03:04:25.330 --> 03:04:25.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:25.340 --> 03:04:27.070 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:04:27.070 --> 03:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:04:29.389 --> 03:04:29.399 align:start position:0%
are you are you focused I don't think
 
03:04:30.769 --> 03:04:30.779 align:start position:0%
you're a government employees
 
03:04:35.030 --> 03:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative Okay so
 
03:04:37.730 --> 03:04:37.740 align:start position:0%
let me suggest a compromise that might
 
03:04:40.010 --> 03:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
recognize let me suggest a compromise
 
03:04:42.010 --> 03:04:42.020 align:start position:0%
that might recognize
 
03:04:44.630 --> 03:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
the importance of all the people on this
 
03:04:44.640 --> 03:04:45.710 align:start position:0%
the importance of all the people on this
list

03:04:45.710 --> 03:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
list
 
03:04:48.349 --> 03:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
so what you do is you create a
 
03:04:51.410 --> 03:04:51.420 align:start position:0%
commission that is five and five House
 
03:04:54.710 --> 03:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
and Senate you add the Attorney General
 
03:04:57.410 --> 03:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
governor and chairman of the liquor
 
03:05:00.710 --> 03:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner designee so that's 13.
 
03:05:02.870 --> 03:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
those are the members of the commission
 
03:05:05.150 --> 03:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
and then you state
 
03:05:08.210 --> 03:05:08.220 align:start position:0%
the commission members shall consult
 
03:05:11.809 --> 03:05:11.819 align:start position:0%
with as Abby minimum
 
03:05:14.570 --> 03:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
and you list all the other stuff
 
03:05:17.389 --> 03:05:17.399 align:start position:0%
except that I I I think there were
 
03:05:19.910 --> 03:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
concerns about the member of the medical
 
03:05:22.010 --> 03:05:22.020 align:start position:0%
community appointed by the president of
 
03:05:25.010 --> 03:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
the Senate certainly you could just make
 
03:05:26.570 --> 03:05:26.580 align:start position:0%
that a generic
 
03:05:30.070 --> 03:05:30.080 align:start position:0%
member of the medical community
 
03:05:33.950 --> 03:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
by somebody it is it's it is a it is a
 
03:05:37.790 --> 03:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:43.370 --> 03:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
yeah I I get that but my point is if we
 
03:05:45.950 --> 03:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
put all the other ones as advisors
 
03:05:48.050 --> 03:05:48.060 align:start position:0%
rather than members of the commission
 
03:05:53.050 --> 03:05:53.060 align:start position:0%
and make it including but not limited to
 
03:05:53.060 --> 03:05:54.670 align:start position:0%
and make it including but not limited to
that

03:05:54.670 --> 03:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:05:58.370 --> 03:05:58.380 align:start position:0%
has the inclusivity but it also
 
03:06:01.010 --> 03:06:01.020 align:start position:0%
recognizes that these are the specific
 
03:06:03.530 --> 03:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
voices that we want to hear
 
03:06:07.910 --> 03:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
if I may respond we heard early on the
 
03:06:12.590 --> 03:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
the discussion about having voices and
 
03:06:14.389 --> 03:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
everyone being heard
 
03:06:16.730 --> 03:06:16.740 align:start position:0%
by having these folks on the commission
 
03:06:19.070 --> 03:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
their vote I mean not their vote but
 
03:06:21.130 --> 03:06:21.140 align:start position:0%
their voices are being heard
 
03:06:24.469 --> 03:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
it's but it's the people who are not on
 
03:06:26.870 --> 03:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
it here representative sorry Senator
 
03:06:28.790 --> 03:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
Carson is speaking Yeah it you're right
 
03:06:31.969 --> 03:06:31.979 align:start position:0%
it is a vote but these are all
 
03:06:35.570 --> 03:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
organizations that have been involved in
 
03:06:37.610 --> 03:06:37.620 align:start position:0%
the discussion of legalization of
 
03:06:40.330 --> 03:06:40.340 align:start position:0%
cannabis right from the very beginning
 
03:06:43.550 --> 03:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
and that's why they've been included I
 
03:06:45.530 --> 03:06:45.540 align:start position:0%
mean if we were to sit down and try and
 
03:06:48.530 --> 03:06:48.540 align:start position:0%
make try and make a list of everyone who
 
03:06:51.050 --> 03:06:51.060 align:start position:0%
has a stake in the game here
 
03:06:53.389 --> 03:06:53.399 align:start position:0%
I mean you want to talk about a huge
 
03:06:56.690 --> 03:06:56.700 align:start position:0%
commission but these are people that
 
03:06:59.750 --> 03:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
routinely every time there is a bill
 
03:07:03.349 --> 03:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
concerning marijuana they come to the
 
03:07:05.630 --> 03:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
legislature and they testify
 
03:07:09.410 --> 03:07:09.420 align:start position:0%
and I don't necessarily agree with them
 
03:07:11.870 --> 03:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
but I do believe their voices are
 
03:07:14.230 --> 03:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
important to be heard
 
03:07:16.969 --> 03:07:16.979 align:start position:0%
so I agree that the voices are to be
 
03:07:18.889 --> 03:07:18.899 align:start position:0%
heard but when you put a representative
 
03:07:22.010 --> 03:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
of a drug-free youth
 
03:07:25.130 --> 03:07:25.140 align:start position:0%
there is no way they could ever vote Yes
 
03:07:27.590 --> 03:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
their commitment of their organization
 
03:07:31.250 --> 03:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
is drug free so therefore you're putting
 
03:07:35.389 --> 03:07:35.399 align:start position:0%
a guaranteed no vote on this board so
 
03:07:36.650 --> 03:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
would you be
 
03:07:36.660 --> 03:07:37.309 align:start position:0%
would you be
um

03:07:37.309 --> 03:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:39.590 --> 03:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
of the um Drug Treatment Community
 
03:07:41.570 --> 03:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
someone who represents drug treatment
 
03:07:44.210 --> 03:07:44.220 align:start position:0%
communities would that make you feel a
 
03:07:45.830 --> 03:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
little more comfortable like I guess
 
03:07:47.450 --> 03:07:47.460 align:start position:0%
that would probably would because some
 
03:07:49.269 --> 03:07:49.279 align:start position:0%
both of them were four
 
03:07:51.469 --> 03:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
immunization but that's what I'm saying
 
03:07:53.809 --> 03:07:53.819 align:start position:0%
this gets get away from this stacking of
 
03:07:55.969 --> 03:07:55.979 align:start position:0%
a board let's just get away from the
 
03:07:57.349 --> 03:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
stacking the board this is get the
 
03:07:59.750 --> 03:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
people who you know that we allow these
 
03:08:01.510 --> 03:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
people to come in and speak and testify
 
03:08:04.370 --> 03:08:04.380 align:start position:0%
absolutely we allow them to tell us what
 
03:08:05.750 --> 03:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
they think or whatever the proposed
 
03:08:07.670 --> 03:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
legislation we absolutely want to hear
 
03:08:10.309 --> 03:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
from them but at the end of the day when
 
03:08:12.349 --> 03:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
there is a that final report and there's
 
03:08:14.570 --> 03:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
a vote
 
03:08:16.730 --> 03:08:16.740 align:start position:0%
you don't want to you know say well we
 
03:08:18.110 --> 03:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
knew all along that they were going to
 
03:08:19.610 --> 03:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
vote no
 
03:08:22.550 --> 03:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
why would why how could that's seems a
 
03:08:24.230 --> 03:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
little undemocratic to me representative
 
03:08:27.050 --> 03:08:27.060 align:start position:0%
Murphy and then Senator ivard thank you
 
03:08:28.610 --> 03:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
um you know we already went over the
 
03:08:30.349 --> 03:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
idea that we want to come up with some
 
03:08:32.990 --> 03:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation so from my
 
03:08:34.910 --> 03:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
simplistic look at this we make the
 
03:08:38.510 --> 03:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
commission five and five legislators and
 
03:08:40.790 --> 03:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
with that I'm sorry that's the committee
 
03:08:43.130 --> 03:08:43.140 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry you know yeah and then we
 
03:08:45.170 --> 03:08:45.180 align:start position:0%
basically have we can list if you want
 
03:08:47.269 --> 03:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
people that would be invited because I
 
03:08:49.010 --> 03:08:49.020 align:start position:0%
would argue that you need to have people
 
03:08:51.050 --> 03:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
from the atcs here the medical marijuana
 
03:08:52.670 --> 03:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
Community you have to have a
 
03:08:55.130 --> 03:08:55.140 align:start position:0%
representative from the medical society
 
03:08:57.230 --> 03:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
whether it's appointed by DHHS or the
 
03:08:58.370 --> 03:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
Department of Public Health and I'm just
 
03:09:00.710 --> 03:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
saying that if we're proposing that
 
03:09:02.269 --> 03:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
ultimately we want to get to legislation
 
03:09:04.070 --> 03:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't we just make it five and
 
03:09:06.710 --> 03:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
five and then have everybody that has a
 
03:09:10.370 --> 03:09:10.380 align:start position:0%
significant voice be invited if I may
 
03:09:11.929 --> 03:09:11.939 align:start position:0%
Madam chair we can't support that
 
03:09:13.070 --> 03:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
because now we're right back at a
 
03:09:13.080 --> 03:09:13.990 align:start position:0%
because now we're right back at a
committee

03:09:13.990 --> 03:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:09:17.210 --> 03:09:17.220 align:start position:0%
so what's the purpose what would be the
 
03:09:17.220 --> 03:09:18.590 align:start position:0%
so what's the purpose what would be the
purpose

03:09:18.590 --> 03:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
03:09:21.290 --> 03:09:21.300 align:start position:0%
um we we came up very carefully with
 
03:09:24.769 --> 03:09:24.779 align:start position:0%
this language and there are people I can
 
03:09:27.110 --> 03:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
look at this the representative from New
 
03:09:30.730 --> 03:09:30.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cannabis there well yes
 
03:09:33.530 --> 03:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
they've already said they will not vote
 
03:09:36.410 --> 03:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
they do not believe any any manufacturer
 
03:09:38.030 --> 03:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
would provide marijuana to The Liquor
 
03:09:40.130 --> 03:09:40.140 align:start position:0%
Commission they've already made clear
 
03:09:42.290 --> 03:09:42.300 align:start position:0%
that they don't believe it can work
 
03:09:43.969 --> 03:09:43.979 align:start position:0%
and what is the purpose of having the
 
03:09:43.979 --> 03:09:45.349 align:start position:0%
and what is the purpose of having the
commission

03:09:45.349 --> 03:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:09:45.359 --> 03:09:45.969 align:start position:0%
commission
um

03:09:45.969 --> 03:09:45.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:48.349 --> 03:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
they want private Enterprise They want
 
03:09:49.730 --> 03:09:49.740 align:start position:0%
to go back to the model the bill you
 
03:09:51.889 --> 03:09:51.899 align:start position:0%
just killed so I the reason I'm
 
03:09:53.570 --> 03:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
recommending that the commission be
 
03:09:55.730 --> 03:09:55.740 align:start position:0%
limited to the legislators the attorney
 
03:09:57.290 --> 03:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
general that will need to defend this
 
03:09:59.929 --> 03:09:59.939 align:start position:0%
the governor who would also need to sign
 
03:10:02.750 --> 03:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
or not at least not veto it and the
 
03:10:04.490 --> 03:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
liquor commissioner who underneath this
 
03:10:07.250 --> 03:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
model would need to implement it would
 
03:10:08.990 --> 03:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
it be it would give us the minimum one
 
03:10:10.849 --> 03:10:10.859 align:start position:0%
with advisory members in order to get
 
03:10:12.530 --> 03:10:12.540 align:start position:0%
those other viewpoints with all due
 
03:10:14.510 --> 03:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
respect Madam chair we're going right
 
03:10:17.030 --> 03:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
back to the commit committee that you
 
03:10:19.309 --> 03:10:19.319 align:start position:0%
wanted and we've said we're not going to
 
03:10:21.349 --> 03:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
support that we will support the
 
03:10:23.929 --> 03:10:23.939 align:start position:0%
commission with the language change to
 
03:10:23.939 --> 03:10:25.130 align:start position:0%
commission with the language change to
include

03:10:25.130 --> 03:10:25.140 align:start position:0%
include
 
03:10:27.950 --> 03:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
that there is an end point here that
 
03:10:30.370 --> 03:10:30.380 align:start position:0%
they are going to propose legislation
 
03:10:33.610 --> 03:10:33.620 align:start position:0%
and that's as far as we're willing to go
 
03:10:35.990 --> 03:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm hoping that we can just take a
 
03:10:38.389 --> 03:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
a minute because I think we are in a
 
03:10:40.910 --> 03:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
place where we're getting very close to
 
03:10:44.150 --> 03:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
agreement I think the other pieces in
 
03:10:46.550 --> 03:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
there are very important so if we can
 
03:10:48.110 --> 03:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
just take five minutes I think that
 
03:10:50.630 --> 03:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
would be really helpful sure five minute
 
03:10:53.110 --> 03:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
or a five minute break
 
03:10:53.120 --> 03:10:54.790 align:start position:0%
or a five minute break
okay

03:10:54.790 --> 03:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:10:57.050 --> 03:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
we'll take a five minute break I did
 
03:10:59.269 --> 03:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
propose for the atcs to have the before
 
03:11:02.590 --> 03:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:18.110 --> 03:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:18.120 --> 03:25:25.690 align:start position:0%
 
much

03:25:25.690 --> 03:25:25.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:28.550 --> 03:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:25:30.050 --> 03:25:30.060 align:start position:0%
welcome back to the committee of
 
03:25:32.389 --> 03:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
conference on House Bill 611 aye Senator
 
03:25:35.269 --> 03:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
Carson thank you madam chair I think uh
 
03:25:37.729 --> 03:25:37.739 align:start position:0%
we in the Senate I think we've reached
 
03:25:39.590 --> 03:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
an agreement
 
03:25:41.990 --> 03:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
um and I just want to go overdose
 
03:25:42.000 --> 03:25:42.530 align:start position:0%
um and I just want to go overdose
um

03:25:42.530 --> 03:25:42.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:46.790 --> 03:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
on the section concerning the THC that
 
03:25:50.510 --> 03:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
instead of two years it's one year
 
03:25:53.210 --> 03:25:53.220 align:start position:0%
um so the one year son said so it takes
 
03:25:55.969 --> 03:25:55.979 align:start position:0%
effective in 60 days so we would have to
 
03:25:58.910 --> 03:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
figure out just exactly when that is
 
03:26:01.010 --> 03:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
going to Sunset
 
03:26:04.010 --> 03:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
um and concerning the commission that we
 
03:26:05.990 --> 03:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
include language
 
03:26:08.450 --> 03:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
um that says something to the effect of
 
03:26:11.090 --> 03:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
that we are that
 
03:26:14.389 --> 03:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
they're going to study with the purpose
 
03:26:16.610 --> 03:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
of proposing legislation to make it very
 
03:26:19.309 --> 03:26:19.319 align:start position:0%
clear what exactly the charge of this
 
03:26:23.889 --> 03:26:23.899 align:start position:0%
commission is And in regards to the
 
03:26:28.309 --> 03:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
membership on the commission we hear we
 
03:26:32.090 --> 03:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
hear what you folks have to say and we
 
03:26:35.929 --> 03:26:35.939 align:start position:0%
would propose eliminating the New
 
03:26:38.269 --> 03:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cannabis Association which is
 
03:26:38.279 --> 03:26:39.229 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cannabis Association which is
H

03:26:39.229 --> 03:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
H
 
03:26:43.790 --> 03:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
as well as Jay the alternative treatment
 
03:26:43.800 --> 03:26:45.190 align:start position:0%
as well as Jay the alternative treatment
centers

03:26:45.190 --> 03:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
centers
 
03:26:48.410 --> 03:26:48.420 align:start position:0%
but with the caveat that there be a new
 
03:26:48.420 --> 03:26:49.330 align:start position:0%
but with the caveat that there be a new
section

03:26:49.330 --> 03:26:49.340 align:start position:0%
section
 
03:26:52.990 --> 03:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
that says that we will
 
03:26:56.389 --> 03:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
consult with an illicit testimony from
 
03:26:58.030 --> 03:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
these organizations
 
03:27:01.010 --> 03:27:01.020 align:start position:0%
so very specifically their voices are
 
03:27:03.370 --> 03:27:03.380 align:start position:0%
going to be heard during this process
 
03:27:06.229 --> 03:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
and I would suggest those are those
 
03:27:08.030 --> 03:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
organizations but not limited to those
 
03:27:10.370 --> 03:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
organizations yes right but I I would
 
03:27:12.950 --> 03:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
like those organizations named because
 
03:27:14.450 --> 03:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
that you're going to consult with them
 
03:27:16.130 --> 03:27:16.140 align:start position:0%
okay that you're going to consult and
 
03:27:25.969 --> 03:27:25.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:28.610 --> 03:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
um that's it those are the only two
 
03:27:30.729 --> 03:27:30.739 align:start position:0%
um there was some discussion about the
 
03:27:32.809 --> 03:27:32.819 align:start position:0%
representative communities for alcohol
 
03:27:35.330 --> 03:27:35.340 align:start position:0%
and drug-free youth but if you go down
 
03:27:38.090 --> 03:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
to section four of the handout that we
 
03:27:41.450 --> 03:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
have you'll see the charge um in section
 
03:27:44.269 --> 03:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
B is keeping marijuana away from kids
 
03:27:46.429 --> 03:27:46.439 align:start position:0%
and out of schools so that's why they're
 
03:27:46.439 --> 03:27:47.750 align:start position:0%
and out of schools so that's why they're
there

03:27:47.750 --> 03:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:27:50.750 --> 03:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
so that is our proposal as a compromise
 
03:27:53.090 --> 03:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
and the other piece is that maybe
 
03:27:54.950 --> 03:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
um the medical society should appoint
 
03:27:57.050 --> 03:27:57.060 align:start position:0%
someone for the medical community
 
03:27:59.389 --> 03:27:59.399 align:start position:0%
uh rather than the Senate correct yes
 
03:28:01.849 --> 03:28:01.859 align:start position:0%
Medical Society or it could be DHHS and
 
03:28:04.490 --> 03:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
public health I think from Medical
 
03:28:07.429 --> 03:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
Society there they don't they'll they'll
 
03:28:11.750 --> 03:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:13.610 --> 03:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
um sorry and just some clarification on
 
03:28:16.490 --> 03:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
the the medical professional is that to
 
03:28:18.830 --> 03:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
look at the health risks of cannabis or
 
03:28:21.769 --> 03:28:21.779 align:start position:0%
yes okay because if we have to issue
 
03:28:25.610 --> 03:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
warnings we need to know exactly what to
 
03:28:28.790 --> 03:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
warn people about the product and more
 
03:28:31.250 --> 03:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
and more information is coming out in
 
03:28:33.590 --> 03:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
fact Senator Whitley and I as members of
 
03:28:35.510 --> 03:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
Senate Judiciary just received a large
 
03:28:38.330 --> 03:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
packet of material from studies that are
 
03:28:40.490 --> 03:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
being done or have been done at
 
03:28:43.670 --> 03:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth so it's very important that
 
03:28:47.210 --> 03:28:47.220 align:start position:0%
everyone has that information because in
 
03:28:49.250 --> 03:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
creating a program you have to have the
 
03:28:52.729 --> 03:28:52.739 align:start position:0%
enforcement section and you have to have
 
03:28:56.030 --> 03:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
the legal section and it's about warning
 
03:28:57.370 --> 03:28:57.380 align:start position:0%
people about
 
03:29:00.229 --> 03:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
marijuana what that is and it's good to
 
03:29:03.889 --> 03:29:03.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:07.849 --> 03:29:07.859 align:start position:0%
yes representative Weber sure we don't
 
03:29:10.250 --> 03:29:10.260 align:start position:0%
know how to do it
 
03:29:12.769 --> 03:29:12.779 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering whether there's a way
 
03:29:12.779 --> 03:29:14.750 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering whether there's a way
of

03:29:14.750 --> 03:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:29:18.050 --> 03:29:18.060 align:start position:0%
um making the language that you
 
03:29:20.389 --> 03:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
requested about shallow consult with and
 
03:29:23.510 --> 03:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
illicit testimony from at a minimum the
 
03:29:26.570 --> 03:29:26.580 align:start position:0%
following people yes yes that's fine we
 
03:29:29.630 --> 03:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
don't want to put restraints on any
 
03:29:32.870 --> 03:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
person or any organization that wants to
 
03:29:36.590 --> 03:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
testify in favor or against right any
 
03:29:39.769 --> 03:29:39.779 align:start position:0%
kind of proposal so that would be fine
 
03:29:42.889 --> 03:29:42.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:44.150 --> 03:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
um I guess my one remaining question
 
03:29:45.710 --> 03:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
would be if we're able to get five
 
03:29:47.750 --> 03:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
volunteers from both bodies
 
03:29:49.250 --> 03:29:49.260 align:start position:0%
um if that seems to still be the right
 
03:29:50.330 --> 03:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
number of people
 
03:29:53.990 --> 03:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
um if I may Madam chair I I think there
 
03:29:55.729 --> 03:29:55.739 align:start position:0%
are more than enough people who are
 
03:29:58.610 --> 03:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
interested in this issue that would be
 
03:30:02.269 --> 03:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
willing to give up their time uh to see
 
03:30:04.309 --> 03:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
if we can even do this
 
03:30:06.889 --> 03:30:06.899 align:start position:0%
I'm assured that that is not going to be
 
03:30:10.969 --> 03:30:10.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:12.349 --> 03:30:12.359 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:30:12.359 --> 03:30:12.969 align:start position:0%
all right
um

03:30:12.969 --> 03:30:12.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:16.070 --> 03:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
sorry and then as a clarification I
 
03:30:18.110 --> 03:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
believe that the
 
03:30:20.150 --> 03:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
I apologize for potentially confusing
 
03:30:21.830 --> 03:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
the two bills but the one that it had an
 
03:30:24.769 --> 03:30:24.779 align:start position:0%
edit to the statutes on the underlying
 
03:30:26.330 --> 03:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
bill was the other Bill not this one
 
03:30:26.340 --> 03:30:27.550 align:start position:0%
bill was the other Bill not this one
correct

03:30:27.550 --> 03:30:27.560 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:30:30.469 --> 03:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yes so I just wanted to make
 
03:30:32.630 --> 03:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
sure we didn't miss an amendment to that
 
03:30:33.769 --> 03:30:33.779 align:start position:0%
but I guess it was a section four
 
03:30:35.450 --> 03:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
instead of a section five perfect so
 
03:30:36.950 --> 03:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
there had been a in the other bill that
 
03:30:38.990 --> 03:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
did not survive the process there had
 
03:30:41.090 --> 03:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
been a fall been a wrong reference so I
 
03:30:42.410 --> 03:30:42.420 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure that if it was
 
03:30:43.910 --> 03:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
this bill that we took care of that but
 
03:30:45.290 --> 03:30:45.300 align:start position:0%
it is not
 
03:30:47.750 --> 03:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
so we are looking to
 
03:30:50.630 --> 03:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
sorry are you taking notes on what it is
 
03:30:52.550 --> 03:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
that we're specifically including within
 
03:30:55.610 --> 03:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
there okay thank you bye
 
03:30:58.070 --> 03:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
okay so are you taking notes on our
 
03:31:00.110 --> 03:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
specific language
 
03:31:02.870 --> 03:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
okay fantastic so we are another summary
 
03:31:02.880 --> 03:31:04.150 align:start position:0%
okay fantastic so we are another summary
yeah

03:31:04.150 --> 03:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:31:06.290 --> 03:31:06.300 align:start position:0%
so you would need another do you want
 
03:31:09.889 --> 03:31:09.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:12.349 --> 03:31:12.359 align:start position:0%
okay all right so I have notes if that's
 
03:31:15.229 --> 03:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
helpful I'm gonna try to go to look at
 
03:31:17.929 --> 03:31:17.939 align:start position:0%
this chronologically
 
03:31:17.939 --> 03:31:19.370 align:start position:0%
this chronologically
um

03:31:19.370 --> 03:31:19.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:22.130 --> 03:31:22.140 align:start position:0%
the issue we have no issues with the
 
03:31:25.990 --> 03:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:28.250 --> 03:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
yes it
 
03:31:32.389 --> 03:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
um okay let's see uh relative I'll just
 
03:31:35.389 --> 03:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
go with this what you have here 611
 
03:31:38.090 --> 03:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
relative to eligibility criteria for the
 
03:31:40.309 --> 03:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program as amended
 
03:31:41.750 --> 03:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
by the Senate
 
03:31:44.450 --> 03:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
uh well no here right here oh I don't
 
03:31:45.650 --> 03:31:45.660 align:start position:0%
know what they want to do this is what
 
03:31:47.210 --> 03:31:47.220 align:start position:0%
so it would be
 
03:31:49.429 --> 03:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
um relative to out
 
03:31:51.710 --> 03:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
relative to eligibility criteria for the
 
03:31:53.210 --> 03:31:53.220 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program and
 
03:31:57.050 --> 03:31:57.060 align:start position:0%
establishing a commission to study
 
03:31:59.809 --> 03:31:59.819 align:start position:0%
yeah you'd have to with with the purpose
 
03:32:02.050 --> 03:32:02.060 align:start position:0%
of proposing legislation
 
03:32:04.849 --> 03:32:04.859 align:start position:0%
state-controlled sales yes so that's the
 
03:32:09.229 --> 03:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:10.969 --> 03:32:10.979 align:start position:0%
and then that would be what the same
 
03:32:13.490 --> 03:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
same uh language change and the amended
 
03:32:16.729 --> 03:32:16.739 align:start position:0%
analysis bullet two yeah okay sections
 
03:32:18.710 --> 03:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
one and two remain don't worry about the
 
03:32:22.250 --> 03:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
amended analysis okay
 
03:32:24.410 --> 03:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
um and then so one and two are unchanged
 
03:32:24.420 --> 03:32:25.190 align:start position:0%
um and then so one and two are unchanged
one

03:32:25.190 --> 03:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:32:27.590 --> 03:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's unchanged it looks like section two
 
03:32:30.830 --> 03:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
to the amount of analysis is to study
 
03:32:33.110 --> 03:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
the commission to study
 
03:32:34.849 --> 03:32:34.859 align:start position:0%
um but it looks here it's a new section
 
03:32:38.389 --> 03:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
three to study right we got it yeah okay
 
03:32:41.210 --> 03:32:41.220 align:start position:0%
so that's where the first changes come
 
03:32:43.190 --> 03:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
in where you insert the language
 
03:32:45.290 --> 03:32:45.300 align:start position:0%
commission to study with the purpose of
 
03:32:49.190 --> 03:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
proposing legislation to the final
 
03:32:52.370 --> 03:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
um and then we are going to remove
 
03:32:56.510 --> 03:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
um and renumber section uh remove H and
 
03:33:00.410 --> 03:33:00.420 align:start position:0%
J so the representative from the ACLU
 
03:33:04.729 --> 03:33:04.739 align:start position:0%
will now become the new age and K will
 
03:33:07.610 --> 03:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
become the new I and L would become the
 
03:33:07.620 --> 03:33:08.630 align:start position:0%
become the new I and L would become the
new

03:33:08.630 --> 03:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
new
 
03:33:11.389 --> 03:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
um J
 
03:33:15.889 --> 03:33:15.899 align:start position:0%
um and then I think that is and then in
 
03:33:18.170 --> 03:33:18.180 align:start position:0%
three we need the the language the
 
03:33:19.969 --> 03:33:19.979 align:start position:0%
commission shall study the feasibility
 
03:33:22.429 --> 03:33:22.439 align:start position:0%
shall study with the purpose of
 
03:33:25.429 --> 03:33:25.439 align:start position:0%
proposing legislation the feasibility
 
03:33:27.290 --> 03:33:27.300 align:start position:0%
um we also need to add the
 
03:33:29.150 --> 03:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
um that the commission will consult
 
03:33:32.150 --> 03:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
analystic testimony from at minimum but
 
03:33:35.210 --> 03:33:35.220 align:start position:0%
that goes after that goes after this is
 
03:33:39.050 --> 03:33:39.060 align:start position:0%
this is the purpose section right now oh
 
03:33:40.790 --> 03:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
yeah so so then the purpose that
 
03:33:42.170 --> 03:33:42.180 align:start position:0%
actually is not section three that's
 
03:33:44.990 --> 03:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
section four the study show right and
 
03:33:47.450 --> 03:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
that's the same study that feasibility
 
03:33:50.929 --> 03:33:50.939 align:start position:0%
with um with the with the proposed
 
03:33:53.990 --> 03:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
legislation and then but but but you're
 
03:33:56.750 --> 03:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
right it did come before at the end of
 
03:33:56.760 --> 03:33:58.370 align:start position:0%
right it did come before at the end of
section

03:33:58.370 --> 03:33:58.380 align:start position:0%
section
 
03:33:58.380 --> 03:34:00.590 align:start position:0%
section
two

03:34:00.590 --> 03:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
two
 
03:34:03.469 --> 03:34:03.479 align:start position:0%
let's see two that was just the numbers
 
03:34:05.929 --> 03:34:05.939 align:start position:0%
so we've got the members but at the end
 
03:34:08.990 --> 03:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
of the members we also need the
 
03:34:11.269 --> 03:34:11.279 align:start position:0%
provision that the commission shall
 
03:34:14.690 --> 03:34:14.700 align:start position:0%
consult with and elicit testimony from
 
03:34:17.030 --> 03:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
at a minimum the following we could also
 
03:34:19.910 --> 03:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
make that um so we start if you look at
 
03:34:23.450 --> 03:34:23.460 align:start position:0%
section five six seven those are where
 
03:34:25.490 --> 03:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
we're adding duties they shall they
 
03:34:28.010 --> 03:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
shall they shall so perhaps they shall
 
03:34:30.710 --> 03:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
elicit should that section should go yep
 
03:34:32.870 --> 03:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
that's fine yeah okay so we'll put that
 
03:34:37.150 --> 03:34:37.160 align:start position:0%
in here will that be a new session six
 
03:34:40.070 --> 03:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
by standalone
 
03:34:42.290 --> 03:34:42.300 align:start position:0%
um I I think as a standalone it'll be
 
03:34:44.269 --> 03:34:44.279 align:start position:0%
it'll be a little bit more clear that
 
03:34:46.309 --> 03:34:46.319 align:start position:0%
while while we do have an understanding
 
03:34:48.050 --> 03:34:48.060 align:start position:0%
of a lot of opposition to the state-run
 
03:34:49.729 --> 03:34:49.739 align:start position:0%
model those voices are very very
 
03:34:51.469 --> 03:34:51.479 align:start position:0%
important well we're not gonna We're not
 
03:34:53.290 --> 03:34:53.300 align:start position:0%
gonna say anything
 
03:34:56.690 --> 03:34:56.700 align:start position:0%
I think that we just make it we need to
 
03:34:59.990 --> 03:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
make it very clear that
 
03:35:00.000 --> 03:35:00.830 align:start position:0%
make it very clear that
um

03:35:00.830 --> 03:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:03.950 --> 03:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
that they they're going to elicit
 
03:35:06.349 --> 03:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
testimony from
 
03:35:08.510 --> 03:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
um these organizations that we've taken
 
03:35:11.630 --> 03:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
out as well as anyone else so you can
 
03:35:14.809 --> 03:35:14.819 align:start position:0%
add it before you want to do four or
 
03:35:18.050 --> 03:35:18.060 align:start position:0%
five or between five and six but if if
 
03:35:20.150 --> 03:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
you do it just at the bottom of Roman 2
 
03:35:23.269 --> 03:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
which is where we took them out of
 
03:35:27.650 --> 03:35:27.660 align:start position:0%
um so you've got a through uh what's now
 
03:35:31.550 --> 03:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
a through J and then you say just have a
 
03:35:33.889 --> 03:35:33.899 align:start position:0%
freestanding sentence that says the
 
03:35:36.050 --> 03:35:36.060 align:start position:0%
commission shall consult with and
 
03:35:38.389 --> 03:35:38.399 align:start position:0%
delicious and illicit testimony from
 
03:35:41.150 --> 03:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
yeah at a minimum the following so it's
 
03:35:43.070 --> 03:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
right at the bottom under J that sounds
 
03:35:45.349 --> 03:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
good is that okay so so that's part of
 
03:35:48.170 --> 03:35:48.180 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral two yeah
 
03:35:48.180 --> 03:35:50.750 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral two yeah
yeah

03:35:50.750 --> 03:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:53.570 --> 03:35:53.580 align:start position:0%
yeah and then in Roman numeral
 
03:35:57.429 --> 03:35:57.439 align:start position:0%
four we need to add she'll study
 
03:36:00.050 --> 03:36:00.060 align:start position:0%
basically shall study with the purpose
 
03:36:02.870 --> 03:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
of proposal the feasibility of
 
03:36:05.750 --> 03:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
establishing okay okay and I think
 
03:36:08.269 --> 03:36:08.279 align:start position:0%
that's all in that particular section
 
03:36:10.550 --> 03:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
03:36:10.560 --> 03:36:11.870 align:start position:0%
and I think
um

03:36:11.870 --> 03:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:15.410 --> 03:36:15.420 align:start position:0%
when we come to the hemp project uh
 
03:36:18.050 --> 03:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
product I think we need we need to put
 
03:36:19.790 --> 03:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
the sunset in
 
03:36:19.800 --> 03:36:20.809 align:start position:0%
the sunset in
um

03:36:20.809 --> 03:36:20.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:23.090 --> 03:36:23.100 align:start position:0%
I since we don't know what date it'll be
 
03:36:25.670 --> 03:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
effective and because plus 60 days will
 
03:36:27.469 --> 03:36:27.479 align:start position:0%
probably fall sometime in August would
 
03:36:29.090 --> 03:36:29.100 align:start position:0%
it make sense to make that effective
 
03:36:30.710 --> 03:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
September 1st and then make the repeal
 
03:36:34.849 --> 03:36:34.859 align:start position:0%
September 1st of 2024 of effective 23.
 
03:36:38.090 --> 03:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
you just do one year from the effective
 
03:36:40.010 --> 03:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
normally you just do it one year from an
 
03:36:42.410 --> 03:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
effective date okay so we'll do that one
 
03:36:44.150 --> 03:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
year from the effective date so then we
 
03:36:45.769 --> 03:36:45.779 align:start position:0%
would need to add a section 7 and
 
03:36:47.630 --> 03:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
renumber the effective date with the
 
03:36:47.640 --> 03:36:48.650 align:start position:0%
renumber the effective date with the
repeal

03:36:48.650 --> 03:36:48.660 align:start position:0%
repeal
 
03:36:50.210 --> 03:36:50.220 align:start position:0%
so you're going to be spending a lot of
 
03:36:53.750 --> 03:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
time with OLS yes I will okay you have
 
03:36:55.130 --> 03:36:55.140 align:start position:0%
my notes for me
 
03:36:57.410 --> 03:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
thank you okay she got it so it seems
 
03:37:02.349 --> 03:37:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:05.510 --> 03:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
I guess all those in favor say aye aye
 
03:37:07.429 --> 03:37:07.439 align:start position:0%
other supposed to say
 
03:37:10.370 --> 03:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you like your doing
 
03:37:11.929 --> 03:37:11.939 align:start position:0%
business with you absolutely it's nice
 
03:37:16.790 --> 03:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:18.469 --> 03:37:18.479 align:start position:0%
with that we conclude the committee of
 
03:37:21.889 --> 03:37:21.899 align:start position:0%
conference on House Bill 611.
 
03:37:25.429 --> 03:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
