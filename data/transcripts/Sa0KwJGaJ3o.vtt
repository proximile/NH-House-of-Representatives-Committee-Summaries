Friday the following week we will be
 
00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
that's during the
 
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
break uh the February break and we will
 
00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and so I'm just advising you
 
00:15:26.189 --> 00:15:26.199 align:start position:0%
that we will be most likely executing
 
00:15:29.430 --> 00:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
the bills which we see here on this list
 
00:15:32.069 --> 00:15:32.079 align:start position:0%
here that we're going to take that
 
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
information and pile it into a bill
 
00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:35.240 align:start position:0%
which we're going to use to move forward
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
to division two so we're going to try to
 
00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
whittle that this list down that would
 
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
be that week of Tuesday in the last
 
00:15:46.269 --> 00:15:46.279 align:start position:0%
Tuesday in the month and we'll start in
 
00:15:48.509 --> 00:15:48.519 align:start position:0%
the morning pardon
 
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
me we will be executing yes we will be
 
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
executing and we may end up doing more
 
00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
work what I have to do is that whatever
 
00:15:59.470 --> 00:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to send forward to
 
00:16:02.749 --> 00:16:02.759 align:start position:0%
finance that gives us that last week
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
within this month to work with LBA and
 
00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
to work with those who are crafting
 
00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
amending language to get that done then
 
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
the following Tuesday which is the first
 
00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:14.949 align:start position:0%
the following Tuesday which is the first
Tuesday

00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
Tuesday
 
00:16:14.959 --> 00:16:16.990 align:start position:0%
Tuesday
in

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:17.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
March we will be taking action on
 
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
everything that's an early
 
00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
bill because we have to have that report
 
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
by noon the following day into the
 
00:16:33.309 --> 00:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
clerk's office on the 5th so we're
 
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
closing down that's why we need to use
 
00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:38.680 align:start position:0%
that that one week day during the
 
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
February break very fortunate when I was
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
on education policy last year we used
 
00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
every day in here uh so we're fortunate
 
00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:50.319 align:start position:0%
to have the fewer bills however we have
 
00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:52.279 align:start position:0%
some very critical bills and we're going
 
00:16:54.509 --> 00:16:54.519 align:start position:0%
to need some time after we have that
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
Tuesday meeting during the break to work
 
00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
with the LBA and work and then come back
 
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
with those for action on the following
 
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:16.669 --> 00:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
start are you guys meeting at all on
 
00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:19.640 align:start position:0%
that uh first or that Tuesday during
 
00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:22.959 align:start position:0%
break I thought is that
 
00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
25th so we we got to coordinate we're
 
00:17:27.549 --> 00:17:27.559 align:start position:0%
trying to coordinate with them uh I
 
00:17:30.390 --> 00:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
think assume 10:00 for for current
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
Pardon Me Assume 10:00 a.m. yeah assume
 
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
10: a.m. it could slide to that 10:30
 
00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
but assume 10: a.m. so but it will be on
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
that Tuesday not later on in that week
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so just for clarity yeah um
 
00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
the next three Tuesdays yeah and there
 
00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
will be exec on all three of them and
 
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
other than that the next two weeks we
 
00:17:59.549 --> 00:17:59.559 align:start position:0%
won't meet it a second day
 
00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
but I think we should hold on anybody's
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
calendar the morning of Wednesday the
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
5th just in case we need it for cleanup
 
00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
depending on how we fared on Tuesday the
 
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
4th that that's basically sop standard
 
00:18:15.789 --> 00:18:15.799 align:start position:0%
operating procedure if we we need an
 
00:18:19.149 --> 00:18:19.159 align:start position:0%
amendment made on the 4th uh we have to
 
00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
do some rushing and then we come in on
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
the morning of the Fifth Fifth get that
 
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
done and we have to have that done by
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
noon on on on the 5th Wednesday
 
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
so that's where we are
 
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
today um we're going to start looking at
 
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
these bills and um I'm not going to go
 
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
down walking through each individual
 
00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
Bill what we want to do is
 
00:18:44.669 --> 00:18:44.679 align:start position:0%
start moving
 
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
towards a a process a a a overview of
 
00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
the procedure that we want to follow in
 
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
putting together a budget bill there's a
 
00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
lot of different scenarios we've seen on
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
this some of doubling the swap some of
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
working with uh the current type formula
 
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
moving things all to the left there's uh
 
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
other bills are coming in saying okay
 
00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:09.159 align:start position:0%
let's talk about fiscal capacity
 
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
disparity Aid and let's talk about
 
00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:13.240 align:start position:0%
relief Aid we see all that and then we
 
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
also see within the catastropic side of
 
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
reduce it to three and a half to two and
 
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
a half um more money at the front side
 
00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:23.039 align:start position:0%
of that um then that gets into the
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
discussion of the differentiated Aid to
 
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:28.440 align:start position:0%
component of special education so um it
 
00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
work we're going to put it all on the
 
00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
table today and try to discuss it then I
 
00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
would advise either caucus to get
 
00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
together and try to rope in some angle
 
00:19:38.909 --> 00:19:38.919 align:start position:0%
that you're after so because we're going
 
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
to have to narrow this thing down and we
 
00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:42.520 align:start position:0%
will with the exact sessions which are
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:19:46.149 --> 00:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
follow so
 
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
um in looking at where we are right now
 
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
I had made a I'm sure you all have this
 
00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to hand out to you a
 
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
formula which shows if we stay just like
 
00:19:59.310 --> 00:19:59.320 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
what's it going to look like in FY 26 in
 
00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
terms of the various columns so I'm
 
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
going to hand that out to
 
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:19.799 align:start position:0%
this I think most everybody has
 
00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:23.240 align:start position:0%
it but in case you didn't bring it in
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
computer it's nice to cou one that's
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
less faint well that has a few pencil
 
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
marks on it too and up left hand corner
 
00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
is a little stain where the coffee fell
 
00:20:38.669 --> 00:20:38.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
once which is typical when I'm touching
 
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
things it's a working document yes so
 
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:48.200 align:start position:0%
just looking across it we have the of
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
course the base cost on this formula
 
00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
then we have three areas of
 
00:20:54.909 --> 00:20:54.919 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid then we're walking in
 
00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
and calculating the cost of an adequate
 
00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919 align:start position:0%
education and and the swep and you can
 
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
see the grants on the right hand side
 
00:21:03.029 --> 00:21:03.039 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant we've
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
discussed that before there is a hold
 
00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
harmless and that's ratcheting down uh
 
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
each bium by
 
00:21:13.269 --> 00:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
20% and so and we have the issue of the
 
00:21:16.269 --> 00:21:16.279 align:start position:0%
excess SWAT and this formula that you
 
00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
see right here does not bring the excess
 
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
swap back to the state um that is also
 
00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
on the table for discussion or where we
 
00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
need to go with a formula it's remember
 
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
the FY 26
 
00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:32.360 align:start position:0%
budget uh involving the swep excess is
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
roughly around 28 plus million
 
00:21:40.630 --> 00:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
do so what I'd like to do is
 
00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
um start to discuss uh various options
 
00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
we have on this looking at these
 
00:21:50.269 --> 00:21:50.279 align:start position:0%
bills and let's take take the ones not
 
00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
dealing with catastrophic aid for not
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
first let's go because we've had a
 
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
little bit of discussion on that that's
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
the first that that that's the first one
 
00:21:58.720 --> 00:21:59.870 align:start position:0%
the first that that that's the first one
life

00:21:59.870 --> 00:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
life
 
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:13.720 align:start position:0%
bills so starting with HB 137 then
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
relative allocating excess Statewide Ed
 
00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:18.799 align:start position:0%
education property tax funds for local
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
137 okay 137 is a bill that came in from
 
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
uh representative cordelli it it's one
 
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%
where that keeps the swep money and
 
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
allows the municipality receiving that
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
excess swep to use it in any purpose
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
which is education
 
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
oriented that's just quick
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
summary um let's discuss that where are
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
we on this concept of swep coming back
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
into state for redistribution or back to
 
00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.230 align:start position:0%
into state for redistribution or back to
the

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:19.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
fund or leaving it to the municipality
 
00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:26.559 align:start position:0%
yes represent spillsbury so just uh to
 
00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
frame the discussion this is essentially
 
00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
the diametric opposite of 739 which I
 
00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.190 align:start position:0%
the diametric opposite of 739 which I
introduced

00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:35.240 align:start position:0%
yesterday um and I do think it's a
 
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
fundamental conversation uh for the
 
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
committee obviously I've expressed my
 
00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
opinion that I think that uh our hand
 
00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
hasn't been forced yet but it's moving
 
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
towards the inevitable that we need to
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh call for the exess to be remitted to
 
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:54.909 align:start position:0%
uh call for the exess to be remitted to
the

00:23:54.909 --> 00:23:54.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
Dr and and and this is not much
 
00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:00.230 align:start position:0%
Dr and and and this is not much
different

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:24:02.269 --> 00:24:02.279 align:start position:0%
than well it's a little bit different
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
than a bill we had back and I'm looking
 
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
at 2011 was HB
 
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
337 that's when this all shifted in
 
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
2011 and there was a bill put forward
 
00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:15.640 align:start position:0%
which was used to carry forward the
 
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
changes but when it was introduced it
 
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
was introduced saying that the
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities could keep the excess as
 
00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
long as it was used for specific two
 
00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
areas one for building Aid and so if
 
00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
they were applying for a $3 million
 
00:24:33.389 --> 00:24:33.399 align:start position:0%
project and they had in their fund $2
 
00:24:35.669 --> 00:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
million they would only be able to seek
 
00:24:39.149 --> 00:24:39.159 align:start position:0%
a million bucks um that's just a quick
 
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
overview of that and the other option
 
00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
was to direct the money towards special
 
00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
education Aid so it would be going after
 
00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:50.039 align:start position:0%
the old catastrophic Aid they could use
 
00:24:51.789 --> 00:24:51.799 align:start position:0%
that excess for that that was what that
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
bill back then then so that's a a little
 
00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
different than the the one we're looking
 
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
at but those are some of the options so
 
00:25:00.669 --> 00:25:00.679 align:start position:0%
you can either say you keep it and use
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
it for education purposes as we're doing
 
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
or narrow it down or say you don't keep
 
00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:10.120 align:start position:0%
it and it moves back into the the
 
00:25:14.029 --> 00:25:14.039 align:start position:0%
formula the state repent
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair good morning
 
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
everybody um so two
 
00:25:22.389 --> 00:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
things the first is just for
 
00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
clarification the analysis of the bill
 
00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
references that it's would be the funds
 
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
would be available to the local
 
00:25:32.669 --> 00:25:32.679 align:start position:0%
municipality for school and Municipal
 
00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
purposes I don't think that's what the
 
00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:37.240 align:start position:0%
bill says but I just want to clarify
 
00:25:40.029 --> 00:25:40.039 align:start position:0%
that because Municipal is obviously more
 
00:25:40.039 --> 00:25:43.909 align:start position:0%
that because Municipal is obviously more
than

00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:47.149 --> 00:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
school okay
 
00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:53.240 align:start position:0%
then uh believing that it is in fact not
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
Municipal that it is for school purposes
 
00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
in the in the bill language
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
and as noted in dr's fiscal note it's
 
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
just codifying what's happening now I
 
00:26:07.389 --> 00:26:07.399 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily see that we even need
 
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
this even if we agreed with it and I
 
00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
concur with representative spillsbury
 
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
that we're just on the cusp of hearing
 
00:26:17.389 --> 00:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
from the court that we can't do this
 
00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:21.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
but any further discussion on that from
 
00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
I think it would be good to hear from
 
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
representative fellas um about her bill
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
which uh takes swept in another
 
00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
Direction um yeah so I don't remember
 
00:26:42.269 --> 00:26:42.279 align:start position:0%
the number of it right now but which one
 
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
was it it eliminates 527 perhaps yeah
 
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
it's the next one down on the list I
 
00:26:49.549 --> 00:26:49.559 align:start position:0%
believe yeah that's that's I I remember
 
00:26:53.789 --> 00:26:53.799 align:start position:0%
what it's like um so
 
00:26:58.389 --> 00:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:01.240 align:start position:0%
to go back to the history of swep that
 
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
it was created back in
 
00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:06.760 align:start position:0%
1999 in response to the Claremont
 
00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:10.120 align:start position:0%
lawsuit so the state had to convince the
 
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
court or show to the court that the
 
00:27:16.269 --> 00:27:16.279 align:start position:0%
state was making a substantial increase
 
00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
in the aid that it was providing to the
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
school districts so it did um changed
 
00:27:27.950 --> 00:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
the allocation formula and it did send
 
00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
more more money to school districts but
 
00:27:32.510 --> 00:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
then it
 
00:27:36.269 --> 00:27:36.279 align:start position:0%
also just looked at the local tax bill
 
00:27:39.549 --> 00:27:39.559 align:start position:0%
and declared that a percentage of that
 
00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
local tax property tax bill for
 
00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
Education was actually State money as
 
00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
opposed to local money and it made zero
 
00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
impact on anybody's property tax bill
 
00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:58.389 align:start position:0%
impact on anybody's property tax bill
because

00:27:58.389 --> 00:27:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:01.640 align:start position:0%
all the cost of an adequate
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
education was then and still is set much
 
00:28:08.669 --> 00:28:08.679 align:start position:0%
lower than any school district could
 
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
possibly run on that amount per student
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
so there's
 
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
always additional local money that has
 
00:28:23.149 --> 00:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
to be raised locally to fund the school
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
districts every single one of
 
00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:39.389 --> 00:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
that well one thing so one one point
 
00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to make is
 
00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:45.039 align:start position:0%
that the only substantial source of
 
00:28:47.909 --> 00:28:47.919 align:start position:0%
Revenue that school districts that towns
 
00:28:50.909 --> 00:28:50.919 align:start position:0%
municipalities have um including their
 
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
school districts the only significant
 
00:28:55.549 --> 00:28:55.559 align:start position:0%
sort of Revenue they have is the
 
00:28:58.509 --> 00:28:58.519 align:start position:0%
property tax they're they get get some
 
00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
money from car registration but you're
 
00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
not going to get too far with that the
 
00:29:04.389 --> 00:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
state has no
 
00:29:04.399 --> 00:29:05.950 align:start position:0%
state has no
business

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:05.960 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:10.120 align:start position:0%
declaring part of their the property tax
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
to be a state tax and the state should
 
00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:17.480 align:start position:0%
never be um tap you know tapping that
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
source of Revenue because the
 
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities need it it's just
 
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and in terms of the
 
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
argument that's being argued in court
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
that says it's it's not that you can't
 
00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:35.320 align:start position:0%
have any
 
00:29:39.389 --> 00:29:39.399 align:start position:0%
excess that's argument is based on the
 
00:29:39.399 --> 00:29:40.990 align:start position:0%
excess that's argument is based on the
fact

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
fact
 
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
that um they're looking at statutes and
 
00:29:48.350 --> 00:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
and related to Pro to taxes that that's
 
00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
how you can't have a you couldn't have a
 
00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
tax that's a state tax and not collect
 
00:29:59.830 --> 00:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
all of the money that that you say is a
 
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
state tax this isn't the the issue is
 
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
it's not a state tax at all it's just a
 
00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:09.039 align:start position:0%
local property tax that they have used
 
00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:13.640 align:start position:0%
smoke and mirrors to name a state
 
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
tax so it's just inappropriate any way
 
00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:22.120 align:start position:0%
you look at it so what my bill does
 
00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
because it was that's that tax was
 
00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:28.360 align:start position:0%
created so it could be an element of the
 
00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:31.039 align:start position:0%
adequacy Aid formula and reduce the
 
00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
amount of real
 
00:30:35.549 --> 00:30:35.559 align:start position:0%
money that the state had to send to the
 
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
school districts so my my bill just says
 
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's intended to be Revenue neutral
 
00:30:47.549 --> 00:30:47.559 align:start position:0%
for the time being it just says that
 
00:30:50.789 --> 00:30:50.799 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep those numbers in the
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
adequacy Aid distribution so there's no
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
cost at this time and then going forward
 
00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:02.120 align:start position:0%
we can work on that
 
00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:05.720 align:start position:0%
so um maybe using replacing it with some
 
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
other kind of measure that includes
 
00:31:11.029 --> 00:31:11.039 align:start position:0%
income maybe some other choice so it's
 
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue neutral for now so it's
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
something that could pass I suppose
 
00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
discussion I've had my paper I could
 
00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
have done a better job
 
00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.110 align:start position:0%
have done a better job
go

00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
ahead um without laboring too much could
 
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
you just walk us through the bill and
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
describe the mechanics of
 
00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.789 align:start position:0%
describe the mechanics of
it

00:31:39.789 --> 00:31:39.799 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
um so so we've
 
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:49.549 --> 00:31:49.559 align:start position:0%
handout then when we we got the handout
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
that just this current adequacy a
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
formula what this does is it starts at
 
00:31:59.789 --> 00:31:59.799 align:start position:0%
the left hand side of the page and the
 
00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:02.440 align:start position:0%
left hand side of the page is is the
 
00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
actual adequacy Aid the right hand side
 
00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
of the page is additional Aid that we're
 
00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:11.720 align:start position:0%
sending to the school districts but
 
00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:13.559 align:start position:0%
we're I'm only going to talk about the
 
00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
leand side of the page so using a
 
00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
formula that says um you know
 
00:32:22.269 --> 00:32:22.279 align:start position:0%
regular Stu every student is worth at
 
00:32:22.279 --> 00:32:24.230 align:start position:0%
regular Stu every student is worth at
least

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
least
 
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
$4,300 and if it's a specialed student
 
00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:31.039 align:start position:0%
it's worth more more um
 
00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
and and also in free and reduced just
 
00:32:36.629 --> 00:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
the basic free and reduced and
 
00:32:39.149 --> 00:32:39.159 align:start position:0%
additional for students that are English
 
00:32:42.269 --> 00:32:42.279 align:start position:0%
language Learners you calculate you add
 
00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
those all together multiply the number
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
of kids in the category by whatever the
 
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
rate is which is on the very um Top
 
00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:54.440 align:start position:0%
Line you can
 
00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:57.200 align:start position:0%
see the the first line of numbers that
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
you see is is the student rate on the
 
00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
le- hand side of the page the second
 
00:33:05.509 --> 00:33:05.519 align:start position:0%
line is how much money is being raised
 
00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
that particular category so at
 
00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:15.880 align:start position:0%
$4,300 rounded up per student that's
 
00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.389 align:start position:0%
$4,300 rounded up per student that's
allocating

00:33:18.389 --> 00:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
allocating
 
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
$648 million in Aid so you take those
 
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
and you get over to column
 
00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:28.120 align:start position:0%
J that's when they're all added up so so
 
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
according to this
 
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
formula the total cost of an adequate
 
00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
education is
 
00:33:36.799 --> 00:33:38.750 align:start position:0%
education is
$819

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
$819
 
00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.269 align:start position:0%
$819
million

00:33:40.269 --> 00:33:40.279 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:42.600 align:start position:0%
so you should the state should be
 
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
sending that amount to the school
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
districts but it's not because when you
 
00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
get to column K that's a swept
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
tax they're subtracting the swept tax
 
00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
from the 89 $9 million and it brings it
 
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
down to under 5 million $500
 
00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
million so that's how this the
 
00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:11.720 align:start position:0%
swep is um used in this
 
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
formula so my bill just says it's not
 
00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
it's not a swep tax it's an amount of
 
00:34:23.869 --> 00:34:23.879 align:start position:0%
money that the uh
 
00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
local municipality should be
 
00:34:29.069 --> 00:34:29.079 align:start position:0%
contributing to education
 
00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
and it
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
uses just um this it takes one set of
 
00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
number like the takes probably the
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
numbers that are you see and it just
 
00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
uses those going
 
00:34:44.349 --> 00:34:44.359 align:start position:0%
forward okay does everybody understand
 
00:34:46.349 --> 00:34:46.359 align:start position:0%
one of the con concerns then how's that
 
00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:48.200 align:start position:0%
stack up against the prior Court
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
decisions in terms of the Court yeah
 
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
you're saying this is local money not
 
00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:54.710 align:start position:0%
you're saying this is local money not
State

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
State
 
00:34:59.190 --> 00:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
money correct um
 
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
yes it is right it's labeling it what it
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
really is it's always been it's always
 
00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
always been local money and it's it's
 
00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
money and and the other thing that's
 
00:35:18.310 --> 00:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
going on is the state has for the state
 
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
collected some of that exess for two or
 
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
three years and then since then it
 
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
hasn't done that and it's not because
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
you know it's because there were laws
 
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
passed that said don't do that anymore
 
00:35:32.109 --> 00:35:32.119 align:start position:0%
it was not the original intent then
 
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
there then was not the original
 
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
intent um when they put together the
 
00:35:41.470 --> 00:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
formula but then somebody asked the
 
00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
court and the court said well if it's a
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
state tax you're going to have to you
 
00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
know collect the excess and then there
 
00:35:52.349 --> 00:35:52.359 align:start position:0%
were other bills that passed that
 
00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:56.200 align:start position:0%
said the local community can keep that
 
00:35:57.990 --> 00:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
money as long as they spend it on
 
00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
education and in the last we're talking
 
00:36:03.069 --> 00:36:03.079 align:start position:0%
about 25 years here it's been changed
 
00:36:07.109 --> 00:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
you know multiple times so but the state
 
00:36:10.829 --> 00:36:10.839 align:start position:0%
for the last 20 years the state has not
 
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
collected that money and of course it
 
00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
went to education because as I said
 
00:36:19.589 --> 00:36:19.599 align:start position:0%
earlier every single School District the
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
cost of running that school district is
 
00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
far above what the state has ever
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
provided so it's always it's money that
 
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
the state the local municipalities have
 
00:36:34.829 --> 00:36:34.839 align:start position:0%
always raised for education so that's
 
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
the rationale and the purpose is to just
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
take that issue off the
 
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
table so we can move forward and be
 
00:36:47.309 --> 00:36:47.319 align:start position:0%
transparent and whatever that the state
 
00:36:50.589 --> 00:36:50.599 align:start position:0%
is going to send them for Aid will be
 
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
real dollars that they actually send for
 
00:36:57.069 --> 00:36:57.079 align:start position:0%
Aid and we can work on that I would I
 
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
personally I think that those numbers
 
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
should be based on we should look at
 
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
other me issues other ways to measure
 
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
the local capacity to um be involved
 
00:37:14.309 --> 00:37:14.319 align:start position:0%
in um financially supporting education I
 
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
think that the municipalities all need
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
to have some skin in the game I don't
 
00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
want the state to run the whole
 
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
show so we can look at things like um
 
00:37:30.829 --> 00:37:30.839 align:start position:0%
average aage family income in the
 
00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
municipality we can look at the value of
 
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:39.880 align:start position:0%
the median value of a home we could we
 
00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
can look at poverty rate you know there
 
00:37:45.630 --> 00:37:45.640 align:start position:0%
are a lot of ways to do it I'm not going
 
00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:47.640 align:start position:0%
to say there's only one way yeah that's
 
00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
getting a little bit into some of the
 
00:37:49.829 --> 00:37:49.839 align:start position:0%
other discussion we're going to have
 
00:37:52.309 --> 00:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
today we had a bill last year was it
 
00:37:55.390 --> 00:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
1583 was that the bill where where we
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
were also discussing fiscal Capac
 
00:38:01.349 --> 00:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
capacity Aid and relief Aid and both of
 
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
those would go after different sources
 
00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
of revenue one's based upon equiz
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
valuation the other one is dealing with
 
00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
the fnr the uh poverty issues directly
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
associated with we can that's where we
 
00:38:19.069 --> 00:38:19.079 align:start position:0%
get this data from as
 
00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
fnr um and that initially was set up you
 
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
didn't get any of that support if you
 
00:38:26.829 --> 00:38:26.839 align:start position:0%
were less than 12% yeah of your
 
00:38:26.839 --> 00:38:27.990 align:start position:0%
were less than 12% yeah of your
population

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
it went on a formula and it had a series
 
00:38:32.309 --> 00:38:32.319 align:start position:0%
of waterfalls going up which was made it
 
00:38:34.109 --> 00:38:34.119 align:start position:0%
difficult and that that's going to be
 
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
squared away with how we we work our
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
data here but then at
 
00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
48% they got Zer the Max and and that
 
00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:45.640 align:start position:0%
made a significant difference and that
 
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
all contributes back in 20111 when we
 
00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
took that 150 million plus dollars out
 
00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
of that side of the column and put on
 
00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%
the right hand side and we ended up with
 
00:38:58.349 --> 00:38:58.359 align:start position:0%
things called stabilization
 
00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so and I just say that that you can
 
00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
go to the department's
 
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
website and um if you pick there um tabs
 
00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:11.720 align:start position:0%
at the top and one of them says I think
 
00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
it says
 
00:39:17.069 --> 00:39:17.079 align:start position:0%
data and then look for public
 
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
reports and from there it's real easy to
 
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
find adequacy Aid and you will find
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
descriptions of every adequacy Aid
 
00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:29.480 align:start position:0%
formula going back 20 years a written
 
00:39:32.589 --> 00:39:32.599 align:start position:0%
description of exactly what it does and
 
00:39:34.589 --> 00:39:34.599 align:start position:0%
you will see that there were when you go
 
00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:38.200 align:start position:0%
back even father there were other ways
 
00:39:40.710 --> 00:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
that um that you know if you call it
 
00:39:44.069 --> 00:39:44.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity or local contribution
 
00:39:46.349 --> 00:39:46.359 align:start position:0%
you know essentially the same idea of
 
00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
what it is there are options for that
 
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
and then I'm sure we can come up with
 
00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:55.240 align:start position:0%
some other options in addition Reon
 
00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:59.589 align:start position:0%
some other options in addition Reon
spillsbury

00:39:59.589 --> 00:39:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to ask again if you can
 
00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
walk us through the statutory language
 
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
as as opposed to the spreadsheet and and
 
00:40:11.829 --> 00:40:11.839 align:start position:0%
so you talking about my bill yeah here's
 
00:40:14.550 --> 00:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
here's the challenge uh and maybe I'm
 
00:40:18.589 --> 00:40:18.599 align:start position:0%
not as clearheaded as I always am after
 
00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
many days in a row but um I find this
 
00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:25.480 align:start position:0%
bill difficult to
 
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
read because it amends a whole bunch of
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
different statutes oh okay and the
 
00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
result is I read the bill and I'm
 
00:40:35.550 --> 00:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
confused and I think I'd have to have my
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
volume of rsas and take it apart one bit
 
00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
at a time and see what it changes so
 
00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
could you just simply take us um through
 
00:40:46.349 --> 00:40:46.359 align:start position:0%
paragraph one paragraph two and tell us
 
00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:48.200 align:start position:0%
what each one is actually
 
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
doing okay so I'd say the whole second
 
00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
page we don't even need to talk about
 
00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:55.480 align:start position:0%
that because that just is technical
 
00:40:56.910 --> 00:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
things if we could let's just start at
 
00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
the start
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
so so so where it goes in the formula is
 
00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
where the the Statewide adequacy 8 is
 
00:41:14.109 --> 00:41:14.119 align:start position:0%
now those are the numbers what I'm
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
really asking is to go through the
 
00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:18.680 align:start position:0%
language of the
 
00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:23.720 align:start position:0%
bill okay so I'm just saying that what
 
00:41:25.069 --> 00:41:25.079 align:start position:0%
what is
 
00:41:28.349 --> 00:41:28.359 align:start position:0%
called adequacy
 
00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax rate
 
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
now would be relabeled to be local
 
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
contribution and it's just trying to
 
00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
freeze the amount that's currently proba
 
00:41:46.109 --> 00:41:46.119 align:start position:0%
it's probably the the numbers that
 
00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:49.160 align:start position:0%
you're seeing here in K it's taking
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
those numbers and relabeling them local
 
00:41:57.589 --> 00:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
contribution and um in terms of doing
 
00:41:57.599 --> 00:41:58.829 align:start position:0%
contribution and um in terms of doing
the

00:41:58.829 --> 00:41:58.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:01.589 --> 00:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
calculation it
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
says that money or the cost of providing
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
an adequate education which would be the
 
00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:12.510 align:start position:0%
an adequate education which would be the
column

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
column
 
00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
here so it can't
 
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
be that um
 
00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
that local contribution is either that
 
00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
number or it's the total cost of an
 
00:42:45.109 --> 00:42:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:53.670 --> 00:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
see okay in the per in the reason that
 
00:42:59.870 --> 00:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
it says
 
00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:02.109 align:start position:0%
it says
that

00:43:02.109 --> 00:43:02.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
is because we don't it it and it's in
 
00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
municipality the cost of an adequate
 
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
education is going to be more than this
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
Statewide property tax the only time
 
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
that it would not be the case would be
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.349 align:start position:0%
 
places

00:43:34.349 --> 00:43:34.359 align:start position:0%
places
 
00:43:39.309 --> 00:43:39.319 align:start position:0%
so there would be no excess because the
 
00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
the lesser of those
 
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
two so this the part that people talk
 
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
about being remitted would not exist
 
00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
is this
 
00:44:01.069 --> 00:44:01.079 align:start position:0%
working is that making sense I think
 
00:44:03.069 --> 00:44:03.079 align:start position:0%
what I like to do is have Mark come on
 
00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:06.520 align:start position:0%
up and we have and explain how this bill
 
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
is different from the one that represent
 
00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
spillsbury is presenting um I I think
 
00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:13.880 align:start position:0%
they're both trying to use the swep
 
00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
money to bring over and support ad
 
00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:19.079 align:start position:0%
adequacy but can you go further please
 
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
mark I I have my computer charging out
 
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
back so I don't have the bill in front
 
00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
of me but um a representative fellow's
 
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
bill um essentially reclassified swept
 
00:44:30.549 --> 00:44:30.559 align:start position:0%
as a local contribution yeah um the
 
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
mechanics of it is is essentially
 
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
freezes swept for a moment in time so
 
00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
swept is that 363 Milli million
 
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
allocation throughout all 245 towns and
 
00:44:42.589 --> 00:44:42.599 align:start position:0%
so that becomes a frozen Benchmark that
 
00:44:46.829 --> 00:44:46.839 align:start position:0%
is your swept um when we are um uh
 
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
calculating how much and remember we do
 
00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:50.680 align:start position:0%
state cash so it's cost of inadequate
 
00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
education minus
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
swept State cash that's the number
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
that's how we determine how much we're
 
00:44:57.870 --> 00:44:57.880 align:start position:0%
going to pay out
 
00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:01.480 align:start position:0%
um so it freezes that 363 million Al
 
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
allocation for a moment in time and then
 
00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:05.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to continue to do the cost
 
00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
of inadequate education calculation and
 
00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:09.160 align:start position:0%
for most communities as representative
 
00:45:11.549 --> 00:45:11.559 align:start position:0%
fellow said um the cost of inadequate
 
00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
education is going to be greater than
 
00:45:16.069 --> 00:45:16.079 align:start position:0%
whatever your portion of the 363 million
 
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:17.800 align:start position:0%
swept is and then we will cut you a
 
00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
check per usual what this bill does is
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
is take that swep number says it is not
 
00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
State money it is a local contribution
 
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
and so we'll now measure you up against
 
00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
your local contribution and um whatever
 
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:33.880 align:start position:0%
your local contribution is that your
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
allocation of that 363 million um uh um
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
we'll measure you up against that if
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
you're over it we'll cut you a check
 
00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:44.920 align:start position:0%
what this does for the uh approximate 43
 
00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
excess swep towns is it's choose the
 
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
lesser of the two so either your
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
allocation of the 363 million or your
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
cost of in adequate education and for
 
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
the ex swept towns when we do that
 
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
calculation we would determine that The
 
00:46:02.589 --> 00:46:02.599 align:start position:0%
Benchmark we measure you up against is
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
not going to be your portion of the
 
00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
swept it's going to be the cost of an
 
00:46:08.589 --> 00:46:08.599 align:start position:0%
adequate education and therefore it
 
00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:13.640 align:start position:0%
eliminates excess swept by saying um by
 
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
not by saying the calculation is going
 
00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:16.760 align:start position:0%
to be the lesser of the two either the
 
00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:19.240 align:start position:0%
cost of an adequate education or swept
 
00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
and so swept is excess swept is when
 
00:46:23.069 --> 00:46:23.079 align:start position:0%
swept is higher than the cost of an
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
adequate education but we're now saying
 
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
the lesser of the two so therefore
 
00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
um uh uh we pay you whatever the cost
 
00:46:32.349 --> 00:46:32.359 align:start position:0%
and adequate education is or you're
 
00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
that's the state funding you receive so
 
00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
there's no excess swept which is excess
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
State funding uh above and above above
 
00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:43.480 align:start position:0%
and beyond the cost of an adequate
 
00:46:45.309 --> 00:46:45.319 align:start position:0%
education I don't know if that helped
 
00:46:47.309 --> 00:46:47.319 align:start position:0%
it's pretty it's a it's a little pretty
 
00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
techy it's like going around around
 
00:46:51.910 --> 00:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
circles here
 
00:46:57.790 --> 00:46:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
we yeah in in the one just above two 137
 
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
and I believe representative spillsbury
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
um I'm not was that was that basically
 
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
just the Rand decision as the Superior
 
00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:13.839 align:start position:0%
Court determined just a a a straight A
 
00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:15.160 align:start position:0%
straight implementation of that is that
 
00:47:19.230 --> 00:47:19.240 align:start position:0%
your bill exactly just remit the excess
 
00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:21.720 align:start position:0%
and if if if that bill was implemented
 
00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:24.200 align:start position:0%
um $28 million Coes into the education
 
00:47:26.349 --> 00:47:26.359 align:start position:0%
trust fund is remitted to the state um
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
no other changes happen um that $28
 
00:47:30.349 --> 00:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
million would be Revenue available for
 
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
access Damon did you have a question or
 
00:47:39.309 --> 00:47:39.319 align:start position:0%
thank you input so now I have
 
00:47:39.319 --> 00:47:40.910 align:start position:0%
thank you input so now I have
two

00:47:40.910 --> 00:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:43.640 align:start position:0%
so the LA thank you for helping us the
 
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
last thing you just said that the 28
 
00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%
million which is the total amount of
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
swep M excess swep yep thank you in
 
00:47:54.309 --> 00:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury's bill would go
 
00:47:59.630 --> 00:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:02.589 --> 00:48:02.599 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to figure out that is then
 
00:48:05.829 --> 00:48:05.839 align:start position:0%
like the revenue has just moved right it
 
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
hasn't changed so that uh oh oh good
 
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
yeah good point um it's actually the way
 
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
to think about it on our financial
 
00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
statements is the revenue has always
 
00:48:19.069 --> 00:48:19.079 align:start position:0%
been collected on paper through a
 
00:48:22.109 --> 00:48:22.119 align:start position:0%
journal entry in our Acer um but the
 
00:48:23.829 --> 00:48:23.839 align:start position:0%
actual thing that is changing is we
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
don't let them keep it so therefore it's
 
00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
a almost like a 28 million less um
 
00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
expense because now they do not get to
 
00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:33.160 align:start position:0%
keep excess swept therefore we're not
 
00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
giving them $28 million so that's
 
00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
actually the proper way to think about
 
00:48:40.549 --> 00:48:40.559 align:start position:0%
the financial transaction um the 28 all
 
00:48:42.829 --> 00:48:42.839 align:start position:0%
363 million is currently always showing
 
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
up in our financial statements but if if
 
00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury were
 
00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
implemented um 28 million less would go
 
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
out and therefore you'd have 28 million
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
in the bank by allowing these
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities to keep the ex swep is
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
that in contradiction to the Claremont
 
00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:03.440 align:start position:0%
decisions um that
 
00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
uh thean Cas so I definitely can't I
 
00:49:08.349 --> 00:49:08.359 align:start position:0%
definitely can't determine that but that
 
00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
those are uh um uh swept was implemented
 
00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:12.559 align:start position:0%
after the Claremont decision so I I
 
00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
can't okay so in conflict with well what
 
00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
would be in conflict with Rand then yeah
 
00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
Rand the Rand Superior Court decision
 
00:49:23.549 --> 00:49:23.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:26.789 --> 00:49:26.799 align:start position:0%
weap represent fellows and then back and
 
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
that rep
 
00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:32.200 align:start position:0%
McGuire so so I I just wanted to to say
 
00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
that for the for the municipalities that
 
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:37.720 align:start position:0%
would remit any back to the state then
 
00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
to that's that's kind of like a cost to
 
00:49:45.630 --> 00:49:45.640 align:start position:0%
them because they're going to have to
 
00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
fill in that suppose that they had to
 
00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
send back um $2 million I most of them
 
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
are not that high but if they have to
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
send $2 million back to the state
 
00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:01.240 align:start position:0%
they are going to have to raise $2
 
00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
million more
 
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
because as I said all all school
 
00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:11.720 align:start position:0%
districts um need more than the than the
 
00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
state cost of in education to
 
00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
operate so that's you know just to be
 
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
clear that you know that's going to cost
 
00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
them s significant more more money
 
00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
yeah clarify that U um the the $28
 
00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
Million number those are communities
 
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
that um U there's some unincorporated
 
00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
communities in there that do not have ch
 
00:50:38.109 --> 00:50:38.119 align:start position:0%
uh students that they educate but most
 
00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:39.880 align:start position:0%
of those communities have students that
 
00:50:41.309 --> 00:50:41.319 align:start position:0%
they educate in school districts that
 
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
they either operate or send students to
 
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
um tuition out um so that $28 million
 
00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:50.200 align:start position:0%
for those 43 communities um if they did
 
00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
not decrease their budget found another
 
00:50:53.549 --> 00:50:53.559 align:start position:0%
source of Revenue then their taxes would
 
00:50:55.870 --> 00:50:55.880 align:start position:0%
go up by 28 million so there that's the
 
00:50:57.990 --> 00:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
the way to think about
 
00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.630 align:start position:0%
the way to think about
that

00:50:59.630 --> 00:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
yes sorry to jump into the queue but
 
00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
just to clarify so what I was trying to
 
00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
drive at is whether your bill HB 527
 
00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.030 align:start position:0%
drive at is whether your bill HB 527
simply

00:51:10.030 --> 00:51:10.040 align:start position:0%
simply
 
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
recharacterize swept in a way that uh
 
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
you know tries to ameliorate this this
 
00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue or does it actually
 
00:51:21.309 --> 00:51:21.319 align:start position:0%
result in the change or shifting of any
 
00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
funds in any
 
00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
direction um it it does address
 
00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:28.710 align:start position:0%
direction um it it does address
the

00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:32.069 --> 00:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
um that the grand decision that we're
 
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
looking at it has zero impact on the
 
00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
amount of real money that the state
 
00:51:41.069 --> 00:51:41.079 align:start position:0%
sends to any
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
town and I and i' also think that we
 
00:51:46.270 --> 00:51:46.280 align:start position:0%
need to keep in mind you know we we
 
00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:48.040 align:start position:0%
don't know what kind of Court ruling is
 
00:51:50.349 --> 00:51:50.359 align:start position:0%
going to come down on the CL on the
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
conal case we don't we don't know but if
 
00:51:58.109 --> 00:51:58.119 align:start position:0%
you want to assume that
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
this the Supreme Court is going to say
 
00:52:03.789 --> 00:52:03.799 align:start position:0%
that the state has to pay more than
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
$4,000 $300 per student for an adequate
 
00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
education then when the when the C if if
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
that suppose it doubled
 
00:52:21.549 --> 00:52:21.559 align:start position:0%
then that measurement of the excess will
 
00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
change because there will be less excess
 
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
because the cost of inadequate educ tion
 
00:52:29.789 --> 00:52:29.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:29.799 --> 00:52:32.470 align:start position:0%
 
higher

00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
higher
 
00:52:34.789 --> 00:52:34.799 align:start position:0%
so okay
 
00:52:37.109 --> 00:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
um go ahead on on this one then we're
 
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
going to try and move on a little bit
 
00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:40.030 align:start position:0%
going to try and move on a little bit
thank

00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
you would you be so kind as to revisit
 
00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:45.670 align:start position:0%
you would you be so kind as to revisit
your

00:52:45.670 --> 00:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
remarks um in regards to the 43x or so
 
00:52:54.670 --> 00:52:54.680 align:start position:0%
excess swep towns and just again walk
 
00:52:57.870 --> 00:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
through that example of the impact of
 
00:53:01.950 --> 00:53:01.960 align:start position:0%
527 yep gladly um so in hypothetical say
 
00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
we have an EXs web Community um um uh
 
00:53:08.270 --> 00:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
representative fellow's uh bill just to
 
00:53:09.309 --> 00:53:09.319 align:start position:0%
back up a little bit representative
 
00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
fellow's Bill essentially does no
 
00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
nothing financially different for school
 
00:53:17.789 --> 00:53:17.799 align:start position:0%
districts it just changes the labeling
 
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
from uh um to local contribution um the
 
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
only change you would see if
 
00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:23.839 align:start position:0%
representative fellow's bills was
 
00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
implemented is you would see a change in
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
our acur and how financially report
 
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
state aid to school districts um and you
 
00:53:32.069 --> 00:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
would see a difference in financial
 
00:53:33.470 --> 00:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
reports submitted to the state those
 
00:53:34.589 --> 00:53:34.599 align:start position:0%
would be the changes you would see if
 
00:53:36.349 --> 00:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
representative fellows was implemented
 
00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:37.480 align:start position:0%
now we're talking about representative
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
spillsbury bill um to essentially
 
00:53:41.789 --> 00:53:41.799 align:start position:0%
Implement Rand as the Superior Court
 
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
decided it um to go through that example
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
say you have a school district that has
 
00:53:47.789 --> 00:53:47.799 align:start position:0%
a $2 million
 
00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
budget they receive $1 million in local
 
00:53:53.470 --> 00:53:53.480 align:start position:0%
funding uh local education taxes and
 
00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:55.240 align:start position:0%
then $1 million in swept and they
 
00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
receive zero State cash cash just in
 
00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
this hypothetical their excess swept
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
community so they have a million doll
 
00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
swept Revenue coming in a million doll
 
00:54:03.789 --> 00:54:03.799 align:start position:0%
local Leed Revenue coming in they have
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
to fund their $2 million budget let's
 
00:54:07.829 --> 00:54:07.839 align:start position:0%
say that 1 million swept let's say
 
00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
500,000 is
 
00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:11.640 align:start position:0%
excess so what would happen at that
 
00:54:14.390 --> 00:54:14.400 align:start position:0%
moment in time if Rand was implemented
 
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
the bill was implemented uh
 
00:54:17.150 --> 00:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury bills was
 
00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
implemented they would continue they
 
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
would have to continue to pay a million
 
00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
and swept regard uh that would not
 
00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
change they would pay a million dollar
 
00:54:26.109 --> 00:54:26.119 align:start position:0%
and swept what would change is they
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
would not keep the excess swept to
 
00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
500k so they would have to send that to
 
00:54:34.349 --> 00:54:34.359 align:start position:0%
the state so now that 500k is not
 
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
funding their school so now they're
 
00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
paying a million dollars in swept taxes
 
00:54:40.990 --> 00:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
but they only have 500k for their
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
revenue um they pre pre- bill um
 
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
pre-implementation they were paying a
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
million local lead now they're going to
 
00:54:51.309 --> 00:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
pay 5 1.5 million in local lead plus the
 
00:54:53.309 --> 00:54:53.319 align:start position:0%
million swept so the net impact of the
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
taxpayer is they lost their excess swept
 
00:54:58.109 --> 00:54:58.119 align:start position:0%
they're paying 500k and now they funded
 
00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
their school at 2 million but they lost
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
their excess swept so the taxpayer um
 
00:55:04.349 --> 00:55:04.359 align:start position:0%
was paying that anyways but the taxpayer
 
00:55:07.430 --> 00:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
decided to use that U fill that budget
 
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
okay further disc represent McGuire
 
00:55:33.910 --> 00:55:33.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and Mr chairman I I believe
 
00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:35.480 align:start position:0%
it's a house rule that you can only
 
00:55:38.829 --> 00:55:38.839 align:start position:0%
drink water in a committee room not
 
00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:40.280 align:start position:0%
coffee or
 
00:55:43.230 --> 00:55:43.240 align:start position:0%
whatever yeah and I drink coffee because
 
00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
I stay awake I understand and and it's
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a water-based product it's a
 
00:55:51.430 --> 00:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
it's a rule that's honored in the in the
 
00:55:54.510 --> 00:55:54.520 align:start position:0%
breach I guess anyways okay quick
 
00:55:56.950 --> 00:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
question and I'm sorry sorry
 
00:55:59.029 --> 00:55:59.039 align:start position:0%
still don't have my voice but
 
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
anyway do you know what year the 363
 
00:56:05.549 --> 00:56:05.559 align:start position:0%
million came
 
00:56:07.789 --> 00:56:07.799 align:start position:0%
in represent fellows might know I think
 
00:56:10.309 --> 00:56:10.319 align:start position:0%
it's the mid 2000 we do have a historian
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
here uh that was here when we went
 
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:13.839 align:start position:0%
through it come you come on up for a
 
00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
second and maybe you can help us answer
 
00:56:17.829 --> 00:56:17.839 align:start position:0%
that introduce yourself to everybody
 
00:56:20.309 --> 00:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
I've seen you many many times at our
 
00:56:20.319 --> 00:56:22.990 align:start position:0%
I've seen you many many times at our
finance

00:56:22.990 --> 00:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:26.799 align:start position:0%
meetings and Doug Hall hi Mark
 
00:56:31.589 --> 00:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
um the 30 the first year 1999 swep was
 
00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
set at
 
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
$660 that was the tax rate that was 1999
 
00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
couple years later it was
 
00:56:44.549 --> 00:56:44.559 align:start position:0%
$5.80 then it was $4 and I don't have it
 
00:56:47.789 --> 00:56:47.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:53.029 --> 00:56:53.039 align:start position:0%
$462 and then the next change was to say
 
00:56:56.430 --> 00:56:56.440 align:start position:0%
it'll that Dr should raise the same
 
00:56:59.789 --> 00:56:59.799 align:start position:0%
amount as the prior year the the rate
 
00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:05.480 align:start position:0%
was taken out and that was 363 million
 
00:57:08.430 --> 00:57:08.440 align:start position:0%
and then after that the law was changed
 
00:57:11.589 --> 00:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
to say 363
 
00:57:11.599 --> 00:57:13.349 align:start position:0%
to say 363
million

00:57:13.349 --> 00:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:57:16.589 --> 00:57:16.599 align:start position:0%
until two years ago when it was changed
 
00:57:20.190 --> 00:57:20.200 align:start position:0%
to 263 million for one year and then
 
00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
back up to
 
00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:26.680 align:start position:0%
363 so this started in 1999 at $66
 
00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:30.640 align:start position:0%
60 and has been I would guess it's
 
00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:35.240 align:start position:0%
probably 12 years that it's been 363
 
00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:37.880 align:start position:0%
million with the exception of the one
 
00:57:40.309 --> 00:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
year when it went down to
 
00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
263 thank you very much thank you um all
 
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
right that that's enough thank
 
00:57:50.190 --> 00:57:50.200 align:start position:0%
you further discussion on on the swep
 
00:57:52.829 --> 00:57:52.839 align:start position:0%
side here
 
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
yes can you just inform us excuse me
 
00:58:00.670 --> 00:58:00.680 align:start position:0%
what the lowest and the highest swept
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
rates are per town to result in that
 
00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
363 oh I'm
 
00:58:09.630 --> 00:58:09.640 align:start position:0%
sorry can you tell us the lowest and the
 
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
highest so the range of swept rates per
 
00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
town to result in that 363 so so this is
 
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
a um the answer to that is everyone pays
 
00:58:21.029 --> 00:58:21.039 align:start position:0%
the same rate um that's not the rate you
 
00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
see on your tax bill because the rate on
 
00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:25.160 align:start position:0%
your tax bill is against an the assessed
 
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
property of your town that's not
 
00:58:29.029 --> 00:58:29.039 align:start position:0%
equalized so each town has different
 
00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
assessing practices so you'll see
 
00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:32.200 align:start position:0%
deviations on your tax bill your swep
 
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
tax bill might be higher than your
 
00:58:36.829 --> 00:58:36.839 align:start position:0%
neighbors in another town um um but when
 
00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
we set the when the swept is set it's
 
00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
the 300 whatever the rate needs to be
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
for every single Community to raise the
 
00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
363 it's essentially one rate it's an
 
00:58:48.589 --> 00:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
equalized rate and so it's 112 uh for uh
 
00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 26 it's going to be 1 12 per
 
00:58:56.670 --> 00:58:56.680 align:start position:0%
th000 yes repent fellow
 
00:58:58.990 --> 00:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
um yes on this issue um what I
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
distributed when I I testified on my
 
00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
bill was I took part of the equalized
 
00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
property values and the tax rates and
 
00:59:09.589 --> 00:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
just showed them just the columns or the
 
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
equalized rates and on here you can see
 
00:59:15.630 --> 00:59:15.640 align:start position:0%
that the rates are not you know equal
 
00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
they're they go up and down there
 
00:59:21.470 --> 00:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
there's quite a good range on these and
 
00:59:27.870 --> 00:59:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:30.349 --> 00:59:30.359 align:start position:0%
the the idea of equalized valuation is
 
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
more a concept than something you can
 
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:36.799 align:start position:0%
actually achieve because what what Dr
 
00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
does and I'm I don't know if we have a
 
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
Dr person here is they look at equalized
 
00:59:48.109 --> 00:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
valuations they first they look at at
 
00:59:51.150 --> 00:59:51.160 align:start position:0%
the assessed values of properties in
 
00:59:54.910 --> 00:59:54.920 align:start position:0%
every town and then they compare those
 
00:59:57.270 --> 00:59:57.280 align:start position:0%
assess the
 
01:00:02.510 --> 01:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
values to the sales value on on
 
01:00:04.589 --> 01:00:04.599 align:start position:0%
properties that sold during the past
 
01:00:07.589 --> 01:00:07.599 align:start position:0%
year and they say whatever that ratio is
 
01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:13.640 align:start position:0%
if if the the average sale price was 20%
 
01:00:16.829 --> 01:00:16.839 align:start position:0%
higher than the appraised price for the
 
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
all those properties then they kind of
 
01:00:23.789 --> 01:00:23.799 align:start position:0%
blanket say the equalized valuation of
 
01:00:27.789 --> 01:00:27.799 align:start position:0%
all similar properties when up 20% so
 
01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:31.240 align:start position:0%
that's how they get the equalized values
 
01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:34.720 align:start position:0%
so they take the equalized values from
 
01:00:37.829 --> 01:00:37.839 align:start position:0%
about 3 years ahead
 
01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
of when they actually
 
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
apply are actually applied to the tax
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
bills so you're using three-year-old
 
01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:49.630 align:start position:0%
bills so you're using three-year-old
equalized

01:00:49.630 --> 01:00:49.640 align:start position:0%
equalized
 
01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
valuations when you get your tax bill
 
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
because and because property values have
 
01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
shifted and it's not even across the
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
shift was not even across all the
 
01:01:06.309 --> 01:01:06.319 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the state that's why
 
01:01:09.829 --> 01:01:09.839 align:start position:0%
you see equalized values on this report
 
01:01:12.549 --> 01:01:12.559 align:start position:0%
which are different from town to
 
01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
town so what you're getting for the the
 
01:01:20.829 --> 01:01:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:24.349 --> 01:01:24.359 align:start position:0%
isn't it
 
01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what to call it it's not
 
01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
very accurate there's a lot of there's a
 
01:01:34.349 --> 01:01:34.359 align:start position:0%
lot of margin of error in every single
 
01:01:36.990 --> 01:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
person's property tax bill that happens
 
01:01:41.069 --> 01:01:41.079 align:start position:0%
at the local level but at least they get
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
reassessed they do a full revaluation
 
01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
every five years when you try to take
 
01:01:48.510 --> 01:01:48.520 align:start position:0%
this up to the state level you're not
 
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
going to have everybody getting
 
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
revalued on the same cycle so one town
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
your Town's going to get valued one year
 
01:02:01.630 --> 01:02:01.640 align:start position:0%
and you know the next person um they
 
01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:04.200 align:start position:0%
they their value is 2 years old and the
 
01:02:06.829 --> 01:02:06.839 align:start position:0%
next person the next town their value is
 
01:02:09.789 --> 01:02:09.799 align:start position:0%
three years old and so that's why you're
 
01:02:13.269 --> 01:02:13.279 align:start position:0%
not getting a consistent rate so any
 
01:02:17.349 --> 01:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
attempt to try to do a state equalized
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
tax rate is not it's not going to be
 
01:02:25.269 --> 01:02:25.279 align:start position:0%
very F accurate at all so and the other
 
01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
thing that's going to happen is if this
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
is really a state tax then they need to
 
01:02:33.309 --> 01:02:33.319 align:start position:0%
collect they need to get the money that
 
01:02:37.349 --> 01:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
people actually pay in their their tax
 
01:02:39.069 --> 01:02:39.079 align:start position:0%
and we know that not everybody pays
 
01:02:42.109 --> 01:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
their property tax so who's going to
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
fill the Gap in the middle that's going
 
01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:46.520 align:start position:0%
to be the municipalities again it's not
 
01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
as you know the state should only get
 
01:02:50.069 --> 01:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
the money that's actually paid and then
 
01:02:52.109 --> 01:02:52.119 align:start position:0%
they should also be reimbursing the town
 
01:02:54.829 --> 01:02:54.839 align:start position:0%
for being their agent to collect it it's
 
01:02:57.470 --> 01:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
very becomes very complicated when you
 
01:03:00.269 --> 01:03:00.279 align:start position:0%
try to scale it up above the single
 
01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:08.589 --> 01:03:08.599 align:start position:0%
taxes this questions for Mark um this
 
01:03:11.269 --> 01:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
may reveal a simplistic uh understanding
 
01:03:14.269 --> 01:03:14.279 align:start position:0%
but would it be correct theoretically at
 
01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:17.480 align:start position:0%
least that if all towns were mandated to
 
01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
rvalue on the exact same fiveyear cycle
 
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
so they I mean I don't know what the
 
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
Manpower would be for the contractors
 
01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:27.160 align:start position:0%
and so on but but but but if every town
 
01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
revalued in the same year does that
 
01:03:32.670 --> 01:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
completely uh uh Wipe Out the equalized
 
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
value valuation requirement yeah if if
 
01:03:36.349 --> 01:03:36.359 align:start position:0%
there was some sort of consistent
 
01:03:39.230 --> 01:03:39.240 align:start position:0%
standardized process um to for everyone
 
01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
to assess in the same manner um
 
01:03:44.910 --> 01:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
you you could you could work towards
 
01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the equalization process
 
01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:51.160 align:start position:0%
um uh so just capture that caveat um I
 
01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm asking is is the timing
 
01:03:57.029 --> 01:03:57.039 align:start position:0%
by year the only variable or is there
 
01:03:59.309 --> 01:03:59.319 align:start position:0%
another variable when you just said the
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
manner in which they
 
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
assess um I I can't speak to that I'm
 
01:04:06.670 --> 01:04:06.680 align:start position:0%
not a I'm not a I'll talk in a little
 
01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
bit on this because we just went through
 
01:04:10.589 --> 01:04:10.599 align:start position:0%
this in my community and the
 
01:04:13.109 --> 01:04:13.119 align:start position:0%
re-evaluation occurred to the
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
Residential Properties not the
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
commercial properties for one it was
 
01:04:20.109 --> 01:04:20.119 align:start position:0%
done off cycle after three years rather
 
01:04:23.069 --> 01:04:23.079 align:start position:0%
than going the fiveyear cycle um so
 
01:04:24.910 --> 01:04:24.920 align:start position:0%
there there that creates a problem in
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
itself if you're going going to do this
 
01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
reassessment when the market values are
 
01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
up on top of us high and that's when
 
01:04:34.510 --> 01:04:34.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to do the reassessment
 
01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
rather than waiting maybe that's going
 
01:04:37.630 --> 01:04:37.640 align:start position:0%
to go down a little bit here and that
 
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
impacts how our formula you know what
 
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
type of dollars you're going to receive
 
01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:43.240 align:start position:0%
in the formula to a degree I've talked
 
01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:45.880 align:start position:0%
to you about that before but um there
 
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
are a number of variables there that we
 
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
should be aware
 
01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:53.880 align:start position:0%
of go ahead yeah just just um um as far
 
01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
as the equalization process um
 
01:04:57.549 --> 01:04:57.559 align:start position:0%
definitely Dr can speak to that as far
 
01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
as uh how it works and how they what
 
01:05:01.589 --> 01:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
methodology they use in towns um the
 
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
equalization process just to walk
 
01:05:04.269 --> 01:05:04.279 align:start position:0%
through the timeline cuz the timeline
 
01:05:07.829 --> 01:05:07.839 align:start position:0%
does create um swept is lagged and
 
01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
there's a reason for why it's lagged so
 
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
just to walk through the timeline um in
 
01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
the fall of
 
01:05:15.309 --> 01:05:15.319 align:start position:0%
24 Town assessors sent in about 500
 
01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
towns um or 245 towns uh uh uh sent in
 
01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
their property values it's called the
 
01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
ms1 form they sent that into Dr Dr then
 
01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
took that data and they went through
 
01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
their Equalization process of bringing
 
01:05:30.349 --> 01:05:30.359 align:start position:0%
everyone up to market value and they
 
01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
didn't publish that um uh some
 
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
communities might challenge it so they
 
01:05:36.069 --> 01:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
might not trust the equalization or they
 
01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
get toe process uh before the
 
01:05:39.390 --> 01:05:39.400 align:start position:0%
equalization process is complete um so
 
01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
they could challenge it um so as that
 
01:05:42.829 --> 01:05:42.839 align:start position:0%
Equalization process is going it takes
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
about nine months to complete so you
 
01:05:48.029 --> 01:05:48.039 align:start position:0%
collect the data in the fall of 24 um or
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
actually I'll use 20 uh 23 September 23
 
01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
they collected it uh published it in the
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
spring of for spring summer of 24 then
 
01:06:00.630 --> 01:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
we use that data so it's collected in
 
01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:03.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 in fiscal year 25 to
 
01:06:05.390 --> 01:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
estimate what your swept is going to be
 
01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 26 so just talking about
 
01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
using data from fiscal year 24 we're
 
01:06:12.349 --> 01:06:12.359 align:start position:0%
using it to forast you're swept that
 
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
you're going to pay in fiscal year 26 so
 
01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
that's a two-year lag and the reason why
 
01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
one of the year is the equalization
 
01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
process takes about a year for it to go
 
01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
through the process and people can
 
01:06:24.109 --> 01:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
challenge it Etc that takes about a year
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
and then the reason why we also forast
 
01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
it out in the future which there are
 
01:06:28.670 --> 01:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
some bills to think about considering
 
01:06:30.670 --> 01:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
not forecasting it out in the future is
 
01:06:32.269 --> 01:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
because now you have an accurate swept
 
01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
number that you can build your school
 
01:06:37.390 --> 01:06:37.400 align:start position:0%
budget off of and also um uh Finance has
 
01:06:39.269 --> 01:06:39.279 align:start position:0%
an accurate adequacy estimate we can
 
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
build adequacy off of um so having that
 
01:06:45.309 --> 01:06:45.319 align:start position:0%
one year lagin swept is uh makes
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
budgeting more accurate um and then one
 
01:06:49.269 --> 01:06:49.279 align:start position:0%
year just is inherent because the
 
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
equalization process does take some time
 
01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:53.319 align:start position:0%
to complete so that's why swept has a a
 
01:06:57.309 --> 01:06:57.319 align:start position:0%
pretty substant two-year lag on it
 
01:07:00.589 --> 01:07:00.599 align:start position:0%
further discussion here yes represent so
 
01:07:05.069 --> 01:07:05.079 align:start position:0%
just on um comment on the possibility
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
that you would want to do a reevaluation
 
01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
of the entire state in in a single all
 
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
all on the same year the people who do
 
01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799 align:start position:0%
these um valuations these appraisers
 
01:07:22.829 --> 01:07:22.839 align:start position:0%
they have to be licensed to do this and
 
01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:24.799 align:start position:0%
there are only so many of them and the
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
5e cyc I assume a lot of them are going
 
01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
you know the these this these companies
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
that do the assessment they do one town
 
01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:34.559 align:start position:0%
one year another town the next year you
 
01:07:38.269 --> 01:07:38.279 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I don't know how you'd um you
 
01:07:41.829 --> 01:07:41.839 align:start position:0%
you need about five times as many that
 
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
that was a hypothetical type discussion
 
01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
that represent I was I was acknowledging
 
01:07:48.829 --> 01:07:48.839 align:start position:0%
that the contractors would be spread
 
01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
thin yeah yeah yeah to get a point
 
01:07:55.069 --> 01:07:55.079 align:start position:0%
across so with the swep um that's one
 
01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
area where there is revenue available if
 
01:07:59.589 --> 01:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
we have to be looking at Revenue to
 
01:08:02.269 --> 01:08:02.279 align:start position:0%
bring in and support the
 
01:08:02.279 --> 01:08:03.789 align:start position:0%
bring in and support the
formula

01:08:03.789 --> 01:08:03.799 align:start position:0%
formula
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
um I do have a sheet here which I'd like
 
01:08:08.269 --> 01:08:08.279 align:start position:0%
to pass out to everybody so we can get
 
01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
some of the discussion going right
 
01:08:12.990 --> 01:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
formula me yes represent K thank you Mr
 
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
chairman I'd like to um tap into
 
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
something that I've heard representative
 
01:08:24.749 --> 01:08:24.759 align:start position:0%
fellows mentioned several times about
 
01:08:27.030 --> 01:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
our swep and the taxpayers who are not
 
01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:28.480 align:start position:0%
paying their bills and the
 
01:08:31.749 --> 01:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
municipalities being on the hook the
 
01:08:32.990 --> 01:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong in this the way
 
01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
I understand it today is that our
 
01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities are already on the hook
 
01:08:38.669 --> 01:08:38.679 align:start position:0%
because they have to pay that over to
 
01:08:41.070 --> 01:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
the school regardless of whether they
 
01:08:44.789 --> 01:08:44.799 align:start position:0%
collect it or not um so I'm a little
 
01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
confused as to you using that reference
 
01:08:49.149 --> 01:08:49.159 align:start position:0%
with it going to the state being any
 
01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
different than what we're already
 
01:08:50.239 --> 01:08:51.749 align:start position:0%
different than what we're already
experiencing

01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:51.759 align:start position:0%
experiencing
 
01:08:53.789 --> 01:08:53.799 align:start position:0%
today when when the town isn't
 
01:08:56.829 --> 01:08:56.839 align:start position:0%
collecting that swep tax
 
01:08:59.789 --> 01:08:59.799 align:start position:0%
so uh you know this is revenue issue but
 
01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
I know what towns do they have something
 
01:09:03.189 --> 01:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
that's called the overlay because they
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
know that that not everybody pays their
 
01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
tax bills so so they make the assessment
 
01:09:11.950 --> 01:09:11.960 align:start position:0%
you know two or three or 4% higher than
 
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
it needs to be to fund the budget but
 
01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
it's different when it's your town and
 
01:09:23.149 --> 01:09:23.159 align:start position:0%
it's your neighbor that can't pay his
 
01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
taxes and eventually what will happen is
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
they might take that property for non-
 
01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:29.590 align:start position:0%
they might take that property for non-
tax

01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
tax
 
01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
payment as opposed
 
01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:35.480 align:start position:0%
to sending it to you know sending it to
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
the state the other thing it's really
 
01:09:39.229 --> 01:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
complicated because some people pay
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
their taxes late you know sometimes they
 
01:09:43.149 --> 01:09:43.159 align:start position:0%
pay half their
 
01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
taxes why
 
01:09:47.709 --> 01:09:47.719 align:start position:0%
would it's just seems to me like you
 
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
know the municipality is giving a giving
 
01:09:53.470 --> 01:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
away money to the state
 
01:09:55.870 --> 01:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
that that was
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
Municipal money it was that overlay
 
01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
money that they were using to so isn't
 
01:10:03.149 --> 01:10:03.159 align:start position:0%
that what they're already doing right
 
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
now when they send it over to the school
 
01:10:07.709 --> 01:10:07.719 align:start position:0%
so instead of sending that that money
 
01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
over to the school district they're
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
going to be sending it to the state so
 
01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
isn't it the same thing it's just
 
01:10:13.790 --> 01:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
redirecting who's receiving it I would
 
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
say it's not the same thing because it's
 
01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
their budget you know it's their budget
 
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
it's the town's budget paying for
 
01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
services for people in the town which is
 
01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
different than paying you know giving
 
01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
the money to be used in somebody else's
 
01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
town or to the
 
01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
state okay I'd like to go ahead and look
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
at this form and bring up another side
 
01:10:39.070 --> 01:10:39.080 align:start position:0%
discussion here um a formula working
 
01:10:40.709 --> 01:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
left to right has from the base costs
 
01:10:42.430 --> 01:10:42.440 align:start position:0%
right through to the extraordinary needs
 
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
Grant on the right hand side money is
 
01:10:48.189 --> 01:10:48.199 align:start position:0%
targeted on the right hand side of the
 
01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
formula they're grants for
 
01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:53.560 align:start position:0%
specific purpose the money on the left
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
hand side of our formula is
 
01:10:57.910 --> 01:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
money which is generated based upon what
 
01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
we establish as a base cost and those
 
01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
areas of differentiated Aid which go to
 
01:11:07.950 --> 01:11:07.960 align:start position:0%
the municipality the district and
 
01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
they're not targeted necessarily to a
 
01:11:11.709 --> 01:11:11.719 align:start position:0%
specific task like English language
 
01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
Learners even though there may be
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
funding within that differentiated Aid
 
01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
that does not have to be used in that
 
01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
direction so in looking at the sheet
 
01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
that you have
 
01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
here and jumping down because you don't
 
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
have the information on on one through
 
01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
four that's been presented but and
 
01:11:32.350 --> 01:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
identifies for this this is just a
 
01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
concept looking at the right hand side
 
01:11:37.870 --> 01:11:37.880 align:start position:0%
there is money through the extraordinary
 
01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:38.910 align:start position:0%
there is money through the extraordinary
needs

01:11:38.910 --> 01:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:11:43.629 --> 01:11:43.639 align:start position:0%
Grant which amounts to
 
01:11:43.639 --> 01:11:45.629 align:start position:0%
Grant which amounts to
$14.9

01:11:45.629 --> 01:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
$14.9
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
million then we also have a column which
 
01:11:52.510 --> 01:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
we call hold Harless which in the
 
01:11:55.229 --> 01:11:55.239 align:start position:0%
fy2 that we're working right now was $59
 
01:11:58.229 --> 01:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
9 million it ratchets down over the next
 
01:12:02.470 --> 01:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
10 years if you add the 184. n and the
 
01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
59.1 together you come up to $244
 
01:12:07.709 --> 01:12:07.719 align:start position:0%
million on the right hand
 
01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
side which is coming from the
 
01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
state should that be moved to the
 
01:12:16.709 --> 01:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
leftand side and put underneath a
 
01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
category like physcal capacity where we
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
once had some of that before or putting
 
01:12:24.669 --> 01:12:24.679 align:start position:0%
it underneath relief Aid of some kind
 
01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
based upon on separate criteria maybe
 
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
criteria on on income and one on on
 
01:12:34.590 --> 01:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
property values uh this is a concept
 
01:12:38.590 --> 01:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
that some are are talking about and then
 
01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
you would have also that hold harmless
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
if you brought that in you would have
 
01:12:45.950 --> 01:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
another $28.6 million you could add into
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
that total
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
244 million doll and spreading that over
 
01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
my question now to Mark is but if we
 
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
move that everything from the right to
 
01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:56.950 align:start position:0%
move that everything from the right to
the

01:12:56.950 --> 01:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:59.390 --> 01:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
left what kind of holes would we have
 
01:13:02.430 --> 01:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
for those property poort towns would
 
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
would there still be because when when
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
you add money into the leftand side
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
you're also adding it on to every town
 
01:13:11.310 --> 01:13:11.320 align:start position:0%
is going to get this money in in fact
 
01:13:12.510 --> 01:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
some of the targeted money has been
 
01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
targeted specifically to those
 
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
towns haven't run a spreadsheet doing
 
01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
that exercise but to Move It from the
 
01:13:22.990 --> 01:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
right side to the left side yeah should
 
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
have no impact um
 
01:13:28.189 --> 01:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
uh uh if one of
 
01:13:30.270 --> 01:13:30.280 align:start position:0%
these um one of the things we do on the
 
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
right side of the formula is we
 
01:13:33.470 --> 01:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
basically look if your excess swept if
 
01:13:35.629 --> 01:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
you're excess swept you don't get it um
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
so there could be some netting against
 
01:13:40.950 --> 01:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
excess swept um so it could lower the
 
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
amount of excess swept but a lot of
 
01:13:44.990 --> 01:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
excess swept communities would not be
 
01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.590 align:start position:0%
excess swept communities would not be
targeted

01:13:46.590 --> 01:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
targeted
 
01:13:50.629 --> 01:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
um uh to begin with so um I think with
 
01:13:53.310 --> 01:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
um um like relief Aid if relief Aid was
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
reenacted um some of that if you say you
 
01:13:57.870 --> 01:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to take 17 million in relief Aid
 
01:13:59.790 --> 01:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
and move it from right side to left side
 
01:14:01.390 --> 01:14:01.400 align:start position:0%
some of that would net against excess
 
01:14:04.030 --> 01:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
swept so it wouldn't truly distribute 17
 
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
million that would be the only impact
 
01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
but basically moving from right side to
 
01:14:10.709 --> 01:14:10.719 align:start position:0%
left side you've financially
 
01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
done no no no significant impact
 
01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
financially and how the distribution is
 
01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
done what you've done is you've recoded
 
01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
something from additional Aid
 
01:14:20.629 --> 01:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
essentially to constitutional Aid that
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
is the the major impact that you would
 
01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
see if that was enacted you are moving
 
01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:27.560 align:start position:0%
the players on that chess board around a
 
01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
little bit so now that when it comes to
 
01:14:33.790 --> 01:14:33.800 align:start position:0%
what what is the state contributing
 
01:14:36.709 --> 01:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
towards the cost of a student the the
 
01:14:39.870 --> 01:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
price might go from $5,000 or whatever
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
we're doing right now to close to $7,000
 
01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
per pupil that that's correct that would
 
01:14:48.510 --> 01:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
be um you would uh say you enacted this
 
01:14:51.550 --> 01:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
the way a judge might see this would um
 
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
all of it would be on the table to be
 
01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
reviewed by a judge um currently in the
 
01:14:58.270 --> 01:14:58.280 align:start position:0%
litigation we have conal we have Rand we
 
01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
have Rand has multiple parts to it conal
 
01:15:02.550 --> 01:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
just looked at base adequacy a so they
 
01:15:06.070 --> 01:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
just looked at that 4,000 number um and
 
01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
they did not look at differential Aid
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
that was what conal looked at so
 
01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
narrowly scoped to look at that um uh
 
01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
the ran trial which is ongoing and has
 
01:15:16.590 --> 01:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh uh Superior Court has not fully
 
01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
decid made a decision on that it's been
 
01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
broken up into pieces but we just had a
 
01:15:23.629 --> 01:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
ran Rand a Rand part of the ran trial
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
this fall was to look at is the um fnr
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
and special education Aid is that
 
01:15:30.030 --> 01:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
adequate because that's on the left side
 
01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
and can be constitutionally challenged
 
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
um no
 
01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
one the litigation is not looking at
 
01:15:38.030 --> 01:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant in any
 
01:15:39.550 --> 01:15:39.560 align:start position:0%
meaningful way the litigation is not
 
01:15:40.830 --> 01:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
looking at the hold harmless Grant in
 
01:15:42.910 --> 01:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
any meaningful way however if you were
 
01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
to take it from the right side to the
 
01:15:48.149 --> 01:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
left side um that that more likely to
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
get involved into the litigation instead
 
01:15:51.350 --> 01:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
of just being looking at base and
 
01:15:53.669 --> 01:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
differential Aid that's
 
01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
correct thank than you any further
 
01:16:01.110 --> 01:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
comments on on that possible you know
 
01:16:04.270 --> 01:16:04.280 align:start position:0%
way of looking at Distributing the
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
dollars yes repr yes um I think that
 
01:16:10.270 --> 01:16:10.280 align:start position:0%
almost anything we want to look at that
 
01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
we should also have a column that shows
 
01:16:14.550 --> 01:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
us the per pupil amount that the
 
01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
municipality is getting because we just
 
01:16:19.390 --> 01:16:19.400 align:start position:0%
see this is just concept right here I
 
01:16:21.270 --> 01:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
don't think there is a spreadsheet doing
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
this right now oh okay so we're just
 
01:16:25.629 --> 01:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
looking at this concept other words
 
01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
I I think that it can be justified uh
 
01:16:30.189 --> 01:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
there there's two philosophies on how
 
01:16:31.709 --> 01:16:31.719 align:start position:0%
you establish what the cost of a child
 
01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:33.880 align:start position:0%
is going to be you can do it by the
 
01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
inputs what are those resources or
 
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
components that are necessary to provide
 
01:16:41.229 --> 01:16:41.239 align:start position:0%
the child the opportunity for an
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
adequate education or you can look at
 
01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
the end result on the right hand side
 
01:16:48.030 --> 01:16:48.040 align:start position:0%
this is the amount of money that we're
 
01:16:50.910 --> 01:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
spending for an adequate education and
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
we know that our achievement scores are
 
01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
very high compared to the rest of the
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
country so must be doing something
 
01:16:58.110 --> 01:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
correct so if you divide that you can
 
01:17:00.030 --> 01:17:00.040 align:start position:0%
find out here's the average cost we're
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
spending so that's what we have to have
 
01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
it um I'm a Believer though that we need
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
to have in a base inputs what are those
 
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
inputs what is the ratio to teacher in
 
01:17:12.790 --> 01:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
the classro of student to teacher that's
 
01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
the input way of doing it and that's the
 
01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:17.560 align:start position:0%
way I believe the 2008 study that came
 
01:17:20.790 --> 01:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
out of the esbrook study uh identified
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
the formula to be so I I I I I I think
 
01:17:28.070 --> 01:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
that if we're going to move into it and
 
01:17:30.910 --> 01:17:30.920 align:start position:0%
I I talked to uh represent luno about
 
01:17:34.669 --> 01:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
his plan which is the foundation formula
 
01:17:37.669 --> 01:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
which it's very complicated to say the
 
01:17:40.709 --> 01:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
least uh but it has it's has some
 
01:17:43.470 --> 01:17:43.480 align:start position:0%
different principles it's working upon
 
01:17:46.669 --> 01:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
and I I I that they're worth very worthy
 
01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
of our looking at And discussing but to
 
01:17:52.350 --> 01:17:52.360 align:start position:0%
accomplish that in the short time we
 
01:17:56.470 --> 01:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
have to unload a bill by Mark March 6 I
 
01:17:57.669 --> 01:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
don't know I haven't even seen a
 
01:18:02.590 --> 01:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet on yet so we may have to be
 
01:18:05.189 --> 01:18:05.199 align:start position:0%
carrying our discussion forward and
 
01:18:06.990 --> 01:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
looking at something more transitional
 
01:18:09.390 --> 01:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
to get us to where we need to get moving
 
01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
in that direction and complying as much
 
01:18:17.070 --> 01:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
as we can yes I do represent
 
01:18:19.390 --> 01:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
Burton I'm trying to figured all this
 
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
out that um it looks like what you're
 
01:18:25.229 --> 01:18:25.239 align:start position:0%
suggesting just as the cya move to move
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
money over from the right side to the
 
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
left side to make it look like a I don't
 
01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
think I you know you're using some
 
01:18:34.629 --> 01:18:34.639 align:start position:0%
military jargon there and I I don't see
 
01:18:37.709 --> 01:18:37.719 align:start position:0%
it that way uh I see it that the state
 
01:18:40.350 --> 01:18:40.360 align:start position:0%
is putting money into the pot right now
 
01:18:42.310 --> 01:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
it's putting in the pot but that's not
 
01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:43.430 align:start position:0%
it's putting in the pot but that's not
being

01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:18:45.709 --> 01:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
counted with because of this formula
 
01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
have can one more question comment um
 
01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
you keep referring to the fact we have a
 
01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
really good education system but it's
 
01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
turned out it's it's a it's that level
 
01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
of Excellence can't be
 
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
supported because we're hearing from the
 
01:19:06.669 --> 01:19:06.679 align:start position:0%
towns now that they need more money even
 
01:19:10.750 --> 01:19:10.760 align:start position:0%
had a a bill to um to to lower the
 
01:19:13.629 --> 01:19:13.639 align:start position:0%
standards recently so so the problem is
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
not the quality of education but it's
 
01:19:18.790 --> 01:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
how we whether we can sustain the level
 
01:19:20.350 --> 01:19:20.360 align:start position:0%
of support we're getting from the state
 
01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
now well we're getting off onto another
 
01:19:25.149 --> 01:19:25.159 align:start position:0%
topic here but I would I would entered
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
into that discussion there are a lot of
 
01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
non-dollar variables which contribute to
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
learning aspiration of the community
 
01:19:37.830 --> 01:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
attitude of those in the building
 
01:19:40.990 --> 01:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
leadership in the building uh emphasis
 
01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
on what your curriculum looks like and
 
01:19:45.189 --> 01:19:45.199 align:start position:0%
how you're imparting that to
 
01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
students uh I I can recall when I went
 
01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
to school I I I was brought up in Canada
 
01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
and I 25 28 30 kids in my classroom and
 
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
we all learned why do we learn well I
 
01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
had a teacher that was from Scotland and
 
01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
you didn't dare look left or right other
 
01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
than to her you didn't make play games
 
01:20:09.790 --> 01:20:09.800 align:start position:0%
and but now we have a society is
 
01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
changing we have a lot of other
 
01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
variables we have to consider but I
 
01:20:16.350 --> 01:20:16.360 align:start position:0%
don't think it's all going to be
 
01:20:18.270 --> 01:20:18.280 align:start position:0%
answered this is my gut I'm talking as
 
01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
Rick lad now yes I understand there is
 
01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:24.120 align:start position:0%
Need for dollars to facilitate that but
 
01:20:26.669 --> 01:20:26.679 align:start position:0%
there are other other variables which
 
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
come into I can show you school
 
01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
districts that have high
 
01:20:35.310 --> 01:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
performance but they are not receiving
 
01:20:38.310 --> 01:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
any additional dollars why is that I can
 
01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
go to the little blue skull up in Landa
 
01:20:43.470 --> 01:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
small school it's an older looking
 
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
building K through three they're doing a
 
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
great job is it Community
 
01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
involvement uh so those variables we
 
01:20:54.270 --> 01:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
need to consider quick quick note Canada
 
01:20:56.669 --> 01:20:56.679 align:start position:0%
in Canada the federal government pays
 
01:20:58.870 --> 01:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
for all special
 
01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:12.229 --> 01:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
so it's a relatively new entrance into
 
01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
this discussion in the last couple of
 
01:21:15.870 --> 01:21:15.880 align:start position:0%
years I found the right side left side
 
01:21:19.149 --> 01:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
to be pretty perplexing because as a
 
01:21:21.870 --> 01:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
math matter it doesn't seem to make any
 
01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
difference um and I think that's what
 
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
Mark was telling us a few minutes ago so
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
what difference does it make if it makes
 
01:21:32.189 --> 01:21:32.199 align:start position:0%
no difference in the math I I suppose
 
01:21:35.470 --> 01:21:35.480 align:start position:0%
that it's a messaging um difference I
 
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
suppose that it's
 
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
potentially in light of the Court's
 
01:21:42.629 --> 01:21:42.639 align:start position:0%
precedence a legal constitutional
 
01:21:45.709 --> 01:21:45.719 align:start position:0%
difference so if if you if you want to
 
01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
pay strong attention and be guided by
 
01:21:51.229 --> 01:21:51.239 align:start position:0%
the the Court's presidents then the
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of those entries on the left
 
01:21:55.870 --> 01:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
side is to say this is what the
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
legislature deems to be the cost of
 
01:21:58.080 --> 01:21:59.270 align:start position:0%
legislature deems to be the cost of
inadequate

01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
inadequate
 
01:22:02.110 --> 01:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
education this is what we're going to
 
01:22:04.590 --> 01:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
support and I think that that leads us
 
01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
to the fundamental flaw in the conval
 
01:22:10.629 --> 01:22:10.639 align:start position:0%
decision the conval decision by looking
 
01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
exclusively at base adequacy has
 
01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
stripped it down to a figure that has to
 
01:22:21.149 --> 01:22:21.159 align:start position:0%
be provided uh uniformly to every
 
01:22:24.629 --> 01:22:24.639 align:start position:0%
student throughout every District uh and
 
01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
and that's that's I won't say that it's
 
01:22:30.750 --> 01:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
pointless but it misses so much of the
 
01:22:33.870 --> 01:22:33.880 align:start position:0%
point and it deprives the legislature of
 
01:22:37.470 --> 01:22:37.480 align:start position:0%
its Duty and opportunity to gauge other
 
01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
variables so whether those variables are
 
01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
free and reduced as a proxy for poverty
 
01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
Early Learning whether you enter back
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
into the left side uh uh capacity to pay
 
01:22:54.709 --> 01:22:54.719 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of local property values uh
 
01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
you know that's essentially what I think
 
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
we're we you know our own legislative
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
precedent asks us to do to put into the
 
01:23:06.229 --> 01:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
left side what we think is fairly
 
01:23:08.430 --> 01:23:08.440 align:start position:0%
characterized as a cost of adequate
 
01:23:11.430 --> 01:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
education and frankly if we do
 
01:23:14.070 --> 01:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
that then I think and we do that
 
01:23:17.149 --> 01:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
responsibly I think that's the primary
 
01:23:20.590 --> 01:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
rebuttal to the argument in the court
 
01:23:22.110 --> 01:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
that a
 
01:23:24.990 --> 01:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
single base adequacy
 
01:23:28.550 --> 01:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
is the answer to a constitutional
 
01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
obligation um so I guess I would to try
 
01:23:34.669 --> 01:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
and bring that back to your
 
01:23:37.870 --> 01:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
point I would weigh the question whether
 
01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
a particular form of Aid goes to the
 
01:23:41.629 --> 01:23:41.639 align:start position:0%
left or the right if we're even making
 
01:23:41.639 --> 01:23:42.550 align:start position:0%
left or the right if we're even making
that

01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:45.669 --> 01:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
distinction um based on that question of
 
01:23:47.790 --> 01:23:47.800 align:start position:0%
what constitutes the base adequacy
 
01:24:00.709 --> 01:24:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:03.189 --> 01:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
I'll be right back sure representative
 
01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:06.639 align:start position:0%
buron um I just read the con Bell
 
01:24:09.709 --> 01:24:09.719 align:start position:0%
decision and the judge covers that he
 
01:24:12.990 --> 01:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
said it would be impossible to do an ad
 
01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:16.719 align:start position:0%
adequacy uh analysis that accounts for
 
01:24:18.950 --> 01:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
all the different budgets in the in the
 
01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
state so he picked on the conservative
 
01:24:24.990 --> 01:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
side he's he very clear about that that
 
01:24:27.390 --> 01:24:27.400 align:start position:0%
his numbers are very conservative and
 
01:24:29.310 --> 01:24:29.320 align:start position:0%
then he goes through every single
 
01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
category and decides what the average
 
01:24:34.390 --> 01:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
should be and he only deals with the
 
01:24:35.790 --> 01:24:35.800 align:start position:0%
cost side he doesn't deal with the
 
01:24:38.830 --> 01:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
revenue side in in that in that in that
 
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
decision the other thing I'd like to add
 
01:24:43.109 --> 01:24:43.119 align:start position:0%
if I could say one more
 
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
thing I was with Doug Hall when we both
 
01:24:48.510 --> 01:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
had brown hair and
 
01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:52.040 align:start position:0%
uh and I I was on the augenblick
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
committee that applied the form formul
 
01:24:58.109 --> 01:24:58.119 align:start position:0%
that worked the Supreme Court found it
 
01:25:00.790 --> 01:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
it would work as I recall done remember
 
01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
it went to the it passed the house it
 
01:25:06.109 --> 01:25:06.119 align:start position:0%
went to the Senate it passed the Senate
 
01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
it went into Senate Finance I think that
 
01:25:11.390 --> 01:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
bill House Bill four I believe it was
 
01:25:15.669 --> 01:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
wasn't it would you allow Doug to
 
01:25:18.669 --> 01:25:18.679 align:start position:0%
describe that process because it worked
 
01:25:21.070 --> 01:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
the court liked it the legislature
 
01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
passed it do you care to come forward
 
01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:33.470 align:start position:0%
passed it do you care to come forward
again

01:25:33.470 --> 01:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:35.510 --> 01:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
I well I've I've saved you the problem
 
01:25:37.990 --> 01:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
because I've been into leg even within
 
01:25:39.750 --> 01:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
the lifespan of people in the room we
 
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
can call it ancient
 
01:25:44.669 --> 01:25:44.679 align:start position:0%
history I but I want to say I I have the
 
01:25:46.830 --> 01:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
research is being done across the street
 
01:25:50.590 --> 01:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
right now on how that that whole process
 
01:25:53.950 --> 01:25:53.960 align:start position:0%
went um and I've got the research people
 
01:25:58.510 --> 01:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
doing it because um it's the only time
 
01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
we had a a formula in place to fund
 
01:26:03.550 --> 01:26:03.560 align:start position:0%
education that the Supreme Court
 
01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
actually liked and if if if the they if
 
01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
they put 8% of the cost you can't say
 
01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
that representative fellas would you
 
01:26:16.669 --> 01:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
make a comment well I'm not a lawyer but
 
01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
you can't say that that the court liked
 
01:26:22.910 --> 01:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
it liked what we did because the court
 
01:26:24.669 --> 01:26:24.679 align:start position:0%
can only say something when someone
 
01:26:28.109 --> 01:26:28.119 align:start position:0%
brings a case to the court and then so
 
01:26:31.350 --> 01:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
you can it can be all wrong for a long
 
01:26:34.510 --> 01:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
time and you don't get a Court ruling
 
01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
until somebody takes it to the court
 
01:26:38.910 --> 01:26:38.920 align:start position:0%
well so and I'm not a lawyer okay I
 
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
apologize you're you're absolutely
 
01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:42.440 align:start position:0%
correct but what we can do in the
 
01:26:45.270 --> 01:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
legislature is send a a proposal to the
 
01:26:47.950 --> 01:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court for an advisory
 
01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
opinion and we did that and it came back
 
01:26:53.669 --> 01:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
they advised us that that formula would
 
01:26:56.189 --> 01:26:56.199 align:start position:0%
would satis safy the school funding
 
01:26:59.430 --> 01:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
issue in the state so that's why we we
 
01:27:01.270 --> 01:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have brought it forward to the
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
for a vote in the house which passed it
 
01:27:06.590 --> 01:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
or the Senate would passed it if if we
 
01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
hadn't had that in our hand and I'm
 
01:27:11.629 --> 01:27:11.639 align:start position:0%
getting a copy from the
 
01:27:14.590 --> 01:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
archives um I have some questions to POS
 
01:27:19.229 --> 01:27:19.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:22.030 --> 01:27:22.040 align:start position:0%
comment okay so right side left side
 
01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
upside downside um I I I do think that
 
01:27:28.510 --> 01:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
one thing that's uh missing from the
 
01:27:31.350 --> 01:27:31.360 align:start position:0%
formula it's it's here in a way but it's
 
01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:32.709 align:start position:0%
formula it's it's here in a way but it's
not

01:27:32.709 --> 01:27:32.719 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
here in in a way that I think is
 
01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:36.750 align:start position:0%
here in in a way that I think is
entirely

01:27:36.750 --> 01:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
entirely
 
01:27:38.669 --> 01:27:38.679 align:start position:0%
satisfactory and that is the
 
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant so we've had
 
01:27:42.550 --> 01:27:42.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal capacity disparity a these are
 
01:27:44.629 --> 01:27:44.639 align:start position:0%
all variations on a theme but the point
 
01:27:49.070 --> 01:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
being to uh provide a figure that's
 
01:27:53.430 --> 01:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
based on equalized valuation and uh and
 
01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:54.629 align:start position:0%
based on equalized valuation and uh and
students

01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:27:58.950 --> 01:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
and uh the senate in the last term took
 
01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
1583 and and changed it and worked it
 
01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:04.070 align:start position:0%
1583 and and changed it and worked it
into

01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:28:08.189 --> 01:28:08.199 align:start position:0%
hb2 uh so that there is a calculation in
 
01:28:09.790 --> 01:28:09.800 align:start position:0%
the extraordinary needs Grant that's
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
based on the number of students who
 
01:28:14.149 --> 01:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
qualify for free and reduced but I think
 
01:28:16.510 --> 01:28:16.520 align:start position:0%
it also differs considerably in a number
 
01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
of other ways in terms of the way it
 
01:28:18.239 --> 01:28:19.870 align:start position:0%
of other ways in terms of the way it
bracketed

01:28:19.870 --> 01:28:19.880 align:start position:0%
bracketed
 
01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
thresholds um and uh Mark I'm wondering
 
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
whether we can get current numbers based
 
01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
on the formulation that the house passed
 
01:28:35.149 --> 01:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
uh two years ago in 15 or was it last
 
01:28:38.750 --> 01:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
1583 yeah we could run the same exact
 
01:28:44.270 --> 01:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
language um through the um the modern
 
01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
data set uh the issue you would have is
 
01:28:48.750 --> 01:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
it' probably come out with less money um
 
01:28:50.030 --> 01:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
because property values have gone up
 
01:28:52.149 --> 01:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
since last year um that would be the
 
01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:54.280 align:start position:0%
only change you would you would see but
 
01:28:55.669 --> 01:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
we could run could run that number I do
 
01:28:57.629 --> 01:28:57.639 align:start position:0%
think it would be interesting to see
 
01:28:59.870 --> 01:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
where the current numbers would lie
 
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
relative to the extraordinary needs
 
01:29:05.109 --> 01:29:05.119 align:start position:0%
Grant figures we already have okay so
 
01:29:08.470 --> 01:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
any any comment on that can you Ju Just
 
01:29:11.109 --> 01:29:11.119 align:start position:0%
explain which bill is that a
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
2024 bill or 1583 was a 2024 Bill and so
 
01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
when uh a year ago when there was a
 
01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:20.390 align:start position:0%
when uh a year ago when there was a
special

01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
special
 
01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um two bills were reported
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
out then approved by the full committee
 
01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
approved by the house and died in the
 
01:29:28.669 --> 01:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
Senate largely because it was an
 
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
off-budget year I'd like to see what
 
01:29:33.550 --> 01:29:33.560 align:start position:0%
frankly both of those bills would look
 
01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
like here one year later so I'd also
 
01:29:39.270 --> 01:29:39.280 align:start position:0%
like to see when you do that to put put
 
01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
a column that shows per
 
01:29:44.870 --> 01:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
pupil um at the end what they end up
 
01:29:48.590 --> 01:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
with for a grant sounds good thank you a
 
01:29:52.669 --> 01:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
grant that's the real money yeah good
 
01:29:56.229 --> 01:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
suggestion now another question uh
 
01:29:57.629 --> 01:29:57.639 align:start position:0%
anybody else want
 
01:29:57.639 --> 01:29:59.430 align:start position:0%
anybody else want
to

01:29:59.430 --> 01:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:30:02.709 --> 01:30:02.719 align:start position:0%
okay I don't know whether where this
 
01:30:05.590 --> 01:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
really leaves the districts on a net
 
01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
basis but I've I've really questioned
 
01:30:13.149 --> 01:30:13.159 align:start position:0%
why the um special education is one of
 
01:30:16.109 --> 01:30:16.119 align:start position:0%
the categories of uh of
 
01:30:19.629 --> 01:30:19.639 align:start position:0%
adequacy and we've got about $69 million
 
01:30:22.629 --> 01:30:22.639 align:start position:0%
more or less uh going to the districts
 
01:30:27.430 --> 01:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
in the form of of a single allowance per
 
01:30:30.430 --> 01:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
student so tracking representative
 
01:30:33.510 --> 01:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
fellow's thoughts that's uh
 
01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:35.430 align:start position:0%
fellow's thoughts that's uh
2392

01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
2392
 
01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:39.470 align:start position:0%
2392
no

01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:44.229 --> 01:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
$2,184 and uh we've had conversation uh
 
01:30:47.629 --> 01:30:47.639 align:start position:0%
with several bills about
 
01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
uh the shortfalls of having one figure
 
01:30:54.669 --> 01:30:54.679 align:start position:0%
and uh whether there should be category
 
01:30:57.550 --> 01:30:57.560 align:start position:0%
a b and c whether there should be 13
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
different types of special ed uh broken
 
01:31:03.229 --> 01:31:03.239 align:start position:0%
out uh whether this leads to
 
01:31:06.350 --> 01:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
stigmatization and so on and so forth
 
01:31:08.669 --> 01:31:08.679 align:start position:0%
and uh I raised the question when we
 
01:31:11.950 --> 01:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
were having a work session a week ago on
 
01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
special ed what if we took all the money
 
01:31:18.109 --> 01:31:18.119 align:start position:0%
that we currently allocate to special ed
 
01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
and maybe more um a year ago we were we
 
01:31:23.709 --> 01:31:23.719 align:start position:0%
passed out a bill that had an extra 35
 
01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
Mill million for for special ed and uh
 
01:31:31.229 --> 01:31:31.239 align:start position:0%
revamp the
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
um the cat Aid so that all the money
 
01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
we're putting into special Aid is
 
01:31:39.669 --> 01:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
reformulated into something that's
 
01:31:42.629 --> 01:31:42.639 align:start position:0%
essentially like an insurance product
 
01:31:45.030 --> 01:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
that lowers the Threshold at which the
 
01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:47.679 align:start position:0%
state contributes from three and a half
 
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
down to something considerably lower say
 
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
hypothetically two um so this the the
 
01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
the districts would be responsible for
 
01:31:59.590 --> 01:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
their own special Aid costs up to that
 
01:32:01.470 --> 01:32:01.480 align:start position:0%
level but then maybe the state kicks in
 
01:32:04.470 --> 01:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
at 50% or these are hypothetical figures
 
01:32:06.629 --> 01:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
all you know X Y and Z
 
01:32:09.070 --> 01:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
variables uh
 
01:32:10.910 --> 01:32:10.920 align:start position:0%
so is
 
01:32:13.390 --> 01:32:13.400 align:start position:0%
there is there support for doing
 
01:32:15.310 --> 01:32:15.320 align:start position:0%
something like that and what are the
 
01:32:19.149 --> 01:32:19.159 align:start position:0%
implications if we if we dramatically
 
01:32:22.590 --> 01:32:22.600 align:start position:0%
enhance uh that insurance product can we
 
01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
then in turn
 
01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
rationalize uh taking the special Aid
 
01:32:30.390 --> 01:32:30.400 align:start position:0%
base allowance out of the adequacy
 
01:32:32.709 --> 01:32:32.719 align:start position:0%
formula um I think that's an important
 
01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
discussion that's part of this big
 
01:32:36.590 --> 01:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
picture of what the formula looks
 
01:32:40.030 --> 01:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
like representative fellas so um if let
 
01:32:41.669 --> 01:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
me see if I understand what you're
 
01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
proposing so we could take we have
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
special ed Aid formerly known as
 
01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
catastrophic we have that pot of money
 
01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
and then we'll take
 
01:32:55.030 --> 01:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
the 69
 
01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:56.149 align:start position:0%
the 69
um

01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:59.629 --> 01:32:59.639 align:start position:0%
million out out of the adequacy aid and
 
01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
put it in the same pot with the
 
01:33:05.229 --> 01:33:05.239 align:start position:0%
catastropic and then decide how we want
 
01:33:08.430 --> 01:33:08.440 align:start position:0%
to sort it out and then maybe then we
 
01:33:10.990 --> 01:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
can justify another 35 million on top of
 
01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:12.880 align:start position:0%
that which is what we were prepared last
 
01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
year to uh to add to the the pool and
 
01:33:19.750 --> 01:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
that and that will be adequate special
 
01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:21.629 align:start position:0%
that and that will be adequate special
ed

01:33:21.629 --> 01:33:21.639 align:start position:0%
ed
 
01:33:26.229 --> 01:33:26.239 align:start position:0%
Aid okay because it counts I mean if the
 
01:33:28.510 --> 01:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
court wants to know do we fund adequate
 
01:33:31.109 --> 01:33:31.119 align:start position:0%
education we have this adequate
 
01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
distribution and then we have our we'll
 
01:33:37.390 --> 01:33:37.400 align:start position:0%
have our adequate special Aid special ed
 
01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
distribution yes yeah whether you car
 
01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
characterizes it as adequacy or adequate
 
01:33:44.669 --> 01:33:44.679 align:start position:0%
Aid or not um what I'm what I'm really
 
01:33:49.270 --> 01:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
looking at is how do we better protect
 
01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:50.149 align:start position:0%
looking at is how do we better protect
the

01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:54.109 --> 01:33:54.119 align:start position:0%
districts from the kind of expenses that
 
01:33:57.990 --> 01:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
are unanticipated unreserved and often
 
01:34:01.870 --> 01:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
unbudgeted that they find with uh and so
 
01:34:04.030 --> 01:34:04.040 align:start position:0%
we would be moving away if we did this
 
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
we would be moving away from a single
 
01:34:09.229 --> 01:34:09.239 align:start position:0%
figure allowance regardless of the
 
01:34:11.149 --> 01:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
actual needs or the actual costs of
 
01:34:13.990 --> 01:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
individual students and we would moving
 
01:34:17.790 --> 01:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
we would be moving over to a format
 
01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
where the state is
 
01:34:24.270 --> 01:34:24.280 align:start position:0%
receiving specific uh submission from
 
01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
the districts about their actual costs
 
01:34:29.750 --> 01:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
and providing dramatically more State
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
assistance in those reimbursement of
 
01:34:34.350 --> 01:34:34.360 align:start position:0%
those actual costs and by the way I
 
01:34:36.910 --> 01:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
think one of the purely incidental point
 
01:34:39.470 --> 01:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
one of the criticisms of our cadid is
 
01:34:41.870 --> 01:34:41.880 align:start position:0%
that uh it only comes back at the end of
 
01:34:43.830 --> 01:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
a year in the form of reimbursement but
 
01:34:46.510 --> 01:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
we could we could r rejigger that where
 
01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
the there was uh you know an advance
 
01:34:50.709 --> 01:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
based on the prior year and a
 
01:34:54.189 --> 01:34:54.199 align:start position:0%
Reconciliation at the end of the year
 
01:34:55.790 --> 01:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
so that's a that's a big mouthful I've
 
01:34:57.990 --> 01:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
just thrown out there on the table I I I
 
01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
don't I don't think that the fact that
 
01:35:04.109 --> 01:35:04.119 align:start position:0%
it's a year delay is a problem okay
 
01:35:06.390 --> 01:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
because it's it's kind of
 
01:35:10.350 --> 01:35:10.360 align:start position:0%
continual and um these costs even you're
 
01:35:11.590 --> 01:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
saying you're you're being reimbursed
 
01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
for last year's expenses in time to use
 
01:35:16.350 --> 01:35:16.360 align:start position:0%
those funds for the current year so you
 
01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
might well you might need to be careful
 
01:35:20.669 --> 01:35:20.679 align:start position:0%
about the transition year make sure that
 
01:35:22.870 --> 01:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
they're not so it's a rolling a Rolling
 
01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
Cash Flow yeah
 
01:35:29.830 --> 01:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
so the and to and actually even those
 
01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
high cost students generally they do
 
01:35:36.870 --> 01:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
budget for them so they they know about
 
01:35:39.510 --> 01:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
that part I just want to
 
01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:41.109 align:start position:0%
that part I just want to
clarify

01:35:41.109 --> 01:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
01:35:43.470 --> 01:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
that um what they're doing for
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
catastroph catastrophic Aid right now
 
01:35:48.590 --> 01:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
they're looking at every single invoice
 
01:35:52.189 --> 01:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it was um allow an
 
01:35:56.229 --> 01:35:56.239 align:start position:0%
allowable cost so but there are a lot of
 
01:36:00.149 --> 01:36:00.159 align:start position:0%
special ed expenditures that are the PA
 
01:36:03.550 --> 01:36:03.560 align:start position:0%
professional in the room there's um they
 
01:36:06.030 --> 01:36:06.040 align:start position:0%
have specialed teachers and the expense
 
01:36:09.109 --> 01:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
of writing the IEP so I think there
 
01:36:13.629 --> 01:36:13.639 align:start position:0%
needs to be some things that just go
 
01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
that don't need the same level of
 
01:36:19.709 --> 01:36:19.719 align:start position:0%
scrutiny they only above the level of
 
01:36:21.510 --> 01:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
scrutiny we were hearing a couple weeks
 
01:36:24.430 --> 01:36:24.440 align:start position:0%
ago that Arkansas they uh they audit one
 
01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
out of every
 
01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:28.510 align:start position:0%
out of every
10

01:36:28.510 --> 01:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
10
 
01:36:32.950 --> 01:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
um as special ed student cases so it
 
01:36:35.669 --> 01:36:35.679 align:start position:0%
could be labor intensive but um but if
 
01:36:36.990 --> 01:36:37.000 align:start position:0%
obviously if we were to bring
 
01:36:38.669 --> 01:36:38.679 align:start position:0%
theoretically if we were going to bring
 
01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
the threshold down from three and a half
 
01:36:44.189 --> 01:36:44.199 align:start position:0%
times actual cost to two times um the
 
01:36:47.550 --> 01:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
average cost uh the universe of of
 
01:36:52.189 --> 01:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
substantially repres
 
01:36:56.709 --> 01:36:56.719 align:start position:0%
Burton did you have
 
01:36:58.870 --> 01:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
something I tried to find the Rand
 
01:37:00.910 --> 01:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
decision on my desk this morning among
 
01:37:03.830 --> 01:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
the stuff to St but I believe that in
 
01:37:05.950 --> 01:37:05.960 align:start position:0%
that correct me if I'm wrong didn't
 
01:37:08.669 --> 01:37:08.679 align:start position:0%
didn't uh the judge say some of the
 
01:37:12.030 --> 01:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
costs would go into the left side and
 
01:37:16.629 --> 01:37:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:20.189 --> 01:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
side not familiar with any um statement
 
01:37:20.199 --> 01:37:22.189 align:start position:0%
side not familiar with any um statement
like

01:37:22.189 --> 01:37:22.199 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
that I I I wish I had the the case with
 
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
me but is there anybody in the room who
 
01:37:27.910 --> 01:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
can clarify that
 
01:37:31.550 --> 01:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
question yes Mr Hall could you step up
 
01:37:38.350 --> 01:37:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:41.990 --> 01:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
mic well oh I'm
 
01:37:45.870 --> 01:37:45.880 align:start position:0%
no right I'm talking about
 
01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
the I'm talking about the um what he's
 
01:37:54.149 --> 01:37:54.159 align:start position:0%
reviewing from the lower court now I I
 
01:37:57.229 --> 01:37:57.239 align:start position:0%
think he the lower court may have done
 
01:38:00.669 --> 01:38:00.679 align:start position:0%
that separated the some of the special
 
01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
ed costs and put it on the left side and
 
01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
the rest on the right
 
01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
side during the trial so um um Doug is
 
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
right uh the conval has gone through the
 
01:38:12.910 --> 01:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
superior court so there's a decision out
 
01:38:14.430 --> 01:38:14.440 align:start position:0%
now it's in the Supreme Court so there's
 
01:38:16.310 --> 01:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
no decision out of the Supreme Court the
 
01:38:18.790 --> 01:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
Rand excess swept has gone through the
 
01:38:20.629 --> 01:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
superior court is now in the Supreme
 
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
Court so there's there's statements from
 
01:38:24.910 --> 01:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
judges on that um during the trial
 
01:38:27.189 --> 01:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
during the litigation left side right
 
01:38:29.229 --> 01:38:29.239 align:start position:0%
side was brought up but the judge has
 
01:38:31.589 --> 01:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
not made any sort of statement or
 
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
opinion um uh uh uh relative to left
 
01:38:37.589 --> 01:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
side right side there was no there was
 
01:38:39.229 --> 01:38:39.239 align:start position:0%
no conversation really of right side and
 
01:38:42.510 --> 01:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
the conell decision that I'm yeah conell
 
01:38:44.830 --> 01:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
did not consider right side um in the
 
01:38:48.189 --> 01:38:48.199 align:start position:0%
judge's order um a judge R is going to
 
01:38:50.350 --> 01:38:50.360 align:start position:0%
have another order because there's Rand
 
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
now there's a the Rand decision is now
 
01:38:54.189 --> 01:38:54.199 align:start position:0%
looking at um special education
 
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
differential Aid the thing you're just
 
01:38:58.950 --> 01:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
discussing so uh judge ruol in that
 
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
order could um uh the superior court
 
01:39:03.109 --> 01:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
order could could make some comment
 
01:39:04.950 --> 01:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
about left side right side but um I'm
 
01:39:06.589 --> 01:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
not familiar with any comment made about
 
01:39:09.149 --> 01:39:09.159 align:start position:0%
that and not that anyone's interested in
 
01:39:12.990 --> 01:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
history but I would point out that in
 
01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:14.910 align:start position:0%
history but I would point out that in
19

01:39:14.910 --> 01:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
19
 
01:39:20.510 --> 01:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
84 855 the sunset committee uh deleted
 
01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:21.950 align:start position:0%
84 855 the sunset committee uh deleted
the

01:39:21.950 --> 01:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:39:25.910 --> 01:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
um special education they were not going
 
01:39:28.830 --> 01:39:28.840 align:start position:0%
to reauthorize it at all we'd be the
 
01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
only state in the Union that did that so
 
01:39:36.669 --> 01:39:36.679 align:start position:0%
that's when I and Betty joea you may
 
01:39:40.109 --> 01:39:40.119 align:start position:0%
remember um we wrote the special ed law
 
01:39:43.030 --> 01:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
because Governor sonunu John sonunu was
 
01:39:45.189 --> 01:39:45.199 align:start position:0%
adamant that that was wrong and Sen
 
01:39:47.790 --> 01:39:47.800 align:start position:0%
speaker Tucker was wrong from Plymouth
 
01:39:50.790 --> 01:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
and we rewrote that bill rewrote the
 
01:39:53.870 --> 01:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
program over a year that coincided Ed
 
01:39:58.470 --> 01:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
with the um the case where the Laconia
 
01:40:01.830 --> 01:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
state hospital had to close down and we
 
01:40:04.229 --> 01:40:04.239 align:start position:0%
were figuring out how to deal with many
 
01:40:06.790 --> 01:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
of the residents coming out because they
 
01:40:09.709 --> 01:40:09.719 align:start position:0%
went into special education theyve been
 
01:40:12.390 --> 01:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
Warehouse prior to that I met some of
 
01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
them and their parents and and special
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
ed you're sort of not on your
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
head uh and so that's some of the
 
01:40:23.310 --> 01:40:23.320 align:start position:0%
history you should know uh that it was
 
01:40:27.229 --> 01:40:27.239 align:start position:0%
was a bipartisan group group that
 
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
reconstituted special ed because it's so
 
01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
important to so many families in our in
 
01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:33.790 align:start position:0%
important to so many families in our in
our

01:40:33.790 --> 01:40:33.800 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:40:36.750 --> 01:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
state representative
 
01:40:39.950 --> 01:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
bricky um so getting back to what you
 
01:40:41.990 --> 01:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
said about
 
01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
um it might be a burden on um on the doe
 
01:40:54.109 --> 01:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
or on their staff yesterday I was amazed
 
01:40:56.109 --> 01:40:56.119 align:start position:0%
when and of course I can't think of her
 
01:40:59.070 --> 01:40:59.080 align:start position:0%
name now from the state said the special
 
01:41:03.550 --> 01:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
ed um Caitlyn when Caitlyn said she only
 
01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:04.390 align:start position:0%
ed um Caitlyn when Caitlyn said she only
has

01:41:04.390 --> 01:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:41:08.669 --> 01:41:08.679 align:start position:0%
a025 FTE staff member and in
 
01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
the it wasn't Caitlyn it Melissa Melissa
 
01:41:15.550 --> 01:41:15.560 align:start position:0%
thank you that's okay um at least you
 
01:41:19.149 --> 01:41:19.159 align:start position:0%
had a name I didn't even have one um so
 
01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:21.719 align:start position:0%
and she has to hire part- timers in June
 
01:41:24.109 --> 01:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
so that might
 
01:41:27.390 --> 01:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
be a real burden
 
01:41:29.910 --> 01:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
on financial bur fair fair to say there
 
01:41:32.550 --> 01:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
would be an administrative requirement
 
01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:34.510 align:start position:0%
would be an administrative requirement
yes

01:41:34.510 --> 01:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:41:37.750 --> 01:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
agreed yes representative peoples thank
 
01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
you representa spillsbury one of the
 
01:41:41.310 --> 01:41:41.320 align:start position:0%
things that came out of yesterday's
 
01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
testimony that I thought was very
 
01:41:45.790 --> 01:41:45.800 align:start position:0%
enlightening was the fact that there was
 
01:41:47.830 --> 01:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
no quantitative way of measuring
 
01:41:51.149 --> 01:41:51.159 align:start position:0%
anything the IEPs are written narrative
 
01:41:53.310 --> 01:41:53.320 align:start position:0%
um we're delivering Services we get an
 
01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:54.709 align:start position:0%
um we're delivering Services we get an
invoice

01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
invoice
 
01:41:58.310 --> 01:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
in it says speech therapy speech therapy
 
01:42:01.470 --> 01:42:01.480 align:start position:0%
invoice we pay it so we don't know
 
01:42:03.149 --> 01:42:03.159 align:start position:0%
whether we have one quantity or two
 
01:42:05.310 --> 01:42:05.320 align:start position:0%
quantities or five quantities of it and
 
01:42:07.510 --> 01:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
whether that bill is rational based on
 
01:42:10.950 --> 01:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
that students um IEP or other
 
01:42:13.470 --> 01:42:13.480 align:start position:0%
educational programs that he's in I
 
01:42:15.070 --> 01:42:15.080 align:start position:0%
think no matter what we do we need to
 
01:42:17.629 --> 01:42:17.639 align:start position:0%
come up with a way and it may add some
 
01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
labor at the doe and maybe even at the
 
01:42:25.030 --> 01:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
local level but there should be a way to
 
01:42:27.030 --> 01:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
quantify what we're delivering for
 
01:42:29.550 --> 01:42:29.560 align:start position:0%
services versus what we're paying and it
 
01:42:32.070 --> 01:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
might come down to like every I has a
 
01:42:34.629 --> 01:42:34.639 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that says this is what we're
 
01:42:35.910 --> 01:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
delivering we're going to give them five
 
01:42:38.070 --> 01:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
units of speech uh they have a pair of
 
01:42:39.510 --> 01:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
professional whatever and when that
 
01:42:41.629 --> 01:42:41.639 align:start position:0%
invoice comes in we have a way of
 
01:42:43.310 --> 01:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
rationalizing what we're going to cut a
 
01:42:45.470 --> 01:42:45.480 align:start position:0%
check to them and provide some
 
01:42:47.189 --> 01:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
transparency and some accountability
 
01:42:48.870 --> 01:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
into that process not that I'm saying
 
01:42:51.070 --> 01:42:51.080 align:start position:0%
there's a problem
 
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
but we do need a way to going forward as
 
01:42:56.910 --> 01:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
we work through these formulas in the
 
01:42:59.070 --> 01:42:59.080 align:start position:0%
future understand what those costs
 
01:43:02.189 --> 01:43:02.199 align:start position:0%
really represent and how they impact um
 
01:43:04.470 --> 01:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
the Educational
 
01:43:07.149 --> 01:43:07.159 align:start position:0%
Funding thank so internal cost
 
01:43:09.790 --> 01:43:09.800 align:start position:0%
accounting principles that uh are used
 
01:43:11.470 --> 01:43:11.480 align:start position:0%
routinely in business don't always find
 
01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
their way into government services yes
 
01:43:14.830 --> 01:43:14.840 align:start position:0%
representative Burton when we were
 
01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
writing the special ed law in New
 
01:43:18.750 --> 01:43:18.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I I chaired the subcommittee
 
01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:19.510 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I I chaired the subcommittee
on

01:43:19.510 --> 01:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:43:22.189 --> 01:43:22.199 align:start position:0%
IEPs and pretty soon I realized the
 
01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
whole people in the in the workshop
 
01:43:25.470 --> 01:43:25.480 align:start position:0%
rooms were
 
01:43:28.510 --> 01:43:28.520 align:start position:0%
lawyers uh and and that the parents were
 
01:43:31.149 --> 01:43:31.159 align:start position:0%
getting clobbered uh when they went into
 
01:43:33.109 --> 01:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
the IP meetings because often the school
 
01:43:35.189 --> 01:43:35.199 align:start position:0%
districts come in and say any cost is
 
01:43:37.070 --> 01:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
too great and the parents come in saying
 
01:43:39.950 --> 01:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
no cost is too great for my kid and any
 
01:43:41.669 --> 01:43:41.679 align:start position:0%
parent in here knows that's probably
 
01:43:45.229 --> 01:43:45.239 align:start position:0%
where you'd be um there is no direct
 
01:43:47.229 --> 01:43:47.239 align:start position:0%
answer to your question representative
 
01:43:50.990 --> 01:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of judgment and so to elay
 
01:43:53.430 --> 01:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
some of that I did sponsor on a trial
 
01:43:56.790 --> 01:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
basis mediation on IEPs and that was
 
01:43:59.430 --> 01:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
suggested by the doe I do you remember
 
01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:00.550 align:start position:0%
suggested by the doe I do you remember
that

01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:44:03.550 --> 01:44:03.560 align:start position:0%
Doug uh and and that gave that moved
 
01:44:07.149 --> 01:44:07.159 align:start position:0%
that the discussion offline to take some
 
01:44:11.109 --> 01:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
of the emotion out of it um I must say
 
01:44:14.430 --> 01:44:14.440 align:start position:0%
that special education and I I had
 
01:44:16.629 --> 01:44:16.639 align:start position:0%
because I've been in college work
 
01:44:20.030 --> 01:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
for they're well trained there it's a
 
01:44:21.709 --> 01:44:21.719 align:start position:0%
specialty now and I
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
think those whool here the teachers I
 
01:44:27.669 --> 01:44:27.679 align:start position:0%
trust them to make the best
 
01:44:31.270 --> 01:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
decision it's not like fixing your pipes
 
01:44:33.070 --> 01:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
it's a judgment
 
01:44:35.629 --> 01:44:35.639 align:start position:0%
call and and that's why it's it's hard
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
to quantify um not that we shouldn't try
 
01:44:41.589 --> 01:44:41.599 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not denying that but
 
01:44:44.109 --> 01:44:44.119 align:start position:0%
understand it's like a medical decision
 
01:44:46.350 --> 01:44:46.360 align:start position:0%
in a way it really is how much Med how
 
01:44:49.189 --> 01:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
many meds do you need uh well anyway
 
01:44:51.070 --> 01:44:51.080 align:start position:0%
thank you well that's an interesting
 
01:44:55.950 --> 01:44:55.960 align:start position:0%
analogy but um medicine has been brought
 
01:44:58.990 --> 01:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
into the insurance World
 
01:45:01.350 --> 01:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
Quantified so I think the challenge is
 
01:45:03.790 --> 01:45:03.800 align:start position:0%
surmountable yes representative fellas
 
01:45:06.629 --> 01:45:06.639 align:start position:0%
so there's there's one thing that um
 
01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
takes up a large chunk of um any School
 
01:45:11.790 --> 01:45:11.800 align:start position:0%
District budget and that's
 
01:45:13.790 --> 01:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
transportation and there's two
 
01:45:15.310 --> 01:45:15.320 align:start position:0%
categories of Transportation there's
 
01:45:17.310 --> 01:45:17.320 align:start position:0%
special ed transportation and then just
 
01:45:20.510 --> 01:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
the regular transportation and in and
 
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
instead of trying to somehow say that
 
01:45:28.390 --> 01:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
all in the a base cost per pupil maybe
 
01:45:32.310 --> 01:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
we just just a suggestion maybe we might
 
01:45:35.910 --> 01:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
want to break that category out because
 
01:45:37.550 --> 01:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
there there's a lot of
 
01:45:40.629 --> 01:45:40.639 align:start position:0%
variability between rural districts and
 
01:45:40.639 --> 01:45:41.270 align:start position:0%
variability between rural districts and
you

01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:45:44.709 --> 01:45:44.719 align:start position:0%
know more compact districts so you're
 
01:45:47.070 --> 01:45:47.080 align:start position:0%
suggesting that the portion of
 
01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
Transportation Services attributable to
 
01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
special ed students be broken out and
 
01:45:53.910 --> 01:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
then what would what would you propose
 
01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
that we do it so actually when we build
 
01:45:59.629 --> 01:45:59.639 align:start position:0%
our formula here it's not one of the
 
01:46:02.109 --> 01:46:02.119 align:start position:0%
columns but maybe
 
01:46:04.750 --> 01:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
Transportation should be one of the
 
01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:07.070 align:start position:0%
Transportation should be one of the
columns

01:46:07.070 --> 01:46:07.080 align:start position:0%
columns
 
01:46:07.080 --> 01:46:09.870 align:start position:0%
columns
because

01:46:09.870 --> 01:46:09.880 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:46:12.350 --> 01:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
um we're we're right now we're not
 
01:46:14.350 --> 01:46:14.360 align:start position:0%
trying speak special ed Transportation
 
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
specifically well maybe special ed
 
01:46:19.149 --> 01:46:19.159 align:start position:0%
Transportation would go in the special
 
01:46:22.510 --> 01:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
ed um allocation we're talking about and
 
01:46:25.550 --> 01:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
regular Transportation would go in
 
01:46:29.430 --> 01:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
here you could say that when it comes to
 
01:46:31.589 --> 01:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
the classroom those are pretty
 
01:46:33.750 --> 01:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
standardized you need a teacher in every
 
01:46:36.189 --> 01:46:36.199 align:start position:0%
classroom and you know you need some
 
01:46:37.990 --> 01:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
overhead in terms of you know the
 
01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
building and operation in the building
 
01:46:42.550 --> 01:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
and heat and lights and all that but
 
01:46:45.189 --> 01:46:45.199 align:start position:0%
transportation in my mind is a large
 
01:46:47.790 --> 01:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
enough category that we might want to
 
01:46:50.470 --> 01:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
look at that separately and I don't and
 
01:46:53.589 --> 01:46:53.599 align:start position:0%
I don't have a a suggestion on how to do
 
01:46:58.109 --> 01:46:58.119 align:start position:0%
it do in terms of like um if it's part
 
01:47:01.669 --> 01:47:01.679 align:start position:0%
of what they actually pay or we've also
 
01:47:06.709 --> 01:47:06.719 align:start position:0%
got a state law that says you have to
 
01:47:09.470 --> 01:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
transport elementary students if they
 
01:47:11.990 --> 01:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
live farther than it's either one and a
 
01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
half or two miles from the school but
 
01:47:17.189 --> 01:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure just about everybody is
 
01:47:19.070 --> 01:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
transporting students that live closer
 
01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:20.550 align:start position:0%
transporting students that live closer
to

01:47:20.550 --> 01:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:47:23.350 --> 01:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
that it's it's just I'm just saying that
 
01:47:26.270 --> 01:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
it's a large piece of the budget that is
 
01:47:30.750 --> 01:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
can be very variable from one um School
 
01:47:34.189 --> 01:47:34.199 align:start position:0%
District to the next and and and also
 
01:47:35.990 --> 01:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
also has a lot to do with geography and
 
01:47:38.470 --> 01:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
topography yeah and and the other thing
 
01:47:41.550 --> 01:47:41.560 align:start position:0%
is I I actually think that we should be
 
01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
doing this allocation based on
 
01:47:47.350 --> 01:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
districts rather than
 
01:47:49.629 --> 01:47:49.639 align:start position:0%
municipalities and one of the reasons I
 
01:47:53.109 --> 01:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
believe that is that the the on
 
01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:55.679 align:start position:0%
Claremont ruling said that the state has
 
01:48:00.350 --> 01:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
to identify describe what is an adequate
 
01:48:03.070 --> 01:48:03.080 align:start position:0%
education um figure out how much it
 
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
costs pay for it and that there has to
 
01:48:08.189 --> 01:48:08.199 align:start position:0%
be accountability that that it's
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
actually being provided and you can't
 
01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
have accountability at the municipality
 
01:48:16.950 --> 01:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
level because you have Cooperative
 
01:48:19.310 --> 01:48:19.320 align:start position:0%
school districts where you have multiple
 
01:48:22.470 --> 01:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
um towns in the school district and they
 
01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
they don't have say over what services
 
01:48:28.510 --> 01:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
are provided um only at the district
 
01:48:32.030 --> 01:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
level do you have a school board that's
 
01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
responsible for what services are
 
01:48:37.030 --> 01:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
provided I'm going to go to
 
01:48:38.589 --> 01:48:38.599 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire in a moment but
 
01:48:41.589 --> 01:48:41.599 align:start position:0%
just just on that thought
 
01:48:46.830 --> 01:48:46.840 align:start position:0%
um if we had our Aid directed by
 
01:48:49.870 --> 01:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
District would you also support then
 
01:48:52.790 --> 01:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
requiring a district to have a single
 
01:48:56.510 --> 01:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
local Ed property tax rate for all of
 
01:49:01.589 --> 01:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:01.599 --> 01:49:05.030 align:start position:0%
 
communities

01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:09.709 --> 01:49:09.719 align:start position:0%
um so that doesn't happen now no and the
 
01:49:11.390 --> 01:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
other thing that doesn't happen now it
 
01:49:13.030 --> 01:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
happens on the county level it doesn't
 
01:49:15.270 --> 01:49:15.280 align:start position:0%
happen on the school district level oh
 
01:49:17.910 --> 01:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
correct so and I'm talking about
 
01:49:20.510 --> 01:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts So within
 
01:49:22.830 --> 01:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts you you
 
01:49:27.669 --> 01:49:27.679 align:start position:0%
could have three towns and
 
01:49:31.109 --> 01:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
um you might be splitting the budget so
 
01:49:32.830 --> 01:49:32.840 align:start position:0%
some Cooperative districts it's just
 
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
straight per pupil everybody's paying in
 
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
the same amount for the pupils that they
 
01:49:40.750 --> 01:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
send but most of them are not that way
 
01:49:43.189 --> 01:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
most of them take the budget and this is
 
01:49:46.030 --> 01:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
common you split the the amount of money
 
01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639 align:start position:0%
that has to be raised from taxes into
 
01:49:52.270 --> 01:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
two pieces and half of it you allocate
 
01:49:53.189 --> 01:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:49:55.310 --> 01:49:55.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities based on the number of
 
01:49:57.790 --> 01:49:57.800 align:start position:0%
students that they have the other half
 
01:50:00.510 --> 01:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
of the money you allocate based on the
 
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation of the towns so what
 
01:50:08.229 --> 01:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
happens if you go if you do that and
 
01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
then you look back at what each Town
 
01:50:14.669 --> 01:50:14.679 align:start position:0%
paid in then you will see that they're
 
01:50:14.679 --> 01:50:16.629 align:start position:0%
paid in then you will see that they're
that

01:50:16.629 --> 01:50:16.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:50:20.910 --> 01:50:20.920 align:start position:0%
um they paid more some towns paid more
 
01:50:24.709 --> 01:50:24.719 align:start position:0%
per pupil for for their um students in
 
01:50:28.750 --> 01:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
other towns paid less for theirs and
 
01:50:31.589 --> 01:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
we're not recognizing it and we're not
 
01:50:35.189 --> 01:50:35.199 align:start position:0%
recognizing the fact that the towns with
 
01:50:37.950 --> 01:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
the higher equalized valuation when you
 
01:50:41.229 --> 01:50:41.239 align:start position:0%
have that split are paying a larger
 
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
portion of the budget than their
 
01:50:46.589 --> 01:50:46.599 align:start position:0%
students represent but we're using the
 
01:50:48.589 --> 01:50:48.599 align:start position:0%
number of students they have in this
 
01:50:50.990 --> 01:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
formula when what they're actually
 
01:50:53.790 --> 01:50:53.800 align:start position:0%
paying is in the sense they're actually
 
01:50:57.430 --> 01:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
paying for their students plus some of
 
01:50:59.470 --> 01:50:59.480 align:start position:0%
from the other town and the vice versa
 
01:51:03.350 --> 01:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
you know so and I didn't really want to
 
01:51:06.430 --> 01:51:06.440 align:start position:0%
take us off on a a huge tangent because
 
01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's an entirely different
 
01:51:10.669 --> 01:51:10.679 align:start position:0%
conversation I just wanted to associate
 
01:51:14.030 --> 01:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
the two ideas if the state is going to
 
01:51:16.149 --> 01:51:16.159 align:start position:0%
provide its portion of the Aid by
 
01:51:19.589 --> 01:51:19.599 align:start position:0%
District should the taxation also uh be
 
01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
and and right now there's no uniformity
 
01:51:23.390 --> 01:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
across District so let's just hold that
 
01:51:26.069 --> 01:51:26.079 align:start position:0%
for another time representative Maguire
 
01:51:27.790 --> 01:51:27.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I just have an
 
01:51:30.390 --> 01:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
anecdote I guess to to support what
 
01:51:32.470 --> 01:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
representative fellow said about
 
01:51:36.430 --> 01:51:36.440 align:start position:0%
Transportation my school has one or more
 
01:51:39.870 --> 01:51:39.880 align:start position:0%
of these very expensive um specialed
 
01:51:43.510 --> 01:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
students who are cost total cost
 
01:51:46.589 --> 01:51:46.599 align:start position:0%
$200,000 a year or more but when I'm
 
01:51:50.189 --> 01:51:50.199 align:start position:0%
told is that money maybe it's they're
 
01:51:52.589 --> 01:51:52.599 align:start position:0%
sent to a special school for a tuition
 
01:51:53.589 --> 01:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
of maybe
 
01:51:56.390 --> 01:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
$120,000 a year but just the
 
01:51:59.629 --> 01:51:59.639 align:start position:0%
transportation to get them from Epsom to
 
01:52:04.629 --> 01:52:04.639 align:start position:0%
the school is $500 a day or $80,000 a
 
01:52:06.830 --> 01:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
year I mean it's just a tremendous
 
01:52:09.390 --> 01:52:09.400 align:start position:0%
amount of money not
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:20.030 --> 01:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:24.910 --> 01:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
say okay further
 
01:52:27.470 --> 01:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
comment well it's it's wide open the
 
01:52:31.030 --> 01:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
purpose of today is to um cover all the
 
01:52:34.910 --> 01:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
bases on the adequacy aid anybody want
 
01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
to take us in a New
 
01:52:42.109 --> 01:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
Brown thank
 
01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:47.870 align:start position:0%
Brown thank
you

01:52:47.870 --> 01:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:51.990 --> 01:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
so thank you so I'm brand new to the
 
01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:53.470 align:start position:0%
so thank you so I'm brand new to the
committee

01:52:53.470 --> 01:52:53.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:52:55.830 --> 01:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
and just been having a few thoughts
 
01:52:58.510 --> 01:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
about what we're doing here um we're
 
01:53:01.149 --> 01:53:01.159 align:start position:0%
still debating what the intent of an
 
01:53:03.390 --> 01:53:03.400 align:start position:0%
adequate education is as we saw this
 
01:53:06.430 --> 01:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
week uh the scope of the subject matter
 
01:53:09.030 --> 01:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
and also the breadth of an educational
 
01:53:10.990 --> 01:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
experience covered is another question
 
01:53:14.030 --> 01:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking about um when the court
 
01:53:17.310 --> 01:53:17.320 align:start position:0%
wrote article 83 and I think
 
01:53:20.149 --> 01:53:20.159 align:start position:0%
1791 they only had grades one through
 
01:53:23.350 --> 01:53:23.360 align:start position:0%
maybe eight total so are we talking
 
01:53:25.950 --> 01:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
about an adequate education provided by
 
01:53:31.109 --> 01:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
the state from K to 12 K to 14 k through
 
01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
graduate school again unanswered
 
01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:36.390 align:start position:0%
graduate school again unanswered
question

01:53:36.390 --> 01:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:53:39.589 --> 01:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
um also if we're jumping the gun on the
 
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
courts and moving toward a Statewide
 
01:53:41.760 --> 01:53:43.229 align:start position:0%
courts and moving toward a Statewide
funding

01:53:43.229 --> 01:53:43.239 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:53:46.629 --> 01:53:46.639 align:start position:0%
mandate um the Golden Rule comes to mind
 
01:53:48.830 --> 01:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
he who has the gold decides the
 
01:53:52.589 --> 01:53:52.599 align:start position:0%
tunes and I think we have had a lot of
 
01:53:55.069 --> 01:53:55.079 align:start position:0%
discussion about inputs and
 
01:53:58.709 --> 01:53:58.719 align:start position:0%
representative um lunow had a list of
 
01:54:00.950 --> 01:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
resources needed in every school that
 
01:54:04.589 --> 01:54:04.599 align:start position:0%
must be provided to school districts we
 
01:54:07.350 --> 01:54:07.360 align:start position:0%
focused on inputs but not outputs as
 
01:54:09.950 --> 01:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
much so when I say the Golden Rule what
 
01:54:11.069 --> 01:54:11.079 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
01:54:14.109 --> 01:54:14.119 align:start position:0%
is if we are going to have state funded
 
01:54:17.109 --> 01:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
programs for local districts we should
 
01:54:20.109 --> 01:54:20.119 align:start position:0%
focus also on more rigorous
 
01:54:22.950 --> 01:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
assessments I think local schools do
 
01:54:25.990 --> 01:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
have you know some interesting ideas for
 
01:54:28.069 --> 01:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
performance-based assessments but I
 
01:54:31.109 --> 01:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
think actual rigorous testing is an
 
01:54:33.990 --> 01:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
important part of Assessments and we
 
01:54:36.350 --> 01:54:36.360 align:start position:0%
should probably revisit a list of such
 
01:54:39.470 --> 01:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
tests that we might have districts use
 
01:54:42.229 --> 01:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
when they assess student
 
01:54:45.510 --> 01:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
performance um and getting back to the
 
01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:49.149 align:start position:0%
performance um and getting back to the
bills

01:54:49.149 --> 01:54:49.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:52.470 --> 01:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
anyway the bills I like so far since
 
01:54:54.270 --> 01:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
don't want to jump the gun on the courts
 
01:54:55.950 --> 01:54:55.960 align:start position:0%
is I like
 
01:54:59.910 --> 01:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
563 which does raise base adequacy for
 
01:55:01.350 --> 01:55:01.360 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
01:55:04.030 --> 01:55:04.040 align:start position:0%
categories the special ed category is
 
01:55:06.390 --> 01:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
the one with the three categories a b
 
01:55:10.750 --> 01:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
and c but I think those are um not
 
01:55:13.430 --> 01:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
really useful categories because if a
 
01:55:16.550 --> 01:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
student's in a classroom 80% of the time
 
01:55:18.589 --> 01:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
that 20% they're not in a classroom
 
01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
could be a very expensive but needed
 
01:55:23.950 --> 01:55:23.960 align:start position:0%
service so saying they deserve a smaller
 
01:55:25.990 --> 01:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
percentage or smaller amount may not
 
01:55:28.589 --> 01:55:28.599 align:start position:0%
work with those time frames classroom
 
01:55:30.790 --> 01:55:30.800 align:start position:0%
time so I think we should probably just
 
01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
change the special ed amount from 2100
 
01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
to something higher and then I also like
 
01:55:39.550 --> 01:55:39.560 align:start position:0%
uh 717 moving the threshold lower to
 
01:55:42.310 --> 01:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
three times and from
 
01:55:46.709 --> 01:55:46.719 align:start position:0%
3.5 and I also like 773
 
01:55:50.470 --> 01:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
which um does not which requires that we
 
01:55:52.350 --> 01:55:52.360 align:start position:0%
compensate or reimburse at at least
 
01:55:56.470 --> 01:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
least 85% or more um for catastrophic
 
01:56:00.669 --> 01:56:00.679 align:start position:0%
Aid so those are my thoughts for now and
 
01:56:02.910 --> 01:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
I've been interested in hearing whatever
 
01:56:05.550 --> 01:56:05.560 align:start position:0%
anyone has to add to that um I really
 
01:56:08.350 --> 01:56:08.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate all your knowledge thank
 
01:56:11.310 --> 01:56:11.320 align:start position:0%
you representative Burton I I just
 
01:56:12.830 --> 01:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
remembered what I was going to say and
 
01:56:16.350 --> 01:56:16.360 align:start position:0%
and not necessary response to you I I in
 
01:56:18.229 --> 01:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
the augenblick formula I did the
 
01:56:21.350 --> 01:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
research on the special ed factor in
 
01:56:23.310 --> 01:56:23.320 align:start position:0%
other words we had factors times
 
01:56:26.350 --> 01:56:26.360 align:start position:0%
different situations and it was 1.5 I
 
01:56:29.109 --> 01:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
believe though that we put in the
 
01:56:32.790 --> 01:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
formula for any coded students in the
 
01:56:36.270 --> 01:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
school but then we we invented CAD a for
 
01:56:38.189 --> 01:56:38.199 align:start position:0%
those really expensive
 
01:56:40.709 --> 01:56:40.719 align:start position:0%
cases I think that's the way it worked
 
01:56:42.470 --> 01:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
so that they would get extra aid from
 
01:56:46.430 --> 01:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
the state for those particular cases so
 
01:56:49.149 --> 01:56:49.159 align:start position:0%
now 1.5 is probably low these days but
 
01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
the 1.5 was
 
01:56:54.990 --> 01:56:55.000 align:start position:0%
what if you had 20 coded students you
 
01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:56.109 align:start position:0%
what if you had 20 coded students you
got

01:56:56.109 --> 01:56:56.119 align:start position:0%
got
 
01:56:58.830 --> 01:56:58.840 align:start position:0%
1.5 uh of the average
 
01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
costs and we had computed an average
 
01:57:04.109 --> 01:57:04.119 align:start position:0%
cost I believe that we use in the
 
01:57:07.149 --> 01:57:07.159 align:start position:0%
formula to determine how much Age and
 
01:57:09.229 --> 01:57:09.239 align:start position:0%
and the formula is based on assess
 
01:57:12.990 --> 01:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
values and assess values the Town based
 
01:57:15.870 --> 01:57:15.880 align:start position:0%
on lot of things but that's the way we
 
01:57:18.030 --> 01:57:18.040 align:start position:0%
dealt with special uh special Aid when
 
01:57:20.709 --> 01:57:20.719 align:start position:0%
we were doing that that
 
01:57:24.629 --> 01:57:24.639 align:start position:0%
formula and it to and again that that
 
01:57:28.470 --> 01:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:30.709 --> 01:57:30.719 align:start position:0%
Senate perhaps it would be worth digging
 
01:57:33.870 --> 01:57:33.880 align:start position:0%
that up and putting it in front of
 
01:57:36.589 --> 01:57:36.599 align:start position:0%
us I've suggested a few times but they
 
01:57:39.229 --> 01:57:39.239 align:start position:0%
look at me like I'm way too old to be uh
 
01:57:42.510 --> 01:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
suggesting such you would catching on
 
01:57:44.310 --> 01:57:44.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes history is is
 
01:57:47.990 --> 01:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
helpful sometimes if it's truthful okay
 
01:57:49.149 --> 01:57:49.159 align:start position:0%
representative ccom and then
 
01:57:49.159 --> 01:57:50.790 align:start position:0%
representative ccom and then
representative

01:57:50.790 --> 01:57:50.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:57:53.950 --> 01:57:53.960 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you
 
01:57:56.030 --> 01:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
as we sit here and talk about the
 
01:57:57.629 --> 01:57:57.639 align:start position:0%
adequacy aid and what the right number
 
01:57:59.830 --> 01:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
is and and calculating it and we talk
 
01:58:01.910 --> 01:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
about the the cost per student I'm still
 
01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
hung up on the cost per student and
 
01:58:08.550 --> 01:58:08.560 align:start position:0%
that we've when you look at what the the
 
01:58:11.310 --> 01:58:11.320 align:start position:0%
definition of the adequate education is
 
01:58:13.030 --> 01:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
when we calculate cost per student on
 
01:58:15.149 --> 01:58:15.159 align:start position:0%
our MS 25s or however it's getting
 
01:58:17.350 --> 01:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
reported to the state it's not apples
 
01:58:19.750 --> 01:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
for apples you know we're including
 
01:58:21.510 --> 01:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
after school programs we're including
 
01:58:24.109 --> 01:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
the clubs we're including the um Sports
 
01:58:26.550 --> 01:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
programs as part of our cost of
 
01:58:30.310 --> 01:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
education and I I personally don't think
 
01:58:32.870 --> 01:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
that those costs should be calculated
 
01:58:36.069 --> 01:58:36.079 align:start position:0%
into the adequate education number and
 
01:58:37.830 --> 01:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
those should be the responsibilities of
 
01:58:39.990 --> 01:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
the towns to fund because they've
 
01:58:43.750 --> 01:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
approved those those um extracurricular
 
01:58:45.950 --> 01:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
items that are outside of the education
 
01:58:48.430 --> 01:58:48.440 align:start position:0%
portion and yes it can be argued that
 
01:58:50.870 --> 01:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
there's things to learn from playing
 
01:58:53.109 --> 01:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
sports um
 
01:58:55.950 --> 01:58:55.960 align:start position:0%
no question but when we look at our
 
01:58:59.270 --> 01:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
adequate education and how the state
 
01:59:01.950 --> 01:59:01.960 align:start position:0%
determines what the average cost per
 
01:59:04.750 --> 01:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
student is we have a lot of extras in
 
01:59:08.069 --> 01:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
there and I just it's not a it's not
 
01:59:11.069 --> 01:59:11.079 align:start position:0%
giving us a fair basis to work with I
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
think I'm a little confused are you
 
01:59:15.270 --> 01:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
saying that we have a lot of these other
 
01:59:17.430 --> 01:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
things you however you want to
 
01:59:21.069 --> 01:59:21.079 align:start position:0%
characterize them in the calculation of
 
01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
what constitutes BAS adequacy or are you
 
01:59:26.149 --> 01:59:26.159 align:start position:0%
saying that that happens to be reported
 
01:59:27.990 --> 01:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
to the state as part of the expenses of
 
01:59:30.189 --> 01:59:30.199 align:start position:0%
the school district Mark can probably
 
01:59:32.750 --> 01:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
say this better than I can but it's I
 
01:59:35.470 --> 01:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
don't believe that it's part of the
 
01:59:37.750 --> 01:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
calculation for the base adequacy but it
 
01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
is part of the
 
01:59:41.510 --> 01:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
calculation of what the the court and
 
01:59:43.390 --> 01:59:43.400 align:start position:0%
others are looking at when they see cost
 
01:59:47.470 --> 01:59:47.480 align:start position:0%
per pupil so when you see $3,000 and
 
01:59:51.030 --> 01:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
$24,000 that's including after school
 
01:59:54.270 --> 01:59:54.280 align:start position:0%
activities before school activities um
 
01:59:55.510 --> 01:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
it may even when I was looking at the
 
01:59:58.109 --> 01:59:58.119 align:start position:0%
ms25 it may even include adult programs
 
01:59:59.430 --> 01:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
because there's a line for that but I
 
02:00:01.229 --> 02:00:01.239 align:start position:0%
would love to have Mark correct me if
 
02:00:03.910 --> 02:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
I'm saying this incorrectly yeah with
 
02:00:06.910 --> 02:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
the cost per pup uh metric whenever it's
 
02:00:08.229 --> 02:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
when it's published and then whenever
 
02:00:09.830 --> 02:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
it's referenced it's referring to
 
02:00:12.990 --> 02:00:13.000 align:start position:0%
current expenditures um uh we back out a
 
02:00:15.990 --> 02:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
few things we back out Transportation um
 
02:00:19.149 --> 02:00:19.159 align:start position:0%
um as well as some other um um areas but
 
02:00:20.629 --> 02:00:20.639 align:start position:0%
yeah it would include um all those
 
02:00:22.750 --> 02:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
additional extra curric ular uh
 
02:00:24.430 --> 02:00:24.440 align:start position:0%
programming um that would be part of the
 
02:00:26.069 --> 02:00:26.079 align:start position:0%
current expenditure so that those some
 
02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
of the programming you T discussed not
 
02:00:31.430 --> 02:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
um Adult Ed um um because that's lower
 
02:00:32.910 --> 02:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
down the financial statements and it's
 
02:00:34.990 --> 02:00:35.000 align:start position:0%
not part of the part of
 
02:00:37.310 --> 02:00:37.320 align:start position:0%
it is
 
02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
it sorry it's in the expenditures it's
 
02:00:43.870 --> 02:00:43.880 align:start position:0%
line six under instruction adult and
 
02:00:45.709 --> 02:00:45.719 align:start position:0%
Community programs what's the function
 
02:00:50.390 --> 02:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
code yeah, 1600 to1 1899 so okay so yeah
 
02:00:52.830 --> 02:00:52.840 align:start position:0%
then it would be it would be included
 
02:00:56.310 --> 02:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
um um so you if it's uh anything in the
 
02:00:58.990 --> 02:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah in the 1600s would be included
 
02:01:01.390 --> 02:01:01.400 align:start position:0%
uh um so that is in the that is in the
 
02:01:03.189 --> 02:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
cost per pupo so whenever that number is
 
02:01:05.310 --> 02:01:05.320 align:start position:0%
referenced it's including those expenses
 
02:01:07.709 --> 02:01:07.719 align:start position:0%
that um are uh would be considered above
 
02:01:09.189 --> 02:01:09.199 align:start position:0%
and beyond the cost of an adequate
 
02:01:11.870 --> 02:01:11.880 align:start position:0%
education above and beyond or it's
 
02:01:13.310 --> 02:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
included in our cost per pupil
 
02:01:16.750 --> 02:01:16.760 align:start position:0%
calculation there's um there's
 
02:01:19.350 --> 02:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
expenditures in the cost per pupil that
 
02:01:21.510 --> 02:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
would be above and beyond what statute
 
02:01:23.430 --> 02:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
says is the cost of inadequate education
 
02:01:26.229 --> 02:01:26.239 align:start position:0%
that's correct thank you and that would
 
02:01:28.510 --> 02:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
have been my answer as well so they
 
02:01:31.510 --> 02:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
don't factor into the determination of
 
02:01:33.589 --> 02:01:33.599 align:start position:0%
uh cost of inadequate
 
02:01:35.669 --> 02:01:35.679 align:start position:0%
education if I
 
02:01:39.990 --> 02:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
may it is coming in in my opinion based
 
02:01:42.270 --> 02:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
on the lawsuits it is coming into the
 
02:01:45.189 --> 02:01:45.199 align:start position:0%
conversation that the districts are
 
02:01:48.990 --> 02:01:49.000 align:start position:0%
saying it costs us $23,000 per pupil and
 
02:01:51.229 --> 02:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
we're not getting enough money so when
 
02:01:53.870 --> 02:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
they're saying we have to spend 23,000
 
02:01:55.629 --> 02:01:55.639 align:start position:0%
per pupil and you're only giving us
 
02:01:57.790 --> 02:01:57.800 align:start position:0%
4,000 or 6,000 or whatever the number is
 
02:01:59.870 --> 02:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
going to be you're not giving us enough
 
02:02:02.669 --> 02:02:02.679 align:start position:0%
it's because this is weighted higher
 
02:02:04.229 --> 02:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
with things that are outside the
 
02:02:06.030 --> 02:02:06.040 align:start position:0%
adequate education
 
02:02:08.550 --> 02:02:08.560 align:start position:0%
requirement okay okay I I think you're
 
02:02:10.870 --> 02:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
getting to the underlying argument about
 
02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
whether the amount that we're uh
 
02:02:15.390 --> 02:02:15.400 align:start position:0%
appropriating to cover the cost of
 
02:02:18.149 --> 02:02:18.159 align:start position:0%
inadequate education is enough and
 
02:02:20.069 --> 02:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
everybody's got their own opinion about
 
02:02:23.350 --> 02:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
that um but the question for us is what
 
02:02:26.189 --> 02:02:26.199 align:start position:0%
are we Bing Gonna Bake into it yes
 
02:02:32.669 --> 02:02:32.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:36.149 --> 02:02:36.159 align:start position:0%
next okay representative fellas so just
 
02:02:39.750 --> 02:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
for clarification the cost per pupil is
 
02:02:41.790 --> 02:02:41.800 align:start position:0%
something that the department Co
 
02:02:44.229 --> 02:02:44.239 align:start position:0%
publishes it's a report that is
 
02:02:46.069 --> 02:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
published and it has multiple lines on
 
02:02:49.470 --> 02:02:49.480 align:start position:0%
it and that's based on what was actually
 
02:02:52.589 --> 02:02:52.599 align:start position:0%
spent by the school districts but the
 
02:02:56.990 --> 02:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
court when they're talking about um what
 
02:02:59.669 --> 02:02:59.679 align:start position:0%
is a adequate you know what does it cost
 
02:03:01.830 --> 02:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
for an adequate education they weren't
 
02:03:05.149 --> 02:03:05.159 align:start position:0%
using that number I think didn't didn't
 
02:03:09.350 --> 02:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
the um conal price out um the adequate
 
02:03:11.310 --> 02:03:11.320 align:start position:0%
part of it and it wasn't
 
02:03:14.229 --> 02:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
just any methodology that I've seen to
 
02:03:15.709 --> 02:03:15.719 align:start position:0%
determine what is the cost of an
 
02:03:18.430 --> 02:03:18.440 align:start position:0%
adequate educ well I I can't say that
 
02:03:21.270 --> 02:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
actually um the methodology used in the
 
02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
2008 report that came up with the 3,500
 
02:03:26.950 --> 02:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
number that was codified in state law
 
02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
that number was U essentially just
 
02:03:31.310 --> 02:03:31.320 align:start position:0%
looked at a teacher a guidance counselor
 
02:03:33.069 --> 02:03:33.079 align:start position:0%
a principal and said what is the cost of
 
02:03:35.270 --> 02:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
this individual and then divided it by
 
02:03:37.149 --> 02:03:37.159 align:start position:0%
number of students to get a per pupil
 
02:03:39.510 --> 02:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
amount so in that methodology they were
 
02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
targeting very specific things that they
 
02:03:43.310 --> 02:03:43.320 align:start position:0%
felt were inadequate education and
 
02:03:45.030 --> 02:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
tallying up the cost so that was a
 
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
methodology used in 2008 that actually
 
02:03:49.830 --> 02:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
was um codif uh that methodology wasn't
 
02:03:52.270 --> 02:03:52.280 align:start position:0%
codified but that number 3500 was
 
02:03:54.030 --> 02:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
codified in state law and so that
 
02:03:55.830 --> 02:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
methodology didn't look at the whole
 
02:03:58.910 --> 02:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
scope of cost per pupil um but there
 
02:04:02.510 --> 02:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
have been exercises that have been uh uh
 
02:04:03.990 --> 02:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
there's been exercises brought into the
 
02:04:05.510 --> 02:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
court and cost per people is something
 
02:04:07.270 --> 02:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
that's been brought into court for sure
 
02:04:09.470 --> 02:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
as part as the conversation um but the
 
02:04:11.910 --> 02:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
methodologies used to determine numbers
 
02:04:14.310 --> 02:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
um have been more narrowly focused to on
 
02:04:15.910 --> 02:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
things that are necessary to provide a
 
02:04:17.549 --> 02:04:17.559 align:start position:0%
cost of inadequate education uh you'd
 
02:04:19.589 --> 02:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
have to read um the conval decision as
 
02:04:21.910 --> 02:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
far as the methodology they used um cost
 
02:04:23.229 --> 02:04:23.239 align:start position:0%
per people was likely referenced
 
02:04:25.149 --> 02:04:25.159 align:start position:0%
multiple times um so it's part of the
 
02:04:26.669 --> 02:04:26.679 align:start position:0%
conversation but you'd have to study
 
02:04:29.270 --> 02:04:29.280 align:start position:0%
their methodology and and and determine
 
02:04:31.790 --> 02:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
um uh your opinion on it essentially so
 
02:04:33.589 --> 02:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
before I call on representative am I
 
02:04:35.109 --> 02:04:35.119 align:start position:0%
would just say that if representative
 
02:04:37.310 --> 02:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
lad were here he would probably Now
 
02:04:40.430 --> 02:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
bring up his chart which the special
 
02:04:42.790 --> 02:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee carefully reviewed a year
 
02:04:44.629 --> 02:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
ago but I don't think it's been placed
 
02:04:46.790 --> 02:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
in front of this committee yet during
 
02:04:49.189 --> 02:04:49.199 align:start position:0%
this cycle and uh I think we have a
 
02:04:50.750 --> 02:04:50.760 align:start position:0%
bunch of members who are not familiar
 
02:04:53.030 --> 02:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
with it but they're they're is a
 
02:04:57.549 --> 02:04:57.559 align:start position:0%
derived uh formula that in fact supports
 
02:04:59.229 --> 02:04:59.239 align:start position:0%
the $
 
02:05:04.270 --> 02:05:04.280 align:start position:0%
4265 which is current uh adequacy number
 
02:05:07.549 --> 02:05:07.559 align:start position:0%
um so perhaps we'll give him a q to to
 
02:05:09.669 --> 02:05:09.679 align:start position:0%
uh move in that direction when he
 
02:05:11.830 --> 02:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
returns and that may be after lunch uh
 
02:05:11.840 --> 02:05:15.549 align:start position:0%
returns and that may be after lunch uh
representative

02:05:15.549 --> 02:05:15.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:19.390 --> 02:05:19.400 align:start position:0%
ases so first I apologize I've been out
 
02:05:21.870 --> 02:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
uh not here for
 
02:05:25.390 --> 02:05:25.400 align:start position:0%
however long it's been almost 2 hours
 
02:05:29.030 --> 02:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
um and uh I've been with representative
 
02:05:31.310 --> 02:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
luno at another hearing and he's still
 
02:05:36.470 --> 02:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
there so um so I'm I've been trying to
 
02:05:39.270 --> 02:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
understand what what's going on here um
 
02:05:41.109 --> 02:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
and I'm stepping into the middle of it
 
02:05:44.229 --> 02:05:44.239 align:start position:0%
but it's been pretty wide ranging so
 
02:05:48.910 --> 02:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
dig okay um but what I wanted to say
 
02:05:51.189 --> 02:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
just in response to what I've heard is
 
02:05:51.199 --> 02:05:53.189 align:start position:0%
just in response to what I've heard is
that

02:05:53.189 --> 02:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:05:56.990 --> 02:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
um that the arguments in
 
02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:58.790 align:start position:0%
um that the arguments in
core

02:05:58.790 --> 02:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
core
 
02:06:02.510 --> 02:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
um that have grown out of the conal
 
02:06:06.390 --> 02:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
lawsuit and the Rand Rand lawsuit both
 
02:06:10.149 --> 02:06:10.159 align:start position:0%
active lawsuits conval at the Finish
 
02:06:13.069 --> 02:06:13.079 align:start position:0%
Line before The Supreme Court in all
 
02:06:18.350 --> 02:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
respects I believe um and Rand um having
 
02:06:21.629 --> 02:06:21.639 align:start position:0%
gone through one component of it the
 
02:06:25.270 --> 02:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
lawsuit that relates to really relates
 
02:06:27.990 --> 02:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
primarily to swept
 
02:06:31.149 --> 02:06:31.159 align:start position:0%
um is back before the trial court
 
02:06:34.189 --> 02:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
justice on this question that that
 
02:06:36.069 --> 02:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
you're now discussing that we're now
 
02:06:38.990 --> 02:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
discussing which is uh well how much
 
02:06:41.750 --> 02:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
does adequacy cost uh
 
02:06:44.629 --> 02:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
what's how does that relate to what the
 
02:06:48.790 --> 02:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
state is providing and uh if it is
 
02:06:50.629 --> 02:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
significantly different is that a
 
02:06:54.750 --> 02:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
difference that uh defensible or not
 
02:06:58.350 --> 02:06:58.360 align:start position:0%
constitutionally so in uh in those
 
02:07:00.790 --> 02:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
arguments the in
 
02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
conal essentially they took a u the
 
02:07:07.830 --> 02:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
judge judge Ru was the trial judge and
 
02:07:12.270 --> 02:07:12.280 align:start position:0%
uh the presenters were um Educators and
 
02:07:14.030 --> 02:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
experts and particularly the
 
02:07:16.270 --> 02:07:16.280 align:start position:0%
superintendent of
 
02:07:20.030 --> 02:07:20.040 align:start position:0%
conal um presented costs real life costs
 
02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
that were not uh including in in their
 
02:07:28.709 --> 02:07:28.719 align:start position:0%
presentation as I recall the costs that
 
02:07:33.189 --> 02:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
are to outside the ambid of the core
 
02:07:36.189 --> 02:07:36.199 align:start position:0%
academic undertaking of the schools and
 
02:07:38.669 --> 02:07:38.679 align:start position:0%
uh their undertaking in
 
02:07:42.549 --> 02:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
that uh trial was the undertaking of the
 
02:07:46.109 --> 02:07:46.119 align:start position:0%
plaintiffs was to demonstrate and
 
02:07:48.549 --> 02:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
prove that
 
02:07:51.109 --> 02:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
4,200 whatever it is something like that
 
02:07:54.470 --> 02:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
per student as a base
 
02:07:59.270 --> 02:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
cost um wasn't enough to provide the
 
02:08:02.750 --> 02:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
fundamentals of uh an adequate education
 
02:08:06.069 --> 02:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
as it's defined in the statute and uh
 
02:08:08.629 --> 02:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
they did not use
 
02:08:12.510 --> 02:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
the per pupil number that's published
 
02:08:14.350 --> 02:08:14.360 align:start position:0%
that you can get at by looking at the
 
02:08:17.390 --> 02:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
total budget and dividing by the numbers
 
02:08:19.510 --> 02:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
of kids and that total budget is going
 
02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:20.310 align:start position:0%
of kids and that total budget is going
to

02:08:20.310 --> 02:08:20.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:08:24.549 --> 02:08:24.559 align:start position:0%
include uh um activities that in this
 
02:08:27.030 --> 02:08:27.040 align:start position:0%
exercise were not being included and
 
02:08:30.790 --> 02:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
they come out very differently so in the
 
02:08:34.510 --> 02:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
trial before J judge ruof he came out
 
02:08:38.350 --> 02:08:38.360 align:start position:0%
with the conclusion that a little over 7
 
02:08:42.510 --> 02:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
$7,000 per pupil as I recall 7356 I
 
02:08:47.709 --> 02:08:47.719 align:start position:0%
believe oh one and one cent and one said
 
02:08:52.149 --> 02:08:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:55.189 --> 02:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
what he I don't recall exactly how he
 
02:08:58.149 --> 02:08:58.159 align:start position:0%
described it but it was a bare minimum
 
02:09:01.470 --> 02:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
and probably not enough he
 
02:09:05.870 --> 02:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
said and uh and that probably when all
 
02:09:09.390 --> 02:09:09.400 align:start position:0%
was said and done um the right number he
 
02:09:12.830 --> 02:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
said would be just shy of $10,000 per
 
02:09:16.830 --> 02:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
student well that is half or less than
 
02:09:21.750 --> 02:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
the published per pupil numbers that um
 
02:09:23.870 --> 02:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
that you can get by just taking the
 
02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
total budget of a a school district and
 
02:09:30.189 --> 02:09:30.199 align:start position:0%
dividing by the number of students uh so
 
02:09:32.350 --> 02:09:32.360 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that's being left out of
 
02:09:35.030 --> 02:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
this adequacy determination because of a
 
02:09:38.669 --> 02:09:38.679 align:start position:0%
judgment made that at its core a lot of
 
02:09:42.229 --> 02:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
the costs that are incurred by school
 
02:09:46.430 --> 02:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
districts although important and perhaps
 
02:09:50.629 --> 02:09:50.639 align:start position:0%
fundamental to the Enterprise are are
 
02:09:54.990 --> 02:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
not at that constitutional level and uh
 
02:09:58.270 --> 02:09:58.280 align:start position:0%
and so that's the general approach
 
02:10:00.390 --> 02:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
that's been taken in the courts and
 
02:10:03.229 --> 02:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
we'll see where the Supreme Court how
 
02:10:05.910 --> 02:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
the supreme court views all of that
 
02:10:09.750 --> 02:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully sooner rather than later um I
 
02:10:12.589 --> 02:10:12.599 align:start position:0%
just want to note that one of the bills
 
02:10:15.589 --> 02:10:15.599 align:start position:0%
that's before us which I'm involved in
 
02:10:18.510 --> 02:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to get into it in any
 
02:10:20.709 --> 02:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
detail because I want because
 
02:10:22.669 --> 02:10:22.679 align:start position:0%
representative Luna really needs to be
 
02:10:25.910 --> 02:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
here for that uh is House Bill
 
02:10:30.669 --> 02:10:30.679 align:start position:0%
772 which is an outgrowth of the um work
 
02:10:33.189 --> 02:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
that the school funding commission that
 
02:10:35.229 --> 02:10:35.239 align:start position:0%
was established in
 
02:10:40.030 --> 02:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
2020 did and uh it's basically it's its
 
02:10:42.709 --> 02:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
recommendation boiled down into a bill
 
02:10:44.069 --> 02:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
and into a
 
02:10:47.990 --> 02:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
formula um and in that bill a different
 
02:10:49.270 --> 02:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
approach was
 
02:10:51.750 --> 02:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
taken um
 
02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:54.310 align:start position:0%
taken um
so

02:10:54.310 --> 02:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:57.830 --> 02:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
that this again I really hesitate to
 
02:11:00.510 --> 02:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
even get into it it's too complicated
 
02:11:02.990 --> 02:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
can but but it it looked at the at the
 
02:11:05.950 --> 02:11:05.960 align:start position:0%
broad array of costs that were being
 
02:11:07.990 --> 02:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
incurred by school districts and the
 
02:11:10.030 --> 02:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
performance of those school districts in
 
02:11:12.830 --> 02:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
terms of student out
 
02:11:16.669 --> 02:11:16.679 align:start position:0%
outcomes and uh and work through to that
 
02:11:22.350 --> 02:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
from that to a a budgeted number that uh
 
02:11:22.360 --> 02:11:25.350 align:start position:0%
from that to a a budgeted number that uh
would

02:11:25.350 --> 02:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:29.390 --> 02:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
be sufficient to meet to provide an
 
02:11:31.510 --> 02:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
adequate education in the Judgment of
 
02:11:35.830 --> 02:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
this commission and um and then provided
 
02:11:38.669 --> 02:11:38.679 align:start position:0%
for the payment of that cost in a very
 
02:11:40.950 --> 02:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
different way than currently is provided
 
02:11:44.750 --> 02:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
basically a joint undertaking Municipal
 
02:11:50.149 --> 02:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
and state that um um significantly
 
02:11:52.229 --> 02:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
increased state aid
 
02:11:54.950 --> 02:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
but uh and and reduce the dependence on
 
02:11:56.990 --> 02:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
the localities by looking at the
 
02:11:59.830 --> 02:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
totality rather than just a piece of it
 
02:12:02.470 --> 02:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
and uh we need to explore that very
 
02:12:06.310 --> 02:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
carefully but we I we've got to do it uh
 
02:12:07.830 --> 02:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
with the prime
 
02:12:11.109 --> 02:12:11.119 align:start position:0%
sponsor good thought and thank you for
 
02:12:13.510 --> 02:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
the clear explanation I think that
 
02:12:15.830 --> 02:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
addressed representative cul's questions
 
02:12:20.149 --> 02:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
extremely well my suggestion it's now um
 
02:12:21.669 --> 02:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
10 past uh
 
02:12:24.990 --> 02:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
noon uh I think that uh let's take our
 
02:12:27.709 --> 02:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
lunch break now and resume at 1 and
 
02:12:29.510 --> 02:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully representative luno
 
02:12:31.709 --> 02:12:31.719 align:start position:0%
representative lad will uh be back with
 
02:12:33.750 --> 02:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
us at that time and I think two of the
 
02:12:35.910 --> 02:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
bills that we really haven't discussed
 
02:12:38.470 --> 02:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
this morning that are if they were
 
02:12:40.830 --> 02:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
adopted uh um
 
02:12:43.790 --> 02:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
transformative are HB
 
02:12:47.109 --> 02:12:47.119 align:start position:0%
772 the foundation opportunity uh budget
 
02:12:49.950 --> 02:12:49.960 align:start position:0%
program and HB
 
02:12:51.669 --> 02:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
675 uh
 
02:12:55.870 --> 02:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
which uh radically increases the swep
 
02:12:59.149 --> 02:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
tax so not that we would limit it but I
 
02:13:01.549 --> 02:13:01.559 align:start position:0%
think that uh those would be two bills
 
02:13:03.470 --> 02:13:03.480 align:start position:0%
we should focus on after lunch with the
 
02:13:07.229 --> 02:13:07.239 align:start position:0%
full crowd okay so we'll recess until
 
02:13:07.239 --> 02:13:23.210 align:start position:0%
full crowd okay so we'll recess until
one

02:13:23.210 --> 02:13:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:23.220 --> 02:13:33.149 align:start position:0%

02:13:50.040 --> 02:14:20.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:14:20.030 --> 02:14:20.040 align:start position:0%

03:09:42.870 --> 03:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
so I would suggest that we pick up a
 
03:09:45.950 --> 03:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
couple of the bills in our roster here
 
03:09:48.990 --> 03:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
that haven't gotten discussion yet um
 
03:09:51.910 --> 03:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps start with the HB
 
03:09:58.590 --> 03:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
675 the Sweeny uh Bill and uh move on to
 
03:10:02.830 --> 03:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative luno HB 772 after
 
03:10:05.670 --> 03:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
that but not too tightly structured just
 
03:10:05.680 --> 03:10:06.750 align:start position:0%
that but not too tightly structured just
a

03:10:06.750 --> 03:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:10:06.760 --> 03:10:08.269 align:start position:0%
a
suggestion

03:10:08.269 --> 03:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
03:10:11.469 --> 03:10:11.479 align:start position:0%
so does anybody want
 
03:10:14.790 --> 03:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
to address this
 
03:10:17.790 --> 03:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
bill and for some reason I miss placed
 
03:10:20.750 --> 03:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
my copy but uh this is the bill that uh
 
03:10:20.760 --> 03:10:22.190 align:start position:0%
my copy but uh this is the bill that uh
dramatically

03:10:22.190 --> 03:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
dramatically
 
03:10:24.670 --> 03:10:24.680 align:start position:0%
increases the
 
03:10:29.590 --> 03:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
swept and uh and then provides base
 
03:10:33.070 --> 03:10:33.080 align:start position:0%
adequacy at the level of Judge Rua's
 
03:10:38.750 --> 03:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:41.710 --> 03:10:41.720 align:start position:0%
case I guess the first observation that
 
03:10:47.469 --> 03:10:47.479 align:start position:0%
I would make is that um doing this with
 
03:10:50.790 --> 03:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
will dramatically increase the amount of
 
03:10:53.309 --> 03:10:53.319 align:start position:0%
excess swept in those towns that already
 
03:10:57.190 --> 03:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
experience it and it will also increase
 
03:10:59.550 --> 03:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
by some maybe undeterminable number the
 
03:11:04.309 --> 03:11:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:11.030 --> 03:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:15.750 --> 03:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
675 so it has some clear benefits and
 
03:11:24.349 --> 03:11:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:27.590 --> 03:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
abilities so Mr chair yes representative
 
03:11:30.950 --> 03:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
luno thank you for kicking this off so I
 
03:11:32.590 --> 03:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
I think there's I think there's three
 
03:11:35.030 --> 03:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
parts to this bill and I'm not looking
 
03:11:38.070 --> 03:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
at it right now but but one of the parts
 
03:11:40.389 --> 03:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
uh adjusted the base cost of an adequate
 
03:11:44.630 --> 03:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
education to the um the the Court's uh
 
03:11:50.110 --> 03:11:50.120 align:start position:0%
the superior Court's U finding yep um
 
03:11:53.269 --> 03:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
73561 correct the second thing it does
 
03:11:56.550 --> 03:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
is IT addresses the the lower Court's
 
03:11:59.790 --> 03:11:59.800 align:start position:0%
finding when it comes to excess swept
 
03:12:02.630 --> 03:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
yes and and uh has the excess swept
 
03:12:06.070 --> 03:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
remitted to the state and it also
 
03:12:09.870 --> 03:12:09.880 align:start position:0%
adjusts the um the swept
 
03:12:15.710 --> 03:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
warrant to um to ra that amount 68% of
 
03:12:18.710 --> 03:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
the additional
 
03:12:21.590 --> 03:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
cost that was calculated in the first in
 
03:12:23.670 --> 03:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
the in the change in adequacy and if I'm
 
03:12:26.750 --> 03:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
not mistaken that's 773 million correct
 
03:12:29.389 --> 03:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
correct and then the third thing it does
 
03:12:34.790 --> 03:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
is impose a um a budget cap on um on on
 
03:12:38.269 --> 03:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
on local school districts uh along with
 
03:12:41.670 --> 03:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
a some sort of override 23s or three
 
03:12:41.680 --> 03:12:42.630 align:start position:0%
a some sort of override 23s or three
fifths

03:12:42.630 --> 03:12:42.640 align:start position:0%
fifths
 
03:12:45.349 --> 03:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
override and a budget cap as distinct
 
03:12:48.429 --> 03:12:48.439 align:start position:0%
from a tax cap correct
 
03:12:50.870 --> 03:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
mhm I so I think I think that's the
 
03:12:53.349 --> 03:12:53.359 align:start position:0%
summary of the of thank you that is a
 
03:12:53.359 --> 03:12:59.030 align:start position:0%
summary of the of thank you that is a
good

03:12:59.030 --> 03:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:01.830 --> 03:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
summary yes representative
 
03:13:05.349 --> 03:13:05.359 align:start position:0%
Damon excuse me thank you so following
 
03:13:09.429 --> 03:13:09.439 align:start position:0%
up on your initial remarks that it would
 
03:13:14.550 --> 03:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
increase um the number of districts with
 
03:13:17.110 --> 03:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
excess swept do we have any more spe
 
03:13:20.710 --> 03:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:25.790 --> 03:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:29.269 --> 03:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
Mark so it I believe that the current
 
03:13:32.990 --> 03:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
law situation is 43 communities and
 
03:13:33.000 --> 03:13:34.710 align:start position:0%
law situation is 43 communities and
$28.6

03:13:34.710 --> 03:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
$28.6
 
03:13:38.070 --> 03:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
million uh yes I think it's 28 million
 
03:13:40.550 --> 03:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
um but
 
03:13:44.790 --> 03:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
um6 is it 26 or 28 no numbers floating
 
03:13:47.910 --> 03:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
around 28 I think U
 
03:13:50.550 --> 03:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
um but um I have a draft fiscal note on
 
03:13:52.389 --> 03:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
this it has not finished um the review
 
03:13:55.550 --> 03:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
process internally so um or maybe it has
 
03:13:57.870 --> 03:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
and it went to the LBA um so you don't
 
03:13:59.710 --> 03:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
have a fiscal note in front of you um
 
03:14:01.790 --> 03:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
but I have been looking at doing
 
03:14:04.750 --> 03:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
analysis I believe I think the number is
 
03:14:07.710 --> 03:14:07.720 align:start position:0%
maybe 57 towns would become excess swept
 
03:14:11.790 --> 03:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
so 10 Towns or so would be added um uh
 
03:14:13.830 --> 03:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
added to the list the excess swept would
 
03:14:16.630 --> 03:14:16.640 align:start position:0%
um would increase um the way to think
 
03:14:18.910 --> 03:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
about when you increase base and when
 
03:14:21.110 --> 03:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
you increase
 
03:14:23.910 --> 03:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
swept you're increasing base on a per
 
03:14:26.070 --> 03:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
student basis so when you increase base
 
03:14:27.870 --> 03:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
adequacy that's based on how many
 
03:14:29.070 --> 03:14:29.080 align:start position:0%
students you have if you have more
 
03:14:30.910 --> 03:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
students you get more money because it's
 
03:14:32.750 --> 03:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
per student amount when you're
 
03:14:35.750 --> 03:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
increasing swept it's based on your
 
03:14:39.469 --> 03:14:39.479 align:start position:0%
share of the state's property values so
 
03:14:42.910 --> 03:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
when you have $1 go up inept $1 go up in
 
03:14:45.030 --> 03:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh sorry $1 go up in base $1 go up in
 
03:14:47.229 --> 03:14:47.239 align:start position:0%
swept it's pretty much neutral cancel
 
03:14:49.950 --> 03:14:49.960 align:start position:0%
each other out um but there is when you
 
03:14:51.910 --> 03:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
actually run a spreadsheet for this uh
 
03:14:55.710 --> 03:14:55.720 align:start position:0%
bill um it's not going to be perfectly
 
03:14:57.870 --> 03:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
that your base is going to go up in the
 
03:15:00.150 --> 03:15:00.160 align:start position:0%
same proportion that your swept goes up
 
03:15:02.190 --> 03:15:02.200 align:start position:0%
um it's going to be pretty there's going
 
03:15:04.910 --> 03:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
to be a lot of matching um but it's an
 
03:15:06.070 --> 03:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
important thing to think about with this
 
03:15:08.030 --> 03:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
formula is you're increasing base which
 
03:15:09.269 --> 03:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
is based on the number of students you
 
03:15:10.910 --> 03:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
have then you're increasing swept which
 
03:15:12.550 --> 03:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
is based on the the prop your share of
 
03:15:15.229 --> 03:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
the state's property wealth essentially
 
03:15:19.269 --> 03:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
um um so just something think about uh
 
03:15:25.429 --> 03:15:25.439 align:start position:0%
but um the fiscal note um has a cost to
 
03:15:34.910 --> 03:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:38.150 --> 03:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
it um yeah my number here is 55 excess
 
03:15:38.160 --> 03:15:39.269 align:start position:0%
it um yeah my number here is 55 excess
swep

03:15:39.269 --> 03:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
swep
 
03:15:41.670 --> 03:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
towns um so that's getting about 10
 
03:15:50.630 --> 03:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:53.389 --> 03:15:53.399 align:start position:0%
43 to 55 I
 
03:15:53.399 --> 03:16:01.110 align:start position:0%
43 to 55 I
believe

03:16:01.110 --> 03:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:06.910 --> 03:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
yep the um um the impact to um adequacy
 
03:16:08.910 --> 03:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
so you're increasing re you're
 
03:16:10.670 --> 03:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
increasing base which is increasing your
 
03:16:12.389 --> 03:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
cost but you're also increasing swept at
 
03:16:15.269 --> 03:16:15.279 align:start position:0%
the same time so um you're you're
 
03:16:16.389 --> 03:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
increasing Revenue at the same time
 
03:16:18.830 --> 03:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
you're increasing in in cost so it's not
 
03:16:21.189 --> 03:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
um um the the end adequacy formula is
 
03:16:24.309 --> 03:16:24.319 align:start position:0%
going to say $1.5 billion um but a lot
 
03:16:25.550 --> 03:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
of that is going to net out against
 
03:16:27.630 --> 03:16:27.640 align:start position:0%
swept so
 
03:16:29.790 --> 03:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
um sorry I'm a little unprepared I got
 
03:16:32.870 --> 03:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
to find my draft fiscal note so M so M
 
03:16:36.670 --> 03:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um the the the dollar increase
 
03:16:40.550 --> 03:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
to to base would would only only apply
 
03:16:43.469 --> 03:16:43.479 align:start position:0%
to the number of um of students in that
 
03:16:45.950 --> 03:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
in that municipality in that city of
 
03:16:48.269 --> 03:16:48.279 align:start position:0%
town city or town
 
03:16:51.030 --> 03:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
you only get basee for the admr for for
 
03:16:53.830 --> 03:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
kids yes for the admr so the dollar
 
03:16:58.429 --> 03:16:58.439 align:start position:0%
increase to swept applies to every uh
 
03:17:02.070 --> 03:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
taxable piece of property in the town so
 
03:17:05.710 --> 03:17:05.720 align:start position:0%
so there's obviously
 
03:17:09.030 --> 03:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
um from cities and towns across the
 
03:17:10.469 --> 03:17:10.479 align:start position:0%
state you're not going to have a
 
03:17:12.950 --> 03:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
onetoone correlation or or even a
 
03:17:14.950 --> 03:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
uniform ratio between the number of
 
03:17:16.550 --> 03:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
taxable properties and the number of
 
03:17:16.560 --> 03:17:19.349 align:start position:0%
taxable properties and the number of
student

03:17:19.349 --> 03:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:21.990 --> 03:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
students I think I follow you yeah I'm
 
03:17:25.309 --> 03:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
just saying that that that um that you
 
03:17:28.790 --> 03:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
know a a a dollar increase in swept and
 
03:17:31.469 --> 03:17:31.479 align:start position:0%
a dollar increase in base are just are
 
03:17:33.830 --> 03:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
two different things
 
03:17:36.870 --> 03:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
understood so I mean the way that I
 
03:17:38.830 --> 03:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
understand that the figures in the bill
 
03:17:41.510 --> 03:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
have been derived are first to take the
 
03:17:44.630 --> 03:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh base adequacy per pupil as dictated
 
03:17:48.550 --> 03:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
in the court decision and then determine
 
03:17:50.510 --> 03:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
from that how much swept would have to
 
03:17:52.870 --> 03:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
be raised to cover it uh even though
 
03:17:55.429 --> 03:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
it's got all the Varian as youve just
 
03:17:57.750 --> 03:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
described right but but but I but I
 
03:17:59.550 --> 03:17:59.560 align:start position:0%
think also a thing that that Mark was
 
03:18:00.870 --> 03:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
talking about and you and I have talked
 
03:18:03.630 --> 03:18:03.640 align:start position:0%
about it before too um because it I
 
03:18:07.110 --> 03:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
think it's it's particularly um evident
 
03:18:09.590 --> 03:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
in in the town that you in Charlestown
 
03:18:11.590 --> 03:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
the town where you live uh because I
 
03:18:14.389 --> 03:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
think Charlestown saw an increase in
 
03:18:16.870 --> 03:18:16.880 align:start position:0%
valuation that was disproportionately
 
03:18:19.469 --> 03:18:19.479 align:start position:0%
higher than the average um increase in
 
03:18:21.950 --> 03:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
valuation across the
 
03:18:25.110 --> 03:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
state I think that might be true I'm not
 
03:18:27.269 --> 03:18:27.279 align:start position:0%
totally certain of it but I mean we we
 
03:18:29.550 --> 03:18:29.560 align:start position:0%
that would be something that you know if
 
03:18:34.349 --> 03:18:34.359 align:start position:0%
looking at changes in in swept that may
 
03:18:35.830 --> 03:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
be something that this committee wants
 
03:18:38.229 --> 03:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
to at least take a look at you know
 
03:18:42.830 --> 03:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
where just like what Mark said it it um
 
03:18:44.950 --> 03:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
your proportion is swept has to do with
 
03:18:46.150 --> 03:18:46.160 align:start position:0%
the proportion of your property
 
03:18:48.309 --> 03:18:48.319 align:start position:0%
valuation compared to all property in
 
03:18:48.319 --> 03:18:49.910 align:start position:0%
valuation compared to all property in
New

03:18:49.910 --> 03:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
New
 
03:18:52.670 --> 03:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yeah it's just a a feature of
 
03:18:55.030 --> 03:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
this type of formula which is pretty
 
03:18:57.550 --> 03:18:57.560 align:start position:0%
much our current Formula um just added
 
03:18:59.110 --> 03:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
additional boost to it but um just
 
03:19:01.150 --> 03:19:01.160 align:start position:0%
something that um something to
 
03:19:02.910 --> 03:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
conceptually think about I'm already
 
03:19:04.910 --> 03:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
getting a um since I have a draft fiscal
 
03:19:06.429 --> 03:19:06.439 align:start position:0%
note and the LBA has not reviewed it
 
03:19:08.110 --> 03:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
Mickey's already sending me teams
 
03:19:09.469 --> 03:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
messages saying he has different numbers
 
03:19:11.429 --> 03:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
slightly so um we have I I don't want to
 
03:19:12.710 --> 03:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
speak too much about numbers until I
 
03:19:14.630 --> 03:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
have a chance for Mickey to review them
 
03:19:16.790 --> 03:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
um but I can speak conceptually about um
 
03:19:18.189 --> 03:19:18.199 align:start position:0%
some of the components of the
 
03:19:22.790 --> 03:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
bill Mr chair okay so so with those now
 
03:19:24.429 --> 03:19:24.439 align:start position:0%
I don't suppose that this is in the
 
03:19:27.750 --> 03:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal note but uh um can you model what
 
03:19:30.030 --> 03:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
that would look like by town across the
 
03:19:33.229 --> 03:19:33.239 align:start position:0%
state yeah I built a a a draft fiscal
 
03:19:35.550 --> 03:19:35.560 align:start position:0%
note that has a town by Town um that
 
03:19:37.590 --> 03:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
will make its way to the LBA and Mickey
 
03:19:39.349 --> 03:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
will see if um if he gets the same
 
03:19:41.070 --> 03:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
result essentially we're looking at a
 
03:19:45.309 --> 03:19:45.319 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks um uh or days yeah yeah
 
03:19:47.590 --> 03:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh um I don't know I could I could I
 
03:19:49.670 --> 03:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
could proba try to prioritize it okay
 
03:19:52.269 --> 03:19:52.279 align:start position:0%
I'm yes
 
03:19:54.830 --> 03:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
representative I just wanted to clarify
 
03:19:57.790 --> 03:19:57.800 align:start position:0%
that uh based on the way LBA worked in
 
03:20:00.469 --> 03:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
the past we're talking days not weeks
 
03:20:02.309 --> 03:20:02.319 align:start position:0%
because it would be a rough estimate
 
03:20:05.349 --> 03:20:05.359 align:start position:0%
right it wouldn't be you know fine-tuned
 
03:20:06.910 --> 03:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
to every little thing but it's what we
 
03:20:09.429 --> 03:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
need to just have an idea of what the
 
03:20:11.990 --> 03:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
you know uh changes would be and if I
 
03:20:14.830 --> 03:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
may really quickly mhm I just wanted to
 
03:20:16.990 --> 03:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
say that I share the concerns expressed
 
03:20:19.150 --> 03:20:19.160 align:start position:0%
by you know multiple people testifying
 
03:20:21.189 --> 03:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
including my colleague from Hopkin on
 
03:20:23.750 --> 03:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
that because we are not really matching
 
03:20:25.710 --> 03:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
the expenditures where the funds go to
 
03:20:27.750 --> 03:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
where the revenues are generated this
 
03:20:29.830 --> 03:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
seems like it will increase certain
 
03:20:32.870 --> 03:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
types of inequality in the state and I
 
03:20:34.590 --> 03:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
think we want to look at Equity we want
 
03:20:36.630 --> 03:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
to obviously make sure that people
 
03:20:38.309 --> 03:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
districts who need more help get more
 
03:20:40.990 --> 03:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
help but to give them more that more
 
03:20:44.150 --> 03:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
help by leaning even harder on other
 
03:20:46.269 --> 03:20:46.279 align:start position:0%
communities tends to have certain
 
03:20:48.429 --> 03:20:48.439 align:start position:0%
negative implications in the state as a
 
03:20:50.070 --> 03:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
whole that we just got to be careful
 
03:20:51.670 --> 03:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
about I'm not saying I have a solution
 
03:20:53.750 --> 03:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
right now but I think those are very
 
03:20:55.389 --> 03:20:55.399 align:start position:0%
legitimate concerns we should keep in
 
03:20:57.870 --> 03:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
mind well I think that the real estate
 
03:21:01.710 --> 03:21:01.720 align:start position:0%
tax is a particularly uncomfortable
 
03:21:04.150 --> 03:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
source to use for redistribution
 
03:21:07.110 --> 03:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
purposes and that's part of the uh the
 
03:21:09.750 --> 03:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
obstacle in this approach I think that
 
03:21:12.510 --> 03:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that people could easily
 
03:21:14.229 --> 03:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
criticize this
 
03:21:16.630 --> 03:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
approach uh as just simply a
 
03:21:18.790 --> 03:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
characterization of a certain portion of
 
03:21:22.030 --> 03:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
the uh property tax from the local Ed
 
03:21:26.710 --> 03:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
column to the uh U State column um you
 
03:21:29.469 --> 03:21:29.479 align:start position:0%
know a distinction without a difference
 
03:21:31.790 --> 03:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
um and it does nothing to alleviate the
 
03:21:38.189 --> 03:21:38.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:40.389 --> 03:21:40.399 align:start position:0%
duress representative
 
03:21:46.750 --> 03:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
Ames well that's I agree um
 
03:21:50.229 --> 03:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
can swept can easily be
 
03:21:50.239 --> 03:21:52.150 align:start position:0%
can swept can easily be
mischaracterized

03:21:52.150 --> 03:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
mischaracterized
 
03:21:55.990 --> 03:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
and identified uh in a way
 
03:21:58.510 --> 03:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
that's really not in keeping with the
 
03:22:01.150 --> 03:22:01.160 align:start position:0%
nature of the tax if we if we take it as
 
03:22:04.510 --> 03:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
a state tax it's not a tax on the
 
03:22:07.469 --> 03:22:07.479 align:start position:0%
community it's a tax on pieces of
 
03:22:12.469 --> 03:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
property around the state and then um
 
03:22:16.070 --> 03:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
because of the way in which the tax has
 
03:22:18.389 --> 03:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
been this particular tax has been
 
03:22:21.030 --> 03:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
collected it's collected locally by
 
03:22:23.870 --> 03:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities and because of the way it
 
03:22:23.880 --> 03:22:25.710 align:start position:0%
municipalities and because of the way it
factors

03:22:25.710 --> 03:22:25.720 align:start position:0%
factors
 
03:22:29.469 --> 03:22:29.479 align:start position:0%
into uh the payment of educational
 
03:22:32.309 --> 03:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
costs uh or it has factored into the
 
03:22:37.389 --> 03:22:37.399 align:start position:0%
payment of educational costs it becomes
 
03:22:39.870 --> 03:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
a attributed to the
 
03:22:42.870 --> 03:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
community um the communities paying more
 
03:22:46.550 --> 03:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
or less as the tax rate goes up and
 
03:22:49.389 --> 03:22:49.399 align:start position:0%
those property
 
03:22:53.630 --> 03:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
values sway from one component to
 
03:22:56.229 --> 03:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
another that uh affects the market value
 
03:22:59.590 --> 03:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
of property in the town
 
03:23:04.030 --> 03:23:04.040 align:start position:0%
um and then the sort of possession
 
03:23:06.950 --> 03:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
that possession impulse that gets into
 
03:23:10.670 --> 03:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
this and uh and the towns that have a
 
03:23:13.269 --> 03:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
property value that's going up and
 
03:23:16.990 --> 03:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
already is up whatever um and
 
03:23:20.550 --> 03:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
and produce much more at a particular
 
03:23:23.389 --> 03:23:23.399 align:start position:0%
equalized rate than other
 
03:23:23.399 --> 03:23:25.070 align:start position:0%
equalized rate than other
towns

03:23:25.070 --> 03:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
towns
 
03:23:27.429 --> 03:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
um understandably say well it's our
 
03:23:29.670 --> 03:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
money don't take it away and when it's
 
03:23:34.630 --> 03:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
taken away it uh it produces uh losses
 
03:23:35.750 --> 03:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
which has
 
03:23:40.309 --> 03:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
happened um and the town
 
03:23:46.110 --> 03:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
that's having its wealth um T taken by
 
03:23:48.150 --> 03:23:48.160 align:start position:0%
other parts of the
 
03:23:50.429 --> 03:23:50.439 align:start position:0%
state have been characterized
 
03:23:52.750 --> 03:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
historically as donor towns because it's
 
03:23:54.670 --> 03:23:54.680 align:start position:0%
their money that's going but it's not
 
03:23:57.550 --> 03:23:57.560 align:start position:0%
really it's it's the individual
 
03:24:00.070 --> 03:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that are paying this so it's
 
03:24:02.790 --> 03:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
really a state tax so I suspect this you
 
03:24:04.670 --> 03:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
stated the other day that the Supreme
 
03:24:08.229 --> 03:24:08.239 align:start position:0%
Court will see it that way and will
 
03:24:11.790 --> 03:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
uh um say that it's not in keeping with
 
03:24:15.389 --> 03:24:15.399 align:start position:0%
the state tax to take uh the money
 
03:24:19.830 --> 03:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
that's collected and in uh in Ry that
 
03:24:24.349 --> 03:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
exceeds the uh adequate education amount
 
03:24:27.950 --> 03:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
that's attributed to Ry
 
03:24:30.790 --> 03:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
and it's not appropriate to leave that
 
03:24:33.830 --> 03:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
money in Ry for the benefit of other
 
03:24:36.070 --> 03:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
things or to pay for other costs
 
03:24:38.389 --> 03:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
educational costs as it happens in this
 
03:24:40.870 --> 03:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
case and I suspect the Supreme Court
 
03:24:43.189 --> 03:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
will come out that way but we don't know
 
03:24:46.110 --> 03:24:46.120 align:start position:0%
you know you said as much we don't know
 
03:24:46.120 --> 03:24:46.870 align:start position:0%
you know you said as much we don't know
you

03:24:46.870 --> 03:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:24:49.790 --> 03:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
I I've I've given up on predicting that
 
03:24:51.630 --> 03:24:51.640 align:start position:0%
Supreme Courts are going to come out
 
03:24:54.429 --> 03:24:54.439 align:start position:0%
with uh with how they're going to judge
 
03:24:57.950 --> 03:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
these things but uh it it's a confusing
 
03:25:00.830 --> 03:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
tax because of all this but it's in a
 
03:25:03.429 --> 03:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
way it's a tax it's a tax on wealth
 
03:25:07.630 --> 03:25:07.640 align:start position:0%
that's what it is and um it uh
 
03:25:09.950 --> 03:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
distributes across the state uh
 
03:25:11.710 --> 03:25:11.720 align:start position:0%
according to where the wealth
 
03:25:15.389 --> 03:25:15.399 align:start position:0%
is I think extremely valuable insights
 
03:25:15.399 --> 03:25:17.389 align:start position:0%
is I think extremely valuable insights
um

03:25:17.389 --> 03:25:17.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:19.510 --> 03:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
the more that we try to categorize
 
03:25:21.750 --> 03:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
things the more that we uh you know have
 
03:25:24.750 --> 03:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
to characterize them in in in different
 
03:25:24.760 --> 03:25:26.229 align:start position:0%
to characterize them in in in different
uh

03:25:26.229 --> 03:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:25:30.590 --> 03:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
subsets but uh at the end of the day
 
03:25:33.670 --> 03:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
conceptually um all of the individual
 
03:25:37.189 --> 03:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
Parcels of property are part of one pool
 
03:25:39.110 --> 03:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
and that's the state of New
 
03:25:41.710 --> 03:25:41.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and
 
03:25:43.950 --> 03:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
conversely uh all of the counties and
 
03:25:46.429 --> 03:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
all of the municipalities are constructs
 
03:25:48.150 --> 03:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire so it
 
03:25:49.429 --> 03:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
works both
 
03:25:53.070 --> 03:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
ways uh and and uh that's one of the
 
03:25:56.269 --> 03:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
things that I've s found so
 
03:25:58.910 --> 03:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
troubling about the uh distinction
 
03:26:01.309 --> 03:26:01.319 align:start position:0%
between a local Ed tax and a state
 
03:26:03.870 --> 03:26:03.880 align:start position:0%
tax when it comes to property I think
 
03:26:07.389 --> 03:26:07.399 align:start position:0%
the real underlying issue is that if you
 
03:26:11.269 --> 03:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
tax One Source too greatly and if you
 
03:26:14.790 --> 03:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
tax it in ways that hit different uh um
 
03:26:16.790 --> 03:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
you know parts of the
 
03:26:19.469 --> 03:26:19.479 align:start position:0%
population and communities differently
 
03:26:21.189 --> 03:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
you create pain that can't be
 
03:26:27.110 --> 03:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:29.750 --> 03:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
state representative Flo yeah thank you
 
03:26:32.269 --> 03:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so um representative Ames
 
03:26:36.030 --> 03:26:36.040 align:start position:0%
brought up you know um some terms that
 
03:26:39.229 --> 03:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
that I think probably you know um took
 
03:26:42.590 --> 03:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
hold more than 20 years ago the the the
 
03:26:47.309 --> 03:26:47.319 align:start position:0%
donor receiver um um towns and we've
 
03:26:49.870 --> 03:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
certainly you know over my time here
 
03:26:51.469 --> 03:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
I've spent a lot of time talking with
 
03:26:53.910 --> 03:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
members of the Coalition communities and
 
03:26:57.590 --> 03:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
and uh and um I don't necessarily agree
 
03:26:59.630 --> 03:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
with with all of their positions because
 
03:27:01.510 --> 03:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
I agree with what what you just said
 
03:27:05.389 --> 03:27:05.399 align:start position:0%
very succinctly that that um that the
 
03:27:08.309 --> 03:27:08.319 align:start position:0%
property base is Statewide and and it's
 
03:27:11.990 --> 03:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
serving a Statewide obligation in its um
 
03:27:14.349 --> 03:27:14.359 align:start position:0%
use as a Statewide education property
 
03:27:17.990 --> 03:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
tax but would would people see things I
 
03:27:20.070 --> 03:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
mean would it be looked at differently
 
03:27:21.790 --> 03:27:21.800 align:start position:0%
if rather than being used for Education
 
03:27:26.950 --> 03:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:29.750 --> 03:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
bridges I I think that's a very good
 
03:27:33.070 --> 03:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
rhetorical question um I I think most
 
03:27:34.830 --> 03:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
people would agree to go back to the
 
03:27:37.070 --> 03:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
property tax that property tax is a
 
03:27:37.080 --> 03:27:38.870 align:start position:0%
property tax that property tax is a
reasonable

03:27:38.870 --> 03:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
03:27:41.950 --> 03:27:41.960 align:start position:0%
source to provide for
 
03:27:45.309 --> 03:27:45.319 align:start position:0%
Education um it's interesting uh my town
 
03:27:48.070 --> 03:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
Charlestown was uh founded on the
 
03:27:51.590 --> 03:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
Connecticut River in 1730s and 40s and
 
03:27:55.550 --> 03:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
the very first tax um was authorized to
 
03:27:57.150 --> 03:27:57.160 align:start position:0%
at town meeting in
 
03:28:00.870 --> 03:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
1758 to pay pay for hiring a minister
 
03:28:02.590 --> 03:28:02.600 align:start position:0%
for the Congregational Church that they
 
03:28:05.950 --> 03:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
were going to create so you know what we
 
03:28:08.389 --> 03:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
tax for comes in and out of fashion over
 
03:28:12.630 --> 03:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
time uh but but real estate is a
 
03:28:12.640 --> 03:28:13.830 align:start position:0%
time uh but but real estate is a
reasonable

03:28:13.830 --> 03:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
03:28:17.750 --> 03:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
source for supporting education it's
 
03:28:20.150 --> 03:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
just not reasonable when it's supporting
 
03:28:21.950 --> 03:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
municipal government County government
 
03:28:27.389 --> 03:28:27.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:30.110 --> 03:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
it right so it's it's not that it's not
 
03:28:31.830 --> 03:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
that it's conceptually the wrong place
 
03:28:35.110 --> 03:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
to look it's that it's too much it's out
 
03:28:35.120 --> 03:28:39.790 align:start position:0%
to look it's that it's too much it's out
of

03:28:39.790 --> 03:28:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:43.389 --> 03:28:43.399 align:start position:0%
proportion it's too much yes uh I think
 
03:28:47.150 --> 03:28:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:49.750 --> 03:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
the other feature that Creeps in is that
 
03:28:52.070 --> 03:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh the con
 
03:28:55.790 --> 03:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
the value of property is not evenly
 
03:29:00.590 --> 03:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
spread through the state so that um uh
 
03:29:02.910 --> 03:29:02.920 align:start position:0%
if you're talking about a
 
03:29:07.510 --> 03:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
Statewide a a uh a
 
03:29:09.910 --> 03:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
program that's
 
03:29:13.790 --> 03:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
important that um and make it dependent
 
03:29:16.229 --> 03:29:16.239 align:start position:0%
on the local wealth
 
03:29:18.389 --> 03:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
uh for its uh
 
03:29:22.349 --> 03:29:22.359 align:start position:0%
funding uh the outcome is going to be
 
03:29:25.550 --> 03:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
uneven uh almost inevitably and we've
 
03:29:29.030 --> 03:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
got huge differences in wealth between
 
03:29:33.229 --> 03:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
towns you'll find we'll talk about uh
 
03:29:35.790 --> 03:29:35.800 align:start position:0%
772 the
 
03:29:40.070 --> 03:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh Foundation opportunity budget bill um
 
03:29:44.349 --> 03:29:44.359 align:start position:0%
maybe this afternoon but um one aspect
 
03:29:46.910 --> 03:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
of that bill is that
 
03:29:49.389 --> 03:29:49.399 align:start position:0%
let's bring that bill in
 
03:29:53.429 --> 03:29:53.439 align:start position:0%
now we could yeah okay
 
03:29:56.870 --> 03:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
um yes yeah yep there's no reason to
 
03:29:59.990 --> 03:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
hold off on it let's integrate
 
03:30:03.750 --> 03:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
this so one aspect of 772 I'm going to
 
03:30:06.349 --> 03:30:06.359 align:start position:0%
turn it over to Dave in a moment Dave L
 
03:30:08.150 --> 03:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
luno representative luno because we're
 
03:30:12.030 --> 03:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
in a formal setting
 
03:30:18.870 --> 03:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
um one aspect of of hb77 to is that
 
03:30:24.349 --> 03:30:24.359 align:start position:0%
it it recognizes that uh this
 
03:30:27.790 --> 03:30:27.800 align:start position:0%
educational undertaking that we have and
 
03:30:31.030 --> 03:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
an obligation that we have in uh New
 
03:30:36.150 --> 03:30:36.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to provide for an adequate
 
03:30:39.710 --> 03:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
education um is an
 
03:30:45.510 --> 03:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
obligation that is uh placed on the
 
03:30:45.520 --> 03:30:47.389 align:start position:0%
obligation that is uh placed on the
state

03:30:47.389 --> 03:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:30:50.830 --> 03:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
but which um historically has been
 
03:30:54.150 --> 03:30:54.160 align:start position:0%
exercised fulfilled mostly uh
 
03:30:58.469 --> 03:30:58.479 align:start position:0%
significantly through through um each
 
03:31:02.269 --> 03:31:02.279 align:start position:0%
local school district the at a local
 
03:31:06.309 --> 03:31:06.319 align:start position:0%
level and um that in thinking about
 
03:31:06.319 --> 03:31:07.830 align:start position:0%
level and um that in thinking about
paying

03:31:07.830 --> 03:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
paying
 
03:31:11.429 --> 03:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
for that obligation which the state
 
03:31:14.750 --> 03:31:14.760 align:start position:0%
holds it's the state's obligation to
 
03:31:17.030 --> 03:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
guarantee uh uh the funding of an
 
03:31:17.040 --> 03:31:18.349 align:start position:0%
guarantee uh uh the funding of an
adequate

03:31:18.349 --> 03:31:18.359 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
03:31:18.359 --> 03:31:20.710 align:start position:0%
adequate
education

03:31:20.710 --> 03:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
education
 
03:31:25.750 --> 03:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
um it to pay for that in 772 you'll see
 
03:31:30.870 --> 03:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
that um we're looking both to the state
 
03:31:34.830 --> 03:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
state sourced funds and to the locality
 
03:31:36.750 --> 03:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
so local source to
 
03:31:40.670 --> 03:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
funds um with the local Source funds
 
03:31:44.269 --> 03:31:44.279 align:start position:0%
being held to a what you might think of
 
03:31:48.189 --> 03:31:48.199 align:start position:0%
as a modest level of low level that's
 
03:31:51.590 --> 03:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
equalized um and that then becomes part
 
03:31:55.309 --> 03:31:55.319 align:start position:0%
of the pot that's paying for an adequate
 
03:31:57.150 --> 03:31:57.160 align:start position:0%
education and the
 
03:32:01.309 --> 03:32:01.319 align:start position:0%
state uh pays for the rest so in a town
 
03:32:01.319 --> 03:32:02.590 align:start position:0%
state uh pays for the rest so in a town
that's

03:32:02.590 --> 03:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:32:05.870 --> 03:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh got significant property per
 
03:32:08.070 --> 03:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
whatever Factor it is per
 
03:32:08.080 --> 03:32:10.349 align:start position:0%
whatever Factor it is per
pupil

03:32:10.349 --> 03:32:10.359 align:start position:0%
pupil
 
03:32:14.510 --> 03:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
um the obligation may be completely
 
03:32:19.229 --> 03:32:19.239 align:start position:0%
fulfilled by local funding um in a
 
03:32:23.229 --> 03:32:23.239 align:start position:0%
midlevel town um it would be partially
 
03:32:27.429 --> 03:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
fulfilled let's say 50% 60% or so will
 
03:32:29.990 --> 03:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
come from the locality but then the
 
03:32:34.510 --> 03:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
state pours in the rest uh the 40% or
 
03:32:37.670 --> 03:32:37.680 align:start position:0%
whatever and then in in a town that has
 
03:32:40.750 --> 03:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
little value um you know little
 
03:32:45.630 --> 03:32:45.640 align:start position:0%
significantly less value um per pupil
 
03:32:49.229 --> 03:32:49.239 align:start position:0%
the the um State comes in with a larger
 
03:32:52.349 --> 03:32:52.359 align:start position:0%
sum and uh you can measure those sums on
 
03:32:56.030 --> 03:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
a paup basis so you get some
 
03:32:58.110 --> 03:32:58.120 align:start position:0%
understanding of what's larger and
 
03:33:04.150 --> 03:33:04.160 align:start position:0%
what's not um so that feature is in our
 
03:33:09.349 --> 03:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
bill which uh my I say our bill luno and
 
03:33:18.790 --> 03:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:24.710 --> 03:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
Damon um you see in that bill um that
 
03:33:28.590 --> 03:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
this is what we're trying to do to
 
03:33:31.990 --> 03:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
ensure that we're able to fund at a
 
03:33:34.670 --> 03:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
meaningful level and to do so in an
 
03:33:37.550 --> 03:33:37.560 align:start position:0%
affordable way that recognizes the
 
03:33:39.469 --> 03:33:39.479 align:start position:0%
different capacities in different
 
03:33:47.990 --> 03:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:51.070 --> 03:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
just continue running and look at
 
03:33:51.080 --> 03:33:52.790 align:start position:0%
just continue running and look at
me

03:33:52.790 --> 03:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
me
 
03:33:57.349 --> 03:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
so representative Ames the
 
03:33:57.359 --> 03:33:59.269 align:start position:0%
so representative Ames the
$538

03:33:59.269 --> 03:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
$538
 
03:34:02.269 --> 03:34:02.279 align:start position:0%
um per thousand value Foundation
 
03:34:05.630 --> 03:34:05.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity is basically an analog to a
 
03:34:08.349 --> 03:34:08.359 align:start position:0%
swept but conceptually it's we start
 
03:34:11.510 --> 03:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
here and then we supplement above that
 
03:34:13.150 --> 03:34:13.160 align:start position:0%
that's I suppose that's one way of
 
03:34:16.110 --> 03:34:16.120 align:start position:0%
putting that the uh the uh and it's
 
03:34:20.830 --> 03:34:20.840 align:start position:0%
looking across the state and uh
 
03:34:23.710 --> 03:34:23.720 align:start position:0%
there's there there are M municipalities
 
03:34:27.389 --> 03:34:27.399 align:start position:0%
that tax at a lower level you know $2
 
03:34:30.630 --> 03:34:30.640 align:start position:0%
$3 that have very significant much
 
03:34:34.150 --> 03:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
greater property wealth from most towns
 
03:34:37.269 --> 03:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
and uh with that $2 rate they rais more
 
03:34:41.670 --> 03:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
than enough to meet not only adequacy
 
03:34:44.229 --> 03:34:44.239 align:start position:0%
aid but a much higher level of spending
 
03:34:48.469 --> 03:34:48.479 align:start position:0%
on their communities so there are some
 
03:34:53.189 --> 03:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
many what 30 40 communities that are at
 
03:34:56.229 --> 03:34:56.239 align:start position:0%
at that low level below the the number
 
03:34:59.590 --> 03:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
that you just referenced um but if you
 
03:35:03.030 --> 03:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
look across the state um apart from
 
03:35:05.389 --> 03:35:05.399 align:start position:0%
those municipalities that can fully pay
 
03:35:11.510 --> 03:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
for adequacy plus uh with uh a low rate
 
03:35:15.870 --> 03:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
a rate lower than that number um
 
03:35:18.070 --> 03:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
practically every other maybe with a
 
03:35:21.389 --> 03:35:21.399 align:start position:0%
couple of exceptions uh municipality is
 
03:35:25.590 --> 03:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
at or above that number
 
03:35:29.710 --> 03:35:29.720 align:start position:0%
$538 um so there's no increase in tax
 
03:35:32.110 --> 03:35:32.120 align:start position:0%
it's recognizing effort that's already
 
03:35:35.830 --> 03:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
being made and recognizing it at a
 
03:35:38.269 --> 03:35:38.279 align:start position:0%
equalized and uniform level and then
 
03:35:40.349 --> 03:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
building off of
 
03:35:43.590 --> 03:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
that maybe representative luno yeah I I
 
03:35:46.150 --> 03:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
would just want to LUN couple of points
 
03:35:48.910 --> 03:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair so couple
 
03:35:52.870 --> 03:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
of points um really important to
 
03:35:55.950 --> 03:35:55.960 align:start position:0%
772s local share which is the first
 
03:35:58.429 --> 03:35:58.439 align:start position:0%
dollars in towards your towards your
 
03:36:00.590 --> 03:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
your um your foundation opportunity
 
03:36:03.389 --> 03:36:03.399 align:start position:0%
budget first dollars or local dollars
 
03:36:04.670 --> 03:36:04.680 align:start position:0%
and up to
 
03:36:07.150 --> 03:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
$538 per thousand and that was based on
 
03:36:07.160 --> 03:36:07.910 align:start position:0%
$538 per thousand and that was based on
a

03:36:07.910 --> 03:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:36:12.189 --> 03:36:12.199 align:start position:0%
calculation um that that um that if
 
03:36:17.229 --> 03:36:17.239 align:start position:0%
every city in town worked towards that
 
03:36:21.590 --> 03:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
$538 and did not go beyond that so just
 
03:36:23.590 --> 03:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
like representative am said sometimes
 
03:36:26.710 --> 03:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
are going to stop at um a buck 50
 
03:36:28.229 --> 03:36:28.239 align:start position:0%
sometimes are going to stop at
 
03:36:31.950 --> 03:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
$225 $3 $4 $5
 
03:36:35.870 --> 03:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
$538 you hit the brakes and what that
 
03:36:41.550 --> 03:36:41.560 align:start position:0%
would leave as as un still yet to be
 
03:36:44.269 --> 03:36:44.279 align:start position:0%
funded Foundation opportunity budget it
 
03:36:47.110 --> 03:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
would leave approximately 4
 
03:36:49.710 --> 03:36:49.720 align:start position:0%
48% Statewide total some of the budgets
 
03:36:52.870 --> 03:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
have already been fully funded at $2.50
 
03:36:55.269 --> 03:36:55.279 align:start position:0%
per thousand up to
 
03:36:58.670 --> 03:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
$538 hit the brakes and uh and it would
 
03:37:02.269 --> 03:37:02.279 align:start position:0%
leave a remaining State share of about
 
03:37:07.150 --> 03:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
40 47% 48% I think we've got 48% in the
 
03:37:09.429 --> 03:37:09.439 align:start position:0%
um in the in the text to the so if we
 
03:37:13.309 --> 03:37:13.319 align:start position:0%
look at page 10 of HB
 
03:37:17.189 --> 03:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
772 in Roman numeral two I think what
 
03:37:20.150 --> 03:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
you're describing is that the foundation
 
03:37:21.790 --> 03:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget local
 
03:37:24.590 --> 03:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
share is the lesser
 
03:37:24.600 --> 03:37:26.110 align:start position:0%
share is the lesser
of

03:37:26.110 --> 03:37:26.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:37:29.750 --> 03:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
$538 per thousand that's why you said up
 
03:37:34.070 --> 03:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
to right were 90% of the municipality's
 
03:37:36.030 --> 03:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
adjusted annual Foundation opportunity
 
03:37:36.040 --> 03:37:38.229 align:start position:0%
adjusted annual Foundation opportunity
budget

03:37:38.229 --> 03:37:38.239 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:37:41.710 --> 03:37:41.720 align:start position:0%
share and
 
03:37:44.750 --> 03:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh and then it goes to calculate how how
 
03:37:47.830 --> 03:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
the $5 38 cents has arrived at and it
 
03:37:49.309 --> 03:37:49.319 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:37:53.590 --> 03:37:53.600 align:start position:0%
recalculated um every two years every
 
03:37:56.309 --> 03:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
budget cycle um so that the total of all
 
03:37:59.070 --> 03:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
local shares is
 
03:38:01.910 --> 03:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
52% of the total Statewide total of
 
03:38:03.550 --> 03:38:03.560 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunities so it's
 
03:38:06.870 --> 03:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
calculated it's designed to raise 52% of
 
03:38:09.750 --> 03:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
the total required cor correct correct
 
03:38:11.870 --> 03:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
because if we if we stuck with a with a
 
03:38:13.670 --> 03:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
fixed number like
 
03:38:16.590 --> 03:38:16.600 align:start position:0%
$538 as soon as the value jumps up by
 
03:38:21.150 --> 03:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
another 30 every soete every yeah yeah
 
03:38:24.469 --> 03:38:24.479 align:start position:0%
so um so that's that's where that's
 
03:38:26.070 --> 03:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
calculated and
 
03:38:31.229 --> 03:38:31.239 align:start position:0%
52% is um is right around that's right
 
03:38:33.630 --> 03:38:33.640 align:start position:0%
around the national average I think so
 
03:38:36.830 --> 03:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
from a from a from a fiscal policy uh
 
03:38:38.990 --> 03:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
standpoint that that would move New
 
03:38:41.950 --> 03:38:41.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from being at the bottom of
 
03:38:44.189 --> 03:38:44.199 align:start position:0%
the of the list in terms of State share
 
03:38:46.030 --> 03:38:46.040 align:start position:0%
so we're just talking state share now
 
03:38:49.790 --> 03:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
because that's our perspective here um U
 
03:38:53.150 --> 03:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
and I forgot where where at 30ish
 
03:38:57.550 --> 03:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
per 30ish perc moving that up to 47 or
 
03:39:00.990 --> 03:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
48% puts us right in the mix The Sweet
 
03:39:03.630 --> 03:39:03.640 align:start position:0%
Spot you know nationally from a from a
 
03:39:07.630 --> 03:39:07.640 align:start position:0%
from a fiscal policy uh perspective and
 
03:39:09.990 --> 03:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
um and it doesn't lock us into uh to a
 
03:39:13.469 --> 03:39:13.479 align:start position:0%
number like $530 I mean $530 was
 
03:39:16.150 --> 03:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
calculated based on our most recent
 
03:39:19.269 --> 03:39:19.279 align:start position:0%
valuations it doesn't lock us into um uh
 
03:39:22.510 --> 03:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
to that down the road the the the other
 
03:39:24.670 --> 03:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
thing that's Point that's really
 
03:39:27.389 --> 03:39:27.399 align:start position:0%
important to make is while it while it
 
03:39:30.590 --> 03:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
shares some of the same purpose as our
 
03:39:33.590 --> 03:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
current swept meaning it knocks the
 
03:39:37.429 --> 03:39:37.439 align:start position:0%
first dollars off the um the budget um
 
03:39:41.349 --> 03:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
it is in no means a state
 
03:39:44.309 --> 03:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
tax the only thing uniform about it is
 
03:39:46.590 --> 03:39:46.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go higher than
 
03:39:49.189 --> 03:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
$538 but like like representative am
 
03:39:52.429 --> 03:39:52.439 align:start position:0%
said for for approximately 50ish towns
 
03:39:55.349 --> 03:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:58.550 --> 03:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
that and um and so there's uh there's
 
03:40:01.110 --> 03:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
nothing pretending it's it's not
 
03:40:03.070 --> 03:40:03.080 align:start position:0%
pretending to be a state tax it's
 
03:40:06.510 --> 03:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
nothing like like a state tax um that
 
03:40:06.520 --> 03:40:07.550 align:start position:0%
nothing like like a state tax um that
said

03:40:07.550 --> 03:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
said
 
03:40:11.030 --> 03:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
772 does not get rid of the Statewide
 
03:40:14.870 --> 03:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
education property tax either so it um
 
03:40:18.790 --> 03:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
it it does reform it based on the the um
 
03:40:22.950 --> 03:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
lower court order that um that um uh
 
03:40:26.349 --> 03:40:26.359 align:start position:0%
that it it behaved like a state tax and
 
03:40:28.870 --> 03:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
that um that cities and towns do not get
 
03:40:33.269 --> 03:40:33.279 align:start position:0%
to retain excess over and above the um
 
03:40:35.630 --> 03:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
cost of an adequate education and in
 
03:40:38.830 --> 03:40:38.840 align:start position:0%
fact the way 772 works is they collect
 
03:40:40.870 --> 03:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
the um the swept locally and the swept
 
03:40:43.950 --> 03:40:43.960 align:start position:0%
out okay still $363 million they collect
 
03:40:47.670 --> 03:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
it locally and they send all of it up to
 
03:40:50.429 --> 03:40:50.439 align:start position:0%
the um to the to the treasury so you
 
03:40:53.110 --> 03:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
don't you can't even you can't even do
 
03:40:55.830 --> 03:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
some of the things that that like have
 
03:40:57.710 --> 03:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
you know negative tax rates and things
 
03:41:01.990 --> 03:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
like that that that some some um um very
 
03:41:02.000 --> 03:41:05.950 align:start position:0%
like that that that some some um um very
small

03:41:05.950 --> 03:41:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:10.870 --> 03:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh towns um do and these are towns that
 
03:41:14.189 --> 03:41:14.199 align:start position:0%
you know are are large townships yeah
 
03:41:17.590 --> 03:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
largely you know you know very few um
 
03:41:20.110 --> 03:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
very low population maybe no students at
 
03:41:20.120 --> 03:41:22.990 align:start position:0%
very low population maybe no students at
all

03:41:22.990 --> 03:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:26.830 --> 03:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
so so it's just want to clarify that and
 
03:41:28.990 --> 03:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
then I'll come to representative buron
 
03:41:31.910 --> 03:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
um on page 18 we still have the
 
03:41:34.750 --> 03:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property
 
03:41:37.229 --> 03:41:37.239 align:start position:0%
de and I'm not sure I've processed all
 
03:41:41.309 --> 03:41:41.319 align:start position:0%
this but basically the um Foundation
 
03:41:43.189 --> 03:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget local share up to
 
03:41:46.469 --> 03:41:46.479 align:start position:0%
$538 per thousand plus plus the swept
 
03:41:48.830 --> 03:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
would both be mandated by this law on
 
03:41:50.990 --> 03:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
the property tax
 
03:41:53.030 --> 03:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
right representative
 
03:41:55.790 --> 03:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
Burton uh yeah I know you weren't here
 
03:41:58.149 --> 03:41:58.159 align:start position:0%
this morning for the conversation but
 
03:42:01.309 --> 03:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering how you account for uh rep
 
03:42:03.870 --> 03:42:03.880 align:start position:0%
Maguire's problem when two
 
03:42:07.950 --> 03:42:07.960 align:start position:0%
$200,000 IEPs arrive in a poor
 
03:42:10.990 --> 03:42:11.000 align:start position:0%
town um should we
 
03:42:14.389 --> 03:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
make should how do they how would they
 
03:42:16.189 --> 03:42:16.199 align:start position:0%
because that's what many towns are
 
03:42:18.550 --> 03:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
concerned about how is that accounted
 
03:42:28.790 --> 03:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:32.070 --> 03:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
bill what I'm getting at if it helps
 
03:42:34.550 --> 03:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
repo that when we did the organ blck
 
03:42:36.630 --> 03:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
formula which was discussed this morning
 
03:42:39.429 --> 03:42:39.439 align:start position:0%
because we had the author of it here uh
 
03:42:42.429 --> 03:42:42.439 align:start position:0%
that's when we came up with cat CAD a
 
03:42:44.910 --> 03:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
that I think we set up if an IEP was
 
03:42:47.189 --> 03:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
over 50,000 or something like that this
 
03:42:47.199 --> 03:42:48.950 align:start position:0%
over 50,000 or something like that this
is

03:42:48.950 --> 03:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:42:53.149 --> 03:42:53.159 align:start position:0%
1986 8 87 um then the state would take
 
03:42:55.670 --> 03:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
care of it like every other free country
 
03:42:58.550 --> 03:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
does yeah I think that I so now now I'm
 
03:43:02.229 --> 03:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
now I'm hearing your question um so so
 
03:43:04.950 --> 03:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
House Bill 772 isn't a circuit breaker
 
03:43:08.910 --> 03:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
build so it's about a a school funding
 
03:43:14.790 --> 03:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
formula that um that works that is fair
 
03:43:17.630 --> 03:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
that is is uniform for for everybody
 
03:43:19.790 --> 03:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
everybody follows the same formula and
 
03:43:21.349 --> 03:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
most importantly and this is what we
 
03:43:24.149 --> 03:43:24.159 align:start position:0%
talked about during the introduction um
 
03:43:26.590 --> 03:43:26.600 align:start position:0%
it there are things that it doesn't have
 
03:43:28.349 --> 03:43:28.359 align:start position:0%
that our current formula does it doesn't
 
03:43:29.630 --> 03:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
have any
 
03:43:33.710 --> 03:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
props to make it work it works by itself
 
03:43:36.229 --> 03:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
and so it doesn't have a hold harmless
 
03:43:38.189 --> 03:43:38.199 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have a built-in stabilization
 
03:43:40.990 --> 03:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have a extraordinary needs
 
03:43:44.389 --> 03:43:44.399 align:start position:0%
Grant component um because the and the
 
03:43:46.030 --> 03:43:46.040 align:start position:0%
our current form has an extraordinary
 
03:43:47.550 --> 03:43:47.560 align:start position:0%
needs Grant because the formula by
 
03:43:51.950 --> 03:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:54.790 --> 03:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
Manchester I guess just a question is we
 
03:43:56.790 --> 03:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
might have to consider a circuit breaker
 
03:43:59.670 --> 03:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
program of absolutely absolutely isn't
 
03:44:02.229 --> 03:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
the whole picture thank yeah I think uh
 
03:44:05.349 --> 03:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
that's the important point that um this
 
03:44:09.910 --> 03:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
formula does not displace the uh high
 
03:44:13.630 --> 03:44:13.640 align:start position:0%
cost special needs placement funding
 
03:44:15.990 --> 03:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
that's separately required because it
 
03:44:19.429 --> 03:44:19.439 align:start position:0%
incidence is not predictable and uh it's
 
03:44:22.030 --> 03:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
not spread in a way that other costs are
 
03:44:23.830 --> 03:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
spread so this addresses general
 
03:44:25.830 --> 03:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
education and not the special needs
 
03:44:29.149 --> 03:44:29.159 align:start position:0%
that's your point right no no it it it
 
03:44:31.630 --> 03:44:31.640 align:start position:0%
it it definitely addresses special needs
 
03:44:34.030 --> 03:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
and when you when you take a look at how
 
03:44:37.229 --> 03:44:37.239 align:start position:0%
the formula gets built out let's see if
 
03:44:39.750 --> 03:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
I can find
 
03:44:47.030 --> 03:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:50.110 --> 03:44:50.120 align:start position:0%
yeah and it you and it it does this um
 
03:44:53.070 --> 03:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
in fact it's it's page page seven
 
03:44:57.070 --> 03:44:57.080 align:start position:0%
starting in line 23 so Roman 3 um talks
 
03:45:00.469 --> 03:45:00.479 align:start position:0%
about a weighted admr which is which is
 
03:45:04.189 --> 03:45:04.199 align:start position:0%
a a way of saying that um that that
 
03:45:07.229 --> 03:45:07.239 align:start position:0%
different um differentiated Aid factors
 
03:45:09.389 --> 03:45:09.399 align:start position:0%
have different weights to them and and
 
03:45:11.229 --> 03:45:11.239 align:start position:0%
that's consistent with what we do right
 
03:45:15.229 --> 03:45:15.239 align:start position:0%
now so we have a base of of of where
 
03:45:17.510 --> 03:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
where are we at 40
 
03:45:20.670 --> 03:45:20.680 align:start position:0%
42 4200 base I'm just going to round up
 
03:45:24.630 --> 03:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
42 4265 4265 base we have a
 
03:45:27.550 --> 03:45:27.560 align:start position:0%
$2,300 uh differentiated Aid component
 
03:45:31.429 --> 03:45:31.439 align:start position:0%
for special education is a 23 23 for um
 
03:45:35.469 --> 03:45:35.479 align:start position:0%
fnr 21 20 21 for special education 23
 
03:45:37.630 --> 03:45:37.640 align:start position:0%
for for free and for free and reduced
 
03:45:43.189 --> 03:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
price lunch um students 700 7 750 yeah
 
03:45:46.189 --> 03:45:46.199 align:start position:0%
well it's 832 832 for English language
 
03:45:49.229 --> 03:45:49.239 align:start position:0%
Learners so so those different dollar
 
03:45:52.110 --> 03:45:52.120 align:start position:0%
numbers are like different weights so so
 
03:45:56.630 --> 03:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
so so I'm seeing in lines 27 through uh
 
03:45:59.229 --> 03:45:59.239 align:start position:0%
32 that this addresses the free and
 
03:46:01.750 --> 03:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
reduced concept corre addresses English
 
03:46:03.469 --> 03:46:03.479 align:start position:0%
language Learners and IT addresses
 
03:46:05.149 --> 03:46:05.159 align:start position:0%
special ed correct but it does it
 
03:46:07.830 --> 03:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
through these weights correct correct
 
03:46:10.030 --> 03:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
and then and then the reason for using
 
03:46:11.790 --> 03:46:11.800 align:start position:0%
weights so that they're automatically
 
03:46:14.510 --> 03:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
adjusting yep and they and they and all
 
03:46:19.030 --> 03:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
the weight tie back to one a single um
 
03:46:21.990 --> 03:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
value which is the
 
03:46:24.550 --> 03:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
base got it like multipliers I'd like to
 
03:46:26.469 --> 03:46:26.479 align:start position:0%
ask a question that because
 
03:46:29.030 --> 03:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative ask a question regarding
 
03:46:31.830 --> 03:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
that so now for example with the special
 
03:46:33.349 --> 03:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
education weight of
 
03:46:38.309 --> 03:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
4.29 what is the base dollar
 
03:46:41.830 --> 03:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
amount so so the the base that I think
 
03:46:46.910 --> 03:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:46.920 --> 03:46:51.590 align:start position:0%
 
line

03:46:51.590 --> 03:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:54.229 --> 03:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
13 okay your Universal cost then is
 
03:46:54.239 --> 03:46:58.990 align:start position:0%
13 okay your Universal cost then is
$7,000

03:46:58.990 --> 03:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:02.149 --> 03:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
,31 and and so so another thing to keep
 
03:47:04.710 --> 03:47:04.720 align:start position:0%
in mind here what what we're what we're
 
03:47:07.149 --> 03:47:07.159 align:start position:0%
seeing on page page
 
03:47:12.269 --> 03:47:12.279 align:start position:0%
seven going on to the top of page eight
 
03:47:15.189 --> 03:47:15.199 align:start position:0%
is is the construction of the foundation
 
03:47:17.550 --> 03:47:17.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget amount and so this is
 
03:47:20.030 --> 03:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
the amount for school district to
 
03:47:22.309 --> 03:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
educate all of its um provide an
 
03:47:24.630 --> 03:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate education to
 
03:47:26.630 --> 03:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
educate all of its students to a
 
03:47:28.349 --> 03:47:28.359 align:start position:0%
Statewide outcome which is a strong
 
03:47:31.229 --> 03:47:31.239 align:start position:0%
outcome in New Hampshire
 
03:47:35.870 --> 03:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
and and so so while while the number
 
03:47:37.870 --> 03:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
that it calculates
 
03:47:40.269 --> 03:47:40.279 align:start position:0%
for Hopkinton I'll just pick where I
 
03:47:43.510 --> 03:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
live um might end up being a little bit
 
03:47:47.349 --> 03:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
less than hop son's school budget for
 
03:47:50.149 --> 03:47:50.159 align:start position:0%
for school districts that have have
 
03:47:52.630 --> 03:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
struggled to put together School budgets
 
03:47:54.070 --> 03:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
it might be greater than their school
 
03:47:57.149 --> 03:47:57.159 align:start position:0%
budget for instance Newport uh Newport
 
03:48:00.469 --> 03:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
has a lot of uh lot of students who have
 
03:48:04.630 --> 03:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
IEPs and um and and so so building
 
03:48:07.149 --> 03:48:07.159 align:start position:0%
building a budget using this formula
 
03:48:09.469 --> 03:48:09.479 align:start position:0%
it's actually going to look like a lot
 
03:48:13.149 --> 03:48:13.159 align:start position:0%
like a school budget but um so it it it
 
03:48:15.510 --> 03:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
treats it treats
 
03:48:18.189 --> 03:48:18.199 align:start position:0%
costs separately from
 
03:48:21.510 --> 03:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
funding so we we you know we cost out
 
03:48:24.389 --> 03:48:24.399 align:start position:0%
something that really looks like what
 
03:48:28.550 --> 03:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
what schools are doing um right now and
 
03:48:32.070 --> 03:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
then it funds it not not it doesn't fund
 
03:48:34.110 --> 03:48:34.120 align:start position:0%
every dollar of those costs with State
 
03:48:36.750 --> 03:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
dollars it starts with a with the local
 
03:48:38.790 --> 03:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
share and then comes in with the state
 
03:48:41.030 --> 03:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
share if your if your local share
 
03:48:45.189 --> 03:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't um doesn't get you there so um
 
03:48:47.910 --> 03:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
so you know separating out costing from
 
03:48:51.510 --> 03:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
funding is uh is is I think sort of
 
03:48:54.670 --> 03:48:54.680 align:start position:0%
central to the to the difference the
 
03:48:57.469 --> 03:48:57.479 align:start position:0%
different approach that that we're
 
03:48:59.790 --> 03:48:59.800 align:start position:0%
proposing in in
 
03:49:04.510 --> 03:49:04.520 align:start position:0%
772 um different than than than a l than
 
03:49:06.590 --> 03:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
every other bill that we've we've looked
 
03:49:11.149 --> 03:49:11.159 align:start position:0%
at that um um that that basically you
 
03:49:13.790 --> 03:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
know cost some costs out inadequate
 
03:49:18.110 --> 03:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
education and funds every dollar of that
 
03:49:21.189 --> 03:49:21.199 align:start position:0%
with with through state
 
03:49:24.750 --> 03:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
taxes representative L yeah um staying
 
03:49:28.469 --> 03:49:28.479 align:start position:0%
on this then and looking at the the
 
03:49:30.790 --> 03:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
weights for these various categories and
 
03:49:32.950 --> 03:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
if we have a weight of 4.29 here or
 
03:49:34.510 --> 03:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
another weight of
 
03:49:37.910 --> 03:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
2.2 are these weights interrelated so if
 
03:49:41.149 --> 03:49:41.159 align:start position:0%
I subtract a 0. 29 from one I'm going to
 
03:49:44.389 --> 03:49:44.399 align:start position:0%
have to add another 0. 29 to another no
 
03:49:47.030 --> 03:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
because the number of kids are
 
03:49:53.070 --> 03:49:53.080 align:start position:0%
different okay um so what brought about
 
03:49:54.670 --> 03:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
for example in special education where
 
03:49:57.149 --> 03:49:57.159 align:start position:0%
you're going to multiply four times the
 
03:50:02.670 --> 03:50:02.680 align:start position:0%
Seven Grand that's you know 28 um what
 
03:50:05.830 --> 03:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
how did you determine that a 4.29 was
 
03:50:09.189 --> 03:50:09.199 align:start position:0%
necessary versus a 3.5 well you were you
 
03:50:12.670 --> 03:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
were with us I know I was there t I
 
03:50:14.750 --> 03:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't buying into it either so well
 
03:50:17.790 --> 03:50:17.800 align:start position:0%
well you know we uh we we did work with
 
03:50:20.550 --> 03:50:20.560 align:start position:0%
a so this was during the 2020 um school
 
03:50:23.750 --> 03:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
funding commission and um we contracted
 
03:50:26.590 --> 03:50:26.600 align:start position:0%
with the the American institutes for
 
03:50:30.309 --> 03:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
research uh who have experts both in um
 
03:50:33.429 --> 03:50:33.439 align:start position:0%
in in school policy and school funding
 
03:50:37.389 --> 03:50:37.399 align:start position:0%
uh policy and what they were able to do
 
03:50:39.870 --> 03:50:39.880 align:start position:0%
is take a look at what every one of our
 
03:50:43.189 --> 03:50:43.199 align:start position:0%
school districts has been doing you know
 
03:50:46.990 --> 03:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
by virtue of looking at the ms25 the
 
03:50:50.790 --> 03:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
doe2 and how money was being spent in
 
03:50:52.950 --> 03:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
each of those districts they were able
 
03:50:56.870 --> 03:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
to isolate uh any spending that that and
 
03:50:58.469 --> 03:50:58.479 align:start position:0%
I'll just use the term didn't move the
 
03:51:00.630 --> 03:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
needle very much in terms of student
 
03:51:02.910 --> 03:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
outcomes so they were able to discount
 
03:51:06.469 --> 03:51:06.479 align:start position:0%
for that and then they were able to to
 
03:51:09.429 --> 03:51:09.439 align:start position:0%
calculate these weights based on um
 
03:51:13.269 --> 03:51:13.279 align:start position:0%
based on you know how many you know how
 
03:51:17.229 --> 03:51:17.239 align:start position:0%
many students um in a in a district uh
 
03:51:21.429 --> 03:51:21.439 align:start position:0%
were um were uh had IEPs let's say let's
 
03:51:23.630 --> 03:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
just talk about the special education
 
03:51:28.110 --> 03:51:28.120 align:start position:0%
part and um and how did that how they
 
03:51:30.830 --> 03:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
would look at at how that District spent
 
03:51:34.510 --> 03:51:34.520 align:start position:0%
money for those for those IEPs and what
 
03:51:36.710 --> 03:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
the student outcomes were for the
 
03:51:38.990 --> 03:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
average student outcome in that district
 
03:51:40.870 --> 03:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
and they were able to compare that to
 
03:51:44.030 --> 03:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
every District in the state and um and
 
03:51:46.870 --> 03:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
by by by looking at all the student
 
03:51:48.469 --> 03:51:48.479 align:start position:0%
outcomes looking at all the student
 
03:51:51.790 --> 03:51:51.800 align:start position:0%
spending they were able to put together
 
03:51:53.870 --> 03:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
a weight for each one of these
 
03:51:58.389 --> 03:51:58.399 align:start position:0%
differentiated Aid factors the the um
 
03:52:00.870 --> 03:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
the the free and reduced price lunch
 
03:52:03.670 --> 03:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
which approximately which is a a proxy
 
03:52:05.990 --> 03:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
for uh for lowincome backgrounds English
 
03:52:09.830 --> 03:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
language Learners special education uh
 
03:52:11.469 --> 03:52:11.479 align:start position:0%
uh we have size of the school district
 
03:52:13.429 --> 03:52:13.439 align:start position:0%
was actually a weight that uh that we
 
03:52:15.030 --> 03:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
use and each one of of them had
 
03:52:18.269 --> 03:52:18.279 align:start position:0%
different uh different factors uh to it
 
03:52:20.349 --> 03:52:20.359 align:start position:0%
and uh and then through a regression
 
03:52:23.910 --> 03:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
analysis uh they looked at the um the
 
03:52:27.110 --> 03:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
you know where where the um you know
 
03:52:28.590 --> 03:52:28.600 align:start position:0%
where where
 
03:52:32.149 --> 03:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
where where each District's calculated
 
03:52:35.149 --> 03:52:35.159 align:start position:0%
Foundation opportunity budget would go
 
03:52:38.630 --> 03:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
would be so they calculated um uh a
 
03:52:40.189 --> 03:52:40.199 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget for each
 
03:52:43.149 --> 03:52:43.159 align:start position:0%
school district and then drew a a best
 
03:52:46.469 --> 03:52:46.479 align:start position:0%
line through all of those so some are
 
03:52:47.590 --> 03:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
going to be bigger some are going to be
 
03:52:50.950 --> 03:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
smaller Dre a best line that fit um to
 
03:52:53.830 --> 03:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
give you to give you these
 
03:52:56.830 --> 03:52:56.840 align:start position:0%
weights so it's not perfect it's not
 
03:52:59.550 --> 03:52:59.560 align:start position:0%
perfect but but with a with a high
 
03:53:01.750 --> 03:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
degree of correlation correlates to
 
03:53:04.149 --> 03:53:04.159 align:start position:0%
getting you to the budget you
 
03:53:06.990 --> 03:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
need so to to somebody who's not really
 
03:53:10.469 --> 03:53:10.479 align:start position:0%
been inside that process or involved
 
03:53:12.830 --> 03:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
with the mathematics of the regression
 
03:53:15.349 --> 03:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
analysis this does a look a little bit
 
03:53:19.309 --> 03:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
black box like you know throw in turn
 
03:53:21.389 --> 03:53:21.399 align:start position:0%
the gears and we'll tell you the number
 
03:53:21.399 --> 03:53:23.510 align:start position:0%
the gears and we'll tell you the number
later

03:53:23.510 --> 03:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
later
 
03:53:26.389 --> 03:53:26.399 align:start position:0%
where regression puts me into regression
 
03:53:29.710 --> 03:53:29.720 align:start position:0%
and depression um the uh my question
 
03:53:31.750 --> 03:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
though is that when you mentioned those
 
03:53:34.229 --> 03:53:34.239 align:start position:0%
categories how do you account for a
 
03:53:37.670 --> 03:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
student who is on an IEP but also low
 
03:53:40.870 --> 03:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
income and also this do you did they did
 
03:53:43.349 --> 03:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
they fractionalize the those students
 
03:53:45.550 --> 03:53:45.560 align:start position:0%
somehow they're not I that student would
 
03:53:47.429 --> 03:53:47.439 align:start position:0%
be counted in each one of those
 
03:53:49.469 --> 03:53:49.479 align:start position:0%
categories um and that's where the
 
03:53:51.189 --> 03:53:51.199 align:start position:0%
student specific characteristics come
 
03:53:52.710 --> 03:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
into play because it requires a same
 
03:53:54.550 --> 03:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
amount of effort for each one of those
 
03:53:56.710 --> 03:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
categories that might be in type or or
 
03:53:58.429 --> 03:53:58.439 align:start position:0%
different yeah I mean a different
 
03:53:59.830 --> 03:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
depending upon what the what the
 
03:54:01.630 --> 03:54:01.640 align:start position:0%
categories are but I also want to
 
03:54:04.189 --> 03:54:04.199 align:start position:0%
address the Black Box comment too so so
 
03:54:06.149 --> 03:54:06.159 align:start position:0%
a single student could trigger several
 
03:54:08.469 --> 03:54:08.479 align:start position:0%
of the allowances absolutely as as they
 
03:54:10.710 --> 03:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
would do in our current uh funding form
 
03:54:14.349 --> 03:54:14.359 align:start position:0%
sure thank you um but but you know so
 
03:54:16.309 --> 03:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
finger in the air where did
 
03:54:20.070 --> 03:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
$2,300 um come from for um for free
 
03:54:22.070 --> 03:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
introduced price lunch students finger
 
03:54:23.149 --> 03:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
in the air where did
 
03:54:26.309 --> 03:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
$2,100 come from special education I
 
03:54:29.630 --> 03:54:29.640 align:start position:0%
would offer I would offer that based on
 
03:54:32.349 --> 03:54:32.359 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing at um School District
 
03:54:35.070 --> 03:54:35.080 align:start position:0%
deliberative sessions what I've heard so
 
03:54:38.429 --> 03:54:38.439 align:start position:0%
far this year during our committee work
 
03:54:41.910 --> 03:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
on Co real costs for special education
 
03:54:47.429 --> 03:54:47.439 align:start position:0%
that the the the 28 ,000 um increment
 
03:54:49.630 --> 03:54:49.640 align:start position:0%
here the weighted increment we're here
 
03:54:51.510 --> 03:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
here for a special education student is
 
03:54:54.990 --> 03:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
a lot closer to what schools are are um
 
03:54:57.590 --> 03:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
what what the true cost is to uh to
 
03:54:59.429 --> 03:54:59.439 align:start position:0%
schools right now than
 
03:55:02.670 --> 03:55:02.680 align:start position:0%
$2,100 so I'd say the $2,100 is sort of
 
03:55:04.429 --> 03:55:04.439 align:start position:0%
in the Black Box I don't think
 
03:55:08.469 --> 03:55:08.479 align:start position:0%
empirically you can uh you can could C
 
03:55:10.790 --> 03:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
you could calculate that but but but
 
03:55:12.710 --> 03:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
these numbers are actually being
 
03:55:14.990 --> 03:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
calculated um
 
03:55:17.389 --> 03:55:17.399 align:start position:0%
I think for all of us uh and and some of
 
03:55:19.550 --> 03:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
us are newer to this the mechanics of
 
03:55:25.389 --> 03:55:25.399 align:start position:0%
this bill are um demanding right to but
 
03:55:26.950 --> 03:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
fundamentally what you've been
 
03:55:28.990 --> 03:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
describing here with these weights is
 
03:55:32.590 --> 03:55:32.600 align:start position:0%
not the determination of the state's Aid
 
03:55:36.110 --> 03:55:36.120 align:start position:0%
itself it's the determination of the
 
03:55:38.710 --> 03:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
budget um right the foundation
 
03:55:40.910 --> 03:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget corre for a
 
03:55:45.429 --> 03:55:45.439 align:start position:0%
particular uh District so if we just
 
03:55:47.910 --> 03:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
accept uh these
 
03:55:50.269 --> 03:55:50.279 align:start position:0%
mechanics once we've established the
 
03:55:53.030 --> 03:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
budget now take the funding process the
 
03:55:55.030 --> 03:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
next couple of steps and describe for
 
03:55:56.790 --> 03:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
everybody the mechanics of how this
 
03:56:00.950 --> 03:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
plays out sure sure so um so once once
 
03:56:03.110 --> 03:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
every District once the Department of
 
03:56:05.389 --> 03:56:05.399 align:start position:0%
Education has calculated the foundation
 
03:56:07.349 --> 03:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget for for every
 
03:56:09.990 --> 03:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
District based on using these weights
 
03:56:11.309 --> 03:56:11.319 align:start position:0%
applied to the number of students that
 
03:56:13.229 --> 03:56:13.239 align:start position:0%
fall into each of these categories get
 
03:56:16.229 --> 03:56:16.239 align:start position:0%
you a total number for uh for each each
 
03:56:18.870 --> 03:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
School District the first dollars to
 
03:56:21.309 --> 03:56:21.319 align:start position:0%
fund that budget come from the local
 
03:56:25.149 --> 03:56:25.159 align:start position:0%
share so this is let me yeah go no go
 
03:56:27.149 --> 03:56:27.159 align:start position:0%
ahead yeah
 
03:56:29.870 --> 03:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
one intermediate
 
03:56:32.630 --> 03:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
step that we're skipping over that
 
03:56:34.950 --> 03:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
little closer to the one intermediate
 
03:56:38.309 --> 03:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
step that we're skipping over in moving
 
03:56:40.950 --> 03:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
from the budget the foundation
 
03:56:44.830 --> 03:56:44.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget number to
 
03:56:47.630 --> 03:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
the pay for side that you're starting to
 
03:56:48.790 --> 03:56:48.800 align:start position:0%
talk about no I'm not talking about the
 
03:56:50.910 --> 03:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
pay I'm talking about well local talking
 
03:56:52.550 --> 03:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
about the local share yeah which is
 
03:56:55.070 --> 03:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
paying for yeah okay
 
03:56:58.269 --> 03:56:58.279 align:start position:0%
um in the bill we have
 
03:57:01.990 --> 03:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
a further Factor applied to that
 
03:57:04.229 --> 03:57:04.239 align:start position:0%
Foundation opportunity budget that's
 
03:57:06.149 --> 03:57:06.159 align:start position:0%
been developed through the application
 
03:57:09.950 --> 03:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
of the weights and the numbers of pupils
 
03:57:14.510 --> 03:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
um we reduce the bill reduces
 
03:57:17.469 --> 03:57:17.479 align:start position:0%
the foundation opportunity budget number
 
03:57:21.550 --> 03:57:21.560 align:start position:0%
by 10% it's called an efficiency factor
 
03:57:24.670 --> 03:57:24.680 align:start position:0%
it's basically a policy determination
 
03:57:24.680 --> 03:57:26.349 align:start position:0%
it's basically a policy determination
that

03:57:26.349 --> 03:57:26.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:57:30.469 --> 03:57:30.479 align:start position:0%
um we want to we don't want to be too
 
03:57:35.630 --> 03:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:41.110 --> 03:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh sort of so it's it's der it's I'd say
 
03:57:43.269 --> 03:57:43.279 align:start position:0%
it's it's derated by an efficiency
 
03:57:46.429 --> 03:57:46.439 align:start position:0%
Factor yeah is so and then it is further
 
03:57:48.030 --> 03:57:48.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm glad you you pointed this out
 
03:57:49.790 --> 03:57:49.800 align:start position:0%
representative Ames and then it's
 
03:57:53.790 --> 03:57:53.800 align:start position:0%
further derated by a transition a phase
 
03:57:56.670 --> 03:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
in that's right period so so in its
 
03:57:59.910 --> 03:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
first year um I'm seeing the phase in on
 
03:58:01.550 --> 03:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
page nine correct right in the middle of
 
03:58:03.630 --> 03:58:03.640 align:start position:0%
page nine and where's the efficiency
 
03:58:10.830 --> 03:58:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:14.389 --> 03:58:14.399 align:start position:0%
it efficiency Universal efficiency see
 
03:58:16.429 --> 03:58:16.439 align:start position:0%
page 8 line
 
03:58:20.910 --> 03:58:20.920 align:start position:0%
14 there you go okay thank you shall me
 
03:58:23.750 --> 03:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
90% Y and then and then that would get
 
03:58:26.950 --> 03:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
multiplied Again by 86 in in the first
 
03:58:29.030 --> 03:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
year this is an adjustment to the
 
03:58:32.790 --> 03:58:32.800 align:start position:0%
calculated opportunity budget correct
 
03:58:37.429 --> 03:58:37.439 align:start position:0%
okay and and um and so so that will
 
03:58:39.550 --> 03:58:39.560 align:start position:0%
then starting with the found the
 
03:58:41.510 --> 03:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
calculated Foundation opportunity budget
 
03:58:43.030 --> 03:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
from all the
 
03:58:46.309 --> 03:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
weights discounted by the efficiency um
 
03:58:50.030 --> 03:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
90% so um further discounted by a phase
 
03:58:52.790 --> 03:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
in Period gets you an adjusted
 
03:58:54.550 --> 03:58:54.560 align:start position:0%
Foundation opportunity budget I think I
 
03:58:57.990 --> 03:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
got the terms right and and and now you
 
03:59:00.750 --> 03:59:00.760 align:start position:0%
start to figure out how to fund that
 
03:59:02.790 --> 03:59:02.800 align:start position:0%
adjusted Foundation opportunity budget
 
03:59:04.670 --> 03:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
just to interject I guess one other
 
03:59:06.830 --> 03:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
feature that we didn't specifically
 
03:59:09.510 --> 03:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
discuss yet is there's also a factor
 
03:59:13.790 --> 03:59:13.800 align:start position:0%
that um adjusts Bas on the size of the
 
03:59:15.429 --> 03:59:15.439 align:start position:0%
student stent population in a given
 
03:59:18.510 --> 03:59:18.520 align:start position:0%
distance that's the school size correct
 
03:59:21.309 --> 03:59:21.319 align:start position:0%
y yeah I I did mention that quickly but
 
03:59:22.630 --> 03:59:22.640 align:start position:0%
you're you're right that's that's
 
03:59:24.950 --> 03:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
something that's not currently in our in
 
03:59:27.110 --> 03:59:27.120 align:start position:0%
our formula but we have that information
 
03:59:28.389 --> 03:59:28.399 align:start position:0%
it's a piece of information the
 
03:59:30.750 --> 03:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
department has for every school district
 
03:59:33.469 --> 03:59:33.479 align:start position:0%
can I make a ask a question yes
 
03:59:35.990 --> 03:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
represent when I read this whole thing
 
03:59:39.630 --> 03:59:39.640 align:start position:0%
and um finally starting to understand it
 
03:59:42.710 --> 03:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
when I came out of regression was that
 
03:59:45.269 --> 03:59:45.279 align:start position:0%
um what does it do to the role of the
 
03:59:48.389 --> 03:59:48.399 align:start position:0%
local school board who
 
03:59:50.870 --> 03:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
traditionally have to deal with a budget
 
03:59:52.870 --> 03:59:52.880 align:start position:0%
it looks like it would be helpful
 
03:59:56.030 --> 03:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
because it would tell them what their
 
03:59:59.030 --> 03:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
budget might be now if if a town wants
 
04:00:02.429 --> 04:00:02.439 align:start position:0%
to go above this they could but it it
 
04:00:05.309 --> 04:00:05.319 align:start position:0%
may take some of the steam out
 
04:00:08.910 --> 04:00:08.920 align:start position:0%
of uh those budget discussions it it
 
04:00:10.349 --> 04:00:10.359 align:start position:0%
definitely could I mean it could put
 
04:00:11.870 --> 04:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
School boards in a position where they
 
04:00:14.189 --> 04:00:14.199 align:start position:0%
need to justify why their budget is is
 
04:00:15.710 --> 04:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
different than than the foundation
 
04:00:17.830 --> 04:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity budet a b deal but
 
04:00:20.070 --> 04:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
fundamentally no this is a you hit on
 
04:00:21.670 --> 04:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
something really important here um
 
04:00:24.550 --> 04:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
represent Burton that that this whole
 
04:00:28.189 --> 04:00:28.199 align:start position:0%
exercise here ultimately takes you to
 
04:00:30.510 --> 04:00:30.520 align:start position:0%
the calculation of a state
 
04:00:33.550 --> 04:00:33.560 align:start position:0%
Grant and that's at the end of the day
 
04:00:35.269 --> 04:00:35.279 align:start position:0%
that's what the School Board needs to
 
04:00:37.790 --> 04:00:37.800 align:start position:0%
know so that and that's what the the
 
04:00:40.670 --> 04:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
voters in town need to know because it's
 
04:00:43.630 --> 04:00:43.640 align:start position:0%
the combination of the school Grant plus
 
04:00:43.640 --> 04:00:44.429 align:start position:0%
the combination of the school Grant plus
plus

04:00:44.429 --> 04:00:44.439 align:start position:0%
plus
 
04:00:44.439 --> 04:00:45.670 align:start position:0%
plus
what

04:00:45.670 --> 04:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:00:49.910 --> 04:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
what you know plus whatever's needed to
 
04:00:53.269 --> 04:00:53.279 align:start position:0%
hit your ultimately the school uh
 
04:00:56.269 --> 04:00:56.279 align:start position:0%
District voters can vote to um you know
 
04:00:58.910 --> 04:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
fund anything they want to sky's the
 
04:01:01.750 --> 04:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
limit but but but but this determination
 
04:01:04.630 --> 04:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
of the grant goes through the vehicle of
 
04:01:07.750 --> 04:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
a commonly understood budget formula so
 
04:01:08.590 --> 04:01:08.600 align:start position:0%
even the
 
04:01:11.309 --> 04:01:11.319 align:start position:0%
$538 that we're talking about that's
 
04:01:14.429 --> 04:01:14.439 align:start position:0%
just in here to calculate what what the
 
04:01:16.389 --> 04:01:16.399 align:start position:0%
remainder would be so that a state Grant
 
04:01:19.269 --> 04:01:19.279 align:start position:0%
could be calculated um it's not it's not
 
04:01:22.469 --> 04:01:22.479 align:start position:0%
that schools have to raise $5 38 it
 
04:01:25.309 --> 04:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't set a limit or restrain the
 
04:01:29.309 --> 04:01:29.319 align:start position:0%
schools so that's correct so so the the
 
04:01:31.630 --> 04:01:31.640 align:start position:0%
the we've now talked about the costing
 
04:01:34.590 --> 04:01:34.600 align:start position:0%
portion the funding portion is that up
 
04:01:34.600 --> 04:01:35.950 align:start position:0%
portion the funding portion is that up
to

04:01:35.950 --> 04:01:35.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:01:38.870 --> 04:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
$538 to hit this adjusted Foundation
 
04:01:41.550 --> 04:01:41.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget um if you're there
 
04:01:44.229 --> 04:01:44.239 align:start position:0%
great you're there if you're not there
 
04:01:46.790 --> 04:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
the state comes in with with um with
 
04:01:49.630 --> 04:01:49.640 align:start position:0%
State funds and get some other source
 
04:01:51.269 --> 04:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
and makes up the difference and gets you
 
04:01:53.590 --> 04:01:53.600 align:start position:0%
to the foundation opportunity not not a
 
04:01:55.189 --> 04:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
dollar more than that just to the
 
04:01:58.309 --> 04:01:58.319 align:start position:0%
foundation opportunity budget and if um
 
04:02:02.070 --> 04:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
if you're um yeah Ju Just like what what
 
04:02:05.189 --> 04:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
um representative spillsbury said if um
 
04:02:08.110 --> 04:02:08.120 align:start position:0%
if your school district has decided to
 
04:02:11.950 --> 04:02:11.960 align:start position:0%
spend uh to spend more then that's on
 
04:02:14.429 --> 04:02:14.439 align:start position:0%
you the state's not going to get you to
 
04:02:17.229 --> 04:02:17.239 align:start position:0%
that higher number um that's on that's
 
04:02:18.630 --> 04:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
on the voters of the
 
04:02:21.189 --> 04:02:21.199 align:start position:0%
district so of course this bill also
 
04:02:23.670 --> 04:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
does not address what sources the state
 
04:02:28.110 --> 04:02:28.120 align:start position:0%
may look to to make up the difference um
 
04:02:30.910 --> 04:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
that's yeah just just not within the
 
04:02:33.229 --> 04:02:33.239 align:start position:0%
Ambit of this bill it it it it does make
 
04:02:37.149 --> 04:02:37.159 align:start position:0%
changes to um to the the um the
 
04:02:39.590 --> 04:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
mechanics behind the Statewide education
 
04:02:43.469 --> 04:02:43.479 align:start position:0%
property tax so there's no retained um
 
04:02:45.830 --> 04:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
discount accounts or excess or anything
 
04:02:49.790 --> 04:02:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:53.070 --> 04:02:53.080 align:start position:0%
um and it doesn't change any other um
 
04:02:58.070 --> 04:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
any other taxes it it does however have
 
04:03:01.349 --> 04:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
a make a substantial change to the low
 
04:03:03.510 --> 04:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
and moderate income property tax relief
 
04:03:05.630 --> 04:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
program and I would I would turn that
 
04:03:08.710 --> 04:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
over to to representative Ames uh to
 
04:03:10.630 --> 04:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
talk about because that's that's also
 
04:03:14.469 --> 04:03:14.479 align:start position:0%
contained separately in a um in a a in a
 
04:03:16.189 --> 04:03:16.199 align:start position:0%
bill parallel to
 
04:03:18.910 --> 04:03:18.920 align:start position:0%
this before you leave that point would
 
04:03:22.550 --> 04:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
it also be possible if if we ran this
 
04:03:25.550 --> 04:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
these numbers through a state model we
 
04:03:29.309 --> 04:03:29.319 align:start position:0%
could predict how much the state would
 
04:03:32.030 --> 04:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
have to kick in right correct correct
 
04:03:36.590 --> 04:03:36.600 align:start position:0%
and and you could also um you could also
 
04:03:39.590 --> 04:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
by by every city and town take a look at
 
04:03:41.750 --> 04:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
how the foundation opportunity budgets
 
04:03:44.550 --> 04:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
compare to let's say what they voted in
 
04:03:48.389 --> 04:03:48.399 align:start position:0%
last year as a school budget and um
 
04:03:51.070 --> 04:03:51.080 align:start position:0%
and you know you could even model how
 
04:03:56.790 --> 04:03:56.800 align:start position:0%
much additional um um you know money
 
04:03:59.110 --> 04:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
that um that that voters in the town
 
04:04:00.670 --> 04:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
might want to you know put in if they
 
04:04:02.870 --> 04:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to have something higher than the
 
04:04:04.750 --> 04:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
than the foundation opportunity budget
 
04:04:06.149 --> 04:04:06.159 align:start position:0%
but it's not required and it doesn't
 
04:04:08.950 --> 04:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
change the um uh the the Grant from the
 
04:04:12.389 --> 04:04:12.399 align:start position:0%
uh uh from the state uh and you can you
 
04:04:16.309 --> 04:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
can and I I don't think the the
 
04:04:23.070 --> 04:04:23.080 align:start position:0%
LBA um typically get into tax rate
 
04:04:27.349 --> 04:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
impact um no they do not right so so um
 
04:04:29.429 --> 04:04:29.439 align:start position:0%
so there we there there is actually I've
 
04:04:32.990 --> 04:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
showed this to to um showed it to
 
04:04:38.070 --> 04:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
somebody recently uh but uh in the um in
 
04:04:40.790 --> 04:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
the body material that that the uh
 
04:04:43.349 --> 04:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
school funding commission created uh we
 
04:04:47.670 --> 04:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
also have a um a a funding simulator on
 
04:04:50.429 --> 04:04:50.439 align:start position:0%
there it's obviously five it's based on
 
04:04:55.790 --> 04:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
2020 uh 2019 and 2020 uh data but um but
 
04:04:57.830 --> 04:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
and it's hosted at the website managed
 
04:05:00.229 --> 04:05:00.239 align:start position:0%
by the Cary school and it's it's
 
04:05:02.550 --> 04:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
basically it's an Excel model and you
 
04:05:05.870 --> 04:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
can um you can type in whatever numbers
 
04:05:08.149 --> 04:05:08.159 align:start position:0%
uh you want and you can see the impact
 
04:05:11.429 --> 04:05:11.439 align:start position:0%
on your your local tax rate based on
 
04:05:15.349 --> 04:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
2020 uh dollars and 2020 evaluations so
 
04:05:18.110 --> 04:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
but uh but you know assuming proportions
 
04:05:19.790 --> 04:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
might might carry through you can see
 
04:05:22.389 --> 04:05:22.399 align:start position:0%
that you can see how that would uh would
 
04:05:25.349 --> 04:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
be relevant to your cities and towns as
 
04:05:28.070 --> 04:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
a representative of relatively property
 
04:05:31.870 --> 04:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
poor towns uh if I was looking for how
 
04:05:33.870 --> 04:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
that's handled in this bill basically
 
04:05:37.429 --> 04:05:37.439 align:start position:0%
it's the idea that the um Foundation
 
04:05:39.710 --> 04:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
contribution is limited to
 
04:05:42.510 --> 04:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
$538 and if your Town's valuation your
 
04:05:45.469 --> 04:05:45.479 align:start position:0%
your grand list is uh relatively small
 
04:05:48.790 --> 04:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
your $538 per th000 value only pulls so
 
04:05:50.750 --> 04:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
much weight and that's where the state
 
04:05:52.670 --> 04:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
steps in above that so that's exactly
 
04:05:56.950 --> 04:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
right the Gap is greater correct there
 
04:05:58.269 --> 04:05:58.279 align:start position:0%
there's one other feature that we
 
04:06:01.229 --> 04:06:01.239 align:start position:0%
haven't mentioned in this um just to
 
04:06:03.550 --> 04:06:03.560 align:start position:0%
make it a little more
 
04:06:09.349 --> 04:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
complicated sure why not why not um
 
04:06:09.359 --> 04:06:11.990 align:start position:0%
complicated sure why not why not um
person

04:06:11.990 --> 04:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
person
 
04:06:15.149 --> 04:06:15.159 align:start position:0%
the the property
 
04:06:18.870 --> 04:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
the the high property level
 
04:06:18.880 --> 04:06:21.630 align:start position:0%
the the high property level
towns

04:06:21.630 --> 04:06:21.640 align:start position:0%
towns
 
04:06:24.950 --> 04:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
um who that are able to
 
04:06:29.830 --> 04:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
meet the foundation budget cost the cost
 
04:06:32.389 --> 04:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
of a of the foundation budget for their
 
04:06:38.550 --> 04:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:41.189 --> 04:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
$538 don't have to go to
 
04:06:46.389 --> 04:06:46.399 align:start position:0%
$538 they stop not not at 100% of the
 
04:06:48.750 --> 04:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
foundation oper opportunity budget but
 
04:06:52.790 --> 04:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
at 90% of it the state kicks in the last
 
04:06:57.189 --> 04:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
10% so every town will get some
 
04:07:00.349 --> 04:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
something and that means every town has
 
04:07:02.750 --> 04:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
a stake in this system that we've
 
04:07:07.349 --> 04:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
created it's not just for the poor guys
 
04:07:11.349 --> 04:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
and and the rich guys uh play their own
 
04:07:13.550 --> 04:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
game thank you for everybody's in the
 
04:07:15.590 --> 04:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
same game that that takes us back to
 
04:07:18.309 --> 04:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
page 10 Roman numeral 2B right the
 
04:07:23.189 --> 04:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
limiting uh 90% Factor yeah okay that's
 
04:07:26.550 --> 04:07:26.560 align:start position:0%
right good um other questions no
 
04:07:29.469 --> 04:07:29.479 align:start position:0%
question is a dumb question here this is
 
04:07:32.870 --> 04:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
a lot to Grapple with do we have other
 
04:07:34.630 --> 04:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
questions about how this actually would
 
04:07:38.469 --> 04:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
work either 675 or 772 we can go back to
 
04:07:40.030 --> 04:07:40.040 align:start position:0%
either of
 
04:07:43.269 --> 04:07:43.279 align:start position:0%
those yes I got a question on this one
 
04:07:43.279 --> 04:07:45.990 align:start position:0%
those yes I got a question on this one
um

04:07:45.990 --> 04:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:48.269 --> 04:07:48.279 align:start position:0%
we had the superintendent of schools
 
04:07:51.469 --> 04:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
come in who talked to us about how she's
 
04:07:56.710 --> 04:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
28 teachers short so she can only hire
 
04:07:59.990 --> 04:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
non uh certified teachers and then as
 
04:08:01.469 --> 04:08:01.479 align:start position:0%
soon as they get their certification
 
04:08:02.750 --> 04:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
they move
 
04:08:06.790 --> 04:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
on um according to your criteria for
 
04:08:09.550 --> 04:08:09.560 align:start position:0%
hiring I don't even see how this can
 
04:08:12.030 --> 04:08:12.040 align:start position:0%
even alleviate her situation can you
 
04:08:14.149 --> 04:08:14.159 align:start position:0%
sort of help me with that well
 
04:08:17.149 --> 04:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
well yes so there there's no there's no
 
04:08:20.389 --> 04:08:20.399 align:start position:0%
criteria for certification in in this no
 
04:08:23.149 --> 04:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
there nobody for hiring it's on your
 
04:08:26.830 --> 04:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
list of right so so so the the bill
 
04:08:29.710 --> 04:08:29.720 align:start position:0%
basically calculates or the you know
 
04:08:32.830 --> 04:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
what this is proposing is is it it
 
04:08:35.750 --> 04:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
calculates a budget that would be
 
04:08:38.189 --> 04:08:38.199 align:start position:0%
necessary for for that every school
 
04:08:40.309 --> 04:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
district including the school district
 
04:08:43.429 --> 04:08:43.439 align:start position:0%
that's 25 minutes from from my house
 
04:08:45.149 --> 04:08:45.159 align:start position:0%
where we had the superintendent testify
 
04:08:48.950 --> 04:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
from Newport um and and it would
 
04:08:51.389 --> 04:08:51.399 align:start position:0%
calculate a school budget I suspect for
 
04:08:54.349 --> 04:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
Newport that is higher than the budget
 
04:08:56.870 --> 04:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
that voters are approving right now even
 
04:08:59.710 --> 04:08:59.720 align:start position:0%
with these the I think second highest
 
04:09:01.870 --> 04:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
property tax local prop school property
 
04:09:05.229 --> 04:09:05.239 align:start position:0%
tax rate in the state and uh and and
 
04:09:08.070 --> 04:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
they come up far short in being able to
 
04:09:12.389 --> 04:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
uh to hire um to hire uh credential
 
04:09:14.790 --> 04:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
teachers uh because the budget just
 
04:09:17.750 --> 04:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't isn't enough so so the budget
 
04:09:20.510 --> 04:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
that comes out of this is designed to
 
04:09:22.750 --> 04:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
address those problems from a budgeting
 
04:09:24.870 --> 04:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
standpoint if they've got Workforce
 
04:09:28.149 --> 04:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
problems due to you know availability of
 
04:09:30.349 --> 04:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
housing or Transportation or other
 
04:09:32.830 --> 04:09:32.840 align:start position:0%
things no this bill this bill does not
 
04:09:35.710 --> 04:09:35.720 align:start position:0%
address uh address that uh but that's
 
04:09:37.910 --> 04:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
not what I heard from the the the
 
04:09:40.990 --> 04:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
Newport soup was I think very clear that
 
04:09:43.389 --> 04:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
that their budget did not allow them to
 
04:09:45.990 --> 04:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
to uh to hire and retain teachers is
 
04:09:49.950 --> 04:09:49.960 align:start position:0%
that cons yeah yeah great once again my
 
04:09:52.630 --> 04:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
district gets raised as an example
 
04:09:54.309 --> 04:09:54.319 align:start position:0%
representative fich
 
04:09:58.149 --> 04:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
Miller thank you Mr chair um I was just
 
04:10:00.590 --> 04:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
curious if somebody could comment on
 
04:10:03.830 --> 04:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
whether this bill does address the
 
04:10:05.950 --> 04:10:05.960 align:start position:0%
different costs that are needed to run
 
04:10:07.950 --> 04:10:07.960 align:start position:0%
schools in different geographical areas
 
04:10:09.469 --> 04:10:09.479 align:start position:0%
of the state because obviously the needs
 
04:10:11.630 --> 04:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
of K County the needs of Rockingham the
 
04:10:14.030 --> 04:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
needs of Hillsboro tend to be very
 
04:10:17.710 --> 04:10:17.720 align:start position:0%
different where in this largish bill
 
04:10:20.109 --> 04:10:20.119 align:start position:0%
would be you know those Provisions if
 
04:10:23.030 --> 04:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
any of those are there no thanks thanks
 
04:10:25.189 --> 04:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
for the question um I would need to
 
04:10:26.870 --> 04:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
actually look back Rick's got a copy of
 
04:10:28.750 --> 04:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
the sorry represent lad has a copy of
 
04:10:33.830 --> 04:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
the report uh right there and and we we
 
04:10:35.550 --> 04:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
the school funding commission certainly
 
04:10:39.990 --> 04:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
looked into Geographic um uh variations
 
04:10:42.389 --> 04:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
in terms of costs whether that's can I
 
04:10:45.469 --> 04:10:45.479 align:start position:0%
speak that yeah please um this was a a
 
04:10:48.950 --> 04:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
discussion item that was a result of the
 
04:10:52.030 --> 04:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
whole commission looking at these small
 
04:10:55.030 --> 04:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
schools years ago I had submitted a bill
 
04:10:57.910 --> 04:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with small rural geographically
 
04:10:57.920 --> 04:10:59.510 align:start position:0%
dealing with small rural geographically
isolated

04:10:59.510 --> 04:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
isolated
 
04:11:04.109 --> 04:11:04.119 align:start position:0%
schools and when I came to present that
 
04:11:06.830 --> 04:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
I was really torpedoed by one of our
 
04:11:09.269 --> 04:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
Senators Senator Lou de
 
04:11:11.630 --> 04:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
delandro and it was over the fact he
 
04:11:12.790 --> 04:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
said well what we're going to do in
 
04:11:14.030 --> 04:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester we're just going to make all
 
04:11:17.109 --> 04:11:17.119 align:start position:0%
our schools small and so we'll get this
 
04:11:20.030 --> 04:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
extra dollar well what we end up doing
 
04:11:22.349 --> 04:11:22.359 align:start position:0%
in this and there there's there's
 
04:11:24.149 --> 04:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
portions of this which I Concur and
 
04:11:25.870 --> 04:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
agree to but there's other portions
 
04:11:27.670 --> 04:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
which I don't this is one area though
 
04:11:31.590 --> 04:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
that um we we change so it doesn't say
 
04:11:34.510 --> 04:11:34.520 align:start position:0%
say that you get this weighted amount
 
04:11:37.750 --> 04:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
for schools it's weighted amount for
 
04:11:37.760 --> 04:11:39.229 align:start position:0%
for schools it's weighted amount for
school

04:11:39.229 --> 04:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:11:42.070 --> 04:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
districts so a district is a total so
 
04:11:43.750 --> 04:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
you take that total popul population if
 
04:11:45.710 --> 04:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
it was weighted towards a small school
 
04:11:48.149 --> 04:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
like a well of course you know you have
 
04:11:51.910 --> 04:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
small districts like cin but you know it
 
04:11:54.590 --> 04:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
does eliminate the fact that Manchester
 
04:11:56.189 --> 04:11:56.199 align:start position:0%
is not going to be able to you know come
 
04:11:59.030 --> 04:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
up with you know 30 40 small schools and
 
04:12:01.670 --> 04:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
get this added weight you know and that
 
04:12:03.189 --> 04:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
I've seen where I've lived in certain
 
04:12:05.910 --> 04:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
places like in Alaska that this did
 
04:12:09.149 --> 04:12:09.159 align:start position:0%
occur and so uh I think that this this
 
04:12:11.309 --> 04:12:11.319 align:start position:0%
Factor right here does eliminate the
 
04:12:13.189 --> 04:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
being that portion of the weighted value
 
04:12:16.309 --> 04:12:16.319 align:start position:0%
being abused representative Pap mishar I
 
04:12:18.790 --> 04:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
think you want to follow up well I I
 
04:12:21.429 --> 04:12:21.439 align:start position:0%
would appreciate it I I I found that
 
04:12:23.229 --> 04:12:23.239 align:start position:0%
very informational but I didn't
 
04:12:25.030 --> 04:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily feel that it addressed the
 
04:12:27.349 --> 04:12:27.359 align:start position:0%
whole different costs of living in
 
04:12:29.030 --> 04:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
different parts of the state based on
 
04:12:31.429 --> 04:12:31.439 align:start position:0%
what I've heard it seems to I haven't
 
04:12:33.189 --> 04:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
caught any part where it would address
 
04:12:36.269 --> 04:12:36.279 align:start position:0%
this and again cost of living in you
 
04:12:37.990 --> 04:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
know Rockingham County by the mass
 
04:12:39.670 --> 04:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
border are very different in cost of
 
04:12:41.309 --> 04:12:41.319 align:start position:0%
living in Co County and they are very
 
04:12:42.750 --> 04:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
different in Hillsboro and they are very
 
04:12:44.830 --> 04:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
different in every County right poor
 
04:12:47.510 --> 04:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
smooth versus kin and so on so is there
 
04:12:49.309 --> 04:12:49.319 align:start position:0%
anything in this bill that would address
 
04:12:51.750 --> 04:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
that because we do provide this guidance
 
04:12:53.429 --> 04:12:53.439 align:start position:0%
budget right and I just want to
 
04:12:55.269 --> 04:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
understand if that budget does account
 
04:12:58.830 --> 04:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
for those cost of living slash cost of
 
04:13:01.469 --> 04:13:01.479 align:start position:0%
hiring teachers and so on and so forth
 
04:13:03.790 --> 04:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
we have a diverse State no there there's
 
04:13:05.790 --> 04:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that addresses that U
 
04:13:07.870 --> 04:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
because the formula applies would it be
 
04:13:09.469 --> 04:13:09.479 align:start position:0%
fair to say though that what the Bill's
 
04:13:12.790 --> 04:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
driving at is how the state's portion
 
04:13:15.309 --> 04:13:15.319 align:start position:0%
were Aid is is determined but what the
 
04:13:18.149 --> 04:13:18.159 align:start position:0%
district then decides to do on its own
 
04:13:21.349 --> 04:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
is entirely still a local decision right
 
04:13:23.149 --> 04:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
but but but I would ALS I think to your
 
04:13:26.349 --> 04:13:26.359 align:start position:0%
to your question though is is and I want
 
04:13:28.269 --> 04:13:28.279 align:start position:0%
to I want to refer back to the report
 
04:13:29.790 --> 04:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
and if you don't have a copy of it there
 
04:13:32.990 --> 04:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
are copies in the in the office but um
 
04:13:35.790 --> 04:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
but as I recall um representative Ames
 
04:13:38.830 --> 04:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
do you um yeah as I'm not going to be
 
04:13:41.510 --> 04:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
able to find it right now but but as as
 
04:13:45.429 --> 04:13:45.439 align:start position:0%
I recall we did look into what are the
 
04:13:48.990 --> 04:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
the cost variations in terms of in terms
 
04:13:52.510 --> 04:13:52.520 align:start position:0%
of if I wanted to hire a a a teacher in
 
04:13:52.520 --> 04:13:53.429 align:start position:0%
of if I wanted to hire a a a teacher in
in

04:13:53.429 --> 04:13:53.439 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:13:55.990 --> 04:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
Littleton um how would that compare to I
 
04:13:59.349 --> 04:13:59.359 align:start position:0%
want to hire a teacher in Windam and um
 
04:14:02.189 --> 04:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
and and so I wanted defer back to that
 
04:14:05.229 --> 04:14:05.239 align:start position:0%
report uh to to see what it concluded
 
04:14:07.950 --> 04:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
yeah if I could add to that um that's my
 
04:14:11.149 --> 04:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
recollection as well I think the the
 
04:14:14.389 --> 04:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
conclusion on this very able cost issue
 
04:14:16.349 --> 04:14:16.359 align:start position:0%
you know it's more expensive here than
 
04:14:18.030 --> 04:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
there that's basically what you're
 
04:14:20.870 --> 04:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
asking about yeah
 
04:14:24.269 --> 04:14:24.279 align:start position:0%
um at that time and this commission was
 
04:14:25.990 --> 04:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
that there's not
 
04:14:26.000 --> 04:14:27.710 align:start position:0%
that there's not
enough

04:14:27.710 --> 04:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
enough
 
04:14:31.630 --> 04:14:31.640 align:start position:0%
to um lead it wasn't enough to lead us
 
04:14:35.109 --> 04:14:35.119 align:start position:0%
to address that directly but there is an
 
04:14:38.950 --> 04:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
obligation to revisit all of these
 
04:14:41.429 --> 04:14:41.439 align:start position:0%
weights and maybe a new
 
04:14:43.830 --> 04:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
weight um
 
04:14:46.269 --> 04:14:46.279 align:start position:0%
periodically I can't remember the uh
 
04:14:48.309 --> 04:14:48.319 align:start position:0%
right right every every 10 years every
 
04:14:52.229 --> 04:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
10 years um and uh that would be fair
 
04:14:55.429 --> 04:14:55.439 align:start position:0%
game and uh you know New Hampshire's a
 
04:14:57.670 --> 04:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
funny state it's
 
04:15:00.189 --> 04:15:00.199 align:start position:0%
got but that would also be something
 
04:15:02.349 --> 04:15:02.359 align:start position:0%
that we want to have have data
 
04:15:04.950 --> 04:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
collection from the Department on that
 
04:15:07.830 --> 04:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
so that weights could be calculated in
 
04:15:09.990 --> 04:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
there's a whole section i' like on where
 
04:15:11.750 --> 04:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
they are first before you jump is that
 
04:15:13.990 --> 04:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
on the same topic okay okay
 
04:15:16.429 --> 04:15:16.439 align:start position:0%
representative Burton has been patient
 
04:15:18.269 --> 04:15:18.279 align:start position:0%
I'm never patient but that's okay thank
 
04:15:20.790 --> 04:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
you I just want to add uh the judge in
 
04:15:23.670 --> 04:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
the conel case struggled with this issue
 
04:15:26.630 --> 04:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
and he wrote a whole page on starting
 
04:15:30.229 --> 04:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
salaries because they ran from 36,000 to
 
04:15:34.030 --> 04:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
670,000 so he finally determined that
 
04:15:37.630 --> 04:15:37.640 align:start position:0%
the correct number was
 
04:15:39.630 --> 04:15:39.640 align:start position:0%
$52,000 and with
 
04:15:42.309 --> 04:15:42.319 align:start position:0%
$552,000 average salary in a school
 
04:15:44.469 --> 04:15:44.479 align:start position:0%
district he figured that would include
 
04:15:46.309 --> 04:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
some beginning faculty and some
 
04:15:49.229 --> 04:15:49.239 align:start position:0%
experienced faculty so when he did this
 
04:15:51.950 --> 04:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
formulation that was the number he he
 
04:15:54.550 --> 04:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
used just as an aside he threw the
 
04:15:57.750 --> 04:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
Oyster River District out my district
 
04:16:00.070 --> 04:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
because our abts teacher salaries up in
 
04:16:02.830 --> 04:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
the 70 grand area we're a University
 
04:16:06.149 --> 04:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
Town high expectations and so forth but
 
04:16:08.950 --> 04:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
52,000 was the average he came up with
 
04:16:10.550 --> 04:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
and a $40,000
 
04:16:13.870 --> 04:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
$42,000 entry salary
 
04:16:17.349 --> 04:16:17.359 align:start position:0%
represent mes just to this point about
 
04:16:20.670 --> 04:16:20.680 align:start position:0%
cost variations on page
 
04:16:26.309 --> 04:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
six um line 30 31
 
04:16:29.550 --> 04:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
32 as part of an obligation that the
 
04:16:31.670 --> 04:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
general court has to determine the value
 
04:16:33.349 --> 04:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
of an adequate
 
04:16:35.670 --> 04:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
education um
 
04:16:35.680 --> 04:16:37.950 align:start position:0%
education um
periodically

04:16:37.950 --> 04:16:37.960 align:start position:0%
periodically
 
04:16:41.790 --> 04:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
um the cost model shall evaluate the
 
04:16:43.670 --> 04:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
relative impact of the following
 
04:16:45.790 --> 04:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
attributes that affect the differential
 
04:16:48.429 --> 04:16:48.439 align:start position:0%
cost of achieving any given level of
 
04:16:51.189 --> 04:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
outcome and assumed to be outside the
 
04:16:54.510 --> 04:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
control of districts so Regional cost
 
04:16:56.550 --> 04:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
factors would be outside
 
04:17:00.550 --> 04:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
the uh and and then the items are
 
04:17:02.630 --> 04:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
variation in student needs the second
 
04:17:05.070 --> 04:17:05.080 align:start position:0%
one is geographic variation in the price
 
04:17:07.950 --> 04:17:07.960 align:start position:0%
levels of necessary specific resources
 
04:17:10.950 --> 04:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
resource elements it's there you
 
04:17:13.950 --> 04:17:13.960 align:start position:0%
know it's hard to work with hard to make
 
04:17:18.269 --> 04:17:18.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:21.469 --> 04:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
yeah representative flad when we
 
04:17:23.630 --> 04:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
discussed this this aspect I got very
 
04:17:24.950 --> 04:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
involved with it because one of the
 
04:17:27.030 --> 04:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
school buses I had in Alaska was a
 
04:17:30.510 --> 04:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
hydrofoil we had hydr foil we had and
 
04:17:32.109 --> 04:17:32.119 align:start position:0%
the person who run that had to be a a
 
04:17:35.030 --> 04:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
registered pilot um just to get the kids
 
04:17:36.149 --> 04:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
from the other side of the lake where
 
04:17:39.349 --> 04:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
there no roads and and so here in this
 
04:17:41.189 --> 04:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
state we have some districts which are
 
04:17:43.469 --> 04:17:43.479 align:start position:0%
small and isolated and their
 
04:17:45.870 --> 04:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
transportation costs for high school
 
04:17:47.750 --> 04:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
where they don't have that available in
 
04:17:51.070 --> 04:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
that small District um are extremely
 
04:17:52.469 --> 04:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
high just like it is in Maine where you
 
04:17:56.229 --> 04:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
have matinicus and monh monhagen Island
 
04:17:58.149 --> 04:17:58.159 align:start position:0%
where they have to send their kids off
 
04:18:00.590 --> 04:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
the island for that education kid
 
04:18:03.189 --> 04:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
expenses just roar we don't have some of
 
04:18:05.550 --> 04:18:05.560 align:start position:0%
those things to the degree but we do
 
04:18:07.389 --> 04:18:07.399 align:start position:0%
have small schools when you're looking
 
04:18:09.469 --> 04:18:09.479 align:start position:0%
at efficiency of scale when you get
 
04:18:11.750 --> 04:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
smaller and smaller and smaller but we
 
04:18:14.389 --> 04:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
by rule and by Statute say You must have
 
04:18:17.070 --> 04:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
X Y and Z and you don't have the number
 
04:18:19.269 --> 04:18:19.279 align:start position:0%
of students to help pay for X Y and Z
 
04:18:22.590 --> 04:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
your costs are going to go up and so
 
04:18:25.389 --> 04:18:25.399 align:start position:0%
that's I think one good reason why this
 
04:18:27.510 --> 04:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
was put in there I I struggled with it
 
04:18:29.349 --> 04:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
when we're on the commission but it's I
 
04:18:31.590 --> 04:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
think it's it's a very positive thing
 
04:18:33.870 --> 04:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
and like representa am says that it's
 
04:18:36.389 --> 04:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
something can be looked at in the future
 
04:18:38.670 --> 04:18:38.680 align:start position:0%
uh I would hope if we ever get into a
 
04:18:40.950 --> 04:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
model like this or if we even take some
 
04:18:43.030 --> 04:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
of these weighted portions out and using
 
04:18:46.510 --> 04:18:46.520 align:start position:0%
in another model um that we explore this
 
04:18:48.990 --> 04:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
uh it's worthy of pursuing many many
 
04:18:51.349 --> 04:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
states have this value in there
 
04:18:53.630 --> 04:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
transportation is really an expensive
 
04:18:55.469 --> 04:18:55.479 align:start position:0%
item for school districts and it will
 
04:18:57.870 --> 04:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
increase in these small districts so we
 
04:19:00.309 --> 04:19:00.319 align:start position:0%
don't have hydro foils but we do have
 
04:19:05.349 --> 04:19:05.359 align:start position:0%
240 miles of bus route and Mr chairman M
 
04:19:07.590 --> 04:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
heagan has a school I've been in it uh
 
04:19:09.229 --> 04:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
they have a one room Schoolhouse and
 
04:19:11.349 --> 04:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
every year they argue with the crediting
 
04:19:14.070 --> 04:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
body uh I've been in it and it's a good
 
04:19:17.429 --> 04:19:17.439 align:start position:0%
school and their kids go on to colleges
 
04:19:19.750 --> 04:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
and so forth yeah I can say my wife's
 
04:19:22.309 --> 04:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
mother worked in matinicus well
 
04:19:25.349 --> 04:19:25.359 align:start position:0%
matinicus is different def you're off
 
04:19:27.870 --> 04:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
the coast for quite a w there 10 miles I
 
04:19:29.910 --> 04:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
and all those along the iboro and all of
 
04:19:32.590 --> 04:19:32.600 align:start position:0%
them uh we we they have concerns I think
 
04:19:34.910 --> 04:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
we were shooting to uh wind up around 2
 
04:19:36.670 --> 04:19:36.680 align:start position:0%
o'clock does anybody want to make a
 
04:19:39.030 --> 04:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
further contribution before we well I do
 
04:19:41.030 --> 04:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
have one last question that I I didn't
 
04:19:43.510 --> 04:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
get the pose to uh both represent Ames
 
04:19:46.269 --> 04:19:46.279 align:start position:0%
and represent luno one of the concerns
 
04:19:48.670 --> 04:19:48.680 align:start position:0%
which I had when when we were looking at
 
04:19:51.990 --> 04:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
this was that we were looking at how do
 
04:19:55.630 --> 04:19:55.640 align:start position:0%
we arrive at that what we want education
 
04:19:58.910 --> 04:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
to cost and you're looking at the you
 
04:20:01.750 --> 04:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
know the performance-based outcomes and
 
04:20:04.710 --> 04:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
accountability which I agree but when we
 
04:20:06.990 --> 04:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
used the data we did not have the type
 
04:20:08.469 --> 04:20:08.479 align:start position:0%
of data that I would like to see the
 
04:20:13.189 --> 04:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
doe2 form did not disaggregate
 
04:20:15.950 --> 04:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
uh the the portions of those expenses
 
04:20:17.349 --> 04:20:17.359 align:start position:0%
which were directly related to the
 
04:20:18.870 --> 04:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate education
 
04:20:21.189 --> 04:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
versus other expenses which don't come
 
04:20:23.910 --> 04:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
fall underneath adequacy in statute but
 
04:20:27.189 --> 04:20:27.199 align:start position:0%
they're optional services that you know
 
04:20:30.429 --> 04:20:30.439 align:start position:0%
you as a district can pay for
 
04:20:33.309 --> 04:20:33.319 align:start position:0%
so I guess where I am is I in order for
 
04:20:36.750 --> 04:20:36.760 align:start position:0%
me to really you know appreciate the the
 
04:20:38.070 --> 04:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
costs which are going to result from
 
04:20:40.790 --> 04:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
this thing I'd like to know how are we
 
04:20:42.910 --> 04:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
going to ever be able to disaggregate 20
 
04:20:44.710 --> 04:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
form we can take out tuition and
 
04:20:46.910 --> 04:20:46.920 align:start position:0%
transportation that's done in there but
 
04:20:49.950 --> 04:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
the rest of it's not and uh often times
 
04:20:51.710 --> 04:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
we look at and that that's the average
 
04:20:55.149 --> 04:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
cost per pupil well is it really in
 
04:20:56.750 --> 04:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
terms of the opportunity for adequate
 
04:20:59.790 --> 04:20:59.800 align:start position:0%
education which we speak to in this
 
04:21:03.510 --> 04:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
legislation yeah so so um you know like
 
04:21:06.189 --> 04:21:06.199 align:start position:0%
we talked about earlier the um the
 
04:21:08.510 --> 04:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
American institutes for research who who
 
04:21:11.590 --> 04:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
did the work and and did the regression
 
04:21:15.870 --> 04:21:15.880 align:start position:0%
uh analysis on on on what what goes into
 
04:21:19.070 --> 04:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
a um uh a public school education did
 
04:21:21.070 --> 04:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
look at all the costs so not just the
 
04:21:23.830 --> 04:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
costs ass associated with the um with
 
04:21:26.510 --> 04:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
the um uh you know
 
04:21:30.710 --> 04:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
1932a content areas uh but uh but no it
 
04:21:33.429 --> 04:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
looked at um it looked at costs and it
 
04:21:36.309 --> 04:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
looked at how those
 
04:21:40.590 --> 04:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
costs affected student outcomes and um
 
04:21:42.870 --> 04:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
and you know what what what you know
 
04:21:44.670 --> 04:21:44.680 align:start position:0%
what are the costs for co-curricular
 
04:21:47.070 --> 04:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
activities um I mean we we we talked
 
04:21:49.550 --> 04:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
about I think on a on another unrelated
 
04:21:52.790 --> 04:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
Bill to this about how um how your first
 
04:21:55.469 --> 04:21:55.479 align:start position:0%
step is to get your students to walk
 
04:21:57.590 --> 04:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
through the door and there's a lot of
 
04:21:59.469 --> 04:21:59.479 align:start position:0%
factors that come into play for that
 
04:22:01.429 --> 04:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
because different students are motivated
 
04:22:03.590 --> 04:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
different different ways might be who
 
04:22:05.149 --> 04:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
they're sitting next to but it also
 
04:22:07.750 --> 04:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
might be I want to play in on um
 
04:22:10.109 --> 04:22:10.119 align:start position:0%
Friday's football game and I know the
 
04:22:11.990 --> 04:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
coach says if I don't if I don't come to
 
04:22:14.109 --> 04:22:14.119 align:start position:0%
school I don't come to practice and I
 
04:22:17.790 --> 04:22:17.800 align:start position:0%
don't play the game and um and so so all
 
04:22:20.910 --> 04:22:20.920 align:start position:0%
those things were were were analyzed in
 
04:22:23.790 --> 04:22:23.800 align:start position:0%
terms of an impact on um on student
 
04:22:26.309 --> 04:22:26.319 align:start position:0%
outcome and and representative mahagan
 
04:22:28.149 --> 04:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
and I talked about well what if I don't
 
04:22:30.349 --> 04:22:30.359 align:start position:0%
have a marching band do I need to get a
 
04:22:31.790 --> 04:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
marching band no you don't need to get a
 
04:22:35.269 --> 04:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
marching band um we're not this bill
 
04:22:39.790 --> 04:22:39.800 align:start position:0%
does not tell your your um your
 
04:22:41.149 --> 04:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
superintendent or your building
 
04:22:41.159 --> 04:22:42.670 align:start position:0%
superintendent or your building
principal

04:22:42.670 --> 04:22:42.680 align:start position:0%
principal
 
04:22:45.990 --> 04:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
what to do and how to and how to do it
 
04:22:48.790 --> 04:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
and and you know the the interest and
 
04:22:51.309 --> 04:22:51.319 align:start position:0%
the impact that a marching band might
 
04:22:54.189 --> 04:22:54.199 align:start position:0%
have in Salem OR Windam or Londoner I
 
04:22:55.590 --> 04:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
understand The Londoner band I think
 
04:23:00.149 --> 04:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
does a lot of uh of uh travel uh across
 
04:23:01.870 --> 04:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
the country and maybe even
 
04:23:04.630 --> 04:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
internationally um may have a different
 
04:23:06.670 --> 04:23:06.680 align:start position:0%
impact in London der than it has in
 
04:23:09.870 --> 04:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
Handover or Hopkinson and um and it's
 
04:23:11.950 --> 04:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
really up to the to the professional
 
04:23:11.960 --> 04:23:13.189 align:start position:0%
really up to the to the professional
experience

04:23:13.189 --> 04:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
experience
 
04:23:17.590 --> 04:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
of your your your local superintendent
 
04:23:21.030 --> 04:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
building principles to Define what um
 
04:23:24.030 --> 04:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
what what these things are to give give
 
04:23:26.630 --> 04:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
the U the the best outcomes for your
 
04:23:29.429 --> 04:23:29.439 align:start position:0%
student but but looking at it across the
 
04:23:32.070 --> 04:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
state in all districts um that
 
04:23:34.389 --> 04:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
Foundation opportunity budget does
 
04:23:38.469 --> 04:23:38.479 align:start position:0%
include does include these um the the
 
04:23:43.630 --> 04:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
the the cost to offer programs beyond
 
04:23:47.710 --> 04:23:47.720 align:start position:0%
the the 13 how many elements do we have
 
04:23:52.349 --> 04:23:52.359 align:start position:0%
in 1932a 11 11 the 11 elements in there
 
04:23:54.910 --> 04:23:54.920 align:start position:0%
and um and and I I don't think there's
 
04:23:57.070 --> 04:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
any District in the state and I think
 
04:23:59.109 --> 04:23:59.119 align:start position:0%
we've heard many people talk about that
 
04:24:00.790 --> 04:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
there's not a single District in the
 
04:24:03.590 --> 04:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
state that offers just those 11 elements
 
04:24:08.670 --> 04:24:08.680 align:start position:0%
and stops there and um um you know I'm
 
04:24:12.149 --> 04:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure you know what and but you
 
04:24:14.389 --> 04:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
know our our current our current model
 
04:24:18.109 --> 04:24:18.119 align:start position:0%
talks about offering the 11 the those 11
 
04:24:20.109 --> 04:24:20.119 align:start position:0%
elements and stops there what we're
 
04:24:22.030 --> 04:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
proposing here we're not we're not
 
04:24:24.750 --> 04:24:24.760 align:start position:0%
taking away those 11 elements but we are
 
04:24:26.830 --> 04:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
incorporating in the student outcome
 
04:24:29.910 --> 04:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
factor and um and at the end of the day
 
04:24:31.910 --> 04:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
I think that's what what Granite Staters
 
04:24:35.790 --> 04:24:35.800 align:start position:0%
want for um for all their kids is to uh
 
04:24:38.269 --> 04:24:38.279 align:start position:0%
to perform at a at a high level like we
 
04:24:40.670 --> 04:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
are doing on average just not happening
 
04:24:42.950 --> 04:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
everywhere and you slip into there a
 
04:24:45.990 --> 04:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
very important point which is that um
 
04:24:49.269 --> 04:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
the list of the topics that make up
 
04:24:52.070 --> 04:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
inadequate education do not limit
 
04:24:54.389 --> 04:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
schools and never intended to limit
 
04:24:57.590 --> 04:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
schools in terms of what they offer
 
04:25:01.590 --> 04:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely representative uh Ames I'm CL
 
04:25:06.990 --> 04:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:09.710 --> 04:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
seniority bar
 
04:25:09.720 --> 04:25:11.309 align:start position:0%
seniority bar
barely

04:25:11.309 --> 04:25:11.319 align:start position:0%
barely
 
04:25:13.309 --> 04:25:13.319 align:start position:0%
um two
 
04:25:17.189 --> 04:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
things one is that I think it's
 
04:25:20.630 --> 04:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
important to say that going
 
04:25:23.790 --> 04:25:23.800 align:start position:0%
through the calculations and the formula
 
04:25:26.309 --> 04:25:26.319 align:start position:0%
that's in House Bill
 
04:25:30.030 --> 04:25:30.040 align:start position:0%
772 leads to
 
04:25:33.710 --> 04:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
results that increase significantly some
 
04:25:33.720 --> 04:25:36.349 align:start position:0%
results that increase significantly some
towns

04:25:36.349 --> 04:25:36.359 align:start position:0%
towns
 
04:25:40.790 --> 04:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
and not so for other towns and it tends
 
04:25:42.910 --> 04:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
to scale according
 
04:25:47.429 --> 04:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
to um according to property
 
04:25:50.830 --> 04:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
wealth um and also according to the
 
04:25:53.990 --> 04:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
relative needs of kids and some element
 
04:25:57.630 --> 04:25:57.640 align:start position:0%
of size is in there too but uh there are
 
04:26:01.269 --> 04:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
differentials and that means that
 
04:26:03.590 --> 04:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
compared to the other formulas that
 
04:26:06.590 --> 04:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the base increase
 
04:26:09.469 --> 04:26:09.479 align:start position:0%
formula the base plus differential Aid
 
04:26:13.830 --> 04:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
formula um the cost of this program
 
04:26:17.149 --> 04:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
bottom line comes out at less than
 
04:26:20.309 --> 04:26:20.319 align:start position:0%
significantly less than the costs of
 
04:26:21.510 --> 04:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
those other
 
04:26:23.590 --> 04:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
programs and
 
04:26:26.670 --> 04:26:26.680 align:start position:0%
um the second thing I want to say is
 
04:26:30.630 --> 04:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
that I will uh I think I I will do this
 
04:26:33.950 --> 04:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
I will send to everybody the uh
 
04:26:37.269 --> 04:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet uh with is an Excel with the
 
04:26:40.950 --> 04:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
formulas in it of what I've put together
 
04:26:43.109 --> 04:26:43.119 align:start position:0%
with the understanding that the a
 
04:26:48.389 --> 04:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
draft um we do not yet have from OS the
 
04:26:50.429 --> 04:26:50.439 align:start position:0%
fiscal statement but we're into this
 
04:26:53.229 --> 04:26:53.239 align:start position:0%
we're trying to talk about it understand
 
04:26:56.710 --> 04:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
that I'm uh I'm not the best with Excel
 
04:27:00.429 --> 04:27:00.439 align:start position:0%
I got clumsy fingers and uh my schooling
 
04:27:03.109 --> 04:27:03.119 align:start position:0%
uh occurred long before the development
 
04:27:03.119 --> 04:27:03.870 align:start position:0%
uh occurred long before the development
of

04:27:03.870 --> 04:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:27:08.950 --> 04:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
EXL um so um I will I will do that and I
 
04:27:10.950 --> 04:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
think that will enable you to see how
 
04:27:14.389 --> 04:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
this plays out in a way in which you can
 
04:27:17.670 --> 04:27:17.680 align:start position:0%
play with the data yourselves um and
 
04:27:20.630 --> 04:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
understand that when the the experts
 
04:27:23.950 --> 04:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
weigh in he's gone
 
04:27:26.950 --> 04:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
um the numbers for the foundation
 
04:27:29.590 --> 04:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity budget may prove to be a
 
04:27:31.269 --> 04:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
little bit different but basically they
 
04:27:34.070 --> 04:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
build off of the work that Mark did two
 
04:27:36.710 --> 04:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
years ago on the predecessor Bill to
 
04:27:38.750 --> 04:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
this bill well that sounds extremely
 
04:27:40.590 --> 04:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
helpful and I I think the black hole
 
04:27:42.710 --> 04:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
obviously that is in front of us today
 
04:27:44.269 --> 04:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
is we don't know what the fiscal note
 
04:27:46.389 --> 04:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
suggests will be the cost of the state
 
04:27:49.870 --> 04:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
of making up the differential um so
 
04:27:53.030 --> 04:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative lad uh can you yeah and
 
04:27:55.149 --> 04:27:55.159 align:start position:0%
representative Burton yeah I too grow up
 
04:27:57.550 --> 04:27:57.560 align:start position:0%
with a Blackboard and chalk and DK well
 
04:27:59.550 --> 04:27:59.560 align:start position:0%
on the desk with the quill pen you and I
 
04:28:03.149 --> 04:28:03.159 align:start position:0%
are the same same but uh and dealing and
 
04:28:05.750 --> 04:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
going back to where I was on this and
 
04:28:09.349 --> 04:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
am the we've talked I as I came into
 
04:28:11.870 --> 04:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
this part way soon I apologize I had we
 
04:28:15.189 --> 04:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
my Microsoft did a number on us today
 
04:28:19.750 --> 04:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
um when when I've been looking at at the
 
04:28:22.030 --> 04:28:22.040 align:start position:0%
way this has been computed as far as the
 
04:28:24.229 --> 04:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
dollar using the
 
04:28:28.189 --> 04:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
outcomes and I'm I'm I'm seeing that
 
04:28:31.189 --> 04:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
there are costs which have been talked
 
04:28:33.070 --> 04:28:33.080 align:start position:0%
about in the committee here earlier
 
04:28:35.830 --> 04:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
today when we we heard that if a local
 
04:28:37.550 --> 04:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
wants to go beyond and expand an
 
04:28:40.149 --> 04:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
enrichment program they can do that
 
04:28:43.070 --> 04:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
that's going on right now in this State
 
04:28:44.469 --> 04:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
there are school districts which were
 
04:28:46.790 --> 04:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
offering much more than others they want
 
04:28:49.030 --> 04:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
to enrich that's the expectation that's
 
04:28:50.950 --> 04:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
what the families want that's what the
 
04:28:52.109 --> 04:28:52.119 align:start position:0%
community wants that's what the
 
04:28:52.119 --> 04:28:53.109 align:start position:0%
community wants that's what the
workforce

04:28:53.109 --> 04:28:53.119 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
04:28:57.550 --> 04:28:57.560 align:start position:0%
wants that's the way our doe 25 form
 
04:29:00.109 --> 04:29:00.119 align:start position:0%
that's it reflects all that in the doe
 
04:29:03.870 --> 04:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
25 form today I believe there we we
 
04:29:07.189 --> 04:29:07.199 align:start position:0%
can't be basing everything off th those
 
04:29:08.630 --> 04:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
communities we should take the high and
 
04:29:10.229 --> 04:29:10.239 align:start position:0%
the low out and find out what's in the
 
04:29:11.790 --> 04:29:11.800 align:start position:0%
middle and what the actual cost is on
 
04:29:13.870 --> 04:29:13.880 align:start position:0%
these doe 25 forms we're going to look
 
04:29:17.269 --> 04:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
at statistics and but because what we're
 
04:29:20.469 --> 04:29:20.479 align:start position:0%
doing by not disaggregating this data
 
04:29:21.870 --> 04:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
then we're going to find out well the
 
04:29:24.750 --> 04:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
average cost is $7,000 or whatever it is
 
04:29:27.590 --> 04:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh it may be but it's also involving all
 
04:29:29.149 --> 04:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
those enrichment programs which are
 
04:29:31.030 --> 04:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
occurring throughout this state it's
 
04:29:32.269 --> 04:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
going well
 
04:29:34.469 --> 04:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
beyond what we expect for the
 
04:29:36.149 --> 04:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity of an adequate
 
04:29:39.389 --> 04:29:39.399 align:start position:0%
education and I understand that you know
 
04:29:41.510 --> 04:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
they're nice things to have but some of
 
04:29:43.510 --> 04:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
those nice things have gone beyond you
 
04:29:46.309 --> 04:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
know the actual need they've gone and
 
04:29:46.319 --> 04:29:47.389 align:start position:0%
know the actual need they've gone and
gone

04:29:47.389 --> 04:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
gone
 
04:29:49.670 --> 04:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
farther we should be building a building
 
04:29:53.830 --> 04:29:53.840 align:start position:0%
on a budget on that uh I'd like to have
 
04:29:56.710 --> 04:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
the inputs that are necessary to say
 
04:29:59.870 --> 04:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
this is what your adequate education is
 
04:30:02.269 --> 04:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
build off those inputs you can use a
 
04:30:04.990 --> 04:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
formula like this but let's start with a
 
04:30:08.910 --> 04:30:08.920 align:start position:0%
figure that is one that is palatable at
 
04:30:12.229 --> 04:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
least to myself that reflects what the
 
04:30:12.239 --> 04:30:15.670 align:start position:0%
least to myself that reflects what the
inputs

04:30:15.670 --> 04:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:19.269 --> 04:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
cost representative Burton one of the
 
04:30:20.990 --> 04:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
resources we had when we did this
 
04:30:23.910 --> 04:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
formula was anytime we changed anything
 
04:30:27.590 --> 04:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
we got a whole new computer model with
 
04:30:29.389 --> 04:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
uh Dean Mitchner I don't know if anyone
 
04:30:32.189 --> 04:30:32.199 align:start position:0%
remembers him he may he was anist yeah
 
04:30:34.149 --> 04:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
but he ran these these things so we
 
04:30:37.030 --> 04:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
could actually see what was going on um
 
04:30:39.189 --> 04:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
by the way adequate is not a great
 
04:30:42.030 --> 04:30:42.040 align:start position:0%
standard for Education none of us want
 
04:30:44.429 --> 04:30:44.439 align:start position:0%
want adequate we want exceptional for
 
04:30:47.469 --> 04:30:47.479 align:start position:0%
our kids um the last thing I'm going to
 
04:30:48.870 --> 04:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
say is
 
04:30:51.990 --> 04:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
this I envy business people because you
 
04:30:54.990 --> 04:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
can measure your output we use output
 
04:30:58.590 --> 04:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
outcomes the true output of education is
 
04:31:00.710 --> 04:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
the increment in intellectual and
 
04:31:02.990 --> 04:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
personal growth of person experiences
 
04:31:05.830 --> 04:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
well going through it now if you go to
 
04:31:08.590 --> 04:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
Harvard and you've got 2 800
 
04:31:11.389 --> 04:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
SATs you're one thing but if you come up
 
04:31:13.149 --> 04:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
if you're immigrant from the Dominican
 
04:31:15.550 --> 04:31:15.560 align:start position:0%
Republic like I had many of them and
 
04:31:19.149 --> 04:31:19.159 align:start position:0%
you're seeking a new life here um and
 
04:31:21.990 --> 04:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
and you learn English and you learn a
 
04:31:26.910 --> 04:31:26.920 align:start position:0%
skill that is also a successful output
 
04:31:29.030 --> 04:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
but the the problem you're working with
 
04:31:32.429 --> 04:31:32.439 align:start position:0%
is we don't know what the outputs are
 
04:31:35.550 --> 04:31:35.560 align:start position:0%
but we know what the inputs ought to be
 
04:31:38.590 --> 04:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
and and we know that they can they can
 
04:31:44.030 --> 04:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
vary um that that my sermon for the day
 
04:31:47.510 --> 04:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
but all right any other sermons any more
 
04:31:49.429 --> 04:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
sermons no that's that's illegal on
 
04:31:51.149 --> 04:31:51.159 align:start position:0%
public money isn't it representative
 
04:31:53.349 --> 04:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
fellows yeah um I don't I don't know if
 
04:31:55.429 --> 04:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
this will be helpful for representative
 
04:31:59.670 --> 04:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
lad or not but back in about
 
04:32:06.070 --> 04:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
2002 to come up with a base cost um what
 
04:32:08.910 --> 04:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
what I remember is taking the state
 
04:32:08.920 --> 04:32:10.269 align:start position:0%
what I remember is taking the state
assessment

04:32:10.269 --> 04:32:10.279 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
04:32:14.109 --> 04:32:14.119 align:start position:0%
results and sorting all the districts
 
04:32:19.109 --> 04:32:19.119 align:start position:0%
based on the T the test um results and
 
04:32:21.550 --> 04:32:21.560 align:start position:0%
then um you know putting putting the
 
04:32:23.550 --> 04:32:23.560 align:start position:0%
best performance at the top and the
 
04:32:26.670 --> 04:32:26.680 align:start position:0%
lowest at the bottom cut it in half take
 
04:32:29.950 --> 04:32:29.960 align:start position:0%
that top half and sort that again based
 
04:32:33.790 --> 04:32:33.800 align:start position:0%
on expenditure per pupil or some kind of
 
04:32:38.830 --> 04:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
cost per pupil and then take the um the
 
04:32:42.990 --> 04:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
lowest the lowest um
 
04:32:45.830 --> 04:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
expenditure per pupil and that was the
 
04:32:47.910 --> 04:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
data I don't remember the details that
 
04:32:51.309 --> 04:32:51.319 align:start position:0%
use used to come up with the um per
 
04:32:53.550 --> 04:32:53.560 align:start position:0%
pupil base
 
04:32:58.670 --> 04:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
cost so the only thing that
 
04:33:01.870 --> 04:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
um is you have to make some accommodate
 
04:33:04.109 --> 04:33:04.119 align:start position:0%
which they didn't do but I think you now
 
04:33:06.070 --> 04:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
now we know better to make some kind of
 
04:33:09.109 --> 04:33:09.119 align:start position:0%
accommodations for the fact that the the
 
04:33:13.189 --> 04:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
biggest um communities would come out
 
04:33:15.990 --> 04:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
came out in in that because the because
 
04:33:18.429 --> 04:33:18.439 align:start position:0%
because of economy as scale you know you
 
04:33:20.390 --> 04:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
get the Manchester and the Nash is in
 
04:33:23.510 --> 04:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
the bigger districts so you need to put
 
04:33:27.510 --> 04:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
back in for the the smaller districts
 
04:33:30.429 --> 04:33:30.439 align:start position:0%
that that it's inherently going to be
 
04:33:33.510 --> 04:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
more per student for the smaller
 
04:33:35.390 --> 04:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
districts because they can't build and
 
04:33:38.709 --> 04:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
and I personally I think we need to look
 
04:33:40.629 --> 04:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
at some kind of funding that's on the
 
04:33:42.470 --> 04:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
classroom level
 
04:33:44.789 --> 04:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
because some districts you you can't
 
04:33:47.349 --> 04:33:47.359 align:start position:0%
control the number of students that you
 
04:33:49.750 --> 04:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
put in a classroom for the smaller
 
04:33:51.590 --> 04:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
districts because they've got to fit in
 
04:33:53.429 --> 04:33:53.439 align:start position:0%
between that you know they've got to
 
04:33:56.990 --> 04:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
keep it below the 30 or the 25 but when
 
04:33:59.670 --> 04:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
you get 35 students you have to split
 
04:34:03.150 --> 04:34:03.160 align:start position:0%
them into two classes so you can't get
 
04:34:04.990 --> 04:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
the same kind of economy and skill you
 
04:34:07.150 --> 04:34:07.160 align:start position:0%
get in the bigger one so that's just
 
04:34:09.510 --> 04:34:09.520 align:start position:0%
just another way of looking at it to put
 
04:34:11.990 --> 04:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
on the table we see that in terms of of
 
04:34:14.429 --> 04:34:14.439 align:start position:0%
the University system to keep the
 
04:34:16.990 --> 04:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
conquered law school going you're going
 
04:34:18.590 --> 04:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
to have to have another program over
 
04:34:20.629 --> 04:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
here and so it's just this bubble you're
 
04:34:24.310 --> 04:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
pushing in so there are those one
 
04:34:25.709 --> 04:34:25.719 align:start position:0%
Department might be carrying another
 
04:34:27.629 --> 04:34:27.639 align:start position:0%
department but you need both
 
04:34:29.990 --> 04:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
departments and and within schools it's
 
04:34:32.949 --> 04:34:32.959 align:start position:0%
very much the same I get that and but
 
04:34:35.349 --> 04:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
there's other ways of of doing the
 
04:34:37.390 --> 04:34:37.400 align:start position:0%
assessment I was around when we used
 
04:34:39.869 --> 04:34:39.879 align:start position:0%
those types of Assessments the norm
 
04:34:44.269 --> 04:34:44.279 align:start position:0%
reference tests to really derive a a a
 
04:34:46.629 --> 04:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
costing formula but there's other
 
04:34:49.349 --> 04:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
outputs too which are really important
 
04:34:51.629 --> 04:34:51.639 align:start position:0%
uh other than you know I I had a brother
 
04:34:53.709 --> 04:34:53.719 align:start position:0%
at 800 on the College Board scores
 
04:34:56.070 --> 04:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
flunked out of college three times in
 
04:34:58.789 --> 04:34:58.799 align:start position:0%
mathematics 800 now he's in charge of
 
04:35:01.830 --> 04:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
bull computer over in Europe but I I
 
04:35:03.510 --> 04:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
think that there's other other
 
04:35:05.310 --> 04:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
performances that we can do we have
 
04:35:08.910 --> 04:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
those IND indices in our how do we judge
 
04:35:10.590 --> 04:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
which we're meeting an adequate
 
04:35:14.189 --> 04:35:14.199 align:start position:0%
education how we reporting to Essa and
 
04:35:16.029 --> 04:35:16.039 align:start position:0%
there you know how many go on to the
 
04:35:17.670 --> 04:35:17.680 align:start position:0%
trades how many go on to college how
 
04:35:19.390 --> 04:35:19.400 align:start position:0%
many go into the service how many you
 
04:35:21.869 --> 04:35:21.879 align:start position:0%
know are participate in this program or
 
04:35:23.750 --> 04:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
that that's how I think we should be
 
04:35:25.869 --> 04:35:25.879 align:start position:0%
measuring outcomes along with those the
 
04:35:28.750 --> 04:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
testing scores I think that's extremely
 
04:35:31.109 --> 04:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
important so I don't want to really
 
04:35:35.789 --> 04:35:35.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:38.070 --> 04:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
instrument I that's sort of like this
 
04:35:40.750 --> 04:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
budget does that I I did a complete cost
 
04:35:43.390 --> 04:35:43.400 align:start position:0%
analysis that you Ag and it and you
 
04:35:45.590 --> 04:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
can't go by that the most expensive
 
04:35:48.109 --> 04:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
program they have is nursing because the
 
04:35:51.830 --> 04:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
ratio of of Faculty full-time faculty to
 
04:35:54.590 --> 04:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
nurses is 10 to one that's very
 
04:35:57.390 --> 04:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
expensive the next was technology the
 
04:35:59.070 --> 04:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
next was the business school I was
 
04:36:02.269 --> 04:36:02.279 align:start position:0%
assistant dean of and then uh liberal
 
04:36:04.310 --> 04:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
arts funds the rest of them because they
 
04:36:08.189 --> 04:36:08.199 align:start position:0%
have these huge intro sections and and
 
04:36:11.590 --> 04:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
so I most most colleges are like that
 
04:36:13.269 --> 04:36:13.279 align:start position:0%
and that's why they're nonprofit because
 
04:36:15.629 --> 04:36:15.639 align:start position:0%
inherently uneconomical from a cost
 
04:36:17.590 --> 04:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
standpoint but it's inherently
 
04:36:19.750 --> 04:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
beneficial from a social Viewpoint we
 
04:36:19.760 --> 04:36:21.830 align:start position:0%
beneficial from a social Viewpoint we
need

04:36:21.830 --> 04:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
need
 
04:36:24.429 --> 04:36:24.439 align:start position:0%
nurses so I
 
04:36:27.510 --> 04:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
so say I think we're at about the wrap
 
04:36:29.949 --> 04:36:29.959 align:start position:0%
up Point yeah yeah so so I think as the
 
04:36:32.670 --> 04:36:32.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes begin to um come out for
 
04:36:35.869 --> 04:36:35.879 align:start position:0%
this for 772 and and um and the other
 
04:36:38.349 --> 04:36:38.359 align:start position:0%
bills you know taking a look at a couple
 
04:36:40.070 --> 04:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
things taking a look at what the bill is
 
04:36:42.269 --> 04:36:42.279 align:start position:0%
trying to accomplish and taking a look
 
04:36:44.789 --> 04:36:44.799 align:start position:0%
at at at the costs at what the what the
 
04:36:49.109 --> 04:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
costs to the state are and um and I and
 
04:36:50.830 --> 04:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
hopefully I think you know because we're
 
04:36:53.349 --> 04:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
looking at different um different
 
04:36:55.269 --> 04:36:55.279 align:start position:0%
methods here from all these different
 
04:36:58.470 --> 04:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
bills that uh that there'll be something
 
04:37:02.269 --> 04:37:02.279 align:start position:0%
there to contrast and uh and I don't
 
04:37:03.510 --> 04:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
think you're going to see two bills that
 
04:37:05.070 --> 04:37:05.080 align:start position:0%
are like oh yeah it doesn't matter which
 
04:37:06.869 --> 04:37:06.879 align:start position:0%
one we pick they both do the same thing
 
04:37:08.789 --> 04:37:08.799 align:start position:0%
I think there'll be significant contrast
 
04:37:11.990 --> 04:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
between between these and um and uh I
 
04:37:13.990 --> 04:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
hope we have uh more of these work
 
04:37:15.510 --> 04:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
sessions coming up soon with fiscal
 
04:37:17.029 --> 04:37:17.039 align:start position:0%
notes I agree with everything you've
 
04:37:18.789 --> 04:37:18.799 align:start position:0%
just said and I think that once we have
 
04:37:21.349 --> 04:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note yes another discussion I
 
04:37:23.551 --> 04:37:23.561 align:start position:0%
think this was a very well balanced day
 
04:37:25.510 --> 04:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
we we went through a whole series of
 
04:37:30.349 --> 04:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
bills that tweak our current uh approach
 
04:37:31.910 --> 04:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
before lunch and then we talked about
 
04:37:33.910 --> 04:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
two bills that would fairly radically
 
04:37:37.070 --> 04:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
transform it so um obviously we can't
 
04:37:39.070 --> 04:37:39.080 align:start position:0%
cover everything today and and we'll
 
04:37:42.109 --> 04:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
revisit those yeah how thought I pass it
 
04:37:43.670 --> 04:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
back to our Jim well I think we're ready
 
04:37:46.230 --> 04:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
to get out of here at least I am um it's
 
04:37:47.830 --> 04:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
been a hard day you know when our
 
04:37:50.709 --> 04:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
reports came they didn't come and they
 
04:37:53.029 --> 04:37:53.039 align:start position:0%
came in about two hours after you sent
 
04:37:58.109 --> 04:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
them uh Microsoft had a problem pardon
 
04:38:02.629 --> 04:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
me from you all I got twice I got it
 
04:38:05.070 --> 04:38:05.080 align:start position:0%
twice yeah but they all came in on the
 
04:38:07.949 --> 04:38:07.959 align:start position:0%
same time when I just walked in here is
 
04:38:12.750 --> 04:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
when I got them uh so uh we have uh
 
04:38:15.789 --> 04:38:15.799 align:start position:0%
nothing scheduled for uh the remainder
 
04:38:18.670 --> 04:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
of this week and other than session
 
04:38:20.830 --> 04:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
tomorrow the governor doing her big
 
04:38:23.869 --> 04:38:23.879 align:start position:0%
thing and uh then we will meet again on
 
04:38:27.590 --> 04:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and we meet on Tuesday at 10:30
 
04:38:29.269 --> 04:38:29.279 align:start position:0%
10:30 we'll be starting and we are going
 
04:38:32.070 --> 04:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
to be executing the bills that are I
 
04:38:34.709 --> 04:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
think it's 11 or 12 bills that we we're
 
04:38:37.429 --> 04:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
executing uh we're we're not attacking
 
04:38:40.910 --> 04:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
any of these th this what we discussed
 
04:38:43.830 --> 04:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
today on at that time those bills are
 
04:38:47.510 --> 04:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
still being yes your representes you're
 
04:38:48.830 --> 04:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
right on and we're going to have to
 
04:38:50.429 --> 04:38:50.439 align:start position:0%
figure out which bills we're going to
 
04:38:52.150 --> 04:38:52.160 align:start position:0%

04:38:55.789 --> 04:38:55.799 align:start position:0%
