everyone before I begin the hearing on
 
00:36:52.589 --> 00:36:52.599 align:start position:0%
House Bill 377 fan I'd like to go over
 
00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
how we're going to proceed today uh we
 
00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
have a lot of people interested in in
 
00:36:58.589 --> 00:36:58.599 align:start position:0%
testifying on this bill as you might
 
00:37:00.349 --> 00:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
well imagine it's an important issue
 
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
regardless of what side you're on uh in
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
order to get through everyone and a
 
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable fashion uh we do have to
 
00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
limit testimony uh the practice of this
 
00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
committee has been that the prime
 
00:37:14.069 --> 00:37:14.079 align:start position:0%
sponsor has given extra time because
 
00:37:16.589 --> 00:37:16.599 align:start position:0%
they were the one who developed the bill
 
00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:18.200 align:start position:0%
they're going to explain that process
 
00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to explain why they did it
 
00:37:22.829 --> 00:37:22.839 align:start position:0%
and and the whole focus and background
 
00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
of that once we get past the prime
 
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor we will have to insist that
 
00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
testimony be limited to 3 minutes it's
 
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
the only way we're going to get through
 
00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
all of the folks who want to testify and
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
we want to give everybody an equal
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
chance if you're still speaking at three
 
00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
minutes I'm going to ask you to start
 
00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
wrapping up I will give you 15 seconds
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
to start wrapping up at the end of those
 
00:37:49.829 --> 00:37:49.839 align:start position:0%
15 seconds regardless of where you are
 
00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
in your testimony I am going to thank
 
00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:54.040 align:start position:0%
you for that testimony and ask the
 
00:37:56.349 --> 00:37:56.359 align:start position:0%
committee if they have any questions and
 
00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
again I I appreciate appreciate the
 
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
importance of this issue I appreciate
 
00:38:02.349 --> 00:38:02.359 align:start position:0%
everyone's feelings on this issue but
 
00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:03.640 align:start position:0%
the only way we're going to get through
 
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:05.800 align:start position:0%
this if we adhere to that and and again
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%

and wear thank you for the opportunity
 
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
to speak on this critical issue and I
 
00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
know it's an emotional one I stand
 
00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
before you to address the growing
 
00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
use of puberty blockers and hormone
 
00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:48.040 align:start position:0%
treatments in minors practices that
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
carry significant medical risks and
 
00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:51.870 align:start position:0%
carry significant medical risks and
long-term

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:51.880 align:start position:0%
long-term
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
consequences I'd like to begin with an
 
00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
undeniable truth children cannot fully
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
fully comprehend the lifelong
 
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
implications of altering their bodies
 
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
with powerful
 
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
medications yet we are witnessing a
 
00:39:08.309 --> 00:39:08.319 align:start position:0%
concerning Trend where children some as
 
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
young as 3 years old are being seen as
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
patients in gender clinics children as
 
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
young as eight or nine are being
 
00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:18.079 align:start position:0%
prescribed puberty blockers and cross-
 
00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
sex hormones often a after just a few
 
00:39:22.829 --> 00:39:22.839 align:start position:0%
hours of
 
00:39:25.069 --> 00:39:25.079 align:start position:0%
consultation while I understand that
 
00:39:28.309 --> 00:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria is real and painful
 
00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
rushing miners into irreversible medical
 
00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:34.520 align:start position:0%
interventions is not the answer these
 
00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:37.160 align:start position:0%
treatments build as re reversible and
 
00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
harmless come with serious risks and
 
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
these are not just abstract
 
00:39:44.309 --> 00:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
possibilities they are already becoming
 
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
tragic realities for young people across

originally developed to treat prostate

of children placed on puberty blockers
 
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
go on to take crossx hormones a pathway

patients scientists at the
 
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
world-renowned Mayo Clinic carried out a
 
00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:45.640 align:start position:0%
study and found that puberty blockers
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
lead to fertility problems withering
 
00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:50.440 align:start position:0%

significant steps to totally restrict or
 
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
halt the use of puberty blockers and
 
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
cross- seex hormones for minors we are
 
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
children their decisions were driven by
 
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
comprehensive reviews of the available
 
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
evidence which revealed profound
 
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
concerns about the long-term impact of
 
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
these medical interventions on young
 
00:41:28.589 --> 00:41:28.599 align:start position:0%
people and what's most alarming many
 
00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
children begin this process before
 
00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
they're even old enough to drive Vote or
 
00:41:35.710 --> 00:41:35.720 align:start position:0%
make decisions about their own Medical
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
Care you will hear today that if these
 
00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
children go don't go through these
 
00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
procedures they are more likely to
 
00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.270 align:start position:0%
procedures they are more likely to
commit

suicides now I'm going to speak from the
 
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
heart and I might get emotional so I'm
 
00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:12.200 align:start position:0%
sorry because I've spoken personally
 
00:42:14.109 --> 00:42:14.119 align:start position:0%
with these families who have been

devastated by these
 
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
treatments parents who believed they
 
00:42:20.069 --> 00:42:20.079 align:start position:0%
were making the right decision to
 
00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:23.240 align:start position:0%
support their children only to find that
 
00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:25.720 align:start position:0%
those children later suffered greatly
 
00:42:28.829 --> 00:42:28.839 align:start position:0%
from the irreversible change es to their
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%

this guys I have seen the photos and I
 
00:42:35.549 --> 00:42:35.559 align:start position:0%
can't unsee them so that's why I'm here

not radical medical

young women detransition they will
 
00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:39.800 align:start position:0%
suffer and their doctors will have no
 
00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:42.440 align:start position:0%
idea how to help them we don't let
 
00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
miners get tattoos go to tanning salons
 
00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
buy cigarettes or consume alcohol
 
00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
because we know they lack the maturity
 
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
to make those decisions and that they
 
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
may cause later on why then would we let
 
00:43:59.109 --> 00:43:59.119 align:start position:0%
them make IR reversible medical choices
 
00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:00.520 align:start position:0%
that will affect their health and
 
00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
happiness for the rest of their lives we
 
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
are in a very difficult societal
 
00:44:08.309 --> 00:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
situation because medical professionals
 
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
have pursued a dangerous protocol
 
00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
without first establishing a scientific
 
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
basis to support it they have misled
 
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
both young people and their responsible
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
adults to believe that quickly accessing
 
00:44:25.309 --> 00:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
this care is the only option they have I
 
00:44:27.829 --> 00:44:27.839 align:start position:0%
urge this committee to consider the
 
00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:31.960 align:start position:0%
scientific evidence and the growing
 
00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
bipartisan this isn't no longer a party
 
00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
issue an international consensus that
 
00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
children should just wait until they're
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
18 that's what we're saying today wait
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
until you're 18 on this issue miners
 
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:47.800 align:start position:0%
deserve protection from experimental
 
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
medical interventions that could cause
 
00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
lasting harm counseling yes
 
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely we must prioritize their la
 
00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
long-term well-being over short-term
 
00:45:03.069 --> 00:45:03.079 align:start position:0%
solutions that may seem compassionate
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
but do carry significant
 
00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:08.440 align:start position:0%
risks I'm asking you today please stand
 
00:45:10.109 --> 00:45:10.119 align:start position:0%
with us in protecting vulnerable
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
children let's give them time let's give
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
them space let's give them hope for a
 
00:45:19.150 --> 00:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
future that isn't divined defined by
 
00:45:23.109 --> 00:45:23.119 align:start position:0%
irreversible medical mistakes thank you
 
00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:25.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative Woods uh thank
 
00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:30.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:45:34.589 --> 00:45:34.599 align:start position:0%
question uh you quoted some numbers
 
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
about the the number of patients uh that
 
00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:43.880 align:start position:0%
have been harmed by this uh you hav't a
 
00:45:47.549 --> 00:45:47.559 align:start position:0%
similar handle on a number of patients
 
00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
that would be harmed if they didn't have
 
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
this medical treatment well you'll hear
 
00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:56.440 align:start position:0%
even in my testimony this afternoon that
 
00:46:00.549 --> 00:46:00.559 align:start position:0%
just last week um the I mean you know
 
00:46:03.549 --> 00:46:03.559 align:start position:0%
when we talk about harm the worst harm
 
00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
is to your self suicide and uh so la
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
just last week the Journal of sexual
 
00:46:13.150 --> 00:46:13.160 align:start position:0%
medicine put out a study um that in over
 
00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:14.230 align:start position:0%
medicine put out a study um that in over
a

00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:16.720 align:start position:0%
100,000 uh people that
 
00:46:20.549 --> 00:46:20.559 align:start position:0%
underwent um medical
 
00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
interventions um at the end of this
 
00:46:26.069 --> 00:46:26.079 align:start position:0%
study there was there was no change it
 
00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
was actually I'm sorry there was more
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
people that after going through these
 
00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
procedures um were commit committing
 
00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
suicide and that just came out last week
 
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
so e and that was a huge study and more
 
00:46:44.549 --> 00:46:44.559 align:start position:0%
studies like this are coming out every
 
00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
day that these interventions whether
 
00:46:50.069 --> 00:46:50.079 align:start position:0%
hormonal or
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
surgical are not saving
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
lives follow up oh yeah that it's not my
 
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
question my question centered around you
 
00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
you mentioned again in the answer you
 
00:47:07.549 --> 00:47:07.559 align:start position:0%
just gave about the harms yep my
 
00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
question is do you have any handle on
 
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
the number of people uh that need this
 
00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
care and would be denied this care I do
 
00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:19.960 align:start position:0%
not have that no nobody has that
 
00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:22.190 align:start position:0%
not have that no nobody has that
representative

00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um
 
00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:30.559 align:start position:0%
you told us anecdotally about people who
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
regret having had
 
00:47:36.349 --> 00:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
treatment have you any actual
 
00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
statistical information about the regret
 
00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:43.240 align:start position:0%
rate for this procedure and have you
 
00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
compared that regret weight with the
 
00:47:47.510 --> 00:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
procedure for other life-changing
 
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:49.880 align:start position:0%
childhood treatments I don't have the
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
answer to that there's probably people
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
coming behind me that may have that um
 
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
but I don't have those numbers no
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
because we're talking not even you know
 
00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:01.640 align:start position:0%
on the national level but it's it's a
 
00:48:05.069 --> 00:48:05.079 align:start position:0%
global uh situation as
 
00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
well other questions yes thank you Mr
 
00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:10.280 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking the
 
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
question um the bill as part of the uh
 
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
description uh has a clause that defines
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
quote normal
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
puberty um it's been a while but my
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
recollection is that there's basically
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
nothing normal about puberty um and so
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
I'm curious uh lack a good definition of
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
what that is how do you expect that to
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
be implemented and
 
00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:36.440 align:start position:0%
enforced what is normal puberty here yes
 
00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
um yeah and iar yes we have medical
 
00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
providers that are sitting right behind
 
00:48:42.829 --> 00:48:42.839 align:start position:0%
me that will answer that question I am
 
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
not a medical professional um but there
 
00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:47.839 align:start position:0%
are different ages that people do go
 
00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
through normal puberty and that is the
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
stages of that I know that they'll be
 
00:48:54.549 --> 00:48:54.559 align:start position:0%
talking about so thank
 
00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
you yes representative Lucas
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thanks for
 
00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:03.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm just wondering
 
00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
have you done any research or listen to
 
00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:09.640 align:start position:0%
evidence um regarding the regret rate
 
00:49:11.549 --> 00:49:11.559 align:start position:0%
for these medications when they're used
 
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
for other conditions like precocious
 
00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
puberty for
 
00:49:20.109 --> 00:49:20.119 align:start position:0%
example yes yep it's coming thank you
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
yep other
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
questions I'm seeing none thank you oh
 
00:49:28.589 --> 00:49:28.599 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative haret uh thank
 
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you representative
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
Maser um appreciating your concern about
 
00:49:36.510 --> 00:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
this medication of these medications I
 
00:49:39.069 --> 00:49:39.079 align:start position:0%
wondered if you had any moral
 
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
disapproval for just the category of
 
00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
transgender people the moral
 
00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
disapproval I don't I love everybody so
 
00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:51.670 align:start position:0%
disapproval I don't I love everybody so
I

00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:49:55.309 --> 00:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
don't as an adult this this is we're
 
00:49:57.309 --> 00:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
talking about that don't that doesn't
 
00:49:59.670 --> 00:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
relate to this bill I'm sorry this is
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
this is harmful procedures on minors and
 
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
I feel like that's just kind of moving
 
00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:06.440 align:start position:0%
into a debate that that's not what this
 
00:50:08.710 --> 00:50:08.720 align:start position:0%
bill is about but thank you for the
 
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
question other
 
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Sam
 
00:50:31.069 --> 00:50:31.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:38.079 align:start position:0%
minutes good morning chairman members of
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Sam Hawkins I'm
 
00:50:41.109 --> 00:50:41.119 align:start position:0%
here today representing Nami New
 
00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in opposition to House Bill
 
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
377 as an organization dedicated to
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
improving the lives of all people
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
impacted by mental illness and suicide
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
we believe that no one should be subject
 
00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
to policies or practices that can cause
 
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
or worsen mental health symptoms and as
 
00:50:56.829 --> 00:50:56.839 align:start position:0%
such we oppose any legislation that
 
00:50:58.630 --> 00:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
seeks to prohibit or limit access to
 
00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:00.280 align:start position:0%
clinically appropriate care for
 
00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:01.870 align:start position:0%
clinically appropriate care for
transgender

00:51:01.870 --> 00:51:01.880 align:start position:0%
transgender
 
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
individuals is well understood I Believe
 
00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:05.960 align:start position:0%
by the committee that too often trans
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
people face stigma discrimination and
 
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
challenges accessing necessary care
 
00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
which all contributes to a like higher
 
00:51:13.789 --> 00:51:13.799 align:start position:0%
likelihood of poor mental health
 
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
outcomes I have specific statistics to
 
00:51:17.789 --> 00:51:17.799 align:start position:0%
that in my written testimony which I
 
00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
will distribute but I do want to be
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
clear and really Hammer home the point
 
00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:23.240 align:start position:0%
that there is nothing inherent in one's
 
00:51:25.789 --> 00:51:25.799 align:start position:0%
life as a transor non-binary person that
 
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
contributes to mental health rather it
 
00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
is due to these experiences with
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
discrimination and an inability to
 
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
receive necessary care and
 
00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
supports everyone's Journey will look
 
00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
different but access to care can be a
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
crucial part of that to promoting the
 
00:51:41.829 --> 00:51:41.839 align:start position:0%
physical and mental health of trans
 
00:51:44.069 --> 00:51:44.079 align:start position:0%
people of all ages with studies we have
 
00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
seen showing that access to care can
 
00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
improve mental health out outcomes
 
00:51:49.670 --> 00:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
including hormone therapy and when
 
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
initiated in adolescence I just further
 
00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:54.680 align:start position:0%
want to say that all major medical
 
00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
associations have released statements
 
00:51:59.230 --> 00:51:59.240 align:start position:0%
supporting gender affirming care our
 
00:52:01.109 --> 00:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
policies must focus on improving mental
 
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:02.720 align:start position:0%
health outcomes for all rather than
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
impeding the medical decision-making of
 
00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
families and restricting access to
 
00:52:09.069 --> 00:52:09.079 align:start position:0%
necessary care trans people like all
 
00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
people deserve access to the care they
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
want and need to be well and I encourage
 
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
you to please listen to the voices and
 
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
stories of trans youth that may come
 
00:52:18.990 --> 00:52:19.000 align:start position:0%

to see some familiar faces here uh this
 
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
bill is very important because doctors
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
don't always get it right we can look
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
back to when the American Medical
 
00:53:16.230 --> 00:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
Association was all right with the Tusk
 
00:53:20.589 --> 00:53:20.599 align:start position:0%
experiments where black men were allowed
 
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
to continue living and infecting people
 
00:53:24.109 --> 00:53:24.119 align:start position:0%
with syphilis in order to see the
 
00:53:26.910 --> 00:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
natural course of the disease that was a
 
00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
tragedy and a disaster that was endorsed
 
00:53:32.549 --> 00:53:32.559 align:start position:0%
by the medical um establishment so
 
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes doctors don't get things right
 
00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
we also remember thalidomide um back
 
00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:40.280 align:start position:0%
before it was a life-saving cure for
 
00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
blood cancers it was given to moms with
 
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
nausea because that was the accepted
 
00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
medical practice at the time however it
 
00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
l led to severe deformities of babies
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
and it had unintended unexpected side
 
00:53:56.789 --> 00:53:56.799 align:start position:0%
effects when those side effects became
 
00:53:59.390 --> 00:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
known people looked at the data looked
 
00:54:00.789 --> 00:54:00.799 align:start position:0%
at the evidence and realized that they
 
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
were causing unintentional harm and
 
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
changed their
 
00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
practice the reason we're here today is
 
00:54:09.549 --> 00:54:09.559 align:start position:0%
because there is growing medical data
 
00:54:11.309 --> 00:54:11.319 align:start position:0%
and evidence that shows that this is in
 
00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
fact harmful for children and
 
00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:15.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um there's been an
 
00:54:17.470 --> 00:54:17.480 align:start position:0%
entrenched view within the medical
 
00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:19.400 align:start position:0%
establishment that this is the correct
 
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
way forward despite mounting evidence in
 
00:54:24.549 --> 00:54:24.559 align:start position:0%
any other area of medicine they would
 
00:54:27.510 --> 00:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
reconsider this but quite frankly look
 
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
around it's it's scary for a lot of
 
00:54:32.069 --> 00:54:32.079 align:start position:0%
people to talk about this because a they
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
feel that people will be told that they
 
00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
hate trans people when that's not true
 
00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
and they are also afraid of the
 
00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:39.640 align:start position:0%
repercussions that will happen to them
 
00:54:41.950 --> 00:54:41.960 align:start position:0%
socially if they speak about this but
 
00:54:45.430 --> 00:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
the fact is if you give a young boy
 
00:54:49.349 --> 00:54:49.359 align:start position:0%
puberty blockers while he is still early
 
00:54:51.910 --> 00:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
early on in puberty you will sterilize
 
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
him for life he will not be able to
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
develop so that he can have functioning
 
00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:00.280 align:start position:0%
testes so that he can then bear
 
00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
children his penis can wither away and
 
00:55:06.589 --> 00:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
Shrink not just staying the size of an
 
00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
eight or nine-year-old boy but actually
 
00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:12.200 align:start position:0%
getting smaller and this is a huge huge
 
00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
problem for those men who later in life
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
and throughout their life know that they
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
want to live as a woman because
 
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
traditionally men who want to live as
 
00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
women who have a procedure um down below
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
would use that tissue if you're looking
 
00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:32.440 align:start position:0%
at these young boys you are denying them
 
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
the ability to have that reproductive
 
00:55:37.390 --> 00:55:37.400 align:start position:0%
tissue repurpose to be more functional
 
00:55:39.549 --> 00:55:39.559 align:start position:0%
you are sentencing them to a life where
 
00:55:42.990 --> 00:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
they need to use colon tissue to create
 
00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
a vagina if they proceed in their
 
00:55:48.549 --> 00:55:48.559 align:start position:0%
medicalization not only are you
 
00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
sterilizing them before they have before
 
00:55:53.549 --> 00:55:53.559 align:start position:0%
they have while they're still in the
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
early stages of their mental development
 
00:55:58.349 --> 00:55:58.359 align:start position:0%
you are closing the door for medical
 
00:55:59.910 --> 00:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
interventions that have helped
 
00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
transgender people over a lifetime it's
 
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
not compassionate to give these it's not
 
00:56:06.990 --> 00:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
compassionate to give these to kids and
 
00:56:09.349 --> 00:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
I ask that we stand up and we say that
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
it's time to end this experiment and
 
00:56:17.470 --> 00:56:17.480 align:start position:0%
protect kids thank you thank you any
 
00:56:22.510 --> 00:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:27.630 --> 00:56:27.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
please be quiet please be quiet in the
 
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
back and thank you for taking my
 
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
questions do you have um references that
 
00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:38.200 align:start position:0%
you can provide for this information um
 
00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you if others don't provide the
 
00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:41.839 align:start position:0%
information I can send some of that
 
00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:43.160 align:start position:0%
along I have a feeling that there'll be
 
00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:44.680 align:start position:0%
others including medical professionals
 
00:56:46.950 --> 00:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
to speak about this but if afterwards
 
00:56:48.430 --> 00:56:48.440 align:start position:0%
you don't have your questions answered
 
00:56:50.349 --> 00:56:50.359 align:start position:0%
please feel free to reach out to me see
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
me on campus ask me and I will make sure
 
00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:54.200 align:start position:0%
you get that data and that information
 
00:56:55.230 --> 00:56:55.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
00:56:59.549 --> 00:56:59.559 align:start position:0%
you other questions representative Weber
 
00:57:01.150 --> 00:57:01.160 align:start position:0%
could you give us some kind of data
 
00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
about the amount of time that uh these
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
treatments have been used and in many
 
00:57:08.670 --> 00:57:08.680 align:start position:0%
cases successfully versus how long it
 
00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
took to discover the issues with phide
 
00:57:13.549 --> 00:57:13.559 align:start position:0%
and correct them well thank you this is
 
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
a developmental issue the EB and flow of
 
00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:19.160 align:start position:0%
hormones over a child's development is
 
00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:21.720 align:start position:0%
not just a onetime switch or a onetime
 
00:57:24.270 --> 00:57:24.280 align:start position:0%
valve um as you go through this process
 
00:57:26.309 --> 00:57:26.319 align:start position:0%
there are different times when the
 
00:57:28.109 --> 00:57:28.119 align:start position:0%
hormones impact your body differently
 
00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
this goes to development of your brain
 
00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
it goes to development of your body it
 
00:57:34.589 --> 00:57:34.599 align:start position:0%
goes to development of your bones um I
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
am actually expecting a massive rash of
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
of huge problems with bone density and
 
00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:41.960 align:start position:0%
we're not just going to see older women
 
00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:43.960 align:start position:0%
having hip fractures we're going to see
 
00:57:45.789 --> 00:57:45.799 align:start position:0%
children treated with puberty blockers
 
00:57:47.750 --> 00:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
with hip fractures and as somebody who
 
00:57:49.470 --> 00:57:49.480 align:start position:0%
broke my femur I have to tell you that's
 
00:57:52.029 --> 00:57:52.039 align:start position:0%
not fun and I don't wish it on anybody
 
00:57:54.109 --> 00:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
um because this is a longer process it's
 
00:57:55.589 --> 00:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
not going to be the same thing as giving
 
00:57:57.589 --> 00:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
a mother olomide and then some number of
 
00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:00.280 align:start position:0%
months later seeing a child um that is
 
00:58:03.390 --> 00:58:03.400 align:start position:0%
born that is that obviously has issues
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
um we can look at the Timeline we can
 
00:58:08.349 --> 00:58:08.359 align:start position:0%
look at the process however would you
 
00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:10.280 align:start position:0%
consider it successful to sterilize a
 
00:58:13.829 --> 00:58:13.839 align:start position:0%
child and if so I'm just curious why why
 
00:58:15.309 --> 00:58:15.319 align:start position:0%
there's push back on adults that want to
 
00:58:17.230 --> 00:58:17.240 align:start position:0%
sterilize themselves if we're okay with
 
00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:20.990 align:start position:0%
sterilize themselves if we're okay with
sterilizing

00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:24.190 align:start position:0%
 
children

00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:24.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:27.390 --> 00:58:27.400 align:start position:0%
follow the import of my question was not
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
the amount of time developmentally for
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
the individual child the import of my
 
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
question was how long have these
 
00:58:39.670 --> 00:58:39.680 align:start position:0%
treatments been in use versus how long
 
00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
theide was in use before the issues were
 
00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
discovered well thank you there is a
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
very very different method of
 
00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
administration when you're giving
 
00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:51.640 align:start position:0%
something as a one-time or a limited
 
00:58:54.789 --> 00:58:54.799 align:start position:0%
basis versus an ongoing treatment when
 
00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
you have an ongoing treatment you need
 
00:58:58.150 --> 00:58:58.160 align:start position:0%
longer followup in order to look at the
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
data um there is Success using these in
 
00:59:03.029 --> 00:59:03.039 align:start position:0%
precocious puberty and I do want to note
 
00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
that when we talk about normal puberty
 
00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
in this bill precocious puberty is not
 
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
defined as normal puberty the intention
 
00:59:12.589 --> 00:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
and what I believe is very clear
 
00:59:14.789 --> 00:59:14.799 align:start position:0%
language is that precocious puberty is
 
00:59:17.309 --> 00:59:17.319 align:start position:0%
not impacted by this bill because it is
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
not normal puberty those children need
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
to be taken off of it because there are
 
00:59:24.829 --> 00:59:24.839 align:start position:0%
serious Adverse Events if they stay on
 
00:59:27.549 --> 00:59:27.559 align:start position:0%
puberty blockers to long you have issues
 
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
with height you have other developmental
 
00:59:31.270 --> 00:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
issues if you have these children who
 
00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
begin puberty at four five six years old
 
00:59:35.950 --> 00:59:35.960 align:start position:0%
and they stay on puberty blockers too
 
00:59:37.829 --> 00:59:37.839 align:start position:0%
long we should learn from that
 
00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
experience instead of somehow pretending
 
00:59:43.109 --> 00:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
that this group of people doesn't
 
00:59:45.069 --> 00:59:45.079 align:start position:0%
deserve the same quality of evidence in
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
order to protect their health and their
 
00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:49.839 align:start position:0%
bodies because they do transgender
 
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
people people with gender confusion are
 
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
wonderful people that need to be
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
supported and you need to make sure
 
00:59:58.950 --> 00:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
that people aren't blinding themselves
 
01:00:01.630 --> 01:00:01.640 align:start position:0%
with kindness to the scientific data we
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
need to make sure we're not allowing
 
01:00:05.349 --> 01:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
harms to be
 
01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:12.029 --> 01:00:12.039 align:start position:0%
up could you explain your use of the
 
01:00:14.910 --> 01:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
confusion you can Define it however you
 
01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
want somebody who somebody who is born
 
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
as a girl or born as a boy and they
 
01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:25.799 align:start position:0%
don't feel comfortable in that gender um
 
01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:27.400 align:start position:0%
if they don't feel comfortable as a girl
 
01:00:29.470 --> 01:00:29.480 align:start position:0%
don't feel comfortable as a boy I don't
 
01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
want to Define somebody's personal
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
experience and I don't want to
 
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
medicalize it either until they are old
 
01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
enough to know the
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
consequences everybody has their own
 
01:00:40.589 --> 01:00:40.599 align:start position:0%
interpretation of their life and I use
 
01:00:43.109 --> 01:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
that term to talk about those who aren't
 
01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
born pop out see pink and hair curlers
 
01:00:48.109 --> 01:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
and act like a stereotypical girl I know
 
01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
that's not me that's not most girls but
 
01:00:52.829 --> 01:00:52.839 align:start position:0%
I also I also know everybody has a
 
01:00:55.230 --> 01:00:55.240 align:start position:0%
process and not everybody always sees
 
01:00:57.870 --> 01:00:57.880 align:start position:0%
thems one way or the
 
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
other representative Woods oh thank you
 
01:01:02.349 --> 01:01:02.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
question um you you pointed out some of
 
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
the difficulties in terms of providing
 
01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:11.630 align:start position:0%
the difficulties in terms of providing
this

01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:15.190 --> 01:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
care sorry uh you pointed out the
 
01:01:17.589 --> 01:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
difficulties that some may have uh later
 
01:01:20.430 --> 01:01:20.440 align:start position:0%
in life if they start at this age uh
 
01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
medicine as I'm sure you're well aware
 
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
is not all one way uh can you you also
 
01:01:29.549 --> 01:01:29.559 align:start position:0%
identify uh the harm that would be done
 
01:01:33.309 --> 01:01:33.319 align:start position:0%
by not instituting it at an earlier age
 
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
and the difficulties would that would be
 
01:01:39.549 --> 01:01:39.559 align:start position:0%
uh encountered if it's delayed well
 
01:01:41.549 --> 01:01:41.559 align:start position:0%
thank you if there were not documented
 
01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:43.640 align:start position:0%
evidence of harm from this medical
 
01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
intervention that would be a more
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
meaningful question however there is
 
01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
clear evidence of harm to a physical
 
01:01:52.829 --> 01:01:52.839 align:start position:0%
harm to children um generally when we
 
01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
look at layers of harm we're usually
 
01:01:56.670 --> 01:01:56.680 align:start position:0%
trying to look at somebody's Integrity
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
in their function because in order to
 
01:02:00.789 --> 01:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
function well throughout life you want
 
01:02:02.589 --> 01:02:02.599 align:start position:0%
to maintain as much physical health as
 
01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
possible um I think that it's a it's a
 
01:02:08.309 --> 01:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
strange place to be where instead of
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
looking at the data of actual harms
 
01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
there are theoretical ideas of what
 
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
would happen on the other side I could
 
01:02:16.750 --> 01:02:16.760 align:start position:0%
see a controlled trial it would be one
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
thing if we had a controlled trial where
 
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
people could enroll in this and children
 
01:02:22.109 --> 01:02:22.119 align:start position:0%
could enroll in it I don't think it
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
would be ethical but at least we could
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
have those data but nobody would do that
 
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
because those who believe that this is
 
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
causing harm would see it unethical as
 
01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:32.680 align:start position:0%
randomizing children to puberty blockers
 
01:02:34.670 --> 01:02:34.680 align:start position:0%
and those who believe that it's harm to
 
01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:36.200 align:start position:0%
deny that would believe that it is
 
01:02:38.269 --> 01:02:38.279 align:start position:0%
causing harm in order to withhold those
 
01:02:40.430 --> 01:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
so we'll never see a study of that there
 
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
have been some looks at some of the
 
01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
natural studies and and um samplings but
 
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
we know that level of of evidence is
 
01:02:52.109 --> 01:02:52.119 align:start position:0%
poor follow up um but that's not my
 
01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
question you said we don't want to cause
 
01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
harm and I agreed we don't want to do
 
01:03:00.430 --> 01:03:00.440 align:start position:0%
that but if the study is not done to see
 
01:03:03.549 --> 01:03:03.559 align:start position:0%
how much benefit is derived and a
 
01:03:07.109 --> 01:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
similar study provided then we have only
 
01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
have data on one side and what we need
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
is is there 10 people being harmed for
 
01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
one being helped or is it just the
 
01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
reverse there are people that are being
 
01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
harmed uh but we have 10 people that are
 
01:03:23.069 --> 01:03:23.079 align:start position:0%
being helped and so that was my question
 
01:03:25.829 --> 01:03:25.839 align:start position:0%
which that you just said there is harm
 
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
being done let's not do it but my
 
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
question is do you know how many are
 
01:03:33.470 --> 01:03:33.480 align:start position:0%
being helped um well thank you for the
 
01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
question as a surgeon I understand why
 
01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
you're looking at this this way because
 
01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
when you look at clinical trials and you
 
01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
look at data and Registries for surgery
 
01:03:43.150 --> 01:03:43.160 align:start position:0%
that is something that you look at
 
01:03:44.109 --> 01:03:44.119 align:start position:0%
because you look at the risk of
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
treatment and risk of non-treatment and
 
01:03:47.950 --> 01:03:47.960 align:start position:0%
the way that surgeries don't have to be
 
01:03:49.829 --> 01:03:49.839 align:start position:0%
approved by the FDA so you're looking
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
and trying to get the data and the best
 
01:03:54.109 --> 01:03:54.119 align:start position:0%
that you can do um even the most of the
 
01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
implantables don't need the same rigor
 
01:03:58.829 --> 01:03:58.839 align:start position:0%
approval that drugs need when you're
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
looking at drugs the first thing you
 
01:04:05.029 --> 01:04:05.039 align:start position:0%
look at is is harm from that drug um
 
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:07.720 align:start position:0%
that is the first process in approving a
 
01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
drug is this safe you can't even look at
 
01:04:12.829 --> 01:04:12.839 align:start position:0%
whether it's effective if it's not safe
 
01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:19.240 align:start position:0%
children other
 
01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:26.549 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
you

01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:43.349 --> 01:04:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
Brown again you have three
 
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
minutes good morning my name is Cali
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
Brown and I'm here today to represent
 
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
all transgender Youth and oppos Bill
 
01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
sorry I am a transgender girl and I am
 
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
20 I transitioned when I was 10 years
 
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
old I was placed on puberty blockers at
 
01:05:08.069 --> 01:05:08.079 align:start position:0%
the age of 12 to prevent male puberty
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
and I started taking estrogen at the age
 
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
of 14 me receiving hormone blockers in
 
01:05:15.630 --> 01:05:15.640 align:start position:0%
therapy was not even a question I needed
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
this to live my life authentically I
 
01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:19.240 align:start position:0%
needed these things in order to feel
 
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
complete and to feel like myself as far
 
01:05:23.589 --> 01:05:23.599 align:start position:0%
as I've been told the Purity blockers
 
01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
are known to be 100% reversible
 
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
why are we going to punish the
 
01:05:30.309 --> 01:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
transgender youth below me to suffer and
 
01:05:33.069 --> 01:05:33.079 align:start position:0%
live their life in the wrong body
 
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
unhappy according to the Trevor Project
 
01:05:39.069 --> 01:05:39.079 align:start position:0%
in 2022 39% of transgender youth in New
 
01:05:40.829 --> 01:05:40.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have seriously considered
 
01:05:43.710 --> 01:05:43.720 align:start position:0%
suicide 10% have actually attempted
 
01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
suicide by following through with this
 
01:05:47.309 --> 01:05:47.319 align:start position:0%
bill you are going to make these numbers
 
01:05:49.829 --> 01:05:49.839 align:start position:0%
raise drastically lack of hormone
 
01:05:51.549 --> 01:05:51.559 align:start position:0%
therapy and Purity blockers will cause
 
01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
feelings of displacement and uncomfort
 
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
which could then lead to the thoughts of
 
01:05:57.910 --> 01:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
suicide the gender affirming care is not
 
01:06:00.269 --> 01:06:00.279 align:start position:0%
hurting us in any way shape or form it's
 
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
just simply growing us into the person
 
01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
we truly are inside to me that's all
 
01:06:07.069 --> 01:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
that matters if we wait till we're 18
 
01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
the damage is already done in my
 
01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
situation my voice would be deep and I'd
 
01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
have a more masculine body shape thank
 
01:06:14.829 --> 01:06:14.839 align:start position:0%
you for giving me the opportunity to
 
01:06:17.549 --> 01:06:17.559 align:start position:0%
speak on behalf of transgender youth
 
01:06:20.829 --> 01:06:20.839 align:start position:0%
thank you any
 
01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank
 
01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
sure okay uh also signed up to speak is
 
01:06:45.549 --> 01:06:45.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:48.069 --> 01:06:48.079 align:start position:0%
O'Brien again representative you have uh
 
01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:49.799 align:start position:0%
you asked for five minutes but three
 
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
minutes please got
 
01:06:55.269 --> 01:06:55.279 align:start position:0%
it um thank you for this opportunity to
 
01:06:55.279 --> 01:06:57.349 align:start position:0%
it um thank you for this opportunity to
speak

01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
speak
 
01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
uh I think there's a lot of lack of
 
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
knowledge on this issue I uh through
 
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
Word of Mouth it seems that I uh am a
 
01:07:10.269 --> 01:07:10.279 align:start position:0%
sympathetic figure to people who have
 
01:07:12.109 --> 01:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
who have detransitioned and I've gotten
 
01:07:15.390 --> 01:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
some calls I recently spoke to a
 
01:07:18.589 --> 01:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
woman um originally from the western
 
01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
part of the state and she now lives in a
 
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
in a city because she can't drive and
 
01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
she detransitioned and and she thinks
 
01:07:29.269 --> 01:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
that it was pushed on her the
 
01:07:32.269 --> 01:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
transitioning to male because it would
 
01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
be a quick fix for her other mental
 
01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
health issues and she's angry and wants
 
01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
to uh wants more medical help with
 
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
detransitioning and finds that to be
 
01:07:43.870 --> 01:07:43.880 align:start position:0%
difficult to find that her the doctors
 
01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
that helped her transition now will not
 
01:07:50.789 --> 01:07:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
that I think that um that this is a sort
 
01:07:56.150 --> 01:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
of body
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
dysmorphia that would not be dissimilar
 
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
to someone who went to their doctor and
 
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
said I need diet pills but that person
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
was anorexic I think it would be immoral
 
01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
for the doctor to give them diet pills
 
01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
and what if that if someone came to
 
01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:13.240 align:start position:0%
their doctor and said I'm not the
 
01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
correct race that I should be and I need
 
01:08:17.789 --> 01:08:17.799 align:start position:0%
some kind of medical intervention to be
 
01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
A different race no we would stop and
 
01:08:22.189 --> 01:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
and help them to accept themselves as
 
01:08:22.199 --> 01:08:22.829 align:start position:0%
and help them to accept themselves as
they

01:08:22.829 --> 01:08:22.839 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
are telling children that they were born
 
01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
in the wrong body is not help in the in
 
01:08:30.749 --> 01:08:30.759 align:start position:0%
the wrong body is not helpful I don't
 
01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
think it it gives the right message we
 
01:08:36.269 --> 01:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
ask them to accept themselves in other
 
01:08:38.590 --> 01:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
circumstances but this why is this an
 
01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
exception and it should not
 
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
be I speak about all of this with some
 
01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
other Insight my late sister-in-law was
 
01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:49.719 align:start position:0%
my very best friend she helped me rais
 
01:08:52.269 --> 01:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
my children she was much older than me
 
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
and she recently passed away from
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
gastrointestin uh intestinal cancer
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
answer not a smoker ran in the
 
01:09:01.870 --> 01:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
family She's a Lesbian she called
 
01:09:03.870 --> 01:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
herself a radical separatist lesbian and
 
01:09:05.990 --> 01:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
we both were tomboys I was in a
 
01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
male-dominated field and usually the
 
01:09:09.390 --> 01:09:09.400 align:start position:0%
only woman in a machine shop where I
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
worked or a musical instrument
 
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
making Martha used to tell me all the
 
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
time that she was glad that she did not
 
01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
live nowadays because that she would
 
01:09:25.110 --> 01:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
have been pushed to become male and she
 
01:09:27.669 --> 01:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
said she would have fallen for it and
 
01:09:32.349 --> 01:09:32.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
that one of the last things that I was
 
01:09:36.669 --> 01:09:36.679 align:start position:0%
able to buy for her when she was very
 
01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
ill was a t-shirt she found out about
 
01:09:40.030 --> 01:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
this t-shirt you could get from an
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
organization called gaze against
 
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
groomers I and and she was so happy
 
01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:45.759 align:start position:0%
about this t-shirt that said leave the
 
01:09:48.030 --> 01:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
kids alone she wanted me to buy it for
 
01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:49.560 align:start position:0%
her and I
 
01:09:52.030 --> 01:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
did she got so sick she couldn't raise
 
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
her arms anymore and she couldn't wear
 
01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
it you have 15 seconds okay while I'm
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
here to to spread to send that message
 
01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
as well that that is uh she went through
 
01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
puberty it was very awkward it is very
 
01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
awkward it's medical uh definitions of
 
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
what is a normal puberty are included in
 
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
this bill puberty is not normal or or
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
it's awkward for everyone and I'll take
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions
 
01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:20.709 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions
representative

01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:23.709 --> 01:10:23.719 align:start position:0%
Weber you stated that we should help
 
01:10:26.830 --> 01:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
children accept themselves as they are
 
01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
yes how does this help the child who
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
starts unaccountably for a parent at age
 
01:10:38.430 --> 01:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
three telling that parent that they are
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
not in their right
 
01:10:44.669 --> 01:10:44.679 align:start position:0%
body I would go I would go back to the
 
01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:46.360 align:start position:0%
examples I gave if you had a child who
 
01:10:49.550 --> 01:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
told you that they were fat yet you knew
 
01:10:51.669 --> 01:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
that you know you had medical help with
 
01:10:53.229 --> 01:10:53.239 align:start position:0%
determining that your child was not
 
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
overweight and your child kept telling
 
01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
you they were fat would you give them
 
01:10:58.110 --> 01:10:58.120 align:start position:0%
diet pills if they were underweight
 
01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:58.830 align:start position:0%
diet pills if they were underweight
would

01:10:58.830 --> 01:10:58.840 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
you change their race somehow using face
 
01:11:04.590 --> 01:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
creams or pills or or things like that
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't do that no parent would do
 
01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
that we would say you are just fine the
 
01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
way you were born you are just fine the
 
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
race that you were born you are just
 
01:11:15.630 --> 01:11:15.640 align:start position:0%
fine the body weight that you are we
 
01:11:18.030 --> 01:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we wouldn't do things like that
 
01:11:20.830 --> 01:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
that would be cruel and to to make a
 
01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
decision for a child and when they are
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
way too young to make that decision they
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
don't have the intellectual capability
 
01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
to make that decision we don't tell them
 
01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
we don't make decisions for them that
 
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
would affect their fertility and their
 
01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
sexual function we don't make decisions
 
01:11:39.149 --> 01:11:39.159 align:start position:0%
that at the age of 3 four 5 6 7 8 9 10
 
01:11:40.669 --> 01:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
that they'll never have an orgasm that
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
they'll never have children we don't
 
01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:57.950 --> 01:11:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Courtney Reid
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire again you have three
 
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
minutes hi good morning members of the
 
01:12:16.270 --> 01:12:16.280 align:start position:0%
committee thank you so much for taking
 
01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:18.280 align:start position:0%
the time to hear my testimony for the
 
01:12:20.229 --> 01:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
record my name is Courtney Reid I serve
 
01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
as policy Advocate with the ACLU of New
 
01:12:25.870 --> 01:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm here to oppose
 
01:12:27.470 --> 01:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
377 uh I will try to keep my remarks
 
01:12:31.229 --> 01:12:31.239 align:start position:0%
brief as we have a lot of speakers to
 
01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
get through today so to get to the
 
01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:36.320 align:start position:0%
bottom line HB
 
01:12:39.310 --> 01:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
377 would directly harm transgender
 
01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
youth by barring access to critical
 
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
Medical Care in a discriminatory fashion
 
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
the consequences of which would be
 
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
devastating there are youth in this
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
state right now that are currently
 
01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
benefiting from this care and this
 
01:12:55.870 --> 01:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
legislation would disrupt thoughtful
 
01:12:58.390 --> 01:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
decisions that families and Physicians
 
01:13:01.149 --> 01:13:01.159 align:start position:0%
have made together to support these
 
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
adolescents HB 377 would deprive
 
01:13:06.669 --> 01:13:06.679 align:start position:0%
transgender Youth and their families of
 
01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
the ability to make critical medical
 
01:13:11.229 --> 01:13:11.239 align:start position:0%
decisions or even to receive a referral
 
01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
to seek this care outside of the
 
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
state all of which is antithetical to
 
01:13:19.870 --> 01:13:19.880 align:start position:0%
our countries and our states values of
 
01:13:22.030 --> 01:13:22.040 align:start position:0%
bodily autonomy and the right to make
 
01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
private medical decisions and so this
 
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
bill seeks to ban access to Medical Care
 
01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
however this Medical Care is
 
01:13:32.709 --> 01:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
wellestablished it follows standards
 
01:13:34.870 --> 01:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
that are set forth by maor Major Medical
 
01:13:37.550 --> 01:13:37.560 align:start position:0%
organizations including W paath the
 
01:13:39.030 --> 01:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
world professional association for
 
01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
transgender Health the American Academy
 
01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
of Pediatrics and the endocrine Society
 
01:13:46.669 --> 01:13:46.679 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care has been supported
 
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
by Decades of research and is endorsed
 
01:13:51.629 --> 01:13:51.639 align:start position:0%
by every Major Medical Association so
 
01:13:54.189 --> 01:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
the reality is that denying this care
 
01:13:56.990 --> 01:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
altogether is far more harmful than the
 
01:13:58.950 --> 01:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
possibility of regret which remains
 
01:14:01.629 --> 01:14:01.639 align:start position:0%
exceedingly rare the government should
 
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
not be dictating personal medical
 
01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
decisions yet this bill does just that
 
01:14:09.470 --> 01:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
by imposing a categorical ban on access
 
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
to this care exclusively for transgender
 
01:14:13.350 --> 01:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
youth while permitting those same
 
01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
treatments for their cisgender peers and
 
01:14:18.750 --> 01:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
so we've seen similar laws blocked by
 
01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
the courts when they're faced uh when
 
01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
they're challenged and with ongoing
 
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
Federal discussions in court cases such
 
01:14:27.310 --> 01:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
as USV scetti at the Supreme Court this
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
beill bill feels unnecessary at this
 
01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
time and so if safety and regret are
 
01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
really at the Forefront of concern for
 
01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:36.070 align:start position:0%
really at the Forefront of concern for
this

01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:36.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
body it would make more sense for the
 
01:14:40.750 --> 01:14:40.760 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill to advocate for
 
01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
research clearer guidelines rather than
 
01:14:45.990 --> 01:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
enacting harmful restrictions that
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
disregard where the research is at and
 
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
dictating how individuals should be
 
01:14:52.990 --> 01:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
living their lives with that in mind I
 
01:14:56.430 --> 01:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
urge you to oppose hb3 77 and protect
 
01:14:58.430 --> 01:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
the rights and well-being of transgender
 
01:15:00.669 --> 01:15:00.679 align:start position:0%
Youth and their families with that I'm
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
 
01:15:06.750 --> 01:15:06.760 align:start position:0%
any questions yes representative
 
01:15:09.390 --> 01:15:09.400 align:start position:0%
delus thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:15:12.149 --> 01:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um the New
 
01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Medical experts have assured
 
01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
us that gender affirming uh care is safe
 
01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:19.189 align:start position:0%
us that gender affirming uh care is safe
and

01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:15:21.629 --> 01:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
evidence-based but many European health
 
01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
agencies have concluded that there are
 
01:15:27.229 --> 01:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
experim that the these are experimental
 
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
treatments for example after a system uh
 
01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
systematic review the council for
 
01:15:35.310 --> 01:15:35.320 align:start position:0%
choices for health in Finland determined
 
01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
that in light of available evidence
 
01:15:40.550 --> 01:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
gender reassignment for minors is an
 
01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:42.110 align:start position:0%
gender reassignment for minors is an
experimental

01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
experimental
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
practice um and England's cast review
 
01:15:47.709 --> 01:15:47.719 align:start position:0%
concluded that there is not a reliable
 
01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
evidence base upon which to make
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
clinical decisions or for children and
 
01:15:54.629 --> 01:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
their families to make informed choices
 
01:15:57.149 --> 01:15:57.159 align:start position:0%
why have you reached such different
 
01:16:00.430 --> 01:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
conclusions how did you come to those
 
01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
conclusions thank you for your question
 
01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:06.280 align:start position:0%
representative of of course the debate
 
01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
around the guidelines and standards of
 
01:16:11.629 --> 01:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
care uh in in Europe and in the United
 
01:16:13.629 --> 01:16:13.639 align:start position:0%
States is something that's constantly
 
01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
evolving and I think the ultimate uh
 
01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
solution to that is not to completely
 
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
prohibit care which has again been
 
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
supported by every Major Medical associ
 
01:16:28.189 --> 01:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
ation but to instead follow and
 
01:16:31.390 --> 01:16:31.400 align:start position:0%
establish the this experimental research
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh and to have further studies to better
 
01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
understand this care I would like to see
 
01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
and I think other Advocates would like
 
01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
to see evidence that suggest it is
 
01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
better to prohibit this care for
 
01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
individuals experiencing gender
 
01:16:50.830 --> 01:16:50.840 align:start position:0%
dysphoria rather than to uh establish
 
01:16:52.629 --> 01:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
more research to make sure that the
 
01:16:55.550 --> 01:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
standards of care are grounded in clear
 
01:16:57.430 --> 01:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
and compelling
 
01:17:01.870 --> 01:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:04.110 --> 01:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you and thank you for taking
 
01:17:07.350 --> 01:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
my question we've heard about treatment
 
01:17:11.149 --> 01:17:11.159 align:start position:0%
and gender affirming care for children
 
01:17:13.470 --> 01:17:13.480 align:start position:0%
who are very very young with the
 
01:17:16.669 --> 01:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
implication that very very young
 
01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
children are receiving the kinds of
 
01:17:21.189 --> 01:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
drugs that we are talking about here
 
01:17:23.669 --> 01:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that the treatment for a
 
01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
younger child
 
01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:29.159 align:start position:0%
and perhaps well into puberty may be as
 
01:17:32.350 --> 01:17:32.360 align:start position:0%
simple as allowing that child to wear
 
01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
the clothing that they choose use the
 
01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
name that they choose and possibly even
 
01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
the pronouns that they choose without
 
01:17:43.189 --> 01:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
any kind
 
01:17:43.199 --> 01:17:45.310 align:start position:0%
any kind
of

01:17:45.310 --> 01:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
whatsoever thank you for your question
 
01:17:53.790 --> 01:17:53.800 align:start position:0%
representative certainly uh what you're
 
01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
describing social affirmation is an
 
01:17:58.189 --> 01:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
important component of care uh I can't
 
01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
speak to the specific ages and
 
01:18:03.229 --> 01:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
guidelines within W path but I do want
 
01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:05.560 align:start position:0%
to express that all of those standards
 
01:18:08.709 --> 01:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
are evidence-backed thank you
 
01:18:09.790 --> 01:18:09.800 align:start position:0%
representative woods and then
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
representative Castle ring thank excuse
 
01:18:14.110 --> 01:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
me thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
01:18:17.790 --> 01:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
question um in
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
um under prohibitions for health care in
 
01:18:26.229 --> 01:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
the um U proposed uh uh
 
01:18:30.510 --> 01:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
line 177 page one uh it says um no
 
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
person shall engage in counseling make a
 
01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
referral so on and so forth um how From
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
aclu's perspective does counseling then
 
01:18:45.390 --> 01:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
uh preclude someone who has
 
01:18:51.070 --> 01:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
questions about um their dysphoria um
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
does this preclude them from does it
 
01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
does that preclude the them from even
 
01:18:57.550 --> 01:18:57.560 align:start position:0%
discussing representative Woods can you
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
move your mic still a little closer
 
01:19:02.189 --> 01:19:02.199 align:start position:0%
please does that preclude does this
 
01:19:05.070 --> 01:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
preclude them from even discussing uh
 
01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
with um one of their patients um the
 
01:19:11.229 --> 01:19:11.239 align:start position:0%
question of their
 
01:19:13.629 --> 01:19:13.639 align:start position:0%
dysphoria thank you for your question
 
01:19:17.189 --> 01:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
representative uh I certainly see
 
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
concerns about uh this bill being overly
 
01:19:23.910 --> 01:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
broad as the definitions uh include
 
01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
person to be any individual not just a
 
01:19:29.149 --> 01:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
healthare provider or a clinician uh I
 
01:19:31.390 --> 01:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
think the line that you site in the bill
 
01:19:33.430 --> 01:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
also raises significant First Amendment
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
concerns as it prohibits referrals uh
 
01:19:37.910 --> 01:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
for seeking State out of care where it
 
01:19:40.350 --> 01:19:40.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
legal other questions representative
 
01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:44.910 align:start position:0%
legal other questions representative
Castle

01:19:44.910 --> 01:19:44.920 align:start position:0%
Castle
 
01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
ring thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:19:48.990 --> 01:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so is it the
 
01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
stance of the ACLU that uh the use of
 
01:19:53.149 --> 01:19:53.159 align:start position:0%
puberty blockers and children are safe
 
01:19:55.550 --> 01:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
and effective
 
01:19:57.189 --> 01:19:57.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question
 
01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
representative the ACLU uh ultimately
 
01:20:02.510 --> 01:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
has a position that it is not the place
 
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
of the legislature to interfere with the
 
01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
physician patient relationship and that
 
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
doing so in the way that this bill does
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
is discriminatory based on sex follow up
 
01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
thank you so the ACLU takes no stance on
 
01:20:18.910 --> 01:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
the efficacy or safe and effectiveness
 
01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
of puberty blockers and children thank
 
01:20:23.470 --> 01:20:23.480 align:start position:0%
you for your question representative uh
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
I want to get back to you and site the
 
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
exact arguments that come from USV
 
01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
scetti which the ACLU argued but the
 
01:20:33.790 --> 01:20:33.800 align:start position:0%
ACLU ultimately supports uh the
 
01:20:36.110 --> 01:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
allowance of these critical medications
 
01:20:37.590 --> 01:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
when medically necessary or deemed
 
01:20:39.070 --> 01:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
medically necessary by physicians to
 
01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
treat gender dysphoria follow could you
 
01:20:44.510 --> 01:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
define medically necessary for
 
01:20:46.350 --> 01:20:46.360 align:start position:0%
me thank you for your question
 
01:20:48.430 --> 01:20:48.440 align:start position:0%
representative I think that uh probably
 
01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
a healthcare provider would give a
 
01:20:51.870 --> 01:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
better answer than me coming from the
 
01:20:55.030 --> 01:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
policy advocacy space but uh when
 
01:20:58.510 --> 01:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
medically necessary this means deemed as
 
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
needed to treat gender dysphoria or to
 
01:21:03.229 --> 01:21:03.239 align:start position:0%
have significant health benefits for the
 
01:21:05.189 --> 01:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
mental health and well-being of a
 
01:21:05.199 --> 01:21:07.910 align:start position:0%
mental health and well-being of a
transgender

01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:10.189 --> 01:21:10.199 align:start position:0%
adolescent representative
 
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
Weber does the ACLU have a policy on the
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
rights of parents to make
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
medically appropriate decisions for
 
01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:23.270 align:start position:0%
medically appropriate decisions for
their

01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:21:26.189 --> 01:21:26.199 align:start position:0%
children thank you representative Weber
 
01:21:28.669 --> 01:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
uh certainly this bill is concerning and
 
01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
how it would interfere with a patient
 
01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
physician relationship understanding
 
01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
that parents are a critical uh component
 
01:21:38.709 --> 01:21:38.719 align:start position:0%
of making these important decisions and
 
01:21:40.870 --> 01:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you will hear uh from other
 
01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
speakers today about the role of parents
 
01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
in uh dictating these Healthcare
 
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
decisions other
 
01:21:52.229 --> 01:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank

testifying today to express my strong
 
01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
support of H bill
 
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
377 um this is necessary in ensuring
 
01:22:30.910 --> 01:22:30.920 align:start position:0%
that young adults or young individuals
 
01:22:32.590 --> 01:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
are protected from making life altering
 
01:22:35.390 --> 01:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
medical decisions before they reach full
 
01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
maturity medical interventions such as
 
01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
puberty blockers and cross- seex
 
01:22:41.550 --> 01:22:41.560 align:start position:0%
hormones have significant and often
 
01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
irreversible effects on a child's
 
01:22:46.390 --> 01:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
development including impacts on
 
01:22:48.950 --> 01:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
fertility bone density and long-term
 
01:22:52.229 --> 01:22:52.239 align:start position:0%
mental health while proponents argue
 
01:22:54.550 --> 01:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
that these treatments alleviate distress
 
01:22:56.590 --> 01:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
growing evidence suggests that many
 
01:22:59.390 --> 01:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
minors later regret undergoing such
 
01:23:01.110 --> 01:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
interventions given the fact that
 
01:23:02.790 --> 01:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
adolescent brain development continues
 
01:23:05.189 --> 01:23:05.199 align:start position:0%
until the mid 20s it is essential that
 
01:23:07.709 --> 01:23:07.719 align:start position:0%
we a on the side of caution when it
 
01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
comes to medical decisions that can have
 
01:23:10.669 --> 01:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
life lifelong
 
01:23:12.910 --> 01:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
consequences this bill does not prevent
 
01:23:15.070 --> 01:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
anyone from accessing these treatments
 
01:23:17.189 --> 01:23:17.199 align:start position:0%
once they reach adulthood and can make
 
01:23:19.709 --> 01:23:19.719 align:start position:0%
fully informed decisions rather it
 
01:23:21.430 --> 01:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
ensures that minors are not subjected to
 
01:23:23.550 --> 01:23:23.560 align:start position:0%
medical procedures that they may later
 
01:23:25.950 --> 01:23:25.960 align:start position:0%
regret before they are old enough to
 
01:23:28.270 --> 01:23:28.280 align:start position:0%
fully comprehend the long-term effects
 
01:23:29.990 --> 01:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
it also protects medical professionals
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
from pressure to administer treatments
 
01:23:33.629 --> 01:23:33.639 align:start position:0%
that may not be in the best long-term
 
01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
interest of their young
 
01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
patients additionally this bill aligns
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
with existing principles and medical
 
01:23:43.870 --> 01:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
ethics that prioritize Do no harm many
 
01:23:45.870 --> 01:23:45.880 align:start position:0%
European countries including Sweden
 
01:23:47.629 --> 01:23:47.639 align:start position:0%
Finland and the United Kingdom have
 
01:23:49.470 --> 01:23:49.480 align:start position:0%
moved a significantly restrict medical
 
01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
transitions for minors due to concerns
 
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
about long-term harm and the lack of
 
01:23:55.870 --> 01:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
conclusive evidence supporting their
 
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
safety and Effectiveness New Hampshire
 
01:24:00.149 --> 01:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
should follow their lead by implementing
 
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
re reasonable safeguards to protect our
 
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
vulnerable children for these re for
 
01:24:07.550 --> 01:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
these reasons I strongly urge the
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
committee to support 377 and move it
 
01:24:12.709 --> 01:24:12.719 align:start position:0%
forward in the legislative process thank
 
01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
you for your time and for your
 
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
commitment to protecting the well-being
 
01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:17.120 align:start position:0%

representative
 
01:24:25.390 --> 01:24:25.400 align:start position:0%
Weber do you have any hard numbers about
 
01:24:31.390 --> 01:24:31.400 align:start position:0%
the regret rate from uh youth who have
 
01:24:34.830 --> 01:24:34.840 align:start position:0%
received these treatments as opposed to
 
01:24:37.390 --> 01:24:37.400 align:start position:0%
youth who have received treatment for
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
other life-altering
 
01:24:41.550 --> 01:24:41.560 align:start position:0%
conditions not in front of me and thank
 
01:24:42.990 --> 01:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative

Weber not in front of me um I do have

those numbers and I can email them over

to you if you would
 
01:24:51.390 --> 01:24:51.400 align:start position:0%
like I will say that the numbers
 
01:24:54.510 --> 01:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
obviously are not hard because a lot lot
 
01:24:56.510 --> 01:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
of the children
 
01:24:58.950 --> 01:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
um we don't have conclusive numbers a
 
01:25:03.510 --> 01:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
it other questions
 
01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
followup is it possible that they're not
 
01:25:11.709 --> 01:25:11.719 align:start position:0%
expressing regret because they don't
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
regret having had the
 
01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:16.400 align:start position:0%
treatment um I couldn't speak for them I
 
01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
know that I have spoken with several
 
01:25:20.830 --> 01:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
families that their children do regret
 
01:25:23.950 --> 01:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
it um and they're embarrassed um and
 
01:25:26.750 --> 01:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
they would never come forward
 
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
publicly representative TZ quick
 
01:25:32.750 --> 01:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you uh Mr chairman thank
 
01:25:34.350 --> 01:25:34.360 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um how many
 
01:25:36.189 --> 01:25:36.199 align:start position:0%
families have you spoken to who are
 
01:25:38.030 --> 01:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
thrilled with their decision or happy
 
01:25:39.790 --> 01:25:39.800 align:start position:0%
with the outcomes of their medical
 
01:25:41.950 --> 01:25:41.960 align:start position:0%
procedure unfortunately I've not spoken
 
01:25:45.310 --> 01:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
to one family that is Happy um with
 
01:25:48.030 --> 01:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
providing that I will say that obviously
 
01:25:50.830 --> 01:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
I've only spoken to um families within
 
01:25:53.550 --> 01:25:53.560 align:start position:0%
my district so that could be different
 
01:25:55.910 --> 01:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
but person have not spoken to
 
01:25:58.870 --> 01:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
any thank you for the question other
 
01:26:01.709 --> 01:26:01.719 align:start position:0%
questions represent yes representative
 
01:26:03.990 --> 01:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman um and thank
 
01:26:05.790 --> 01:26:05.800 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
01:26:09.149 --> 01:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
um several uh folks have now testified
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
that we know that this is providing harm
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
while also acknowledging that there
 
01:26:15.229 --> 01:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
hasn't been a proper blind study uh or
 
01:26:17.189 --> 01:26:17.199 align:start position:0%
properly structured study to confirm
 
01:26:19.629 --> 01:26:19.639 align:start position:0%
that so how are you generating the idea
 
01:26:20.990 --> 01:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
that we know that this is bad without
 
01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
the data to support it
 
01:26:26.590 --> 01:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
I'm personally speaking to families that
 
01:26:28.270 --> 01:26:28.280 align:start position:0%
their children have gone through it
 
01:26:30.669 --> 01:26:30.679 align:start position:0%
these are families living this um
 
01:26:33.550 --> 01:26:33.560 align:start position:0%
Nightmare and they thought they were
 
01:26:36.430 --> 01:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
providing the best medical care for
 
01:26:38.189 --> 01:26:38.199 align:start position:0%
their child at the time and now years
 
01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
later they're realizing that it was an
 
01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
awful mistake and it can't be
 
01:26:45.229 --> 01:26:45.239 align:start position:0%
reversed thank you for the
 
01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:47.679 align:start position:0%

also signed up to speak is Rosie emrich
 
01:26:59.119 --> 01:27:09.310 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is Rosie emrich

01:27:09.310 --> 01:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:12.310 --> 01:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
hookit uh Dear honorable members of the
 
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
committee I am here today and conquered
 
01:27:16.590 --> 01:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
for the third
 
01:27:19.229 --> 01:27:19.239 align:start position:0%
week this is the third week I've had to
 
01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
show up here and sit in front of people
 
01:27:24.590 --> 01:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
just like you and listen to them say
 
01:27:26.189 --> 01:27:26.199 align:start position:0%
horrible things there are people behind
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
me snickering and laughing and
 
01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
talking this is painful I am tired I am
 
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:46.590 --> 01:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
anymore I spent a lot of time this
 
01:27:48.149 --> 01:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
weekend thinking about my
 
01:27:50.950 --> 01:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
testimony and I'm not entirely confident
 
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
that what I say is going to land on some
 
01:27:58.189 --> 01:27:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:00.270 --> 01:28:00.280 align:start position:0%
but my child's journey is theirs and
 
01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
theirs alone and con contrary to the
 
01:28:04.950 --> 01:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
testimony that I read online and some of
 
01:28:07.390 --> 01:28:07.400 align:start position:0%
the things that I've heard today I did
 
01:28:10.030 --> 01:28:10.040 align:start position:0%
not force my child into
 
01:28:13.990 --> 01:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
this why would I why would I subject my
 
01:28:16.149 --> 01:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
child to
 
01:28:18.669 --> 01:28:18.679 align:start position:0%
this they didn't choose this I didn't
 
01:28:20.550 --> 01:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
choose this nobody else compelled or
 
01:28:23.550 --> 01:28:23.560 align:start position:0%
influence them into this what I did was
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
listen and pay
 
01:28:27.910 --> 01:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
attention I listened to what they
 
01:28:29.310 --> 01:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
started telling me from the time they
 
01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
first started speaking sentences and I
 
01:28:34.270 --> 01:28:34.280 align:start position:0%
continue to listen every day and if they
 
01:28:36.709 --> 01:28:36.719 align:start position:0%
said Mom I was wrong I want to go back I
 
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
would be the first one to affirm that
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
too I love my children with everything
 
01:28:42.239 --> 01:28:43.350 align:start position:0%
too I love my children with everything
in

01:28:43.350 --> 01:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:28:46.229 --> 01:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
me and it is me and my child in
 
01:28:48.070 --> 01:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
collaboration with their trained medical
 
01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
providers with years of professional
 
01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
experience who should be making these
 
01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:53.030 align:start position:0%
experience who should be making these
medical

01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
medical
 
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
decisions so I'm here today even though
 
01:28:57.709 --> 01:28:57.719 align:start position:0%
it feels like it's not accomplishing
 
01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
anything and I don't think some of you
 
01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
will hear it I'm here today because I'm
 
01:29:04.590 --> 01:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
doing everything in my power to build my
 
01:29:06.430 --> 01:29:06.440 align:start position:0%
child a world where they know I will
 
01:29:09.109 --> 01:29:09.119 align:start position:0%
always fight for them even if I'm
 
01:29:10.990 --> 01:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
bailing out the entire ocean from a
 
01:29:13.430 --> 01:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
sinking ship with a teaspoon I will
 
01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
always listen and love them when they
 
01:29:17.550 --> 01:29:17.560 align:start position:0%
tell me who they are and I will fight
 
01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:18.750 align:start position:0%
tell me who they are and I will fight
for

01:29:18.750 --> 01:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
them despite all of this hardship right

comfortable in our skins more confident
 
01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
in the ways in which we don't meet the
 
01:29:31.709 --> 01:29:31.719 align:start position:0%
impossible standards of feminity or
 
01:29:34.270 --> 01:29:34.280 align:start position:0%
mascul masculinity we're more
 
01:29:36.430 --> 01:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
understanding and compassionate we're
 
01:29:39.070 --> 01:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
more willing to seek to understand we
 
01:29:41.070 --> 01:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
are fiercer and more likely to stand
 
01:29:43.229 --> 01:29:43.239 align:start position:0%
with those being marginalized and mostly
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%

bill so my name is Jennifer I'm from
 
01:31:10.390 --> 01:31:10.400 align:start position:0%
nashille New Hampshire I'm a mother of
 
01:31:13.149 --> 01:31:13.159 align:start position:0%
three children my youngest is a trans
 
01:31:15.629 --> 01:31:15.639 align:start position:0%
male I've always been supportive of my
 
01:31:17.550 --> 01:31:17.560 align:start position:0%
children no matter what they have needed
 
01:31:20.070 --> 01:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
from me I have created an environment in
 
01:31:22.229 --> 01:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
my home where my children can be open
 
01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
and honest with who they are when my son
 
01:31:27.470 --> 01:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
was nine he told me that he was actually
 
01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:28.470 align:start position:0%
was nine he told me that he was actually
a

01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:31:32.430 --> 01:31:32.440 align:start position:0%
boy he had been born female he socially
 
01:31:35.790 --> 01:31:35.800 align:start position:0%
transitioned to a
 
01:31:38.669 --> 01:31:38.679 align:start position:0%
male he always hated school but he began
 
01:31:40.990 --> 01:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
to engage and find friends with his
 
01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
haircut and wardrobe changed he finally
 
01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
seemed comfortable in his own skin
 
01:31:48.149 --> 01:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
gender affirming Care at that time was
 
01:31:51.229 --> 01:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
counseling it was support it was using
 
01:31:54.070 --> 01:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
his correct pronouns and it was allow
 
01:31:57.510 --> 01:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
him to be who he was as a mother I did
 
01:31:59.350 --> 01:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
have to grieve the loss of my daughter
 
01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
but I also celebrated that I gained a
 
01:32:03.990 --> 01:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
son over the next four years I watched
 
01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:06.560 align:start position:0%
my son's journey of Discovery he is very
 
01:32:08.590 --> 01:32:08.600 align:start position:0%
confident and aware of who he is he
 
01:32:11.629 --> 01:32:11.639 align:start position:0%
actually asked me to take him here today
 
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
he has a unique situation because he has
 
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
Turner syndrome and his body does not
 
01:32:18.830 --> 01:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
produce sex hormones we did not have to
 
01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
pursue puberty blockers because he
 
01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
didn't need them but we are in a unique
 
01:32:26.550 --> 01:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
situation where we don't have the time
 
01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
to wait until he's 18 to start sex
 
01:32:31.149 --> 01:32:31.159 align:start position:0%
hormones he's not going through puberty
 
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
without them he's had months years of
 
01:32:36.629 --> 01:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
counseling he's well-rounded he's a
 
01:32:39.669 --> 01:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
happy kid this bill seeks to destroy my
 
01:32:42.430 --> 01:32:42.440 align:start position:0%
family values my role as a mother to
 
01:32:44.910 --> 01:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
support my child and it inappropriate
 
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
inappropriately inserts the government
 
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
into my child's
 
01:32:51.390 --> 01:32:51.400 align:start position:0%
Healthcare his body his medications his
 
01:32:53.189 --> 01:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
sense of self are not things to be
 
01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
regulated or banned I know with 100%
 
01:32:58.669 --> 01:32:58.679 align:start position:0%
certainty that he is a boy and that
 
01:33:00.669 --> 01:33:00.679 align:start position:0%
having secondary male characteristics
 
01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:02.719 align:start position:0%
are the right choice for him I didn't
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
choose it it's not been an easy path
 
01:33:07.830 --> 01:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
like the other mom said we listen to our
 
01:33:11.550 --> 01:33:11.560 align:start position:0%
kids he knows he tells me just as my
 
01:33:13.790 --> 01:33:13.800 align:start position:0%
other kids have chose to go down path
 
01:33:15.950 --> 01:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
that they've wanted to go down and I've
 
01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
supported them I know that he's done his
 
01:33:21.310 --> 01:33:21.320 align:start position:0%
research I know we don't enter into
 
01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
situations lightly we have an
 
01:33:24.590 --> 01:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
endrocrinologist we have a trained
 
01:33:27.109 --> 01:33:27.119 align:start position:0%
medical team from Mass General people
 
01:33:28.910 --> 01:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
come from all over the country to go to
 
01:33:31.229 --> 01:33:31.239 align:start position:0%
Mass General I trust the team that we
 
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
have I never thought I'd have to sit
 
01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
here in front of the government in New
 
01:33:39.149 --> 01:33:39.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to remind you that my child's
 
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
health care is my child's health care
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
and nobody in the government has any
 
01:33:46.390 --> 01:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
right to legislate that I've been
 
01:33:49.830 --> 01:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
sitting back here listening to hateful
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
people who are snickering at people's
 
01:33:55.390 --> 01:33:55.400 align:start position:0%
testimony who are rude and respectful my
 
01:33:57.350 --> 01:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
son is an amazing person who's here
 
01:33:59.750 --> 01:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
today to stand up for our family and
 
01:34:02.229 --> 01:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
what we believe in and you 15 thank you
 
01:34:03.510 --> 01:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
and there's people that don't even have
 
01:34:06.109 --> 01:34:06.119 align:start position:0%
the decency to even open their ears to
 
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
listen so I please hope that you can
 
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
son hello my name is Luke Bo and I am a
 
01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
trans boy from nashaa New Hampshire and
 
01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
I oppose this bill I'm 13 years old
 
01:34:27.669 --> 01:34:27.679 align:start position:0%
right now but I might not look at a Thum
 
01:34:29.310 --> 01:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
because I have a medical condition
 
01:34:31.990 --> 01:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
called Turner syndrome Turner syndrome
 
01:34:34.390 --> 01:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
is a condition where some of the DNA of
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
my ex chromosome is missing this means
 
01:34:39.229 --> 01:34:39.239 align:start position:0%
my body physically cannot go through
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
puberty on its own because of this I
 
01:34:43.990 --> 01:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
need to take one of the hormones so I
 
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
can go through puberty I would prefer to
 
01:34:48.830 --> 01:34:48.840 align:start position:0%
take testosterone of course because it
 
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
fits what I want to look like sound like
 
01:34:55.030 --> 01:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
feel like and who I am a boy I've been
 
01:34:58.430 --> 01:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
out since 2021 but have felt this way
 
01:35:01.149 --> 01:35:01.159 align:start position:0%
for way longer growing up I've never
 
01:35:03.390 --> 01:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
liked girly things I've always dressed
 
01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
masculine and done what's considered
 
01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
masculine things I always related to
 
01:35:11.470 --> 01:35:11.480 align:start position:0%
masculine characters and would dress up
 
01:35:14.189 --> 01:35:14.199 align:start position:0%
like them I dressed up as a handyman all
 
01:35:17.870 --> 01:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
the time and I always wore so-called boy
 
01:35:20.310 --> 01:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
clothes my sister would even say I was
 
01:35:22.229 --> 01:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
an old man trapped in a little girl's
 
01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
body obviously
 
01:35:26.669 --> 01:35:26.679 align:start position:0%
these things don't make me trans but
 
01:35:28.830 --> 01:35:28.840 align:start position:0%
looking back I was just a little boy who
 
01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
didn't know how to say he was a boy I
 
01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
however could technically take estrogen
 
01:35:36.149 --> 01:35:36.159 align:start position:0%
but it would be very uncomfortable for
 
01:35:39.229 --> 01:35:39.239 align:start position:0%
me too but if I don't take any hormones
 
01:35:41.790 --> 01:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
it will lead to serious problems this
 
01:35:44.109 --> 01:35:44.119 align:start position:0%
band cannot be put in place because if
 
01:35:45.910 --> 01:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
it does I will be stuck in a
 
01:35:47.990 --> 01:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
prepubescent body for the rest of my
 
01:35:50.830 --> 01:35:50.840 align:start position:0%
life or if an exception is made so I can
 
01:35:53.149 --> 01:35:53.159 align:start position:0%
take estrogen I will be in a body that's
 
01:35:54.189 --> 01:35:54.199 align:start position:0%
not m
 
01:35:56.109 --> 01:35:56.119 align:start position:0%
and someone who I've never been and
 
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
never will be thank you for your time
 
01:36:04.149 --> 01:36:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:06.149 --> 01:36:06.159 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:36:07.590 --> 01:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I was just
 
01:36:10.109 --> 01:36:10.119 align:start position:0%
curious um if you would ever want the
 
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
decision to change your mind because
 
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
obviously I have 11-year-old daughter
 
01:36:14.830 --> 01:36:14.840 align:start position:0%
she changes her mind all the time so I'm
 
01:36:16.510 --> 01:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
only curious about that because I've
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
heard different testimony back and forth
 
01:36:21.390 --> 01:36:21.400 align:start position:0%
about that there it is possible to
 
01:36:23.669 --> 01:36:23.679 align:start position:0%
detransition it is not possible so I'm
 
01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
just curious for you would you like to
 
01:36:26.910 --> 01:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
have that choice in your future to be
 
01:36:30.750 --> 01:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
able to go back and forth with that um I
 
01:36:33.870 --> 01:36:33.880 align:start position:0%
mean it'd be nice if I did want to
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
change my mind but I know that this is
 
01:36:38.669 --> 01:36:38.679 align:start position:0%
something that I'm set in stone I felt
 
01:36:40.709 --> 01:36:40.719 align:start position:0%
this way for like five years my mind is
 
01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
not changing thank you other
 
01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
Weber is it of concern to you as a
 
01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:56.950 align:start position:0%
Weber is it of concern to you as a
mom

01:36:56.950 --> 01:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
mom
 
01:37:02.109 --> 01:37:02.119 align:start position:0%
um that if we pass this bill putting
 
01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
restrictions on kids who do not have
 
01:37:07.709 --> 01:37:07.719 align:start position:0%
pre-existing medical
 
01:37:10.270 --> 01:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
conditions that just as we have seen
 
01:37:13.310 --> 01:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
with other medical procedures that have
 
01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:14.310 align:start position:0%
with other medical procedures that have
been

01:37:14.310 --> 01:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
banned it may make it more difficult for
 
01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
you as a mom to seek the appropriate
 
01:37:25.270 --> 01:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
care that you and your son know that he
 
01:37:28.510 --> 01:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
needs absolutely that's of utmost
 
01:37:31.470 --> 01:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
concern um actually we we have been
 
01:37:32.990 --> 01:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
meeting with our
 
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
endrocrinologist for months now this is
 
01:37:38.229 --> 01:37:38.239 align:start position:0%
not an easy decision we've been planning
 
01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
his testosterone but the political
 
01:37:42.189 --> 01:37:42.199 align:start position:0%
climate is something that we've had to
 
01:37:43.990 --> 01:37:44.000 align:start position:0%
talk about in our doctor's appointments
 
01:37:46.189 --> 01:37:46.199 align:start position:0%
and that's horrifying to me the the
 
01:37:47.229 --> 01:37:47.239 align:start position:0%
these are things we've been talking
 
01:37:49.350 --> 01:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
about for years planning for when
 
01:37:52.350 --> 01:37:52.360 align:start position:0%
testosterone was appropriate and at with
 
01:37:54.910 --> 01:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
his condition 14 years old is when it's
 
01:37:57.470 --> 01:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
appropriate that is the what the Turner
 
01:38:00.790 --> 01:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
Turner syndrome guidelines are and the
 
01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
political climate and people trying to
 
01:38:05.870 --> 01:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
legislate this is getting in the way of
 
01:38:08.109 --> 01:38:08.119 align:start position:0%
his best care and treatment and I do
 
01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
have to say even if he didn't have
 
01:38:11.669 --> 01:38:11.679 align:start position:0%
Turner syndrome I would want this
 
01:38:14.430 --> 01:38:14.440 align:start position:0%
decision to be made privately with his
 
01:38:17.189 --> 01:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
therapist his doctor and our
 
01:38:17.199 --> 01:38:19.430 align:start position:0%
therapist his doctor and our
family

01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
family
 
01:38:22.030 --> 01:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
well this is an intrusive question so
 
01:38:23.510 --> 01:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
please don't answer it if you don't want
 
01:38:26.229 --> 01:38:26.239 align:start position:0%
to how how long have you been discussing
 
01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
with doctors counselors and others this
 
01:38:32.709 --> 01:38:32.719 align:start position:0%
course of treatment sure um when did you
 
01:38:35.310 --> 01:38:35.320 align:start position:0%
start thank you for your question so I
 
01:38:37.109 --> 01:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
actually found out that um Luke had
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
Turner syndrome when I was pregnant um
 
01:38:41.189 --> 01:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
so I've always known that he would have
 
01:38:43.709 --> 01:38:43.719 align:start position:0%
infertility that he would have these
 
01:38:45.709 --> 01:38:45.719 align:start position:0%
concerns that he might not have ovarian
 
01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
function so gender has always been
 
01:38:50.189 --> 01:38:50.199 align:start position:0%
something that was kind of in the
 
01:38:54.550 --> 01:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
background of my mind and so when he um
 
01:38:57.109 --> 01:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
came out to me at 9 years old we started
 
01:38:58.629 --> 01:38:58.639 align:start position:0%
talking to his doctor right then and
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
there so he'll be 14 this summer so
 
01:39:03.629 --> 01:39:03.639 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about it with his
 
01:39:05.629 --> 01:39:05.639 align:start position:0%
doctor since he was nine we've been on
 
01:39:08.750 --> 01:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
no um we we take a growth hormone but
 
01:39:10.510 --> 01:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
that that's for his Turners but we have
 
01:39:13.750 --> 01:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
taken no gender affirming care right now
 
01:39:15.990 --> 01:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
it's all been support and I have to say
 
01:39:17.629 --> 01:39:17.639 align:start position:0%
the Nashville schools have been
 
01:39:19.830 --> 01:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
completely supportive I've always called
 
01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
him his pronouns his name everything
 
01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:29.629 --> 01:39:29.639 align:start position:0%
in representative Kastle R thank you Mr
 
01:39:31.229 --> 01:39:31.239 align:start position:0%
chair just I have a follow-up question
 
01:39:33.189 --> 01:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
um so your the condition that your son
 
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
has um it seems to me like there's a
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
difference in hormone changes and
 
01:39:38.189 --> 01:39:38.199 align:start position:0%
different things that happen anyways is
 
01:39:39.189 --> 01:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
there is there anything that you would
 
01:39:40.830 --> 01:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
tell us on that because I'm not educated
 
01:39:42.750 --> 01:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
on that condition so just curious more
 
01:39:44.750 --> 01:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
on that so with turner syndrome he on
 
01:39:46.589 --> 01:39:46.599 align:start position:0%
his ex chromosome he's missing some
 
01:39:49.270 --> 01:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
information and there's a wide variety
 
01:39:51.470 --> 01:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
of the way that that can present for
 
01:39:53.870 --> 01:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
kids he is very fortunate there are
 
01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
heart conditions kidney um conditions
 
01:39:58.270 --> 01:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
multiple conditions he doesn't have he
 
01:40:01.709 --> 01:40:01.719 align:start position:0%
has a very mild form of it for us we
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
think it was a blessing because he
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
hasn't he didn't have to go on puberty
 
01:40:08.109 --> 01:40:08.119 align:start position:0%
blockers because his body naturally
 
01:40:11.030 --> 01:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
provided those puberty blocking so it
 
01:40:12.990 --> 01:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
actually gave us the time and space to
 
01:40:16.070 --> 01:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
be able to work out um what he needed
 
01:40:18.669 --> 01:40:18.679 align:start position:0%
for his his
 
01:40:21.669 --> 01:40:21.679 align:start position:0%
hormones other
 
01:40:24.149 --> 01:40:24.159 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
01:40:32.310 --> 01:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:35.040 align:start position:0%

01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:51.790 --> 01:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
Johnson good morning good morning hello
 
01:40:53.390 --> 01:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
representatives and thank you for the
 
01:40:55.390 --> 01:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
chance to speak with you today and you
 
01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
have three
 
01:40:58.709 --> 01:40:58.719 align:start position:0%
minutes I've taught in New Hampshire for
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
30 years I've met many teens and I'm
 
01:41:02.109 --> 01:41:02.119 align:start position:0%
here to represent them and their freedom
 
01:41:05.070 --> 01:41:05.080 align:start position:0%
to get the health care that they need um
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
adolescence is a time of growth and
 
01:41:08.790 --> 01:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
development some students it's a you
 
01:41:11.310 --> 01:41:11.320 align:start position:0%
know relatively smooth Journey um but
 
01:41:12.790 --> 01:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
others struggle with maybe a learning
 
01:41:14.790 --> 01:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
disability going through a family crisis
 
01:41:17.270 --> 01:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
or even you know loss of a parent um
 
01:41:19.589 --> 01:41:19.599 align:start position:0%
whatever circumstances a student has
 
01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:21.719 align:start position:0%
though we as educators are committed to
 
01:41:23.709 --> 01:41:23.719 align:start position:0%
helping these young people find a path
 
01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
to success sometimes it comes through
 
01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:29.159 align:start position:0%
support from their peers teachers um
 
01:41:31.390 --> 01:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
parents other times consultation with
 
01:41:33.189 --> 01:41:33.199 align:start position:0%
experts like child psychiatrists or
 
01:41:36.510 --> 01:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
counselors or doctors um let's take one
 
01:41:39.669 --> 01:41:39.679 align:start position:0%
student Johnny he's in the class he's
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
he's um struggles to stay focused blurts
 
01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:44.159 align:start position:0%
out remarks loses homework um can't
 
01:41:46.510 --> 01:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
complete tests um finally he's referred
 
01:41:48.709 --> 01:41:48.719 align:start position:0%
to testing oh he's got
 
01:41:53.229 --> 01:41:53.239 align:start position:0%
ADHD um so this decision whether Maybe
 
01:41:54.270 --> 01:41:54.280 align:start position:0%
maybe we could help him through
 
01:41:57.030 --> 01:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
medication or not um that should be made
 
01:42:00.550 --> 01:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
by him his parents his doctor not by
 
01:42:02.430 --> 01:42:02.440 align:start position:0%
lawmakers um it's not the role of the
 
01:42:04.189 --> 01:42:04.199 align:start position:0%
state to interfere in these private
 
01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
decisions and of course it's very
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
different ADHD but still like for every
 
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
every medical condition when you take
 
01:42:12.310 --> 01:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
medications there there are possible
 
01:42:14.510 --> 01:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
side effects right like with ADHD you
 
01:42:16.270 --> 01:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
can be your height can be you know
 
01:42:18.149 --> 01:42:18.159 align:start position:0%
stunted a little bit you have increased
 
01:42:19.390 --> 01:42:19.400 align:start position:0%
risk of having a heart attack
 
01:42:23.270 --> 01:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
cardiovascular health um so um as
 
01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
lawmakers you all have generously given
 
01:42:26.830 --> 01:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
of your time to make sure New Hampshire
 
01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
and its citizens are the best they can
 
01:42:31.149 --> 01:42:31.159 align:start position:0%
be um I really believe you all care for
 
01:42:34.149 --> 01:42:34.159 align:start position:0%
us in New Hampshire and want to help um
 
01:42:37.109 --> 01:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's citizens flourish um
 
01:42:39.390 --> 01:42:39.400 align:start position:0%
it's important that we look to experts
 
01:42:41.629 --> 01:42:41.639 align:start position:0%
in situations that may be unfamiliar to
 
01:42:44.189 --> 01:42:44.199 align:start position:0%
us um such as the current state of
 
01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
transgender youth here um who hope to be
 
01:42:49.030 --> 01:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
able to consult with doctors and get the
 
01:42:51.350 --> 01:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
medical care they need maybe we feel
 
01:42:54.669 --> 01:42:54.679 align:start position:0%
fine in our bodies and we known oh I'm
 
01:42:56.830 --> 01:42:56.840 align:start position:0%
we've always had this sense I'm a I'm a
 
01:42:58.709 --> 01:42:58.719 align:start position:0%
man I'm a woman whatever your case may
 
01:43:00.870 --> 01:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
be and we have trouble imagining what a
 
01:43:03.390 --> 01:43:03.400 align:start position:0%
transgender person feels like um but the
 
01:43:06.109 --> 01:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
fact is that they do exist have always
 
01:43:08.629 --> 01:43:08.639 align:start position:0%
existed and will always exist whether
 
01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
others understand them or not um there
 
01:43:12.870 --> 01:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
are questions there are answers to
 
01:43:14.470 --> 01:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
questions out there many experts in
 
01:43:16.750 --> 01:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
relevant Fields um having the government
 
01:43:19.070 --> 01:43:19.080 align:start position:0%
mandate private citizens Health Care
 
01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
choices um is not not the answer the
 
01:43:23.669 --> 01:43:23.679 align:start position:0%
answer is to believe the rights of
 
01:43:25.310 --> 01:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
indivual individual families and their
 
01:43:27.990 --> 01:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
health care providers to decide every
 
01:43:29.830 --> 01:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
educator knows that a student setbacks
 
01:43:32.270 --> 01:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
can lead to growth but knowingly denying
 
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
a Young Person's very personal identity
 
01:43:36.750 --> 01:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
is not how we both best help them it's
 
01:43:38.830 --> 01:43:38.840 align:start position:0%
by listening to them getting informed
 
01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
ourselves Consulting with experts and

fashioned into a simulation of a woman's
 
01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
body but it will never function like a
 
01:46:14.189 --> 01:46:14.199 align:start position:0%
woman's body and his dating pool is near

01:46:28.470 --> 01:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
he's learning that no one can change sex
 
01:46:30.189 --> 01:46:30.199 align:start position:0%
he could have grown up like so many
 
01:46:32.430 --> 01:46:32.440 align:start position:0%
gender non-conforming men who are living
 
01:46:34.990 --> 01:46:35.000 align:start position:0%

for these kids stop giving them medicine
 
01:46:43.510 --> 01:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
medications that harm their bodies and
 
01:46:45.790 --> 01:46:45.800 align:start position:0%
their minds leaving them sexually
 
01:46:48.750 --> 01:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
dysfunctional and infertile and with

Barbies be their gender non-conforming
 
01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
selves Don't force them into a gender
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
stereotype box gender confused kids and
 
01:47:06.149 --> 01:47:06.159 align:start position:0%
their parents deserve better girls who
 
01:47:08.629 --> 01:47:08.639 align:start position:0%
are tomboys and effeminate boys deserve
 
01:47:12.189 --> 01:47:12.199 align:start position:0%
better puberty is a human
 
01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
right thank you any questions
 
01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:15.950 align:start position:0%
right thank you any questions
representative

01:47:15.950 --> 01:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:47:20.149 --> 01:47:20.159 align:start position:0%
Weber do you have any research on the um
 
01:47:26.350 --> 01:47:26.360 align:start position:0%
uh rates of regret following surgery as
 
01:47:29.189 --> 01:47:29.199 align:start position:0%
opposed to the rates of people who are
 
01:47:31.510 --> 01:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
satisfied with the surgery or regret
 
01:47:34.149 --> 01:47:34.159 align:start position:0%
rates for other types of life-changing
 
01:47:37.030 --> 01:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
surgeries um as opposed to anecdotal
 
01:47:40.189 --> 01:47:40.199 align:start position:0%
evidence what what I've my understanding
 
01:47:42.990 --> 01:47:43.000 align:start position:0%
is that no one's collecting the data on
 
01:47:47.030 --> 01:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
regret um there I mean there are very
 
01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
little data being collected on regret
 
01:47:50.990 --> 01:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
what I what there is I could send to you
 
01:47:55.629 --> 01:47:55.639 align:start position:0%
um and what happened in um the UK is
 
01:47:59.149 --> 01:47:59.159 align:start position:0%
that um they tried to go the the kid
 
01:48:01.109 --> 01:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
after they shut down the Tavo they tried
 
01:48:04.750 --> 01:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
to go to the Adult Services and find out
 
01:48:06.350 --> 01:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
you know how many of these people have
 
01:48:09.109 --> 01:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
detransitioned or expressed regret and
 
01:48:11.430 --> 01:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't share the data with them
 
01:48:15.950 --> 01:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
so these are really difficult numbers to
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:26.390 --> 01:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:38.669 --> 01:48:38.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:41.709 --> 01:48:41.719 align:start position:0%
doson good morning my name is Kelly van

state of New Hampshire as well as a
 
01:48:53.510 --> 01:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
concerned constituent I am here today to
 
01:48:56.910 --> 01:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
implore you to find HB 377 in expedient
 
01:48:56.920 --> 01:48:57.830 align:start position:0%
implore you to find HB 377 in expedient
to

01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:49:00.030 --> 01:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
legislate I've had the privilege of
 
01:49:01.870 --> 01:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
knowing transgender children both
 
01:49:04.589 --> 01:49:04.599 align:start position:0%
personally and in my clinical work they
 
01:49:06.750 --> 01:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
are kids with all of the strengths and
 
01:49:09.070 --> 01:49:09.080 align:start position:0%
challenges of any child but with a need
 
01:49:10.830 --> 01:49:10.840 align:start position:0%
for additional medical support to live
 
01:49:13.990 --> 01:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
long and happy lives the children I know
 
01:49:15.310 --> 01:49:15.320 align:start position:0%
would love accessing care to be
 
01:49:17.589 --> 01:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
protected because it really is about the
 
01:49:19.470 --> 01:49:19.480 align:start position:0%
least interesting thing about them when
 
01:49:20.870 --> 01:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
they have access to the care that they
 
01:49:22.790 --> 01:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
need they would much prefer to be
 
01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
focused on things like school friends
 
01:49:26.109 --> 01:49:26.119 align:start position:0%
and activities just like their peers are
 
01:49:26.119 --> 01:49:27.830 align:start position:0%
and activities just like their peers are
able

01:49:27.830 --> 01:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
able
 
01:49:30.430 --> 01:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
to denying the children I have known and
 
01:49:32.229 --> 01:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
others like them access to care that is
 
01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
largely and in some cases entirely
 
01:49:37.510 --> 01:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
reversible has minimal Associated risks
 
01:49:40.109 --> 01:49:40.119 align:start position:0%
and with a 97% satisfaction rate is
 
01:49:41.910 --> 01:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
cruel and unethical and that
 
01:49:44.310 --> 01:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
satisfaction rate comes from a 2024
 
01:49:46.629 --> 01:49:46.639 align:start position:0%
article published in Jamma
 
01:49:48.870 --> 01:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics this legislation would have
 
01:49:50.669 --> 01:49:50.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely no impact on the vast
 
01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
majority of granite Staters it would not
 
01:49:54.910 --> 01:49:54.920 align:start position:0%
improve their lives help them support
 
01:49:57.589 --> 01:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
their families or make them safer they
 
01:49:59.430 --> 01:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
would have no idea that others in their
 
01:50:01.390 --> 01:50:01.400 align:start position:0%
state are no longer afforded privacy
 
01:50:03.790 --> 01:50:03.800 align:start position:0%
autonomy and competent Medical Care in
 
01:50:06.030 --> 01:50:06.040 align:start position:0%
their doctor's office however for the
 
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
small minority that it would impact the
 
01:50:10.709 --> 01:50:10.719 align:start position:0%
effect would be devastating the state
 
01:50:12.830 --> 01:50:12.840 align:start position:0%
has no business getting between parents
 
01:50:14.510 --> 01:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
children and their medical providers in
 
01:50:17.350 --> 01:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
making complex and nuanced decisions
 
01:50:18.830 --> 01:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
these deeply personal decisions should
 
01:50:20.709 --> 01:50:20.719 align:start position:0%
be made in a doctor's office not a
 
01:50:23.189 --> 01:50:23.199 align:start position:0%
legislative chamber as state that
 
01:50:25.109 --> 01:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
prioritizes parents rights and personal
 
01:50:27.709 --> 01:50:27.719 align:start position:0%
freedom I ask you as its representatives
 
01:50:29.270 --> 01:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
to legislate in keeping with those
 
01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
values and oppose this Bill thank you
 
01:50:36.550 --> 01:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
for your time thank you representative
 
01:50:40.229 --> 01:50:40.239 align:start position:0%
Weber so am I to um understand that you
 
01:50:42.310 --> 01:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
believe it would simply be flat out
 
01:50:44.310 --> 01:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
discriminatory to deny these children
 
01:50:47.109 --> 01:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
the care that they need I do thank you
 
01:50:48.950 --> 01:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
for the question and I do particularly
 
01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
as there is an exception for their
 
01:50:52.750 --> 01:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
cisgender counterparts to receive this
 
01:50:56.109 --> 01:50:56.119 align:start position:0%
same Care thank you and followup it's
 
01:50:57.629 --> 01:50:57.639 align:start position:0%
not actually a follow-up it's a whole
 
01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
new question okay sure um thank you for
 
01:51:04.790 --> 01:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
the Indulgence uh as a professional do
 
01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
you have concerns that if we put limits
 
01:51:09.390 --> 01:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
and guardrails around this particular
 
01:51:12.910 --> 01:51:12.920 align:start position:0%
type of care we may wind up discouraging
 
01:51:15.149 --> 01:51:15.159 align:start position:0%
pediatric endocrinologists from coming
 
01:51:17.589 --> 01:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire to make their practices
 
01:51:20.069 --> 01:51:20.079 align:start position:0%
here when they can go to neighboring
 
01:51:22.830 --> 01:51:22.840 align:start position:0%
states where they will be able to
 
01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
practice the full range of the services
 
01:51:30.790 --> 01:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
that they think that uh are needed
 
01:51:34.629 --> 01:51:34.639 align:start position:0%
and the follow-up to that is will that
 
01:51:39.069 --> 01:51:39.079 align:start position:0%
have effects for children with many
 
01:51:42.550 --> 01:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
other kinds of childhood conditions
 
01:51:44.990 --> 01:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
diabetes comes to mind that require a
 
01:51:47.229 --> 01:51:47.239 align:start position:0%
pediatric endocrinologist for their care
 
01:51:48.589 --> 01:51:48.599 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question um
 
01:51:50.229 --> 01:51:50.239 align:start position:0%
that's actually a an incredibly
 
01:51:51.669 --> 01:51:51.679 align:start position:0%
pertinent question to me because I also
 
01:51:53.149 --> 01:51:53.159 align:start position:0%
happen to be the parent of a child with
 
01:51:55.709 --> 01:51:55.719 align:start position:0%
type 1 diabetes um and it does concern
 
01:51:58.069 --> 01:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
me our Pediatric Endocrinology team is
 
01:52:00.310 --> 01:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
wonderful and I know that providing
 
01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
gender affirming Services is an
 
01:52:04.270 --> 01:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
important part of their practice and I
 
01:52:05.950 --> 01:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
do fear that there would be a chilling
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
effect on medical professionals and I
 
01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
you know speaking as a mental health
 
01:52:11.229 --> 01:52:11.239 align:start position:0%
professional I also fear that some of
 
01:52:12.750 --> 01:52:12.760 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill could provide a
 
01:52:14.629 --> 01:52:14.639 align:start position:0%
chilling effect and leave some Mental
 
01:52:17.669 --> 01:52:17.679 align:start position:0%
Health Providers feeling that there is a
 
01:52:20.550 --> 01:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh conflict between the nasw code of
 
01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
ethics by which we are all to practice
 
01:52:24.990 --> 01:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
and and the law that we have to follow
 
01:52:27.550 --> 01:52:27.560 align:start position:0%
as licensed Professionals in the state
 
01:52:29.589 --> 01:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
in the sense of you know providing
 
01:52:31.109 --> 01:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
counseling around seeking gender
 
01:52:31.119 --> 01:52:32.470 align:start position:0%
counseling around seeking gender
affirming

01:52:32.470 --> 01:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
affirming
 
01:52:35.270 --> 01:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
care representative Woods uh thank you
 
01:52:36.470 --> 01:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thanks for taking my
 
01:52:38.550 --> 01:52:38.560 align:start position:0%
question being a counselor uh do you
 
01:52:40.149 --> 01:52:40.159 align:start position:0%
read this I you may have heard my
 
01:52:42.870 --> 01:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
question earlier uh do you see this as a
 
01:52:46.069 --> 01:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
chilling effect to talk to your patients
 
01:52:50.229 --> 01:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
at all about any any kind of sexual
 
01:52:53.669 --> 01:52:53.679 align:start position:0%
dysmorphia uh for or against a change I
 
01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
mean the way this is written it just
 
01:52:59.189 --> 01:52:59.199 align:start position:0%
says counseling yes I do I do that does
 
01:53:00.669 --> 01:53:00.679 align:start position:0%
concern me and I have experience not
 
01:53:02.550 --> 01:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
only providing direct Clinical Services
 
01:53:05.709 --> 01:53:05.719 align:start position:0%
but also uh supervising clinicians who
 
01:53:07.629 --> 01:53:07.639 align:start position:0%
are new to the field and who often have
 
01:53:09.629 --> 01:53:09.639 align:start position:0%
these questions and to be frank even as
 
01:53:11.629 --> 01:53:11.639 align:start position:0%
someone with 15 years of experience I
 
01:53:13.910 --> 01:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
would need to seek supervision um from
 
01:53:15.470 --> 01:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
other professionals to really understand
 
01:53:16.910 --> 01:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
what the implications of this bill would
 
01:53:18.310 --> 01:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
be for my
 
01:53:20.750 --> 01:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
practice representative Kastle ring
 
01:53:21.870 --> 01:53:21.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:53:22.990 --> 01:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
so does the state have the ability to
 
01:53:27.030 --> 01:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
systematically review things and you
 
01:53:28.910 --> 01:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
know let's say stop them if there's
 
01:53:30.950 --> 01:53:30.960 align:start position:0%
evidence of damage or something that
 
01:53:32.910 --> 01:53:32.920 align:start position:0%
could happen to a child or anything like
 
01:53:34.470 --> 01:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
that in your clinical
 
01:53:36.510 --> 01:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
practice I'm sorry just to clarify do
 
01:53:37.870 --> 01:53:37.880 align:start position:0%
you mean the State Board of mental
 
01:53:39.430 --> 01:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
health practice in general the state
 
01:53:41.069 --> 01:53:41.079 align:start position:0%
because you mentioned here that the
 
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
government is involved in this
 
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
conversation so the question that I have
 
01:53:45.550 --> 01:53:45.560 align:start position:0%
for you is have you seen that in your
 
01:53:47.870 --> 01:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
practice anything else that has happened
 
01:53:49.709 --> 01:53:49.719 align:start position:0%
that the state has come in and said this
 
01:53:53.189 --> 01:53:53.199 align:start position:0%
couldn't happen because it's unsafe
 
01:53:56.589 --> 01:53:56.599 align:start position:0%
uh not that I can think of okay so if I
 
01:53:57.990 --> 01:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
were to tell you there would sorry
 
01:53:59.830 --> 01:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
follow sorry so if I to tell you there
 
01:54:02.030 --> 01:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
were cases of that would you agree that
 
01:54:04.430 --> 01:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
that's good or not that the state would
 
01:54:06.229 --> 01:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
have oversight into intervening when
 
01:54:08.669 --> 01:54:08.679 align:start position:0%
there are unsafe practices in medicine
 
01:54:10.709 --> 01:54:10.719 align:start position:0%
yes yes I would think that in general
 
01:54:12.910 --> 01:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
having oversight would be a good thing
 
01:54:15.390 --> 01:54:15.400 align:start position:0%
for uh the state to have but that that
 
01:54:17.669 --> 01:54:17.679 align:start position:0%
should be happening at the level of the
 
01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
mental health board in the case of mine
 
01:54:21.990 --> 01:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
or of other uh state boards of Medical
 
01:54:23.629 --> 01:54:23.639 align:start position:0%
Practice and not necessarily through
 
01:54:27.390 --> 01:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
sweeping and Broad legislation follow so
 
01:54:29.270 --> 01:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
in your clinical practice would you say
 
01:54:31.790 --> 01:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
that these uh puberty blockers are safe
 
01:54:33.709 --> 01:54:33.719 align:start position:0%
and effective as the question I asked
 
01:54:35.830 --> 01:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
before uh that would be out of my scope
 
01:54:36.990 --> 01:54:37.000 align:start position:0%
of practice as a mental health
 
01:54:39.270 --> 01:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
professional in my own reading of the
 
01:54:41.910 --> 01:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
literature as an individual I taking the
 
01:54:43.270 --> 01:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
preponderance of evidence I feel
 
01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
personally that they are but it would be
 
01:54:45.870 --> 01:54:45.880 align:start position:0%
out of my scope of practice to say as
 
01:54:47.470 --> 01:54:47.480 align:start position:0%
mental health professional thank you
 
01:54:50.510 --> 01:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
you're welcome representative
 
01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
delus thank you Mr chairman
 
01:54:54.830 --> 01:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
just a quick question what is what's the
 
01:54:58.870 --> 01:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
age range in your pediatric uh practice
 
01:55:01.149 --> 01:55:01.159 align:start position:0%
so my current practice is not I don't
 
01:55:02.790 --> 01:55:02.800 align:start position:0%
see pediatric patients in my current
 
01:55:04.229 --> 01:55:04.239 align:start position:0%
practice but over the course of my
 
01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
career I have seen uh children and their
 
01:55:10.750 --> 01:55:10.760 align:start position:0%
families ranging anywhere from 3 to 21
 
01:55:12.109 --> 01:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
and then all through the rest of the
 
01:55:15.510 --> 01:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
lifespan oh okay great um can I ask a
 
01:55:17.069 --> 01:55:17.079 align:start position:0%
second question not even a followup just
 
01:55:20.709 --> 01:55:20.719 align:start position:0%
a Qui just a question so being involved
 
01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
in this in these cases
 
01:55:25.589 --> 01:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
do you see regret are there people who
 
01:55:28.030 --> 01:55:28.040 align:start position:0%
come to you who want to
 
01:55:30.510 --> 01:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
detransition and what have you done with
 
01:55:32.510 --> 01:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
that uh I have never worked with someone
 
01:55:35.069 --> 01:55:35.079 align:start position:0%
who wanted to detransition if I did have
 
01:55:36.589 --> 01:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
theoretically someone who came into my
 
01:55:38.669 --> 01:55:38.679 align:start position:0%
practice with that I would provide the
 
01:55:41.109 --> 01:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
same type of support and evidence-based
 
01:55:43.030 --> 01:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
care that I would to any patient who
 
01:55:44.870 --> 01:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
came into my office which would mean
 
01:55:46.750 --> 01:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
exploring the reasons for it looking at
 
01:55:48.189 --> 01:55:48.199 align:start position:0%
their preferred ways of being and
 
01:55:49.870 --> 01:55:49.880 align:start position:0%
providing support to them whatever that
 
01:55:51.430 --> 01:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
looked like regardless of my personal
 
01:55:51.440 --> 01:55:53.510 align:start position:0%
looked like regardless of my personal
beliefs

01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
beliefs
 
01:55:55.870 --> 01:55:55.880 align:start position:0%
yeah other
 
01:55:58.109 --> 01:55:58.119 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank

educator and I drove here from

Connecticut today because this is such
 
01:56:39.109 --> 01:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
an important um issue for me I believe
 
01:56:41.470 --> 01:56:41.480 align:start position:0%
that we are all made every single one of
 
01:56:44.069 --> 01:56:44.079 align:start position:0%
us in the image of God and are endowed
 
01:56:46.270 --> 01:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
by our creator with the rights the
 
01:56:49.350 --> 01:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
inalienable rights of life liberty and
 
01:56:52.229 --> 01:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
the pursuit of happiness I am a surviv
 
01:56:55.350 --> 01:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
Survivor of sexual assault childhood
 
01:56:58.629 --> 01:56:58.639 align:start position:0%
sexual assault I experienced traumatic
 
01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
violative Behavior between the ages of 5
 
01:57:05.669 --> 01:57:05.679 align:start position:0%
to 10 this caused my childhood self to
 
01:57:07.350 --> 01:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
believe that being a woman was a
 
01:57:10.669 --> 01:57:10.679 align:start position:0%
position of weakness and to reject my
 
01:57:13.910 --> 01:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
own body I experienced suicidal a
 
01:57:17.189 --> 01:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
ideation from the age of seven if I had
 
01:57:20.270 --> 01:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
been offered puberty blocking drugs at
 
01:57:23.229 --> 01:57:23.239 align:start position:0%
my pre-teen years I probably would have
 
01:57:26.870 --> 01:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
taken them it was only years later as an
 
01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
adult that I understood the origins of
 
01:57:32.550 --> 01:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
my feelings of self-hatred
 
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
thankfully gender altering drugs were
 
01:57:38.950 --> 01:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
not available to me as a minor and
 
01:57:41.550 --> 01:57:41.560 align:start position:0%
instead the resources at my disposal
 
01:57:44.430 --> 01:57:44.440 align:start position:0%
were a loving family youth leaders at my
 
01:57:46.510 --> 01:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
church and
 
01:57:50.229 --> 01:57:50.239 align:start position:0%
counseling I am so grateful that my
 
01:57:52.310 --> 01:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
story is not the story of so many
 
01:57:55.510 --> 01:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
persons like Laura smtz from Oklahoma or
 
01:57:57.790 --> 01:57:57.800 align:start position:0%
Simon Prince's girlfriend or many
 
01:57:59.589 --> 01:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
stories that I have read and heard over
 
01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%
the past decades I so appreciate the
 
01:58:04.870 --> 01:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
testimony of Jamie Reid from the courage
 
01:58:06.830 --> 01:58:06.840 align:start position:0%
Coalition that you will hear soon and
 
01:58:09.109 --> 01:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
the D transitioners and the sisters that
 
01:58:13.709 --> 01:58:13.719 align:start position:0%
are present today my story has a happy
 
01:58:17.229 --> 01:58:17.239 align:start position:0%
ending of inner healing forgiveness and
 
01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
freedom I represent the children whose
 
01:58:22.390 --> 01:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
lives will be saved from from
 
01:58:24.430 --> 01:58:24.440 align:start position:0%
significant mutilation and possible
 
01:58:28.189 --> 01:58:28.199 align:start position:0%
death if you do not pass this bill there
 
01:58:30.830 --> 01:58:30.840 align:start position:0%
are many many persons who have
 
01:58:33.189 --> 01:58:33.199 align:start position:0%
previously adopted a sexual or gender
 
01:58:36.149 --> 01:58:36.159 align:start position:0%
identity that later they found in life
 
01:58:39.109 --> 01:58:39.119 align:start position:0%
was unfulfilling I have an entire book
 
01:58:41.229 --> 01:58:41.239 align:start position:0%
here of their stories and there are many
 
01:58:43.790 --> 01:58:43.800 align:start position:0%

movement.com
 
01:58:48.870 --> 01:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
they found that healing from childhood
 
01:58:51.510 --> 01:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
trauma actually enabled them to
 
01:58:53.990 --> 01:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
eventually be able to be restored to
 
01:58:58.510 --> 01:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
their true identity and to embrace
 
01:59:01.990 --> 01:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
Freedom please I strongly urge you to
 
01:59:04.189 --> 01:59:04.199 align:start position:0%
pass this bill HB
 
01:59:07.550 --> 01:59:07.560 align:start position:0%
377 protect our children from a lifetime
 
01:59:10.709 --> 01:59:10.719 align:start position:0%
of regret and don't live with your own
 
01:59:12.950 --> 01:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
regret that you failed to vote to
 
01:59:16.589 --> 01:59:16.599 align:start position:0%
protect them when you had the
 
01:59:18.750 --> 01:59:18.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity and I would be happy to take
 
01:59:21.470 --> 01:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you yes
 
01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:22.750 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you yes
representative

01:59:22.750 --> 01:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question is it your belief
 
01:59:28.069 --> 01:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
that had uh puberty blockers been
 
01:59:30.430 --> 01:59:30.440 align:start position:0%
available your parents would have you
 
01:59:31.669 --> 01:59:31.679 align:start position:0%
and your parents and your doctors would
 
01:59:34.990 --> 01:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
have made the choice to take them and
 
01:59:37.470 --> 01:59:37.480 align:start position:0%
beyond that do you expect do you believe
 
01:59:39.470 --> 01:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
that you would have then at some point
 
01:59:42.510 --> 01:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
later chosen to pursue gender uh
 
01:59:45.030 --> 01:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
transition rather than stopping to take
 
01:59:47.950 --> 01:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
the puberty blockers and P and having a
 
01:59:50.229 --> 01:59:50.239 align:start position:0%
normal puberty experience from then on
 
01:59:51.589 --> 01:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Miller and
 
01:59:55.390 --> 01:59:55.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the the question um I know
 
01:59:57.750 --> 01:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
that if I had been raised in the current
 
02:00:01.149 --> 02:00:01.159 align:start position:0%
climate of all of this ideology that we
 
02:00:03.910 --> 02:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
are experiencing I watch my students
 
02:00:06.510 --> 02:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
every single day I think that it would
 
02:00:08.870 --> 02:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
have been probably a TR a choice that I
 
02:00:11.270 --> 02:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
would have made I probably would have
 
02:00:14.510 --> 02:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
chosen to go ahead and experience gender
 
02:00:16.750 --> 02:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
quote affirming care which actually I
 
02:00:19.629 --> 02:00:19.639 align:start position:0%
believe is extremely destructive for
 
02:00:24.069 --> 02:00:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:25.870 --> 02:00:25.880 align:start position:0%
yeah again s could do you not block the
 
02:00:29.189 --> 02:00:29.199 align:start position:0%
door please yes
 
02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:31.400 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair thank
 
02:00:32.990 --> 02:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question excuse me if
 
02:00:36.790 --> 02:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
it's very intrusive but um when you were
 
02:00:39.270 --> 02:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
um a child and you were abused did you
 
02:00:41.310 --> 02:00:41.320 align:start position:0%
ever think that you were a
 
02:00:43.950 --> 02:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
boy no I never um thank you

representative Palmer thank you for the
 
02:00:48.189 --> 02:00:48.199 align:start position:0%
question no I never thought that I was a
 
02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
boy I knew that I was born as a girl and
 
02:00:56.910 --> 02:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
I knew that if I wanted to grow up
 
02:00:58.990 --> 02:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
without the organs that I had that I
 
02:01:02.069 --> 02:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
didn't have an option for that at that
 
02:01:05.510 --> 02:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:08.990 --> 02:01:09.000 align:start position:0%

you also signed up to speak is
 
02:01:20.910 --> 02:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:34.189 --> 02:01:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:36.830 --> 02:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
minutes sorry took a second to unlock my
 
02:01:38.870 --> 02:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
iPad we're not counting it against you
 
02:01:41.870 --> 02:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair and my dear
 
02:01:43.390 --> 02:01:43.400 align:start position:0%
colleagues for the record I'm

representative alisandra Murray from
 
02:01:45.199 --> 02:01:46.189 align:start position:0%
representative alisandra Murray from
Manchester

02:01:46.189 --> 02:01:46.199 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
02:01:49.310 --> 02:01:49.320 align:start position:0%
W9 and I'm here testifying in opposition
 
02:01:51.310 --> 02:01:51.320 align:start position:0%
to this bill I'll try to speak fast
 
02:01:53.229 --> 02:01:53.239 align:start position:0%
since I have 3 minutes during my first
 
02:01:55.629 --> 02:01:55.639 align:start position:0%
term last year I testified on a very
 
02:01:57.470 --> 02:01:57.480 align:start position:0%
similar bill at which point I came out
 
02:01:59.390 --> 02:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
to all of my colleagues as a trans
 
02:02:02.310 --> 02:02:02.320 align:start position:0%
non-binary person these issues impact me
 
02:02:04.750 --> 02:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
personally and also impact many people I
 
02:02:07.870 --> 02:02:07.880 align:start position:0%
love since anti-lgbtq attacks have
 
02:02:09.149 --> 02:02:09.159 align:start position:0%
started in New Hampshire this past
 
02:02:10.870 --> 02:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
session I have multiple friends who are
 
02:02:13.189 --> 02:02:13.199 align:start position:0%
either trans themselves or have children
 
02:02:15.069 --> 02:02:15.079 align:start position:0%
who are gender non-conforming who are
 
02:02:16.709 --> 02:02:16.719 align:start position:0%
now moving out of New Hampshire because
 
02:02:18.629 --> 02:02:18.639 align:start position:0%
it is no longer safe for them here and
 
02:02:20.270 --> 02:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
because the life-saving health care they
 
02:02:23.350 --> 02:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
need is at risk legislation such as this
 
02:02:25.350 --> 02:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
is not protecting Granite seaters it is
 
02:02:27.229 --> 02:02:27.239 align:start position:0%
ruining people's lives and putting them
 
02:02:29.350 --> 02:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
in danger there is an incorrect
 
02:02:30.629 --> 02:02:30.639 align:start position:0%
assumption that the use of Medical
 
02:02:32.149 --> 02:02:32.159 align:start position:0%
Treatments like puberty blockers and
 
02:02:34.270 --> 02:02:34.280 align:start position:0%
hormone therapy is prolific and easy to
 
02:02:37.390 --> 02:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
access this is patently false Over The
 
02:02:39.550 --> 02:02:39.560 align:start position:0%
Last 5 Years fewer than a thousand trans
 
02:02:41.229 --> 02:02:41.239 align:start position:0%
people per year have started treatment
 
02:02:43.390 --> 02:02:43.400 align:start position:0%
with puberty blockers this is a tiny
 
02:02:46.589 --> 02:02:46.599 align:start position:0%
fraction of the 121,000 youth who were
 
02:02:48.430 --> 02:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with gender dysphoria within
 
02:02:50.990 --> 02:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
that same time period similarly just
 
02:02:53.470 --> 02:02:53.480 align:start position:0%
14,000 total of those youth were treated
 
02:02:55.589 --> 02:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
with hormone therapy underscoring just
 
02:02:58.069 --> 02:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
how rare the situation is puberty
 
02:03:00.109 --> 02:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
blockers are safely used in children who
 
02:03:02.109 --> 02:03:02.119 align:start position:0%
start puberty too early a condition
 
02:03:04.229 --> 02:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
known as precocious puberty and their
 
02:03:06.310 --> 02:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
use in transp patients is not considered
 
02:03:08.589 --> 02:03:08.599 align:start position:0%
experimental by experts these treatments
 
02:03:11.589 --> 02:03:11.599 align:start position:0%
have been taking place for decades a
 
02:03:13.709 --> 02:03:13.719 align:start position:0%
2023 study published in the New England
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
Journal of Medicine found after
 
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
following participants for 2 years after
 
02:03:18.790 --> 02:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
they started treatment that gender
 
02:03:20.510 --> 02:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
affirming Healthcare significantly
 
02:03:22.669 --> 02:03:22.679 align:start position:0%
improved trans and non binary teenagers
 
02:03:25.310 --> 02:03:25.320 align:start position:0%
mental health and body dysphoria on the
 
02:03:26.870 --> 02:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
other hand I've heard me Members
 
02:03:28.709 --> 02:03:28.719 align:start position:0%
reference the Cass report I will gladly
 
02:03:30.270 --> 02:03:30.280 align:start position:0%
send the committee a breakdown of the
 
02:03:32.750 --> 02:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
many inaccuracies in that report but the
 
02:03:34.069 --> 02:03:34.079 align:start position:0%
issue I'll mention today is that the
 
02:03:36.229 --> 02:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
report endorses Psychotherapy as the
 
02:03:37.830 --> 02:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
recommended treatment for youth
 
02:03:40.270 --> 02:03:40.280 align:start position:0%
experiencing gender dysphoria used since
 
02:03:42.229 --> 02:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
the late 1800s it did not improve
 
02:03:43.750 --> 02:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
patient outcomes with individuals
 
02:03:45.310 --> 02:03:45.320 align:start position:0%
reporting significant distress
 
02:03:47.149 --> 02:03:47.159 align:start position:0%
throughout treatment there is an
 
02:03:48.750 --> 02:03:48.760 align:start position:0%
abundance of evidence showing that
 
02:03:50.750 --> 02:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
medically affirming interventions confer
 
02:03:52.870 --> 02:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
key benefits and no contemporary
 
02:03:55.310 --> 02:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
evidence whatsoever shows those same
 
02:03:56.589 --> 02:03:56.599 align:start position:0%
benefits for those treated with
 
02:03:59.350 --> 02:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
Psychotherapy alone all this data shows
 
02:04:01.189 --> 02:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
that gender fir care is not only an
 
02:04:03.109 --> 02:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
effective treatment for gender dysphoria
 
02:04:05.950 --> 02:04:05.960 align:start position:0%
but it is also a necessary one people
 
02:04:07.430 --> 02:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
keep talking about the permanent effects
 
02:04:08.910 --> 02:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
of these treatments but do you know what
 
02:04:11.870 --> 02:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
is actually permanent is puberty I knew
 
02:04:13.510 --> 02:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
before 10 years old that I was not a
 
02:04:15.310 --> 02:04:15.320 align:start position:0%
girl and not only did I feel it in
 
02:04:17.510 --> 02:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
myself but my entire childhood adults
 
02:04:18.990 --> 02:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
around me told me I was not meeting
 
02:04:20.709 --> 02:04:20.719 align:start position:0%
their expectations of my gender
 
02:04:22.950 --> 02:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
presentation now these same adults want
 
02:04:24.990 --> 02:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
to talk about saving the tomboys but
 
02:04:26.589 --> 02:04:26.599 align:start position:0%
they don't want to save them they want
 
02:04:29.149 --> 02:04:29.159 align:start position:0%
them to conform they wanted me to
 
02:04:31.830 --> 02:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
conform the truth is even if this bill
 
02:04:33.790 --> 02:04:33.800 align:start position:0%
passes you will not eliminate gender
 
02:04:36.109 --> 02:04:36.119 align:start position:0%
dysphoria for a single individual you
 
02:04:38.589 --> 02:04:38.599 align:start position:0%
will solve problems for no person you
 
02:04:41.069 --> 02:04:41.079 align:start position:0%
will only increase the risk of suicide
 
02:04:43.390 --> 02:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
for lgbtq teens and make it even harder
 
02:04:45.030 --> 02:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
for them to become the individuals they
 
02:04:47.270 --> 02:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
know themselves to be as you vote on
 
02:04:48.830 --> 02:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
this billing committee and on the floor
 
02:04:50.189 --> 02:04:50.199 align:start position:0%
I urge you to consider how this
 
02:04:51.910 --> 02:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
legislation aligns with your position on
 
02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:52.870 align:start position:0%
legislation aligns with your position on
parental

02:04:52.870 --> 02:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
parental
 
02:04:55.870 --> 02:04:55.880 align:start position:0%
rights may I finish my sentence finished
 
02:04:57.470 --> 02:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
sentence yes if our colleagues should be
 
02:04:59.030 --> 02:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
allowed to treat their children with ior
 
02:05:01.470 --> 02:05:01.480 align:start position:0%
mechin outside of the medical context
 
02:05:02.669 --> 02:05:02.679 align:start position:0%
why should the parents of gender
 
02:05:04.669 --> 02:05:04.679 align:start position:0%
non-conforming youth not be allowed to
 
02:05:06.669 --> 02:05:06.679 align:start position:0%
make the medically supported decisions
 
02:05:08.589 --> 02:05:08.599 align:start position:0%
that they think will best support their
 
02:05:10.310 --> 02:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
child I ask you to vote against this
 
02:05:11.709 --> 02:05:11.719 align:start position:0%
bill and urge you to please listen to
 
02:05:13.430 --> 02:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
the voices of my community members here
 
02:05:16.229 --> 02:05:16.239 align:start position:0%
today we are 1% of the population but
 
02:05:18.430 --> 02:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
our voices our experiences and our lives
 
02:05:20.750 --> 02:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
matter thank you any questions
 
02:05:22.350 --> 02:05:22.360 align:start position:0%
representative kessle
 
02:05:23.990 --> 02:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:05:25.870 --> 02:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
my question so I had a question for you
 
02:05:28.270 --> 02:05:28.280 align:start position:0%
you said that it wasn't experimental uh
 
02:05:29.990 --> 02:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
to your knowledge is there any puberty
 
02:05:32.950 --> 02:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
blocker that is approved by the FDA
 
02:05:36.910 --> 02:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
under that um I believe that um if not
 
02:05:39.229 --> 02:05:39.239 align:start position:0%
by the FDA the majority of these
 
02:05:40.950 --> 02:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
treatments are considered on the same
 
02:05:42.950 --> 02:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
level as um prescriptions such as
 
02:05:45.870 --> 02:05:45.880 align:start position:0%
Wellbutrin um there are plenty of uh
 
02:05:47.709 --> 02:05:47.719 align:start position:0%
treatments that are considered off label
 
02:05:49.589 --> 02:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
not technically FDA approved that are
 
02:05:51.990 --> 02:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
widely used across um the industry for
 
02:05:54.950 --> 02:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
multiple conditions follow so question
 
02:05:56.870 --> 02:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
for you too I I know the Mayo Clinic
 
02:05:57.950 --> 02:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
studies I know a couple different
 
02:05:59.910 --> 02:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
studies that were sent to me over email
 
02:06:03.069 --> 02:06:03.079 align:start position:0%
um they did show that there was harm uh
 
02:06:04.870 --> 02:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
to kids with their bone density and
 
02:06:05.950 --> 02:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
different things would you agree with
 
02:06:07.990 --> 02:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
those studies or not I mean I would have
 
02:06:09.549 --> 02:06:09.559 align:start position:0%
to look at these individual studies I
 
02:06:11.870 --> 02:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
would say every medication for the most
 
02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
part has some sort of side effects and
 
02:06:15.750 --> 02:06:15.760 align:start position:0%
it's up to the individual their parents
 
02:06:17.510 --> 02:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
their doctor to determine if those side
 
02:06:19.990 --> 02:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
effects are worth the treatment that is
 
02:06:23.069 --> 02:06:23.079 align:start position:0%
being um treated the medical treatment
 
02:06:26.270 --> 02:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
itself thank you representative Tes
 
02:06:27.910 --> 02:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
02:06:30.229 --> 02:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
question um representative Murray I
 
02:06:32.589 --> 02:06:32.599 align:start position:0%
appreciated you laying out a lot of hard
 
02:06:34.149 --> 02:06:34.159 align:start position:0%
data that we had not yet heard this
 
02:06:36.750 --> 02:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
morning um could you possibly if you
 
02:06:41.310 --> 02:06:41.320 align:start position:0%
know elaborate on how much um uh like
 
02:06:43.709 --> 02:06:43.719 align:start position:0%
medical evaluation I'm sorry mental
 
02:06:46.470 --> 02:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
health evaluation and treatment happens
 
02:06:50.750 --> 02:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
you know as a a a patient is going
 
02:06:52.109 --> 02:06:52.119 align:start position:0%
through this process
 
02:06:55.470 --> 02:06:55.480 align:start position:0%
because um the previous speaker uh it it
 
02:06:57.589 --> 02:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
was almost like people thought the drugs
 
02:06:59.750 --> 02:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
are just handed out and so as wondering
 
02:07:02.430 --> 02:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
if you could illustrate for us um or
 
02:07:04.069 --> 02:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
maybe another mental health professional
 
02:07:07.149 --> 02:07:07.159 align:start position:0%
you know sort of how um more detailed uh
 
02:07:09.910 --> 02:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
the therapy that uh patients would get
 
02:07:13.030 --> 02:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
if they're in in this course of therapy
 
02:07:14.629 --> 02:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
yeah um I mean obviously I can't speak
 
02:07:16.870 --> 02:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
to every case I can speak to my own as
 
02:07:18.510 --> 02:07:18.520 align:start position:0%
an adult I've been talking with my
 
02:07:20.589 --> 02:07:20.599 align:start position:0%
doctor about my gender dysphoria for 10
 
02:07:23.470 --> 02:07:23.480 align:start position:0%
years and throughout that time we've POS
 
02:07:27.189 --> 02:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
um we've um explored multiple treatments
 
02:07:29.750 --> 02:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
and at no point where those treatments
 
02:07:32.390 --> 02:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
offered to me on the first visit right
 
02:07:35.910 --> 02:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
away at all without trying other um less
 
02:07:38.709 --> 02:07:38.719 align:start position:0%
invasive or um easier treatments first
 
02:07:42.109 --> 02:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:45.430 --> 02:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
Psychotherapy any other
 
02:07:47.870 --> 02:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
questions seeing done thank you thank
 
02:07:47.880 --> 02:07:53.470 align:start position:0%
questions seeing done thank you thank
you

02:07:53.470 --> 02:07:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:17.310 --> 02:08:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:20.310 --> 02:08:20.320 align:start position:0%
Brennan good morning my name is Nancy
 
02:08:22.870 --> 02:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
Brennan I live in
 
02:08:26.790 --> 02:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
weer and I have been reading studying
 
02:08:30.030 --> 02:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
following and testifying on issues like
 
02:08:33.189 --> 02:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
this for the past eight years ever since
 
02:08:35.549 --> 02:08:35.559 align:start position:0%
I worked with the venerable R renie
 
02:08:38.990 --> 02:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
Cushing to pass the first transgender
 
02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:41.109 align:start position:0%
Cushing to pass the first transgender
non-discrimination

02:08:41.109 --> 02:08:41.119 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination
 
02:08:43.990 --> 02:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
bill I think it's important I did bring
 
02:08:46.750 --> 02:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
testimony I have sent you testimony and
 
02:08:49.950 --> 02:08:49.960 align:start position:0%
the testimony I sent you has a lot of
 
02:08:52.790 --> 02:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
reference material and I have brought
 
02:08:55.109 --> 02:08:55.119 align:start position:0%
even more but I know you're not giving
 
02:08:59.470 --> 02:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
me an hour there is good information out
 
02:09:03.750 --> 02:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
there that tells what transgender care
 
02:09:08.030 --> 02:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
is and what it does I would recommend a
 
02:09:13.510 --> 02:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
book called free to be which is by a
 
02:09:17.510 --> 02:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
clinician and a researcher with loads
 
02:09:22.629 --> 02:09:22.639 align:start position:0%
and loads of um schooling and experience
 
02:09:26.310 --> 02:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
working with transgender kids we have
 
02:09:31.390 --> 02:09:31.400 align:start position:0%
heard stories today both from people who
 
02:09:36.109 --> 02:09:36.119 align:start position:0%
want this care and I think so far only
 
02:09:37.629 --> 02:09:37.639 align:start position:0%
secondhand but we're going to hear some
 
02:09:40.709 --> 02:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
others from people who themselves wound
 
02:09:40.719 --> 02:09:41.950 align:start position:0%
others from people who themselves wound
up

02:09:41.950 --> 02:09:41.960 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:09:44.350 --> 02:09:44.360 align:start position:0%
detransitioning this book gives the
 
02:09:47.510 --> 02:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
history the science and then
 
02:09:51.470 --> 02:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
representative stories of real children
 
02:09:55.669 --> 02:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
who went to gender clinics and who spent
 
02:10:00.549 --> 02:10:00.559 align:start position:0%
weeks months years being counseled
 
02:10:02.790 --> 02:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
before they were ever given puberty
 
02:10:05.470 --> 02:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
blockers some never given puberty
 
02:10:08.669 --> 02:10:08.679 align:start position:0%
blockers some left happy with who they
 
02:10:12.270 --> 02:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
are nobody that I read about was pushed
 
02:10:14.470 --> 02:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
into it I'm not saying it can never
 
02:10:17.310 --> 02:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
happen but I am saying that there's a
 
02:10:20.709 --> 02:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
lot of false information out there the
 
02:10:24.350 --> 02:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
cast view which was mentioned is seen as
 
02:10:27.390 --> 02:10:27.400 align:start position:0%
some kind of a you know be all and end
 
02:10:30.629 --> 02:10:30.639 align:start position:0%
all of why we shouldn't do this but the
 
02:10:34.950 --> 02:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
cast review has been reviewed by real
 
02:10:37.149 --> 02:10:37.159 align:start position:0%
doctors real
 
02:10:39.750 --> 02:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
endrocrinologist and they found a lot of
 
02:10:42.629 --> 02:10:42.639 align:start position:0%
problems with it I can send it to you if
 
02:10:44.910 --> 02:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
you're interested but there were I don't
 
02:10:49.830 --> 02:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
know 15 or 20 doctors gender care people
 
02:10:53.589 --> 02:10:53.599 align:start position:0%
um who had a total of 86 years of
 
02:10:57.390 --> 02:10:57.400 align:start position:0%
experience and published 278 peer
 
02:11:00.310 --> 02:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
reviewed studies and they came out with
 
02:11:04.069 --> 02:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
all the things wrong with the cast
 
02:11:04.079 --> 02:11:05.750 align:start position:0%
all the things wrong with the cast
review

02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
review
 
02:11:08.470 --> 02:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
um there was a question and it may or
 
02:11:10.350 --> 02:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
may not have gotten answered there was a
 
02:11:14.709 --> 02:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
question about regret regret overall for
 
02:11:17.750 --> 02:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
Trans care and this is probably
 
02:11:20.069 --> 02:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
specifically more for 15 seconds please
 
02:11:23.310 --> 02:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
more for adults but the regret is only
 
02:11:27.109 --> 02:11:27.119 align:start position:0%
1% as opposed to knee surgery which is 6
 
02:11:29.990 --> 02:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
to %. at any rate I have lots of
 
02:11:32.830 --> 02:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
information and I hope you will listen
 
02:11:35.310 --> 02:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
to the stories of the people that need
 
02:11:39.189 --> 02:11:39.199 align:start position:0%

02:12:02.149 --> 02:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
esteemed legislators of the house Health
 
02:12:04.030 --> 02:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
and Human Services and elderly Affairs
 
02:12:05.790 --> 02:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
committee I'd like to begin by thanking
 
02:12:08.189 --> 02:12:08.199 align:start position:0%
you all for your hard work on the people
 
02:12:10.229 --> 02:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
for the people of New Hampshire and for
 
02:12:11.310 --> 02:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
your concern for the health and
 
02:12:13.390 --> 02:12:13.400 align:start position:0%
well-being of gender distressed children
 
02:12:16.950 --> 02:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
I'm here to testify in favor of HB 377
 
02:12:19.350 --> 02:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
before I do I'd like to explain uh I'd
 
02:12:20.510 --> 02:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
like to tell you a little bit about my
 
02:12:22.470 --> 02:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
own experience my name is Peter Doyle
 
02:12:24.470 --> 02:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
I'm a lifelong Democrat and liberal and
 
02:12:27.549 --> 02:12:27.559 align:start position:0%
let me be clear I'm not anti-trans
 
02:12:29.510 --> 02:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
adults may do what they feel is best for
 
02:12:32.030 --> 02:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
them children however require a higher
 
02:12:34.709 --> 02:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
degree of safeguarding I know this to be
 
02:12:36.910 --> 02:12:36.920 align:start position:0%
true because I was once a so-called
 
02:12:39.910 --> 02:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
trans child as a child I experienced
 
02:12:42.390 --> 02:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
what's now called gender dysphoria from
 
02:12:44.910 --> 02:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
a young age up until puly I regularly
 
02:12:47.750 --> 02:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
told adults that I was a girl this was
 
02:12:50.229 --> 02:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
the 1980s so it was not taken seriously
 
02:12:52.629 --> 02:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
and rightfully so gender dysphoria did
 
02:12:55.510 --> 02:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
not really exist then we had not begun
 
02:12:57.910 --> 02:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
to pathologize gender non-conformity in
 
02:13:00.709 --> 02:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
youth more importantly I was not a girl
 
02:13:04.030 --> 02:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
I was a boy the idea that I had that I
 
02:13:06.510 --> 02:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
could become a girl was seen as absurd
 
02:13:08.990 --> 02:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
because it is it's tooth Fair wish only
 
02:13:11.189 --> 02:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
a child could believe the adults in my
 
02:13:12.589 --> 02:13:12.599 align:start position:0%
life knew this and they acted
 
02:13:15.470 --> 02:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
accordingly painful as it was at the
 
02:13:17.830 --> 02:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
time for me I am better for it had I
 
02:13:20.069 --> 02:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
grown up today what is normal devel what
 
02:13:21.990 --> 02:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
is a normal developmental phase would
 
02:13:23.990 --> 02:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
have been seen would have been affirmed
 
02:13:26.510 --> 02:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
as real I would have been shipped off to
 
02:13:28.270 --> 02:13:28.280 align:start position:0%
a gender Clinic where so-called
 
02:13:29.629 --> 02:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
clinicians would have abandoned their
 
02:13:31.709 --> 02:13:31.719 align:start position:0%
hypocritic oath and ignored the evidence
 
02:13:34.030 --> 02:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
to make my tooth fairy wish come true in
 
02:13:36.030 --> 02:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
the form of puberty blockers and cross-
 
02:13:37.870 --> 02:13:37.880 align:start position:0%
seex hormones that would have been a
 
02:13:40.390 --> 02:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
grave mistake I did not need blockers or
 
02:13:42.830 --> 02:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
hormones to be my so-called authentic
 
02:13:45.430 --> 02:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
self I just needed to grow up my
 
02:13:48.189 --> 02:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
experience is very common among samesex
 
02:13:50.750 --> 02:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
attracted adults I grew up to be a
 
02:13:52.990 --> 02:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
healthy happy gay man who has lived a
 
02:13:55.310 --> 02:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
full life thus far and I know many
 
02:13:58.149 --> 02:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
others with similar experience to my own
 
02:13:59.350 --> 02:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
given that childhood gender
 
02:14:01.629 --> 02:14:01.639 align:start position:0%
non-conformity is a common experience
 
02:14:04.790 --> 02:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
from most same-sex attracted adults how
 
02:14:06.109 --> 02:14:06.119 align:start position:0%
can you tell the difference between
 
02:14:08.109 --> 02:14:08.119 align:start position:0%
someone like myself who would have been
 
02:14:10.350 --> 02:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
harmed by medicalization versus someone
 
02:14:12.830 --> 02:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
who wouldn't the short answer is you
 
02:14:16.390 --> 02:14:16.400 align:start position:0%
cannot children do not know who they are
 
02:14:18.669 --> 02:14:18.679 align:start position:0%
they are children it is the duty of
 
02:14:21.350 --> 02:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
adults to orient them to reality that a
 
02:14:23.310 --> 02:14:23.320 align:start position:0%
normal part of growing up gender
 
02:14:26.030 --> 02:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
distress is no exception protect
 
02:14:29.109 --> 02:14:29.119 align:start position:0%
vulnerable kids like I was let kids be
 
02:14:32.189 --> 02:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
kids let them grow up just as I did
 
02:14:35.030 --> 02:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
gender transition is an adult decision
 
02:14:37.270 --> 02:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
that children are incapable of making
 
02:14:39.149 --> 02:14:39.159 align:start position:0%
this is why I order you to or this is
 
02:14:43.030 --> 02:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
why I urge you to support HB 377 thank
 
02:14:47.549 --> 02:14:47.559 align:start position:0%

trans boys both of who started
 
02:18:33.589 --> 02:18:33.599 align:start position:0%
testosterone before age 18 in strong
 
02:18:35.709 --> 02:18:35.719 align:start position:0%
opposition to hb33 could move the
 
02:18:37.469 --> 02:18:37.479 align:start position:0%

02:18:41.870 --> 02:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
okay um when my middle child told me he
 
02:18:43.629 --> 02:18:43.639 align:start position:0%
was trans I was confused and even felt a
 
02:18:45.030 --> 02:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
little betrayed as a woman what was
 
02:18:46.549 --> 02:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
wrong with being a girl had I not
 
02:18:48.950 --> 02:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
modeled Womanhood effectively thankfully
 
02:18:50.469 --> 02:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
those feelings faded quickly as I talked
 
02:18:51.870 --> 02:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
with my son and did more reading about
 
02:18:53.910 --> 02:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
what it's what it's like to be trans but
 
02:18:55.750 --> 02:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
I'm still ashamed of My First
 
02:18:57.549 --> 02:18:57.559 align:start position:0%
Reactions I'm telling you this so you
 
02:18:59.070 --> 02:18:59.080 align:start position:0%
can understand that like all parents of
 
02:19:00.709 --> 02:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
trans kids this was not something his
 
02:19:03.070 --> 02:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
father or or I pushed upon him well my
 
02:19:04.270 --> 02:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
husband and I were always open to the
 
02:19:05.950 --> 02:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
idea of our kids being gay the idea that
 
02:19:07.469 --> 02:19:07.479 align:start position:0%
they might be trans transgender was
 
02:19:09.030 --> 02:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
never even a blip on our radar until our
 
02:19:12.830 --> 02:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
son came out sorry I'm super nervous um
 
02:19:14.389 --> 02:19:14.399 align:start position:0%
before coming out my son was anxious and
 
02:19:15.830 --> 02:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
depressed so we sought counseling for
 
02:19:17.790 --> 02:19:17.800 align:start position:0%
him after he came out my therap his
 
02:19:19.110 --> 02:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
therapist was able to talk with him
 
02:19:20.349 --> 02:19:20.359 align:start position:0%
about what he was feeling regarding his
 
02:19:22.549 --> 02:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
gender he was in therapy for at least
 
02:19:25.309 --> 02:19:25.319 align:start position:0%
two years before he Ser he seriously
 
02:19:26.349 --> 02:19:26.359 align:start position:0%
broached the idea of starting
 
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
testosterone which like everything in
 
02:19:30.549 --> 02:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
his life he had meticulously researched
 
02:19:32.589 --> 02:19:32.599 align:start position:0%
before asking if he could he's he's a
 
02:19:35.230 --> 02:19:35.240 align:start position:0%
refuge kid his therapists his Physicians
 
02:19:36.790 --> 02:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
and we as his parents all talk with him
 
02:19:38.349 --> 02:19:38.359 align:start position:0%
extensively about what it would mean for
 
02:19:41.070 --> 02:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
him let me be clear hormones are not
 
02:19:43.030 --> 02:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
given until there is no doubt that it is
 
02:19:44.549 --> 02:19:44.559 align:start position:0%
in an adolescent's best interest and
 
02:19:47.629 --> 02:19:47.639 align:start position:0%
that can and usually does take years to
 
02:19:48.910 --> 02:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
take this decision away from those who
 
02:19:50.469 --> 02:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
know the Adolescent best and worst to
 
02:19:52.630 --> 02:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
make it a felony to do so undermines not
 
02:19:54.270 --> 02:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
only the parent child Bond but also
 
02:19:55.950 --> 02:19:55.960 align:start position:0%
what's recognized as best practice
 
02:19:57.870 --> 02:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
medically none of these decisions are
 
02:19:59.670 --> 02:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
made like like lightly and the
 
02:20:00.950 --> 02:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
interference of the state does nothing
 
02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
to help the truly compassionate thing
 
02:20:04.790 --> 02:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
would be to trust parents their child
 
02:20:06.230 --> 02:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
and medical professionals to help make
 
02:20:07.590 --> 02:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
decisions that are in the child's best
 
02:20:09.349 --> 02:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
interest I hope that you'll take our
 
02:20:10.630 --> 02:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
experience into consideration when
 
02:20:11.750 --> 02:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
voting on this bill and deem it
 
02:20:13.349 --> 02:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to
 
02:20:16.990 --> 02:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you any question any
 
02:20:18.469 --> 02:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
taking questions any question
 
02:20:20.990 --> 02:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I was just
 
02:20:24.630 --> 02:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
wondering the a sorry I was just
 
02:20:27.429 --> 02:20:27.439 align:start position:0%
wondering the ages of your sons um my

middle child is 21 and my youngest is 17
 
02:20:32.790 --> 02:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
 
02:20:32.800 --> 02:20:34.950 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you
representative

02:20:34.950 --> 02:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:20:37.429 --> 02:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
delus thank you Mr chair this is
 
02:20:39.550 --> 02:20:39.560 align:start position:0%
actually more of a followup to uh the
 
02:20:41.790 --> 02:20:41.800 align:start position:0%
representative's question when did they
 
02:20:44.150 --> 02:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
when did they start their
 
02:20:49.270 --> 02:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
therapy um my middle was I believe 13 um
 
02:20:52.510 --> 02:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
and the youngest was 14
 
02:20:54.429 --> 02:20:54.439 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yeah and before that
 
02:20:56.790 --> 02:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
there was no like the hormone therapy
 
02:20:58.309 --> 02:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
was much much much later everything was
 
02:21:00.910 --> 02:21:00.920 align:start position:0%
social before that and you know we we
 
02:21:03.190 --> 02:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
had to wait until I don't think that
 
02:21:05.670 --> 02:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
anyone will give hormone therapy before
 
02:21:08.990 --> 02:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
at least a year of of um therapy and
 
02:21:10.590 --> 02:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
usually it's two or
 
02:21:13.389 --> 02:21:13.399 align:start position:0%
three other
 
02:21:18.830 --> 02:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:45.309 --> 02:21:45.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:48.710 --> 02:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
colie hello everyone excuse me my name
 
02:21:51.190 --> 02:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
is Stephanie colie um I am from Center
 
02:21:55.070 --> 02:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
Conway New Hampshire and I'm here to
 
02:21:56.870 --> 02:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
oppose HB
 
02:21:59.429 --> 02:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
377 um as you're probably can tell by my
 
02:22:02.910 --> 02:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
voice I am a transgender woman and so I
 
02:22:04.870 --> 02:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
have irreversible changes haven't gone
 
02:22:08.670 --> 02:22:08.680 align:start position:0%
through puberty me puberty specifically
 
02:22:11.910 --> 02:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
um so for those that have spoken about
 
02:22:15.349 --> 02:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
the fact that um children who undergo uh
 
02:22:17.910 --> 02:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
cross hormonal therapy will have um
 
02:22:20.150 --> 02:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
irreversible changes there will be
 
02:22:24.150 --> 02:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
changes regardless I assure you so um
 
02:22:26.389 --> 02:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
couple facts that I've heard many
 
02:22:30.510 --> 02:22:30.520 align:start position:0%
questions about was the um how often
 
02:22:33.270 --> 02:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
people regret it so I pulled up a couple
 
02:22:36.030 --> 02:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
of things while I was listening um to
 
02:22:40.110 --> 02:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
the earlier testimony and basically um
 
02:22:44.469 --> 02:22:44.479 align:start position:0%
according to uh a 2022 study trans kids
 
02:22:47.030 --> 02:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
are almost always right about their
 
02:22:49.990 --> 02:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
transness and so recent studies show
 
02:22:55.070 --> 02:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
that over um 97.5 to 98% of the kids who
 
02:22:57.630 --> 02:22:57.640 align:start position:0%
declare their transness maintains that
 
02:23:00.070 --> 02:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
over time in other words detransitioning
 
02:23:02.630 --> 02:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
is quite rare yes you will hear from
 
02:23:04.270 --> 02:23:04.280 align:start position:0%
people who considered it or even went
 
02:23:07.429 --> 02:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
through transition and lat a change but
 
02:23:10.710 --> 02:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
it is quite low um the other thing is
 
02:23:14.110 --> 02:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
that there was a very large study I was
 
02:23:17.429 --> 02:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
part of that in 2022 called the US trans
 
02:23:20.510 --> 02:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
survey and they studied over 90,000
 
02:23:25.469 --> 02:23:25.479 align:start position:0%
trans people 990,000 okay um and out of
 
02:23:28.230 --> 02:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
that almost no one U regrets any sort of
 
02:23:31.349 --> 02:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
gender affirming surgery and
 
02:23:33.990 --> 02:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
97% report that life
 
02:23:36.950 --> 02:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
satisfaction improved after gender
 
02:23:39.349 --> 02:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
affirming surgery and again kids are not
 
02:23:41.469 --> 02:23:41.479 align:start position:0%
getting gender affirming surgery this is
 
02:23:43.870 --> 02:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
not Jiffy Loop people one kid doesn't
 
02:23:45.550 --> 02:23:45.560 align:start position:0%
come in as a boy and goes out as a girl
 
02:23:47.469 --> 02:23:47.479 align:start position:0%
or vice versa it's not the way it
 
02:23:49.429 --> 02:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
happens it takes years even for an
 
02:23:51.990 --> 02:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
adults in my own case I was in
 
02:23:54.910 --> 02:23:54.920 align:start position:0%
counseling for oh God I can't even count
 
02:23:58.070 --> 02:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
decades um and ultimately um came out
 
02:24:01.230 --> 02:24:01.240 align:start position:0%
later in life um and I went into uh
 
02:24:03.269 --> 02:24:03.279 align:start position:0%
counseling for two years and then I went
 
02:24:05.670 --> 02:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
to lowd dose homeone therapy for about
 
02:24:08.469 --> 02:24:08.479 align:start position:0%
four to five and then finally went into
 
02:24:10.630 --> 02:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
higher levels of homo therapy and
 
02:24:12.510 --> 02:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
transition eight years after the whole
 
02:24:15.469 --> 02:24:15.479 align:start position:0%
process so this is nothing that's done
 
02:24:18.910 --> 02:24:18.920 align:start position:0%
quickly and lightly and I do do not
 
02:24:22.429 --> 02:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
think given the Hance evidence of that
 
02:24:25.309 --> 02:24:25.319 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care is helps people I
 
02:24:27.990 --> 02:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
don't think it's the position of the
 
02:24:31.349 --> 02:24:31.359 align:start position:0%
government to be you know interceding on
 
02:24:34.110 --> 02:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
against parents the children the
 
02:24:37.349 --> 02:24:37.359 align:start position:0%
patients and the doctors if there's
 
02:24:39.790 --> 02:24:39.800 align:start position:0%
evidence that comes out showing problems
 
02:24:42.950 --> 02:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
certainly that's a a different story but
 
02:24:45.030 --> 02:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
they've been using these um puberty
 
02:24:47.469 --> 02:24:47.479 align:start position:0%
blockers for four decades you have 15
 
02:24:49.870 --> 02:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
seconds okay and I'm that's pretty so I
 
02:24:52.510 --> 02:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
just you to oppose if anybody has any
 
02:24:54.670 --> 02:24:54.680 align:start position:0%
questions I'm willing to answer thank
 
02:24:57.790 --> 02:24:57.800 align:start position:0%
you any questions representative
 
02:25:01.070 --> 02:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
delus thank you Mr chairman I'm I'm
 
02:25:03.670 --> 02:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
interested to know when what age did you
 
02:25:08.670 --> 02:25:08.680 align:start position:0%
start the hormone therapy I was
 
02:25:12.990 --> 02:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
53 I'm I'm almost 70 now I'm 69 almost
 
02:25:16.750 --> 02:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
70 so as an as an adult correct you've
 
02:25:19.230 --> 02:25:19.240 align:start position:0%
made this decision yes and I regret not
 
02:25:22.790 --> 02:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
having that option I knew at age 4 which
 
02:25:25.309 --> 02:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
was 1959 if you want to do the
 
02:25:31.429 --> 02:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
math um that I was female but back then
 
02:25:33.550 --> 02:25:33.560 align:start position:0%
that was not an option and I feel like
 
02:25:34.950 --> 02:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get pulled back into
 
02:25:37.670 --> 02:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
those bad old days okay thank
 
02:25:39.910 --> 02:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:25:42.710 --> 02:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
Castle thank you for the question thank
 
02:25:45.030 --> 02:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um I just have a question
 
02:25:46.950 --> 02:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
specific to your experience you said you
 
02:25:49.349 --> 02:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
were four so my question would be if you
 
02:25:51.750 --> 02:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
were to take those hormon then would you
 
02:25:53.950 --> 02:25:53.960 align:start position:0%
have a concern of other I mean would you
 
02:25:55.469 --> 02:25:55.479 align:start position:0%
be concerned now that you would have had
 
02:25:57.710 --> 02:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
other issues and developmental and
 
02:25:59.150 --> 02:25:59.160 align:start position:0%
things like that that would have
 
02:26:00.910 --> 02:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
affected you negatively now in your
 
02:26:03.870 --> 02:26:03.880 align:start position:0%
later years um well first of all at age
 
02:26:05.190 --> 02:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
four you would never start
 
02:26:07.790 --> 02:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
hormonotherapy not then certainly but
 
02:26:11.429 --> 02:26:11.439 align:start position:0%
not now CH when children at a young age
 
02:26:14.630 --> 02:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
present um with gender dysphoria they go
 
02:26:17.030 --> 02:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
through counseling for quite a while and
 
02:26:19.870 --> 02:26:19.880 align:start position:0%
then they socially transition with the
 
02:26:22.550 --> 02:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
parent involvement um the psych
 
02:26:24.469 --> 02:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist psychologist therapist
 
02:26:27.070 --> 02:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
whatever um the doctor um they go
 
02:26:28.870 --> 02:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
through social transition meaning they
 
02:26:30.670 --> 02:26:30.680 align:start position:0%
just dress appropriately for whatever
 
02:26:32.990 --> 02:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
they feel comfortable um change their
 
02:26:35.910 --> 02:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
hairstyle Etc it's not until they I
 
02:26:38.309 --> 02:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
believe the it's Tanner stage two
 
02:26:39.870 --> 02:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
puberty I think that question was asked
 
02:26:43.950 --> 02:26:43.960 align:start position:0%
earlier when they begin um having um uh
 
02:26:46.590 --> 02:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
puberty blockers and it's a Tanner stage
 
02:26:50.030 --> 02:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
two um at that point of puberty they
 
02:26:53.070 --> 02:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
then consider the um puberty blockage
 
02:26:55.030 --> 02:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
because that allows the child and the
 
02:26:56.710 --> 02:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
family and the doctors and the
 
02:26:59.349 --> 02:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
therapists time to see if this trans and
 
02:27:01.630 --> 02:27:01.640 align:start position:0%
this maintains itself that this child
 
02:27:03.710 --> 02:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
truly does want it or it's just a phase
 
02:27:07.230 --> 02:27:07.240 align:start position:0%
or they're exploring so so you never
 
02:27:09.230 --> 02:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
you're not going to start any the any
 
02:27:11.670 --> 02:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
sort of drugs surgery or anything at age
 
02:27:14.349 --> 02:27:14.359 align:start position:0%
four follow follow up so then I guess
 
02:27:17.349 --> 02:27:17.359 align:start position:0%
I'll re rephrase the question if there
 
02:27:19.429 --> 02:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
were scientifical proof that it would
 
02:27:21.950 --> 02:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
cause detrimental harm to a child would
 
02:27:24.630 --> 02:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
you be opposed to us passing a bill that
 
02:27:26.150 --> 02:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
would make it to 18 if there was
 
02:27:29.870 --> 02:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
scientific um evidence of harm the
 
02:27:32.230 --> 02:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
medical societies which all support this
 
02:27:34.269 --> 02:27:34.279 align:start position:0%
would be against it they're the ones
 
02:27:36.150 --> 02:27:36.160 align:start position:0%
that study this they do the follow-up
 
02:27:38.230 --> 02:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
studies and when they come out with
 
02:27:40.110 --> 02:27:40.120 align:start position:0%
information that indicates a particular
 
02:27:44.269 --> 02:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
therapy is dangerous to to um you know
 
02:27:46.349 --> 02:27:46.359 align:start position:0%
in the preponderance of evidence they're
 
02:27:48.389 --> 02:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
going they're going to stop that as well
 
02:27:50.670 --> 02:27:50.680 align:start position:0%
I was I was a healthare professional for
 
02:27:54.309 --> 02:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
41 years as a nurse for 35 and I saw a
 
02:27:57.110 --> 02:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
lot of changes in those decades and
 
02:27:59.150 --> 02:27:59.160 align:start position:0%
during that time I saw things that were
 
02:28:01.990 --> 02:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
set in stone that then later changed but
 
02:28:04.269 --> 02:28:04.279 align:start position:0%
again these medicines have been studied
 
02:28:06.429 --> 02:28:06.439 align:start position:0%
for decades they've been using that for
 
02:28:09.590 --> 02:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
precocious puberty for I think 40 years
 
02:28:10.830 --> 02:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
so that's a long time they've been
 
02:28:11.950 --> 02:28:11.960 align:start position:0%
looking at this stuff and they'll
 
02:28:15.630 --> 02:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
continue to look at it and so and again
 
02:28:17.190 --> 02:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
people have said well there's potential

I will remind you that suicide is one of
 
02:28:25.630 --> 02:28:25.640 align:start position:0%
the lead leading causes of

stability okay so and suicide is quite
 
02:28:30.750 --> 02:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
high in our rate and trust me I know
 
02:28:32.269 --> 02:28:32.279 align:start position:0%

21-year-old transgender man and I
 
02:29:33.790 --> 02:29:33.800 align:start position:0%
vehemently oppose this bill I was 13
 
02:29:35.910 --> 02:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
when I first realized I was trans and I
 
02:29:38.590 --> 02:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
had gone through an estrogen field field
 
02:29:41.389 --> 02:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
uh puberty long before then I was eight
 
02:29:44.429 --> 02:29:44.439 align:start position:0%
when I had my first period and at that
 
02:29:46.630 --> 02:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
point I had also started to grow to grow
 
02:29:50.150 --> 02:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
breasts um I had all the Hallmarks of a
 
02:29:52.790 --> 02:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
female body I had never felt comfortable
 
02:29:55.550 --> 02:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
during or after puberty I was told by
 
02:29:57.150 --> 02:29:57.160 align:start position:0%
family members at the time that I would
 
02:30:00.070 --> 02:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
get over it uh but I never did doctors
 
02:30:02.389 --> 02:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
never took me seriously their priority
 
02:30:04.190 --> 02:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
was always making sure that I could bear
 
02:30:07.429 --> 02:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
children any he push to maintain my own
 
02:30:11.030 --> 02:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
bodily autonomy was met with lectures
 
02:30:12.990 --> 02:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
about how it may negatively impact my
 
02:30:15.349 --> 02:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
ability to be a mother I never wanted to
 
02:30:18.349 --> 02:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
be a mother all of that push back and
 
02:30:20.750 --> 02:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
incessant reminders of my worth as a
 
02:30:23.030 --> 02:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
reproductive vessel was Amplified
 
02:30:26.110 --> 02:30:26.120 align:start position:0%
10-fold 2 years after coming out when I
 
02:30:29.750 --> 02:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
set sought a medical transition before I
 
02:30:31.190 --> 02:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
could even be considered for
 
02:30:33.230 --> 02:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
testosterone I had to get a letter from
 
02:30:34.990 --> 02:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
a therapist stating that I had been
 
02:30:37.110 --> 02:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
consistent in a diagnosis of gender
 
02:30:39.870 --> 02:30:39.880 align:start position:0%
dysphoria for at least a year I filled
 
02:30:42.190 --> 02:30:42.200 align:start position:0%
out form after form telling me the risks
 
02:30:44.790 --> 02:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
and when I was 14 I finally got to go on
 
02:30:46.670 --> 02:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
testosterone and just as medical
 
02:30:48.750 --> 02:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
literature from Decades of research has
 
02:30:51.110 --> 02:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
confirmed time and again it D
 
02:30:53.429 --> 02:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
dramatically improved my mental and
 
02:30:55.790 --> 02:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
physical well-being as any necessary
 
02:30:58.230 --> 02:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
medical treatment should I am not
 
02:30:59.750 --> 02:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
exaggerating when I say that gender
 
02:31:01.750 --> 02:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
affirming care is the reason I am alive
 
02:31:05.469 --> 02:31:05.479 align:start position:0%

02:32:12.670 --> 02:32:12.680 align:start position:0%
I'm an 18-year-old trans man I oppose
 
02:32:15.389 --> 02:32:15.399 align:start position:0%
this bill I will be speaking about my
 
02:32:18.389 --> 02:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
personal experiences with HRT hormone
 
02:32:20.630 --> 02:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
replacement therapy and some pieces of
 
02:32:20.640 --> 02:32:21.910 align:start position:0%
replacement therapy and some pieces of
important

02:32:21.910 --> 02:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:32:26.030 --> 02:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
history I started HRT when I was 15 I
 
02:32:27.910 --> 02:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
remember the excitement I felt with each
 
02:32:30.670 --> 02:32:30.680 align:start position:0%
change I experienced and how truly
 
02:32:32.670 --> 02:32:32.680 align:start position:0%
confident I felt in my body for the
 
02:32:34.510 --> 02:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
first time in my
 
02:32:37.550 --> 02:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
life unfortunately that came to an end
 
02:32:40.790 --> 02:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
all too soon as at 16 I was diagnosed
 
02:32:43.870 --> 02:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
with stage 4 Hodgkins lymphoma for
 
02:32:46.950 --> 02:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
safety reasons I could not be on HRT and
 
02:32:49.830 --> 02:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
chemo at the same time so now along with
 
02:32:52.230 --> 02:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
with being stuck in a body that was
 
02:32:54.870 --> 02:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
slowly killing itself and being killed
 
02:32:57.269 --> 02:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
by chemo I was stuck in a body that no
 
02:32:59.990 --> 02:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
longer aligned with how I saw myself as
 
02:33:03.710 --> 02:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
once you stop HRT most of the changes
 
02:33:06.309 --> 02:33:06.319 align:start position:0%
reverse I was old enough to choose to
 
02:33:09.269 --> 02:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
start chemo and my cancer related scans
 
02:33:12.349 --> 02:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
that gave me large doses of radiation if
 
02:33:14.429 --> 02:33:14.439 align:start position:0%
I was deemed old enough to choose those
 
02:33:16.710 --> 02:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
drugs that could have killed me then I
 
02:33:18.790 --> 02:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
was old enough to decide what else I
 
02:33:20.830 --> 02:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
wanted to do with my
 
02:33:23.910 --> 02:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
body now I'm in complete remission and
 
02:33:27.269 --> 02:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
I've been back on HRT for about a year
 
02:33:29.309 --> 02:33:29.319 align:start position:0%
it has practically saved my mental
 
02:33:31.469 --> 02:33:31.479 align:start position:0%
health and it saves the mental health of
 
02:33:35.030 --> 02:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
many other trans youth many of which I
 
02:33:37.790 --> 02:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
know with the introduction of all these
 
02:33:40.670 --> 02:33:40.680 align:start position:0%
anti-trans laws presented in just the
 
02:33:43.630 --> 02:33:43.640 align:start position:0%
last two months along with one being
 
02:33:45.349 --> 02:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
presented to along with the one being
 
02:33:47.750 --> 02:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
presented today these laws and bills are
 
02:33:50.750 --> 02:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
trying to scare trans kids into clients
 
02:33:54.190 --> 02:33:54.200 align:start position:0%
so that they can erase trans people do
 
02:33:56.230 --> 02:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
you know who else had tried to erase
 
02:34:00.110 --> 02:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
trans people in the past the Nazis did
 
02:34:02.510 --> 02:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
just three months into Hitler's Reign
 
02:34:04.790 --> 02:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
the Nazis attacked the first queer and
 
02:34:07.550 --> 02:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
trans clinic and burned all papers and
 
02:34:09.910 --> 02:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
books retaining to trans people and
 
02:34:12.670 --> 02:34:12.680 align:start position:0%
their health care we've already seen
 
02:34:15.150 --> 02:34:15.160 align:start position:0%
similar Erasure in our own country with
 
02:34:17.389 --> 02:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
the word transgender simply being erased
 
02:34:19.190 --> 02:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
from all government sites among many
 
02:34:20.990 --> 02:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
other laws and executive orders
 
02:34:22.429 --> 02:34:22.439 align:start position:0%
attacking our
 
02:34:24.710 --> 02:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
community it's been two months and the
 
02:34:26.990 --> 02:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
law is already trying to erase us how
 
02:34:28.990 --> 02:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
long until books start getting burned
 
02:34:31.469 --> 02:34:31.479 align:start position:0%
again I assume not long since books
 
02:34:33.110 --> 02:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
discussing trans people are already
 
02:34:34.750 --> 02:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
being banned from
 
02:34:38.349 --> 02:34:38.359 align:start position:0%
schools a quote from um Henry Chine in
 
02:34:40.469 --> 02:34:40.479 align:start position:0%
which the book containing it was burned
 
02:34:43.349 --> 02:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
that day by the Nazis where they burn
 
02:34:45.710 --> 02:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
books in the end they will burn humans
 
02:34:48.349 --> 02:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
too this bill is the Stepping Stones to
 
02:34:50.349 --> 02:34:50.359 align:start position:0%
do the same thing as the not
 
02:34:53.230 --> 02:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
erase trans people those who do not
 
02:34:55.269 --> 02:34:55.279 align:start position:0%
learn from history are destined to
 
02:34:57.429 --> 02:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
repeat it if you do not learn from
 
02:35:00.030 --> 02:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
history and decide to pass this bill you
 
02:35:02.830 --> 02:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
are doing the same thing as the Nazis
 
02:35:05.870 --> 02:35:05.880 align:start position:0%

02:36:12.550 --> 02:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
encounter horrendous legislation
 
02:36:14.990 --> 02:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
emerging from this body in response to
 
02:36:20.190 --> 02:36:20.200 align:start position:0%
unfounded fear HB 377 FN is based on
 
02:36:23.110 --> 02:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
inaccurate assumptions by folks who know
 
02:36:25.230 --> 02:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
little about gender affirming
 
02:36:27.469 --> 02:36:27.479 align:start position:0%
care I speak with
 
02:36:30.269 --> 02:36:30.279 align:start position:0%
compassion and love for my family
 
02:36:34.750 --> 02:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
members and for the lgbtqi
 
02:36:37.150 --> 02:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
community to quote an inspiring young
 
02:36:39.230 --> 02:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
person I heard testify in another
 
02:36:41.389 --> 02:36:41.399 align:start position:0%
committee regarding hateful bills that
 
02:36:43.870 --> 02:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
would harm her sibling I'm not going to
 
02:36:45.870 --> 02:36:45.880 align:start position:0%
answer questions because there should
 
02:36:47.950 --> 02:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
not be any questions about what I say
 
02:36:47.960 --> 02:36:49.630 align:start position:0%
not be any questions about what I say
here

02:36:49.630 --> 02:36:49.640 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:36:51.950 --> 02:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
that young person said there should not
 
02:36:54.150 --> 02:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
be any questions because healthc care is
 
02:36:55.750 --> 02:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
a human
 
02:36:58.550 --> 02:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
right this bill does nothing to help
 
02:37:02.309 --> 02:37:02.319 align:start position:0%
children it does direct harm to children
 
02:37:06.670 --> 02:37:06.680 align:start position:0%
the title of HB 377 is vulnerable
 
02:37:11.309 --> 02:37:11.319 align:start position:0%
children compassion and protection act
 
02:37:13.389 --> 02:37:13.399 align:start position:0%
we need a definition for compassion in
 
02:37:13.399 --> 02:37:14.269 align:start position:0%
we need a definition for compassion in
this

02:37:14.269 --> 02:37:14.279 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:37:14.279 --> 02:37:16.070 align:start position:0%
this
hearing

02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:37:19.110 --> 02:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
compassion a feeling of deep sympathy
 
02:37:21.269 --> 02:37:21.279 align:start position:0%
and sor sorrow for another who is
 
02:37:24.670 --> 02:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
stricken by Misfortune accompanied by a
 
02:37:27.349 --> 02:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
strong desire to alleviate
 
02:37:31.389 --> 02:37:31.399 align:start position:0%
suffering this proposed act does not
 
02:37:35.070 --> 02:37:35.080 align:start position:0%
evoke deep sympathy for children nor
 
02:37:37.429 --> 02:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
does it include a strong desire to
 
02:37:40.150 --> 02:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
alleviate the suffering of said
 
02:37:43.269 --> 02:37:43.279 align:start position:0%
children in fact this act promotes the
 
02:37:45.389 --> 02:37:45.399 align:start position:0%
criminalization of trained medical
 
02:37:47.670 --> 02:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
professionals whose years of training is
 
02:37:50.910 --> 02:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
backed by years of scientific research
 
02:37:53.349 --> 02:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
in criminalizing professionals this bill
 
02:37:56.710 --> 02:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
also does direct harm to their
 
02:38:01.590 --> 02:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
patients the word protection means care
 
02:38:06.030 --> 02:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
guardianship who are you trying to
 
02:38:08.670 --> 02:38:08.680 align:start position:0%
protect if it is the patience you are
 
02:38:12.429 --> 02:38:12.439 align:start position:0%
trying to protect then rip this bill up
 
02:38:14.429 --> 02:38:14.439 align:start position:0%
it does nothing to protect
 
02:38:17.190 --> 02:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
children I strongly urge you to oppose
 
02:38:21.750 --> 02:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
this bill and vote Yes for
 
02:38:28.070 --> 02:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:31.030 --> 02:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak I have the
 
02:38:43.429 --> 02:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:46.070 --> 02:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
here is that is that your first name
 
02:38:48.269 --> 02:38:48.279 align:start position:0%
last name
 
02:38:51.830 --> 02:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
um yeah yeah sorry um winter is my first
 
02:38:55.230 --> 02:38:55.240 align:start position:0%

so thank you I
 
02:39:06.190 --> 02:39:06.200 align:start position:0%
strongly advise opposing this uh this
 
02:39:09.030 --> 02:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
bill because
 
02:39:14.429 --> 02:39:14.439 align:start position:0%
like I was once very suicidal and that's
 
02:39:16.670 --> 02:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
mainly because I had a bad therapist and
 
02:39:18.710 --> 02:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
couldn't get the help I get I've had
 
02:39:20.670 --> 02:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
transfer friends and still have them
 
02:39:25.230 --> 02:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
that are really suicidal and uh well
 
02:39:26.910 --> 02:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
because they don't feel love they're not
 
02:39:30.030 --> 02:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
getting the help and care they need and
 
02:39:32.550 --> 02:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
that's very important because like
 
02:39:34.830 --> 02:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
coming from a trans person if I didn't
 
02:39:37.510 --> 02:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
get the help eventually such as hormones
 
02:39:40.309 --> 02:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
and blockers I'm going be real I don't
 
02:39:43.670 --> 02:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
even know if I'd be alive right now
 
02:39:51.190 --> 02:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:54.830 --> 02:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
it's very important
 
02:39:59.349 --> 02:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
to support young kids instead of take
 
02:39:59.359 --> 02:40:03.469 align:start position:0%
to support young kids instead of take
away

02:40:03.469 --> 02:40:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:06.870 --> 02:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
and uh yeah
 
02:40:10.070 --> 02:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
and I kind of lost my train of thought
 
02:40:13.710 --> 02:40:13.720 align:start position:0%
um questions are welcome okay hey I
 
02:40:17.550 --> 02:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
representative Weber huh thank you Weber
 
02:40:18.950 --> 02:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you very much for
 
02:40:22.269 --> 02:40:22.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question my question is could
 
02:40:24.910 --> 02:40:24.920 align:start position:0%
you tell us a little more about your
 
02:40:27.590 --> 02:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
life before you started taking uh
 
02:40:31.429 --> 02:40:31.439 align:start position:0%
hormones and after and what changes you
 
02:40:33.710 --> 02:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
saw okay so I if you're willing to
 
02:40:34.870 --> 02:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
discuss that I don't want to be
 
02:40:37.469 --> 02:40:37.479 align:start position:0%
intrusive no it's okay I'm totally fine
 
02:40:39.150 --> 02:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
with it
 
02:40:42.790 --> 02:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
so I would like crossdress in this
 
02:40:45.230 --> 02:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
little or fan costume when I was about
 
02:40:48.030 --> 02:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
like I don't know 3 years old I remember
 
02:40:50.190 --> 02:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
it vaguely and
 
02:40:52.190 --> 02:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
I would wear this fairy costume
 
02:40:53.990 --> 02:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
constantly when I was like four after
 
02:40:57.710 --> 02:40:57.720 align:start position:0%
going trick-or treating and honestly
 
02:41:01.389 --> 02:41:01.399 align:start position:0%
um once like I had major depression
 
02:41:04.990 --> 02:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
beforeand cuz I don't think Mom and Dad
 
02:41:06.910 --> 02:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
knew what trans was I didn't know what
 
02:41:09.670 --> 02:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
trans were was I didn't know have the
 
02:41:13.429 --> 02:41:13.439 align:start position:0%
language to describe it and so when I
 
02:41:18.389 --> 02:41:18.399 align:start position:0%
did uh yeah everything changed I when I
 
02:41:21.110 --> 02:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
start to raise me as a girl I felt whole
 
02:41:24.790 --> 02:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
again and before all that
 
02:41:28.590 --> 02:41:28.600 align:start position:0%
um I would that was basically it I was
 
02:41:32.550 --> 02:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
happy and it was great until one day I
 
02:41:34.950 --> 02:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
hit a tiny bit of male puberty I got the
 
02:41:37.349 --> 02:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
blockers and it really helped me out
 
02:41:40.870 --> 02:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
emotionally and later on in a nutshell
 
02:41:46.190 --> 02:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
long story short got the hormones and uh
 
02:41:48.150 --> 02:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
I find it very important and very
 
02:41:50.230 --> 02:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
meaningful and
 
02:41:53.030 --> 02:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
strongly um
 
02:41:56.670 --> 02:41:56.680 align:start position:0%

02:42:01.309 --> 02:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
representative Castle ring thank you Mr
 
02:42:02.870 --> 02:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
02:42:04.710 --> 02:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned that you had changed
 
02:42:07.030 --> 02:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
therapists I'm just curious if the new
 
02:42:08.870 --> 02:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
therapist that you have recommended the
 
02:42:10.550 --> 02:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
therapy that you're currently doing or
 
02:42:12.990 --> 02:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
the course of action that you're
 
02:42:18.150 --> 02:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
doing my old therapist was a jerk who uh
 
02:42:22.510 --> 02:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
honestly was unsupportive and uh wasn't
 
02:42:24.790 --> 02:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
very nice and wasn't really a good
 
02:42:28.429 --> 02:42:28.439 align:start position:0%
person so I switched to a therapist I
 
02:42:30.150 --> 02:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
used to have when I was nine who was
 
02:42:31.630 --> 02:42:31.640 align:start position:0%
actually trans
 
02:42:31.640 --> 02:42:33.349 align:start position:0%
actually trans
himself

02:42:33.349 --> 02:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
himself
 
02:42:33.359 --> 02:42:35.670 align:start position:0%
himself
and

02:42:35.670 --> 02:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:42:39.230 --> 02:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
uh it just kind of happened
 
02:42:43.230 --> 02:42:43.240 align:start position:0%
cuz my um old therapist was uneducated
 
02:42:46.309 --> 02:42:46.319 align:start position:0%
and I couldn't get the care I needed
 
02:42:50.710 --> 02:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
so no they didn't set me up with a new
 
02:42:50.720 --> 02:42:52.389 align:start position:0%
so no they didn't set me up with a new
therapist

02:42:52.389 --> 02:42:52.399 align:start position:0%

School I am well trained in child
 
02:44:49.910 --> 02:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
psychology and and one of the things I
 
02:44:53.030 --> 02:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring up is that when we have
 
02:44:56.150 --> 02:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
what childhood is about is De developing
 
02:44:59.309 --> 02:44:59.319 align:start position:0%
and growing they're not just Smalls siiz
 
02:45:01.910 --> 02:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
humans there's a lot of work going on
 
02:45:04.910 --> 02:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
inside of their um mental capacity and
 
02:45:07.510 --> 02:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
their emotional development they do the
 
02:45:09.590 --> 02:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
obvious things like grow and have sports
 
02:45:11.710 --> 02:45:11.720 align:start position:0%
and and they learn things in school
 
02:45:14.590 --> 02:45:14.600 align:start position:0%
facts and and skills but they also
 
02:45:17.469 --> 02:45:17.479 align:start position:0%
inside of their mind they are also
 
02:45:20.030 --> 02:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
working out many emotional things that
 
02:45:22.950 --> 02:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
they need to to master in order to
 
02:45:26.070 --> 02:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
become adults we develop a sense of
 
02:45:29.070 --> 02:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
identity we develop our understanding of
 
02:45:32.590 --> 02:45:32.600 align:start position:0%
relationships um our sense of self and
 
02:45:35.309 --> 02:45:35.319 align:start position:0%
um how we relate to the world we cover
 
02:45:37.510 --> 02:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
philosophical things who am I what am I
 
02:45:39.790 --> 02:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
here for and all of those things are
 
02:45:42.389 --> 02:45:42.399 align:start position:0%
covered for a minor while they're on
 
02:45:46.910 --> 02:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
their way to adulthood and um so you
 
02:45:49.110 --> 02:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
could look at what what are they
 
02:45:52.389 --> 02:45:52.399 align:start position:0%
important tools of a child let's look if
 
02:45:55.870 --> 02:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
many times they would take on roles in
 
02:45:57.990 --> 02:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
order to see well I'm going to be a
 
02:46:00.070 --> 02:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
pirate I'm going to be a princess I'm
 
02:46:03.070 --> 02:46:03.080 align:start position:0%
going to be a doctor I'm going to be a
 
02:46:05.150 --> 02:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
firefighter you know and and they might
 
02:46:08.870 --> 02:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
live out those things for a while um
 
02:46:11.110 --> 02:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
what we do with our imagination is very
 
02:46:14.190 --> 02:46:14.200 align:start position:0%
important and just as a carpenter skills
 
02:46:17.710 --> 02:46:17.720 align:start position:0%
um their tools are a saw and hammers a
 
02:46:20.030 --> 02:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
child's tools are there imagination and
 
02:46:23.990 --> 02:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
play and in those processes they need to
 
02:46:26.870 --> 02:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
have the ability in their formative
 
02:46:29.349 --> 02:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
years that the things they do are not
 
02:46:32.110 --> 02:46:32.120 align:start position:0%
permanent they can play with this thing
 
02:46:33.950 --> 02:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
they can play it through they might
 
02:46:37.630 --> 02:46:37.640 align:start position:0%
become a firefighter they might become
 
02:46:40.429 --> 02:46:40.439 align:start position:0%
the other gender later with the facility
 
02:46:43.110 --> 02:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
of of Medical Science 15 seconds left
 
02:46:45.190 --> 02:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
and so uh we need to make sure that the
 
02:46:47.710 --> 02:46:47.720 align:start position:0%
children remain in that protected state
 
02:46:50.469 --> 02:46:50.479 align:start position:0%
that the things that they do are not um
 
02:46:53.110 --> 02:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
permanent that they can reverse
 
02:46:56.510 --> 02:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
them thank you thank you any
 
02:46:59.269 --> 02:46:59.279 align:start position:0%
questions representative CLE ring thank
 
02:47:00.469 --> 02:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
02:47:02.510 --> 02:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
question um I have a question for you
 
02:47:05.150 --> 02:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
with your experience um have you seen a
 
02:47:07.269 --> 02:47:07.279 align:start position:0%
lot of kids with uh let's call it gender
 
02:47:10.429 --> 02:47:10.439 align:start position:0%
distress in their youth um change their
 
02:47:13.070 --> 02:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
mind when they oh yes okay oh yes say
 
02:47:14.429 --> 02:47:14.439 align:start position:0%
that's a large portion of it or a small
 
02:47:19.110 --> 02:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
portion uh most most most do thank you
 
02:47:19.120 --> 02:47:20.269 align:start position:0%
portion uh most most most do thank you
representative

02:47:20.269 --> 02:47:20.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:47:22.429 --> 02:47:22.439 align:start position:0%
lamon thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:47:25.870 --> 02:47:25.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um but have you
 
02:47:28.429 --> 02:47:28.439 align:start position:0%
seen children that don't change their
 
02:47:32.230 --> 02:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
mind from your testimony it it sounds as
 
02:47:36.429 --> 02:47:36.439 align:start position:0%
if you don't believe that uh there are
 
02:47:40.670 --> 02:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
trans children that yes indeed we we've
 
02:47:42.710 --> 02:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
heard many examples already today that
 
02:47:45.269 --> 02:47:45.279 align:start position:0%
there are people who have a very firmly
 
02:47:49.070 --> 02:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
um consistent uh view of themselves in a
 
02:47:51.349 --> 02:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
particular role in a particular gender
 
02:47:54.910 --> 02:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
and it is unfortunate that in the uh
 
02:47:57.750 --> 02:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
current landscape of ideas and social
 
02:48:00.349 --> 02:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
Society is that the idea of changing
 
02:48:03.590 --> 02:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
genders is right on the table with other
 
02:48:06.469 --> 02:48:06.479 align:start position:0%
options and so it it becomes a little
 
02:48:09.630 --> 02:48:09.640 align:start position:0%
too easy for children to to look in that
 
02:48:11.630 --> 02:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
direction however they still May
 
02:48:15.670 --> 02:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
maintain that and become adulthood they
 
02:48:19.950 --> 02:48:19.960 align:start position:0%
could finish the procedure um yes
 
02:48:19.960 --> 02:48:21.910 align:start position:0%
could finish the procedure um yes
please

02:48:21.910 --> 02:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
please
 
02:48:25.230 --> 02:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
um but would you not agree that uh
 
02:48:29.150 --> 02:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
puberty blockers which this bill would
 
02:48:33.309 --> 02:48:33.319 align:start position:0%
prohibit um may give a child an
 
02:48:37.309 --> 02:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
option to really work things through
 
02:48:40.469 --> 02:48:40.479 align:start position:0%
give them time to decide and figure out
 
02:48:43.150 --> 02:48:43.160 align:start position:0%
whether it's a passing phase or they are
 
02:48:46.990 --> 02:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
truly um trans children and would it not
 
02:48:48.870 --> 02:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
give them
 
02:48:48.880 --> 02:48:49.910 align:start position:0%
give them
the

02:48:49.910 --> 02:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:48:49.920 --> 02:48:51.590 align:start position:0%
the
option

02:48:51.590 --> 02:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
option
 
02:48:56.230 --> 02:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
uh to transition later without having to
 
02:49:01.190 --> 02:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
go through puberty um and a and the
 
02:49:04.790 --> 02:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
gender which they really do not
 
02:49:07.429 --> 02:49:07.439 align:start position:0%
yesong as long as it's reversible it
 
02:49:09.950 --> 02:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
would make some sense but quite
 
02:49:12.469 --> 02:49:12.479 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the puberty blockers once
 
02:49:14.429 --> 02:49:14.439 align:start position:0%
you pass the years of puberty you cannot
 
02:49:16.950 --> 02:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
go back and have puberty thank goodness
 
02:49:19.710 --> 02:49:19.720 align:start position:0%
for most of us puberty was a difficult
 
02:49:22.349 --> 02:49:22.359 align:start position:0%
time and you know we all have some sort
 
02:49:24.870 --> 02:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
of um
 
02:49:27.269 --> 02:49:27.279 align:start position:0%
Amnesia various phases of repression of
 
02:49:28.710 --> 02:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
the things that were difficult then but
 
02:49:30.870 --> 02:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
that we somehow or rather managed to get
 
02:49:34.030 --> 02:49:34.040 align:start position:0%
through it is it is unfortunate that
 
02:49:37.070 --> 02:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
it's a med like that is not reversible
 
02:49:39.030 --> 02:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
because then they can't just try
 
02:49:41.229 --> 02:49:41.239 align:start position:0%
it follow
 
02:49:44.469 --> 02:49:44.479 align:start position:0%
followup um I believe most of the
 
02:49:46.349 --> 02:49:46.359 align:start position:0%
testimony we have and the evidence
 
02:49:49.150 --> 02:49:49.160 align:start position:0%
online is that they are reversible
 
02:49:49.160 --> 02:49:50.150 align:start position:0%
online is that they are reversible
puberty

02:49:50.150 --> 02:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
puberty
 
02:49:53.429 --> 02:49:53.439 align:start position:0%
blockers if you go all the way to
 
02:49:57.150 --> 02:49:57.160 align:start position:0%
adulthood and you haven't had puberty
 
02:49:58.910 --> 02:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
you can't go back and get
 
02:50:02.389 --> 02:50:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:05.229 --> 02:50:05.239 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
 
02:50:05.239 --> 02:50:11.389 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay thank you
thank

do uh hello uh my name is Savannah
 
02:50:37.190 --> 02:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
Griffin I'm from Bradford New Hampshire
 
02:50:41.990 --> 02:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
um and I'm a transwoman i there's been a
 
02:50:44.110 --> 02:50:44.120 align:start position:0%
lot of talk
 
02:50:49.790 --> 02:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
about regret and permanent irreversible
 
02:50:53.229 --> 02:50:53.239 align:start position:0%
decisions and let me start by saying
 
02:50:57.830 --> 02:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
that my biggest regret is not
 
02:50:57.840 --> 02:50:59.550 align:start position:0%
that my biggest regret is not
transitioning

02:50:59.550 --> 02:50:59.560 align:start position:0%
transitioning
 
02:50:59.560 --> 02:51:01.269 align:start position:0%
transitioning
sooner

02:51:01.269 --> 02:51:01.279 align:start position:0%
sooner
 
02:51:06.190 --> 02:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
um and as for irreversible
 
02:51:10.150 --> 02:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
changes suicide is an extremely
 
02:51:10.160 --> 02:51:11.469 align:start position:0%
changes suicide is an extremely
irreversible

02:51:11.469 --> 02:51:11.479 align:start position:0%
irreversible
 
02:51:15.550 --> 02:51:15.560 align:start position:0%
change um when I was
 
02:51:19.110 --> 02:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
17 before I had come out I would was
 
02:51:23.150 --> 02:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
suffering severe depression and driving
 
02:51:26.190 --> 02:51:26.200 align:start position:0%
home from school one day I drove my
 
02:51:29.750 --> 02:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
truck off the road hoping I would not be
 
02:51:31.469 --> 02:51:31.479 align:start position:0%
alive at the end of
 
02:51:35.229 --> 02:51:35.239 align:start position:0%
it luckily I
 
02:51:35.239 --> 02:51:36.910 align:start position:0%
it luckily I
survived

02:51:36.910 --> 02:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
survived
 
02:51:42.190 --> 02:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
and I started counseling and anti
 
02:51:45.510 --> 02:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
depressions um the
 
02:51:49.190 --> 02:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
anti-depressants weren't very effective
 
02:51:52.469 --> 02:51:52.479 align:start position:0%
but I managed to survive and through
 
02:51:54.630 --> 02:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
counseling I was able
 
02:51:58.469 --> 02:51:58.479 align:start position:0%
to accept myself as who I
 
02:52:01.910 --> 02:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
was and
 
02:52:05.830 --> 02:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
start estrogen I
 
02:52:11.469 --> 02:52:11.479 align:start position:0%
was 18 at the time and it's the best
 
02:52:14.910 --> 02:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
decision I've ever made six and a half
 
02:52:18.790 --> 02:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
months after starting the estren I was
 
02:52:21.429 --> 02:52:21.439 align:start position:0%
able to quit the
 
02:52:25.790 --> 02:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
anti-depressants I've been as happy as
 
02:52:27.550 --> 02:52:27.560 align:start position:0%
I've ever
 
02:52:32.710 --> 02:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
been and I go months without having
 
02:52:36.670 --> 02:52:36.680 align:start position:0%
suicidal thoughts at all whereas before
 
02:52:40.510 --> 02:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
coming out it was daily not just
 
02:52:44.269 --> 02:52:44.279 align:start position:0%
Suicidal Thoughts but self harm drug
 
02:52:48.229 --> 02:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
abuse it was not good I'm lucky to have
 
02:52:49.830 --> 02:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
come out
 
02:52:49.840 --> 02:52:51.590 align:start position:0%
come out
Al

02:52:51.590 --> 02:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
Al
 
02:52:55.870 --> 02:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
I this bill which I am opposed to I
 
02:52:57.790 --> 02:52:57.800 align:start position:0%
forgot to State
 
02:52:59.590 --> 02:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
um would
 
02:53:04.269 --> 02:53:04.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:07.190 --> 02:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
starting the hormone replacement therapy
 
02:53:09.630 --> 02:53:09.640 align:start position:0%
that I desperately needed had I been
 
02:53:13.349 --> 02:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
able to accept myself as who I was
 
02:53:15.429 --> 02:53:15.439 align:start position:0%
before I tried to kill
 
02:53:18.630 --> 02:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
myself and maybe that would have kept
 
02:53:20.670 --> 02:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
from trying to kill myself
 
02:53:20.680 --> 02:53:23.830 align:start position:0%
from trying to kill myself
and

02:53:23.830 --> 02:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:27.429 --> 02:53:27.439 align:start position:0%
yeah we don't need any more suicide
 
02:53:30.990 --> 02:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
attempts it's enough of an epidemic
 
02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:33.070 align:start position:0%
attempts it's enough of an epidemic
already

02:53:33.070 --> 02:53:33.080 align:start position:0%
already
 
02:53:35.710 --> 02:53:35.720 align:start position:0%
please just realize that you're down to
 
02:53:39.030 --> 02:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:42.550 --> 02:53:42.560 align:start position:0%

we've been talking about in other
 
02:54:00.950 --> 02:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
directions for you the Lost opportunity
 
02:54:03.510 --> 02:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
was not having the treatment that you
 
02:54:05.550 --> 02:54:05.560 align:start position:0%
needed earlier in your life when you
 
02:54:08.790 --> 02:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
needed it
 
02:54:12.070 --> 02:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
precisely other
 
02:54:14.309 --> 02:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
questions yes

02:54:23.870 --> 02:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
did you realize that you were um you
 
02:54:27.030 --> 02:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
were not in the the proper body or what
 
02:54:28.630 --> 02:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
age did you realize you were not the
 
02:54:32.269 --> 02:54:32.279 align:start position:0%
gender that you were born as I started
 
02:54:35.269 --> 02:54:35.279 align:start position:0%
suffering from disphoria at about the
 
02:54:36.630 --> 02:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
age of
 
02:54:39.750 --> 02:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
15 although I didn't end up coming out
 
02:54:42.309 --> 02:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
until I was
 
02:54:44.429 --> 02:54:44.439 align:start position:0%
18 representative Lucas did you have
 
02:54:48.870 --> 02:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
your hand up no okay sorry anyone else

yes representative hartnet thank you Mr
 
02:54:52.710 --> 02:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you for your testimony
 
02:54:56.229 --> 02:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
and thanks for uh taking the question um
 
02:54:58.309 --> 02:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh I appreciate that you're here uh in
 
02:55:00.429 --> 02:55:00.439 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill one of the
 
02:55:02.469 --> 02:55:02.479 align:start position:0%
things that would be helpful for us to
 
02:55:05.229 --> 02:55:05.239 align:start position:0%
understand a little more is what the
 
02:55:08.910 --> 02:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
process was like for you once you found
 
02:55:11.510 --> 02:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
a physician to work with what the
 
02:55:13.429 --> 02:55:13.439 align:start position:0%
process was like the discussions were
 
02:55:16.349 --> 02:55:16.359 align:start position:0%
like how long it took before prescribing
 
02:55:18.750 --> 02:55:18.760 align:start position:0%
happened uh what they explained to you
 
02:55:21.349 --> 02:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
about the the risks of the medicines the
 
02:55:23.429 --> 02:55:23.439 align:start position:0%
benefits those kinds of things we've
 
02:55:24.870 --> 02:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
sort of been missing a little bit of
 
02:55:26.590 --> 02:55:26.600 align:start position:0%
that today it' be helpful if you could
 
02:55:31.510 --> 02:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
explain that I mean My Testimony might
 
02:55:34.790 --> 02:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
be slightly not well I guess not
 
02:55:38.070 --> 02:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
perfectly aligned because I didn't come
 
02:55:41.469 --> 02:55:41.479 align:start position:0%
out till I was 18 so I underwent a
 
02:55:44.590 --> 02:55:44.600 align:start position:0%
slightly different process um
 
02:55:48.990 --> 02:55:49.000 align:start position:0%
but I started counseling shortly after
 
02:55:52.110 --> 02:55:52.120 align:start position:0%
my suicide attempt
 
02:55:56.910 --> 02:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
um and then through counseling I
 
02:56:00.550 --> 02:56:00.560 align:start position:0%
discussed my dysphoria I dis we
 
02:56:02.750 --> 02:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
discussed options
 
02:56:07.349 --> 02:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
of well being trans or being some other
 
02:56:09.670 --> 02:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
sort of gender
 
02:56:13.830 --> 02:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
non-confirming and I eventually came to
 
02:56:17.389 --> 02:56:17.399 align:start position:0%
the realization that I in fact very very
 
02:56:21.870 --> 02:56:21.880 align:start position:0%
much needed to start estrogen and
 
02:56:24.429 --> 02:56:24.439 align:start position:0%
spirolactone which is a testosterone
 
02:56:29.349 --> 02:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
blocker and I was in college in the
 
02:56:32.429 --> 02:56:32.439 align:start position:0%
North country of New York at the time uh
 
02:56:35.469 --> 02:56:35.479 align:start position:0%
so I went to Planned Parenthood north
 
02:56:35.479 --> 02:56:37.110 align:start position:0%
so I went to Planned Parenthood north
country

02:56:37.110 --> 02:56:37.120 align:start position:0%
country
 
02:56:42.670 --> 02:56:42.680 align:start position:0%
and explained my situation to them with
 
02:56:46.590 --> 02:56:46.600 align:start position:0%
my uh about how I had been seeing the
 
02:56:51.870 --> 02:56:51.880 align:start position:0%
therapist and they give me a very dense
 
02:56:54.110 --> 02:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
packet of
 
02:56:58.229 --> 02:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
information and they ran some blood
 
02:56:58.239 --> 02:57:00.030 align:start position:0%
information and they ran some blood
tests

02:57:00.030 --> 02:57:00.040 align:start position:0%
tests
 
02:57:05.590 --> 02:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
and they started me they said I could
 
02:57:08.910 --> 02:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
either start on estrogen or spiral acone
 
02:57:10.910 --> 02:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
but I could only start one at a time to
 
02:57:13.349 --> 02:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
see if there were any side
 
02:57:16.830 --> 02:57:16.840 align:start position:0%
effects and so I started I chose to
 
02:57:18.870 --> 02:57:18.880 align:start position:0%
start on estrogen
 
02:57:21.870 --> 02:57:21.880 align:start position:0%
and after about 3 months of no negative
 
02:57:25.030 --> 02:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
side effects I started on
 
02:57:27.150 --> 02:57:27.160 align:start position:0%
spirolactone after they ran some more
 
02:57:32.469 --> 02:57:32.479 align:start position:0%
tests to make sure that my levels were
 
02:57:32.479 --> 02:57:35.110 align:start position:0%
tests to make sure that my levels were
normal

02:57:35.110 --> 02:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
normal
 
02:57:35.120 --> 02:57:37.469 align:start position:0%
normal
um

02:57:37.469 --> 02:57:37.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:40.910 --> 02:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
yeah follow up thank you uh did you feel
 
02:57:42.630 --> 02:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
like you could have stopped this at any
 
02:57:45.190 --> 02:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:50.190 --> 02:57:50.200 align:start position:0%
wanted um yes I could but being honest
 
02:57:52.150 --> 02:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
that thought never really crossed my
 
02:57:54.630 --> 02:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
mind because I mean I was happier than
 
02:57:57.510 --> 02:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
I'd ever been
 
02:58:00.070 --> 02:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
before thank you representative Castle
 
02:58:02.550 --> 02:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
ring thank you Mr chairman um question
 
02:58:05.190 --> 02:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
for you on your I don't know how to
 
02:58:05.990 --> 02:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
phrase this question I'm trying to
 
02:58:07.990 --> 02:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
figure out how to do it but so
 
02:58:10.670 --> 02:58:10.680 align:start position:0%
specifically when it comes to you you
 
02:58:12.910 --> 02:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you had therapy after you
 
02:58:15.229 --> 02:58:15.239 align:start position:0%
had tried to commit suicide did you have
 
02:58:20.229 --> 02:58:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:24.070 --> 02:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
um very little
 
02:58:24.080 --> 02:58:26.550 align:start position:0%
um very little
but

02:58:26.550 --> 02:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:58:30.389 --> 02:58:30.399 align:start position:0%
um I think if I had had some counseling
 
02:58:33.670 --> 02:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
I might have been able to come to the
 
02:58:37.150 --> 02:58:37.160 align:start position:0%
conclusion that I was trans and maybe
 
02:58:40.309 --> 02:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
even start hormone replacement therapy
 
02:58:43.550 --> 02:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
before I had tried to kill
 
02:58:45.830 --> 02:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
myself so is there anything else that
 
02:58:47.070 --> 02:58:47.080 align:start position:0%
you would say going through your
 
02:58:49.269 --> 02:58:49.279 align:start position:0%
experience that you could help us
 
02:58:51.429 --> 02:58:51.439 align:start position:0%
understand that you would that could be
 
02:58:55.550 --> 02:58:55.560 align:start position:0%
done differently to help the suicide
 
02:58:57.190 --> 02:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
conversation I
 
02:59:02.950 --> 02:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
mean there's still quite a social stigma
 
02:59:02.960 --> 02:59:04.830 align:start position:0%
mean there's still quite a social stigma
around

02:59:04.830 --> 02:59:04.840 align:start position:0%
around
 
02:59:10.269 --> 02:59:10.279 align:start position:0%
suicide um and I think it needs to be
 
02:59:13.510 --> 02:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
talked about and if you are suffering
 
02:59:16.269 --> 02:59:16.279 align:start position:0%
those thoughts please talk to somebody
 
02:59:18.790 --> 02:59:18.800 align:start position:0%
and maybe
 
02:59:21.950 --> 02:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
you can work it work out your issues
 
02:59:26.110 --> 02:59:26.120 align:start position:0%
before you try to take your own
 
02:59:28.950 --> 02:59:28.960 align:start position:0%
life other
 
02:59:34.870 --> 02:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:40.630 --> 02:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:42.750 --> 02:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
bonana a
 
02:59:45.469 --> 02:59:45.479 align:start position:0%
bon and you've asked for 5 to 10 minutes
 
02:59:46.870 --> 02:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
again we have to limit testimony to
 
02:59:48.630 --> 02:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
three today yep I understand understand
 
02:59:50.030 --> 02:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
um I just want to say that I just put my
 
02:59:51.309 --> 02:59:51.319 align:start position:0%
legal name down given that this is a
 
02:59:52.630 --> 02:59:52.640 align:start position:0%
legal setting I would prefer you refer
 
02:59:53.950 --> 02:59:53.960 align:start position:0%
to me as Oliver and my last name is
 
02:59:55.750 --> 02:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
pronounced Bama I fully understand no
 
02:59:57.710 --> 02:59:57.720 align:start position:0%
one pronounces it right the first time
 
02:59:59.710 --> 02:59:59.720 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to preface this with
 
03:00:01.190 --> 03:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
the fact that I am actually one of the
 
03:00:02.429 --> 03:00:02.439 align:start position:0%
people who would be impacted by this
 
03:00:06.110 --> 03:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
bill I am currently 17 and in uh seeking
 
03:00:08.150 --> 03:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
hormone replacement therapy I've been in
 
03:00:10.070 --> 03:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
the process of seeking this uh treatment
 
03:00:13.389 --> 03:00:13.399 align:start position:0%
for about 3 years now and prior to that
 
03:00:14.990 --> 03:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
I was in significant therapy for other
 
03:00:17.349 --> 03:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
unrelated reasons um I would like to say
 
03:00:19.190 --> 03:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
also uh kind of where I would like to
 
03:00:22.710 --> 03:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
say here is that the I find this bill to
 
03:00:24.990 --> 03:00:25.000 align:start position:0%
not only be abhorent and contributing to
 
03:00:26.190 --> 03:00:26.200 align:start position:0%
the genocide of trans people which I
 
03:00:29.510 --> 03:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
will get to but also to be incredibly
 
03:00:32.469 --> 03:00:32.479 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um I actually am from Sutton
 
03:00:34.469 --> 03:00:34.479 align:start position:0%
uh just kind of sim a similar area to
 
03:00:36.630 --> 03:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
our previous speaker and I've actually
 
03:00:38.389 --> 03:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
experienced extreme bullying to the
 
03:00:39.870 --> 03:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
point of that I've been diagnosed with
 
03:00:42.110 --> 03:00:42.120 align:start position:0%
complex post-traumatic stress
 
03:00:45.110 --> 03:00:45.120 align:start position:0%
disorder excuse me in relation to my
 
03:00:46.910 --> 03:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
gender expression and gender identity
 
03:00:48.389 --> 03:00:48.399 align:start position:0%
due to the bullying I EXP experiened
 
03:00:50.510 --> 03:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
from first through fifth grade now I
 
03:00:52.790 --> 03:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
experienced this bullying not because I
 
03:00:54.790 --> 03:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
considered myself trans or called myself
 
03:00:56.510 --> 03:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
as such but instead because I asserted
 
03:00:58.030 --> 03:00:58.040 align:start position:0%
that I was neither a boy nor a girl
 
03:01:00.349 --> 03:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
because I am transmasculine nonbinary I
 
03:01:01.830 --> 03:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
would like to say that the bullying that
 
03:01:03.309 --> 03:01:03.319 align:start position:0%
I experienced actually greatly
 
03:01:04.910 --> 03:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
discouraged me from coming out as
 
03:01:06.830 --> 03:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
transgender and in fact delayed my
 
03:01:09.429 --> 03:01:09.439 align:start position:0%
wanting to identify as such publicly for
 
03:01:11.389 --> 03:01:11.399 align:start position:0%
many years and I would like to say that
 
03:01:13.070 --> 03:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
I find that this bill is only going to
 
03:01:15.190 --> 03:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
encourage that kind of bullying and that
 
03:01:17.590 --> 03:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
kind of fear in trans youth um I would
 
03:01:20.710 --> 03:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
also like like to say um how this um
 
03:01:24.070 --> 03:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
fits into the definition of genocide um
 
03:01:26.429 --> 03:01:26.439 align:start position:0%
the you um excuse
 
03:01:30.110 --> 03:01:30.120 align:start position:0%
me um so the official gen definition of
 
03:01:31.590 --> 03:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
genocide as defined by the United
 
03:01:34.070 --> 03:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
Nations is as follows quote genocide
 
03:01:35.469 --> 03:01:35.479 align:start position:0%
means any of the following acts
 
03:01:37.070 --> 03:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
committed with the intent to destroy in
 
03:01:39.469 --> 03:01:39.479 align:start position:0%
whole or in part a national ethnical
 
03:01:41.870 --> 03:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
racial or religious group as such a
 
03:01:43.429 --> 03:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
killing members of the group b causing
 
03:01:45.110 --> 03:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
serious bodily or mental harm to members
 
03:01:47.429 --> 03:01:47.439 align:start position:0%
of the group C deliberately inflicting
 
03:01:49.190 --> 03:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
on the group grou conditions of Life
 
03:01:50.510 --> 03:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
calculated to bring about its physical
 
03:01:53.510 --> 03:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
destruction in whole or in part and D
 
03:01:55.150 --> 03:01:55.160 align:start position:0%
imposing measures intended to prevent
 
03:01:57.190 --> 03:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
births within the group and E forcibly
 
03:01:58.670 --> 03:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
transferring Children of the group to
 
03:02:00.590 --> 03:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
another group I use the genocide term
 
03:02:02.190 --> 03:02:02.200 align:start position:0%
genocide here in no way meaning that
 
03:02:03.590 --> 03:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
this has reached the extent of the
 
03:02:05.590 --> 03:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
Holocaust or various ongoing genocides
 
03:02:07.469 --> 03:02:07.479 align:start position:0%
in the palest in Palestine and in the
 
03:02:08.950 --> 03:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
Congo and in no way intend to
 
03:02:10.910 --> 03:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
delegitimize this fites but instead to
 
03:02:12.870 --> 03:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
draw necessary attention to the cause um
 
03:02:14.190 --> 03:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
and anytime I'm going to cite a piece of
 
03:02:15.830 --> 03:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
legislation here I may not KN in the
 
03:02:17.910 --> 03:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
bill number but it is from the uh like
 
03:02:19.030 --> 03:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
official legislation I have done
 
03:02:21.110 --> 03:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
significant Research into this um I
 
03:02:22.269 --> 03:02:22.279 align:start position:0%
would now address each one of these
 
03:02:24.269 --> 03:02:24.279 align:start position:0%
criteria one at a time some Nuance is
 
03:02:25.870 --> 03:02:25.880 align:start position:0%
required because being transgender is
 
03:02:27.110 --> 03:02:27.120 align:start position:0%
not something that is passed down like
 
03:02:28.910 --> 03:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
through families or genetically like a
 
03:02:32.110 --> 03:02:32.120 align:start position:0%
religion or um other ethnic uh thing is
 
03:02:33.990 --> 03:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's similar honestly to the way uh
 
03:02:36.030 --> 03:02:36.040 align:start position:0%
disabilities are um firstly killing
 
03:02:38.510 --> 03:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
members of the group 350 trans people
 
03:02:39.950 --> 03:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
were murdered because they were Trans in
 
03:02:42.070 --> 03:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
2024 and increase from last year by
 
03:02:44.229 --> 03:02:44.239 align:start position:0%
nearly 10% these Mo these murders were
 
03:02:45.469 --> 03:02:45.479 align:start position:0%
motivated by the fact that they were
 
03:02:47.190 --> 03:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
trans and this especially impacts black
 
03:02:48.670 --> 03:02:48.680 align:start position:0%
Trans women
 
03:02:51.030 --> 03:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
um and keep in mind that there are only
 
03:02:52.790 --> 03:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
a couple million trans people in the US
 
03:02:54.389 --> 03:02:54.399 align:start position:0%
uh trans people have about I believe
 
03:02:55.550 --> 03:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
it's three times as likely to be
 
03:02:57.710 --> 03:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
murdered as their s under counterparts
 
03:02:59.469 --> 03:02:59.479 align:start position:0%
um second is serious bodily or mental
 
03:03:00.830 --> 03:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
harm to the group numerous states have
 
03:03:02.269 --> 03:03:02.279 align:start position:0%
either put restrictions on or outright
 
03:03:05.790 --> 03:03:05.800 align:start position:0%
Bann trans Healthcare as you yep um
 
03:03:07.910 --> 03:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
which is um it proved to reduce rates of
 
03:03:09.670 --> 03:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
depression anxiety and self harm and Su
 
03:03:12.190 --> 03:03:12.200 align:start position:0%
suicidal ideation comparably to about
 
03:03:14.790 --> 03:03:14.800 align:start position:0%
20% of people dep anti depressants
 
03:03:16.389 --> 03:03:16.399 align:start position:0%
working for people additionally there is
 
03:03:18.070 --> 03:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
the shooting of queer and trans spaces
 
03:03:19.510 --> 03:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
and the attempts to eradicate these
 
03:03:22.269 --> 03:03:22.279 align:start position:0%
physical spaces and the defining of uh
 
03:03:23.790 --> 03:03:23.800 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care as child abuse
 
03:03:24.830 --> 03:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
despite the fact that there is no
 
03:03:26.389 --> 03:03:26.399 align:start position:0%
evidence to as such in the attempt to
 
03:03:27.550 --> 03:03:27.560 align:start position:0%
remove trans people from their families
 
03:03:28.750 --> 03:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
I ask that you oppose this Bill thank
 
03:03:31.349 --> 03:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much any
 
03:03:37.550 --> 03:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:40.830 --> 03:03:40.840 align:start position:0%

03:03:55.870 --> 03:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
hello members of the committee my name
 
03:03:57.830 --> 03:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
is Lind Jak house and I am a co-founder
 
03:04:00.389 --> 03:04:00.399 align:start position:0%
of 603 equality a Statewide organization
 
03:04:03.229 --> 03:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
that advocates for lgbtq plus people
 
03:04:04.910 --> 03:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
while I myself have never accessed
 
03:04:06.710 --> 03:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
puberty blockers or hormone replacement
 
03:04:09.110 --> 03:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
therapy as a non-binary person I've
 
03:04:10.670 --> 03:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
spoken with countless Youth and adults
 
03:04:12.590 --> 03:04:12.600 align:start position:0%
across our state who have and who have
 
03:04:14.790 --> 03:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
been able to grow and Thrive into happy
 
03:04:16.469 --> 03:04:16.479 align:start position:0%
healthy young adults due to being able
 
03:04:19.429 --> 03:04:19.439 align:start position:0%
to access this medical care as with any
 
03:04:20.990 --> 03:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
type of Health Care it is natural to
 
03:04:22.910 --> 03:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
have questions but questions about
 
03:04:24.190 --> 03:04:24.200 align:start position:0%
health care should be answered by
 
03:04:26.110 --> 03:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
doctors and these decisions made by
 
03:04:28.990 --> 03:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
families not politicians some opponents
 
03:04:31.030 --> 03:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
of this care put forth the false idea
 
03:04:32.990 --> 03:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
that teenagers cannot consent to Medical
 
03:04:35.349 --> 03:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
Care this is a false idea that seems to
 
03:04:37.269 --> 03:04:37.279 align:start position:0%
only ever be applied to accessing gender
 
03:04:39.510 --> 03:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
transition related care if it was true
 
03:04:40.990 --> 03:04:41.000 align:start position:0%
that teenagers couldn't consent to
 
03:04:42.870 --> 03:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
Medical Care Childhood Cancer WS
 
03:04:44.670 --> 03:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't exist and children and teens
 
03:04:46.269 --> 03:04:46.279 align:start position:0%
would have to wait until their 18th
 
03:04:48.630 --> 03:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
birthday to repair a broken B own the
 
03:04:49.830 --> 03:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
best way to protect the health and
 
03:04:51.469 --> 03:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
well-being of transgender young people
 
03:04:53.030 --> 03:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
is to ensure that they can continue to
 
03:04:55.349 --> 03:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
have access to essential age appropriate
 
03:04:57.429 --> 03:04:57.439 align:start position:0%
Medical Care from licensed clinicians
 
03:04:58.950 --> 03:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
practicing according to the
 
03:05:01.150 --> 03:05:01.160 align:start position:0%
well-established standards of care
 
03:05:02.550 --> 03:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
Studies have found that regret for
 
03:05:04.950 --> 03:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
transition related care is quite rare as
 
03:05:08.070 --> 03:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
low as 1 or 2% Studies have shown 6 to
 
03:05:10.349 --> 03:05:10.359 align:start position:0%
30% of patients are dissatisfied after
 
03:05:12.229 --> 03:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
knee surgery yet no one is trying to
 
03:05:14.429 --> 03:05:14.439 align:start position:0%
pass laws to ban knee surgery
 
03:05:15.830 --> 03:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
transgender young people who meet
 
03:05:18.429 --> 03:05:18.439 align:start position:0%
criteria for gender trans dysphoria and
 
03:05:20.710 --> 03:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
who undergo social or medical transition
 
03:05:22.750 --> 03:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
are actually the least likely to regret
 
03:05:25.030 --> 03:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
their care and those vast majority of
 
03:05:27.030 --> 03:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
transgender youth remain consistent and
 
03:05:28.830 --> 03:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
persistent in their gender identity over
 
03:05:31.229 --> 03:05:31.239 align:start position:0%
time many people who choose to stop a
 
03:05:33.429 --> 03:05:33.439 align:start position:0%
medical transition have complex unique
 
03:05:35.910 --> 03:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
reasons like discrimination feeling at
 
03:05:38.110 --> 03:05:38.120 align:start position:0%
home in a more non-binary Identity or
 
03:05:40.030 --> 03:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
not feeling like their transition
 
03:05:42.429 --> 03:05:42.439 align:start position:0%
requires medical assistance I respect
 
03:05:44.429 --> 03:05:44.439 align:start position:0%
everyone's unique Journey but no one
 
03:05:46.389 --> 03:05:46.399 align:start position:0%
should seek to use the law to stop
 
03:05:47.710 --> 03:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
others from having the freedom to to
 
03:05:49.309 --> 03:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
medically transition just because it
 
03:05:51.670 --> 03:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't right for them Additionally the
 
03:05:53.510 --> 03:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
largest doctor's Union in the UK the
 
03:05:55.269 --> 03:05:55.279 align:start position:0%
British Medical Association voted in
 
03:05:57.190 --> 03:05:57.200 align:start position:0%
favor of a resolution to publicly
 
03:05:59.309 --> 03:05:59.319 align:start position:0%
critique the cast review used to crack
 
03:06:00.910 --> 03:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
down on gender affirming care for Trans
 
03:06:02.590 --> 03:06:02.600 align:start position:0%
youth in the UK calling its
 
03:06:04.830 --> 03:06:04.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations unsubstantiated the
 
03:06:06.670 --> 03:06:06.680 align:start position:0%
organization also voted to oppose the
 
03:06:08.670 --> 03:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
implementation of the reviews
 
03:06:10.790 --> 03:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
recommendations and stating that gender
 
03:06:12.790 --> 03:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
identity services in the UK are
 
03:06:15.190 --> 03:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
inadequate a claim well supported by the
 
03:06:17.150 --> 03:06:17.160 align:start position:0%
extreme wait times of 5 years or more
 
03:06:19.030 --> 03:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
which have linked to suicides among some
 
03:06:21.150 --> 03:06:21.160 align:start position:0%
transp patients they assert that the
 
03:06:23.510 --> 03:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
cast review engaged in unexplained
 
03:06:25.870 --> 03:06:25.880 align:start position:0%
steady deviations and ambiguous
 
03:06:28.510 --> 03:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
eligibility criteria while excluding
 
03:06:31.190 --> 03:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
evidence supporting transgender care
 
03:06:32.910 --> 03:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
evidence-based standards of care exist
 
03:06:34.550 --> 03:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
to ensure that no one regardless of
 
03:06:36.229 --> 03:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
their age under goes any permanent
 
03:06:38.590 --> 03:06:38.600 align:start position:0%
irreversible changes without informed
 
03:06:40.389 --> 03:06:40.399 align:start position:0%
consent and careful consultation with
 
03:06:42.670 --> 03:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
medical and mental health professionals
 
03:06:44.389 --> 03:06:44.399 align:start position:0%
Banning this medically necessary care
 
03:06:46.110 --> 03:06:46.120 align:start position:0%
puts transgender people at incre
 
03:06:48.150 --> 03:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
increased risk of serious harm including
 
03:06:49.870 --> 03:06:49.880 align:start position:0%

me thank you Mr chair members of the
 
03:07:57.389 --> 03:07:57.399 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Jonas suon Morse I
 
03:07:59.830 --> 03:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
live in Canterbury New Hampshire I am
 
03:08:03.110 --> 03:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
here to testify against this bill um I
 
03:08:05.110 --> 03:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
want to start by affirming that trans
 
03:08:07.790 --> 03:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
boys are boys trans girls are girls
 
03:08:10.710 --> 03:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
trans non-binary people
 
03:08:13.990 --> 03:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
exist um I am the parent of a trans kid
 
03:08:15.830 --> 03:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
but I actually want to tell you a story
 
03:08:18.229 --> 03:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
about my adolescence um my body was
 
03:08:20.110 --> 03:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
changing I was getting hair in new
 
03:08:23.309 --> 03:08:23.319 align:start position:0%
places and I felt a little lump in my
 
03:08:25.469 --> 03:08:25.479 align:start position:0%
chest and at first I didn't think about
 
03:08:27.590 --> 03:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
it very much at all and then I thought
 
03:08:30.190 --> 03:08:30.200 align:start position:0%
about it a lot and then I went and
 
03:08:31.910 --> 03:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
talked to my mom about it and that will
 
03:08:34.070 --> 03:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
tell you how nervous I was and
 
03:08:35.550 --> 03:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
eventually we went and talked to my
 
03:08:38.750 --> 03:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
doctor who said yep you're going through
 
03:08:40.469 --> 03:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
adolescence your body is changing you're
 
03:08:42.229 --> 03:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
going through puberty you're making and
 
03:08:44.349 --> 03:08:44.359 align:start position:0%
reacting to various hormones you are
 
03:08:47.190 --> 03:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
developing breast tissue and I said wait
 
03:08:49.790 --> 03:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
no hang on I get the beard one not the
 
03:08:49.800 --> 03:08:51.349 align:start position:0%
no hang on I get the beard one not the
breast

03:08:51.349 --> 03:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
breast
 
03:08:54.469 --> 03:08:54.479 align:start position:0%
one um and my doctor told me bodies are
 
03:08:56.630 --> 03:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
complicated and we talked a bit about
 
03:08:58.510 --> 03:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
some of the complexities of puberty and
 
03:09:01.710 --> 03:09:01.720 align:start position:0%
hormones and even with that
 
03:09:03.670 --> 03:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
conversation it was really very
 
03:09:05.590 --> 03:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
confusing to have my body developing in
 
03:09:08.389 --> 03:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
a way that did not align at all with who
 
03:09:12.830 --> 03:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
I was I did eventually go through a more
 
03:09:15.309 --> 03:09:15.319 align:start position:0%
typical male puberty development I
 
03:09:17.510 --> 03:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
joined the swim team that's basically
 
03:09:19.830 --> 03:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
got me through high school I went off to
 
03:09:21.990 --> 03:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
college got married we moved to New
 
03:09:24.429 --> 03:09:24.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're raising a family life is
 
03:09:24.439 --> 03:09:25.510 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're raising a family life is
pretty

03:09:25.510 --> 03:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
03:09:28.590 --> 03:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
good if this bill becomes law some kid
 
03:09:30.550 --> 03:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is going to notice his
 
03:09:33.630 --> 03:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
body changing and hair in new places and
 
03:09:35.590 --> 03:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
he's going to feel a lump in his chest
 
03:09:37.429 --> 03:09:37.439 align:start position:0%
and not think about it very much and
 
03:09:39.670 --> 03:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
then think about it a lot and then go
 
03:09:41.790 --> 03:09:41.800 align:start position:0%
talk to a doctor who's going to say yep
 
03:09:43.190 --> 03:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
your body is changing you're going
 
03:09:44.710 --> 03:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
through puberty you're making and
 
03:09:47.790 --> 03:09:47.800 align:start position:0%
reacting um to various hormones your
 
03:09:49.429 --> 03:09:49.439 align:start position:0%
breasts are going to get bigger your
 
03:09:50.750 --> 03:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
hips are going to get rounder you're
 
03:09:53.469 --> 03:09:53.479 align:start position:0%
going to start having periods and that
 
03:09:55.870 --> 03:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
kid is going to say wait what no I want
 
03:09:58.710 --> 03:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
the beard one not the breast one and his
 
03:10:00.670 --> 03:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
doctor isn't going to say well that's
 
03:10:04.229 --> 03:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
not possible his doctor is going to say
 
03:10:05.990 --> 03:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
that's illegal
 
03:10:08.750 --> 03:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
here I don't know how my story would
 
03:10:12.429 --> 03:10:12.439 align:start position:0%
have gone if that had been my experience
 
03:10:14.550 --> 03:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
it definitely would not have continued
 
03:10:16.550 --> 03:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
with I joined the high school swim team
 
03:10:18.910 --> 03:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
and that's what got me through high
 
03:10:21.830 --> 03:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
school I hope my story would still have
 
03:10:24.590 --> 03:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
ended with life is pretty good or at
 
03:10:26.950 --> 03:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
least I don't know my story hasn't ended
 
03:10:26.960 --> 03:10:27.910 align:start position:0%
least I don't know my story hasn't ended
yet

03:10:27.910 --> 03:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
yet
 
03:10:30.190 --> 03:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
but but it would have been a much more
 
03:10:33.630 --> 03:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
traumatic experience along the way don't
 
03:10:36.469 --> 03:10:36.479 align:start position:0%
subject our kids to that let kids and
 
03:10:38.830 --> 03:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
parents and medical professionals make
 
03:10:42.990 --> 03:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
their own choices about their own bodies
 
03:10:46.870 --> 03:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
please vote itl and I would be happy not
 
03:10:49.110 --> 03:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
to share my family's personal
 
03:10:51.150 --> 03:10:51.160 align:start position:0%
experiences but in general the
 
03:10:53.870 --> 03:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
experience that I've had as the parent
 
03:10:55.750 --> 03:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
of a trans kid and some of the research
 
03:10:58.229 --> 03:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
we've done into options if you would
 
03:11:01.910 --> 03:11:01.920 align:start position:0%

and spent years as a mental health
 
03:11:57.550 --> 03:11:57.560 align:start position:0%
professional before walking away when
 
03:11:59.190 --> 03:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
treatment turned into a billing game
 
03:12:01.950 --> 03:12:01.960 align:start position:0%
driven by profit over care she once
 
03:12:03.910 --> 03:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
dreamed of running a therapeutic farm
 
03:12:05.750 --> 03:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
for kids to give them purpose and
 
03:12:07.510 --> 03:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
self-esteem through Hands-On work and
 
03:12:10.110 --> 03:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
agricultural setting but she left that
 
03:12:11.790 --> 03:12:11.800 align:start position:0%
Vision in the field behind as she
 
03:12:14.349 --> 03:12:14.359 align:start position:0%

Weber thank you Insight thank you for
 
03:15:14.349 --> 03:15:14.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question so do you believe
 
03:15:16.269 --> 03:15:16.279 align:start position:0%
that all the people who testified here
 
03:15:21.510 --> 03:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:24.349 --> 03:15:24.359 align:start position:0%
wrong I'm not going to speak for
 
03:15:27.710 --> 03:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
them and I don't think children should
 
03:15:31.349 --> 03:15:31.359 align:start position:0%
be taking these drugs you cannot change
 
03:15:32.950 --> 03:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
your gender you cannot change your
 
03:15:37.510 --> 03:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:40.070 --> 03:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
to any other
 
03:15:43.750 --> 03:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
questions oh Miller the other side too
 
03:15:45.510 --> 03:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
close you couldn't see me uh thank you
 
03:15:46.630 --> 03:15:46.640 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
03:15:49.590 --> 03:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
question uh you brought up the financial
 
03:15:51.389 --> 03:15:51.399 align:start position:0%
side of this implying that this is a
 
03:15:52.990 --> 03:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
money grab rather than actually
 
03:15:54.830 --> 03:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
providing health and I'm curious do you
 
03:15:56.750 --> 03:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
feel the same way about other drugs that
 
03:15:59.389 --> 03:15:59.399 align:start position:0%
have been developed and possibly used
 
03:16:02.189 --> 03:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
off uh label such as OIC which was
 
03:16:05.030 --> 03:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
developed for type two diabetes or
 
03:16:06.790 --> 03:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
Viagra which certainly has generated
 
03:16:08.790 --> 03:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
plenty of money for fiser over the
 
03:16:11.269 --> 03:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
years pharmaceutical companies are in it
 
03:16:15.349 --> 03:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
to make money and if they can provide um
 
03:16:18.429 --> 03:16:18.439 align:start position:0%
or think they can provide some kind of
 
03:16:21.269 --> 03:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
benefit without all thinking about all
 
03:16:23.429 --> 03:16:23.439 align:start position:0%
the side effects I mean all of the typ
 
03:16:25.550 --> 03:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
all the people that are taking OIC that
 
03:16:27.150 --> 03:16:27.160 align:start position:0%
are not type two diabetics and are
 
03:16:28.950 --> 03:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
taking as a weight loss they are
 
03:16:31.229 --> 03:16:31.239 align:start position:0%
suffering severe consequences and side
 
03:16:36.269 --> 03:16:36.279 align:start position:0%
effects to it and um so just because we
 
03:16:40.030 --> 03:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
can doesn't mean we should follow follow
 
03:16:42.750 --> 03:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
following up on that is your is your
 
03:16:44.469 --> 03:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
claim here that these side effects are
 
03:16:46.110 --> 03:16:46.120 align:start position:0%
not properly disclosed not properly
 
03:16:48.670 --> 03:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
understood or just being
 
03:16:51.830 --> 03:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
ignored I think people want a quick fix
 
03:16:53.710 --> 03:16:53.720 align:start position:0%
and their Quick Fix is here let me take
 
03:16:56.189 --> 03:16:56.199 align:start position:0%
this pill let me take this injection and
 
03:16:57.510 --> 03:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
all of my problems are going to be
 
03:16:59.830 --> 03:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
solved and that's not
 
03:17:02.389 --> 03:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
true one more followup one more follow I
 
03:17:04.830 --> 03:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
may sorry given the duration described
 
03:17:06.030 --> 03:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
by all of the other people who have
 
03:17:07.510 --> 03:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
testified here saying that none of this
 
03:17:09.790 --> 03:17:09.800 align:start position:0%
was quick you still believe that this is
 
03:17:11.469 --> 03:17:11.479 align:start position:0%
actually a quick fix not a multi-year
 
03:17:12.910 --> 03:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
thing that is actually necessary for
 
03:17:15.510 --> 03:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
these people not when I've heard stories
 
03:17:19.309 --> 03:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
of people going in to plan Parenthood or
 
03:17:23.189 --> 03:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
other facilities and within 30 minutes
 
03:17:26.950 --> 03:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
of talking to someone there're given uh
 
03:17:29.790 --> 03:17:29.800 align:start position:0%
hormone drug thank
 
03:17:32.309 --> 03:17:32.319 align:start position:0%
no other questions yes
 
03:17:34.950 --> 03:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for M Mr chair
 
03:17:37.670 --> 03:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um on
 
03:17:40.269 --> 03:17:40.279 align:start position:0%
another thought if my child was born
 
03:17:44.750 --> 03:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:49.150 --> 03:17:49.160 align:start position:0%
implant that's not that's not the same
 
03:17:51.630 --> 03:17:51.640 align:start position:0%
thing I'm not sure how you're equating
 
03:17:54.469 --> 03:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
that I think it I guess I think it is
 
03:17:58.189 --> 03:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
but if my child Do It um I know a child
 
03:18:00.349 --> 03:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
who only who has um
 
03:18:03.590 --> 03:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
chromosomal dis is issues like the
 
03:18:07.670 --> 03:18:07.680 align:start position:0%
Turner syndrome boy that spoke and they
 
03:18:10.389 --> 03:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
had to choose their child's
 
03:18:13.630 --> 03:18:13.640 align:start position:0%
gender um so will this will this bill
 
03:18:17.389 --> 03:18:17.399 align:start position:0%
stop them from being able to do that
 
03:18:21.630 --> 03:18:21.640 align:start position:0%
I don't think that this bill is
 
03:18:25.630 --> 03:18:25.640 align:start position:0%
prohibiting those types of medical it's
 
03:18:29.630 --> 03:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
geared towards doctors doing this gender
 
03:18:31.830 --> 03:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
affirming whatever care that they think
 
03:18:34.469 --> 03:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
it is I don't think it is stopping
 
03:18:38.110 --> 03:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
someone that has a genetic um
 
03:18:41.309 --> 03:18:41.319 align:start position:0%
abnormality or and mutation from getting
 
03:18:43.309 --> 03:18:43.319 align:start position:0%
the treatment that has been standard
 
03:18:45.309 --> 03:18:45.319 align:start position:0%
care for
 
03:18:48.389 --> 03:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
years other question
 
03:18:55.309 --> 03:18:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:06.870 --> 03:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:09.950 --> 03:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
returned yes I have um thank you for
 
03:19:11.870 --> 03:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
taking my testimony my name is Amry
 
03:19:13.670 --> 03:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
Banfield I'm a parental rights advocate
 
03:19:14.910 --> 03:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I've been doing this
 
03:19:18.110 --> 03:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
for over 20 years um and I'm a parental
 
03:19:20.750 --> 03:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
rights Advocate but I don't Advocate
 
03:19:23.510 --> 03:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
when something's going to hurt a child I
 
03:19:26.910 --> 03:19:26.920 align:start position:0%
I draw the line in the sand and so on
 
03:19:28.469 --> 03:19:28.479 align:start position:0%
this particular Bill the first thing I
 
03:19:30.349 --> 03:19:30.359 align:start position:0%
did is I called a nurse a pediatric
 
03:19:31.870 --> 03:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
nurse and I said what are some of the
 
03:19:33.309 --> 03:19:33.319 align:start position:0%
side effects what are some of the things
 
03:19:35.550 --> 03:19:35.560 align:start position:0%
that can happen if you're put on these
 
03:19:38.630 --> 03:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
puberty blockers blood clots infertility
 
03:19:42.110 --> 03:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
cancer depression testosterone rage uh
 
03:19:45.750 --> 03:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
she reported that child uh girl put on
 
03:19:48.429 --> 03:19:48.439 align:start position:0%
testosterone to trans into a boy
 
03:19:52.469 --> 03:19:52.479 align:start position:0%
destroyed a a a medical room she they
 
03:19:54.950 --> 03:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
were they were in the in the um Hospital
 
03:19:56.910 --> 03:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
destroyed the medical room and they
 
03:19:59.469 --> 03:19:59.479 align:start position:0%
attributed it to the testosterone and
 
03:20:01.550 --> 03:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
earlier we heard about anorexic if
 
03:20:03.910 --> 03:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
you're anorexic do you give medication
 
03:20:07.630 --> 03:20:07.640 align:start position:0%
to an anorexic of course not um so there
 
03:20:11.830 --> 03:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
are limits that are placed on uh people
 
03:20:13.110 --> 03:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
all the
 
03:20:16.429 --> 03:20:16.439 align:start position:0%
time if anybody here has high blood
 
03:20:18.670 --> 03:20:18.680 align:start position:0%
pressure pressure you're not going to be
 
03:20:20.950 --> 03:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
approved to to donate an extra part in
 
03:20:23.710 --> 03:20:23.720 align:start position:0%
your body a kidney you can't Mass
 
03:20:25.790 --> 03:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
General will not take you as a Kidney
 
03:20:28.110 --> 03:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
donor for somebody who could you can
 
03:20:30.309 --> 03:20:30.319 align:start position:0%
save somebody's life because somewhere
 
03:20:33.110 --> 03:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
down the road that could become a
 
03:20:34.830 --> 03:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
problem so they're looking out for your
 
03:20:38.309 --> 03:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
best interest this happens all the time
 
03:20:41.309 --> 03:20:41.319 align:start position:0%
this is children these are children who
 
03:20:43.950 --> 03:20:43.960 align:start position:0%
do not have the capacity to think long
 
03:20:46.229 --> 03:20:46.239 align:start position:0%
term once they become adult there's
 
03:20:48.870 --> 03:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
nothing nothing in this that prohibits
 
03:20:51.670 --> 03:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
them from taking this medication they
 
03:20:54.590 --> 03:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
can wear different clothing they can use
 
03:20:56.630 --> 03:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
different names they can use different
 
03:20:59.670 --> 03:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
pronouns nobody's stopping them but when
 
03:21:02.229 --> 03:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
you're talking about a child who does
 
03:21:04.349 --> 03:21:04.359 align:start position:0%
not have the capacity to make these
 
03:21:07.349 --> 03:21:07.359 align:start position:0%
decisions of lifelong
 
03:21:10.910 --> 03:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
harm then yes we can protect that child
 
03:21:12.790 --> 03:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
we do it all the time and we even
 
03:21:14.630 --> 03:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
protect children from their parents
 
03:21:17.389 --> 03:21:17.399 align:start position:0%
sometimes when they're doing something
 
03:21:21.030 --> 03:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
harmful um you cannot sell your kidney
 
03:21:22.670 --> 03:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
the federal federal law will not allow
 
03:21:24.269 --> 03:21:24.279 align:start position:0%
you to sell your kidney an extra part
 
03:21:26.229 --> 03:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
that you don't need I can tell you I've
 
03:21:27.870 --> 03:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
got a third kidney in here I've got
 
03:21:29.469 --> 03:21:29.479 align:start position:0%
somebody who donated a kidney to me so I
 
03:21:33.150 --> 03:21:33.160 align:start position:0%
know all about it you can't sell it you
 
03:21:35.790 --> 03:21:35.800 align:start position:0%
so this body autonomy thing is not
 
03:21:37.670 --> 03:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily true in many
 
03:21:37.680 --> 03:21:39.389 align:start position:0%
necessarily true in many
cases

03:21:39.389 --> 03:21:39.399 align:start position:0%
cases
 
03:21:41.950 --> 03:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
um as I said I I'm a parental rights
 
03:21:43.990 --> 03:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
Advocate and the first one of the first
 
03:21:46.229 --> 03:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
calls I got on transitioning which was
 
03:21:48.830 --> 03:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
years ago was from a mother who adopted
 
03:21:52.590 --> 03:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
a three or four-year-old Twins and that
 
03:21:55.189 --> 03:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
three-year-old had grown into a uh
 
03:21:58.189 --> 03:21:58.199 align:start position:0%
16-year-old she had been physically and
 
03:22:01.070 --> 03:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
and brutally um abused as a young child
 
03:22:03.670 --> 03:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
so she had adopted these two children
 
03:22:06.070 --> 03:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
the girl when she was 16 had started
 
03:22:09.150 --> 03:22:09.160 align:start position:0%
dressing as a boy things like this and
 
03:22:12.469 --> 03:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
it wasn't because she thought she was a
 
03:22:14.590 --> 03:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
boy it was because she didn't want that
 
03:22:17.670 --> 03:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
male attention and so so she was seeing
 
03:22:19.429 --> 03:22:19.439 align:start position:0%
somebody she was seeing a therapist and
 
03:22:21.269 --> 03:22:21.279 align:start position:0%
they were working through that and they
 
03:22:23.550 --> 03:22:23.560 align:start position:0%
were working through those things and I
 
03:22:25.550 --> 03:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
can remember the the person that called
 
03:22:28.429 --> 03:22:28.439 align:start position:0%
me is you know if if they had gone in
 
03:22:28.439 --> 03:22:29.229 align:start position:0%
me is you know if if they had gone in
that

03:22:29.229 --> 03:22:29.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:22:31.309 --> 03:22:31.319 align:start position:0%
direction permanent damage could have
 
03:22:32.830 --> 03:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
happened to her but she was just simply
 
03:22:35.349 --> 03:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
trying to keep male attention off of her
 
03:22:38.950 --> 03:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
03:22:41.110 --> 03:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing any thank you thank
 
03:22:41.120 --> 03:22:46.910 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing any thank you thank
you

03:22:46.910 --> 03:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:54.670 --> 03:22:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:57.389 --> 03:22:57.399 align:start position:0%
Cornell walkwell Cornell
 
03:23:06.150 --> 03:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:09.870 --> 03:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
okay hi my name is Rockwell Cornell and
 
03:23:11.870 --> 03:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
I oppose this bill because it does not
 
03:23:13.750 --> 03:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
protect anyone and will significantly
 
03:23:15.870 --> 03:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
increase harm to vulnerable children
 
03:23:18.349 --> 03:23:18.359 align:start position:0%
throughout the St there are far greater
 
03:23:20.150 --> 03:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
risks to the safety and well-being of
 
03:23:22.269 --> 03:23:22.279 align:start position:0%
the children in this country but today
 
03:23:23.830 --> 03:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
we are focusing on deciding if
 
03:23:26.150 --> 03:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
transgender children get to have medical
 
03:23:28.469 --> 03:23:28.479 align:start position:0%
treatment needed to accept their bodies
 
03:23:29.590 --> 03:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
as their
 
03:23:32.110 --> 03:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
own deciding if puberty blockers and
 
03:23:34.030 --> 03:23:34.040 align:start position:0%
hormones are needed for a child is a
 
03:23:35.750 --> 03:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
serious decision that should not be made
 
03:23:37.870 --> 03:23:37.880 align:start position:0%
lightly but most importantly this isn't
 
03:23:39.590 --> 03:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
a decision that should be made by the
 
03:23:41.389 --> 03:23:41.399 align:start position:0%
government this is a decision that
 
03:23:43.229 --> 03:23:43.239 align:start position:0%
should be made by parents who listen
 
03:23:45.110 --> 03:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
carefully to their children and their
 
03:23:47.070 --> 03:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
doctors restri restricting puberty
 
03:23:49.349 --> 03:23:49.359 align:start position:0%
blockers and hormones from trans kids
 
03:23:51.269 --> 03:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
won't change who they are it only makes
 
03:23:53.670 --> 03:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
it 72% more likely that they die before
 
03:23:56.229 --> 03:23:56.239 align:start position:0%
they reach adulthood this bill poses
 
03:23:58.229 --> 03:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
children as political pwns to distract
 
03:23:59.750 --> 03:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
from the greater issues of independent
 
03:24:01.910 --> 03:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
freedoms at risk in this country I
 
03:24:03.710 --> 03:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
oppose this bill because I want kids to
 
03:24:05.870 --> 03:24:05.880 align:start position:0%
stay alive and I think all children
 
03:24:07.870 --> 03:24:07.880 align:start position:0%
including trans children should be given
 
03:24:09.309 --> 03:24:09.319 align:start position:0%
the resources they need to make it
 
03:24:11.469 --> 03:24:11.479 align:start position:0%
safely to
 
03:24:15.349 --> 03:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
adulthood thank you any
 
03:24:20.710 --> 03:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:36.110 --> 03:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:39.229 --> 03:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
Cary you said it right the first time
 
03:24:40.990 --> 03:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
most people don't get it right the way I
 
03:24:43.630 --> 03:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
had a little help so I hate public
 
03:24:45.429 --> 03:24:45.439 align:start position:0%
speaking so I'm gonna read because not
 
03:24:47.990 --> 03:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
GNA so I'm speaking today in support of
 
03:24:48.000 --> 03:24:49.189 align:start position:0%
GNA so I'm speaking today in support of
HB

03:24:49.189 --> 03:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
HB
 
03:24:52.070 --> 03:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
377 I was diagnosed bip with bipolar
 
03:24:54.870 --> 03:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
disorder when I was 18 I've spent 22
 
03:24:56.710 --> 03:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
years living with mental illness and
 
03:24:58.469 --> 03:24:58.479 align:start position:0%
working to help erase the stigma and
 
03:24:59.950 --> 03:24:59.960 align:start position:0%
working hard to build a life that's
 
03:25:02.550 --> 03:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
fulfilling meaningful but also based in
 
03:25:05.229 --> 03:25:05.239 align:start position:0%
reality spending two decades deep in the
 
03:25:07.550 --> 03:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
mental health space I can tell you that
 
03:25:09.189 --> 03:25:09.199 align:start position:0%
there are no other mental health
 
03:25:11.389 --> 03:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
conditions where we allow the patient to
 
03:25:13.830 --> 03:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
dictate the standard of care gender
 
03:25:15.670 --> 03:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
dysphoria whether people like it or not
 
03:25:17.030 --> 03:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
is a mental health health condition and
 
03:25:19.910 --> 03:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
should be treated as such I think back
 
03:25:21.790 --> 03:25:21.800 align:start position:0%
to the few times in my life I have been
 
03:25:23.830 --> 03:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
suicidal what would have happened if I
 
03:25:25.349 --> 03:25:25.359 align:start position:0%
had gone into my doctor's office and
 
03:25:27.830 --> 03:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
said I no longer want to live this is my
 
03:25:30.229 --> 03:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
truth I know my mind better than you and
 
03:25:32.710 --> 03:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
this is the answer and then said
 
03:25:35.710 --> 03:25:35.720 align:start position:0%
doctor gave me a prescription for lethal
 
03:25:38.469 --> 03:25:38.479 align:start position:0%
doses of medication if my doctor allowed
 
03:25:40.910 --> 03:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
me to dictate my treatment plan I know
 
03:25:42.910 --> 03:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
many people have come down on state reps
 
03:25:45.309 --> 03:25:45.319 align:start position:0%
saying they have no business legislating
 
03:25:47.469 --> 03:25:47.479 align:start position:0%
standards of care but I would ask those
 
03:25:48.910 --> 03:25:48.920 align:start position:0%
people to realize this is something
 
03:25:50.990 --> 03:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's happened for decades and for good
 
03:25:53.830 --> 03:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
reason having been hospitalized I'm am
 
03:25:56.389 --> 03:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
unable to purchase a firearm now is that
 
03:25:57.950 --> 03:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
because you legislators think I'm cuckoo
 
03:26:00.630 --> 03:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
for Cocoa Puffs or is it because you
 
03:26:02.429 --> 03:26:02.439 align:start position:0%
understand that someone with my history
 
03:26:04.790 --> 03:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
of mental illness sometimes needs to be
 
03:26:06.349 --> 03:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
protected from the deception and the
 
03:26:08.590 --> 03:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
delusion that bipolar disorder creates
 
03:26:11.269 --> 03:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
in my mind I personally believe it's the
 
03:26:14.870 --> 03:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
latter before 2014 the standard protocol
 
03:26:16.550 --> 03:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
for gender dysphoria was walk for
 
03:26:19.349 --> 03:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
waiting and in over 60 to 80% of the
 
03:26:21.790 --> 03:26:21.800 align:start position:0%
cases once puberty was established and
 
03:26:23.950 --> 03:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
these kids were able to explore who they
 
03:26:26.349 --> 03:26:26.359 align:start position:0%
were through therapy and other means the
 
03:26:29.229 --> 03:26:29.239 align:start position:0%
Jud andoria resolved on its own in the
 
03:26:30.510 --> 03:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we don't allow
 
03:26:32.309 --> 03:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
children to get tattoos buy cigarettes
 
03:26:34.710 --> 03:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
or alcohol we have these laws because
 
03:26:36.830 --> 03:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
the adults know that children ultimately
 
03:26:39.349 --> 03:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
cannot process or fully comprehend the
 
03:26:41.510 --> 03:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
consequences of their actions we have
 
03:26:43.910 --> 03:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
these laws in place to protect children
 
03:26:47.309 --> 03:26:47.319 align:start position:0%
and HB 377 in my opinion Falls in line
 
03:26:48.990 --> 03:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire's strong history on
 
03:26:50.550 --> 03:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
airing on the side of caution when it
 
03:26:52.950 --> 03:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
comes to the protection of children with
 
03:26:54.830 --> 03:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
the findings of the cast report in the W
 
03:26:57.349 --> 03:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
path files every other country has
 
03:26:59.349 --> 03:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
paused the standard of care and we have
 
03:27:00.950 --> 03:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
the medical evidence to back up the
 
03:27:02.670 --> 03:27:02.680 align:start position:0%
plethora of reasons that we need to be
 
03:27:04.830 --> 03:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
following suit I would ask you to vote a
 
03:27:06.389 --> 03:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
to pass on this bill so that we can
 
03:27:07.990 --> 03:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
follow the science and help protect
 
03:27:12.590 --> 03:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
these children thank you thank you any
 
03:27:19.030 --> 03:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:24.349 --> 03:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:27.189 --> 03:27:27.199 align:start position:0%
lmore so I came back my name is Donna
 
03:27:29.389 --> 03:27:29.399 align:start position:0%

to step out come right back okay well I
 
03:27:34.830 --> 03:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
I've called Naomi Naomi at lore you you
 
03:27:37.309 --> 03:27:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:53.870 --> 03:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:55.150 --> 03:27:55.160 align:start position:0%
uh hi there thank you for giving me the
 
03:27:57.590 --> 03:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak today uh my name is
 
03:27:59.790 --> 03:27:59.800 align:start position:0%
Naomi lmore I'm a resident of Dover New
 
03:28:02.309 --> 03:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm here to testify
 
03:28:03.830 --> 03:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
against HB
 
03:28:07.429 --> 03:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
377 the vulnerable child compassion and
 
03:28:09.950 --> 03:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
protection act offers neither compassion
 
03:28:11.870 --> 03:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
nor protection and the name itself is
 
03:28:14.349 --> 03:28:14.359 align:start position:0%
derived from an inflammatory choice of
 
03:28:16.550 --> 03:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
words meant to create a false sense of
 
03:28:19.269 --> 03:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
danger when no threat exists the title
 
03:28:20.950 --> 03:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
of the bill attempts to emotionally
 
03:28:23.389 --> 03:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
manipulate a valid Precinct of thought
 
03:28:24.950 --> 03:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
when the only real precinct for this
 
03:28:28.110 --> 03:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
bill is intolerance and
 
03:28:31.309 --> 03:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
bigotry gender dysphoria if identified
 
03:28:33.429 --> 03:28:33.439 align:start position:0%
and treated early can only improve
 
03:28:36.229 --> 03:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
quality of life parents and families
 
03:28:37.830 --> 03:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
should have the option of pursuing
 
03:28:41.150 --> 03:28:41.160 align:start position:0%
hormonal treatments because that outcome
 
03:28:43.550 --> 03:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
can only and will always be reached by
 
03:28:45.030 --> 03:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
having a healthy dialogue with their
 
03:28:46.750 --> 03:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
children and acknowledging their
 
03:28:48.870 --> 03:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
feelings and experience the sort of
 
03:28:50.910 --> 03:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
dynamic that should exist in every
 
03:28:53.269 --> 03:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
healthy household Healthcare Providers
 
03:28:54.590 --> 03:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
should be able to have the freedom to
 
03:28:56.269 --> 03:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
engage in conversation and educate
 
03:28:58.590 --> 03:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
families deciding to pursue this and
 
03:29:00.110 --> 03:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
administer treatment if the family
 
03:29:02.790 --> 03:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
consents to it it is a private personal
 
03:29:04.790 --> 03:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
matter and this litigation withholds
 
03:29:06.590 --> 03:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
access to life-saving care and fosters
 
03:29:08.110 --> 03:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
an environment of fear and
 
03:29:09.950 --> 03:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding healthc care providers
 
03:29:11.910 --> 03:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
are not prescribing this in a predatory
 
03:29:14.269 --> 03:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
fashion and no danger exists in that
 
03:29:16.429 --> 03:29:16.439 align:start position:0%
regard this should be a family decision
 
03:29:18.150 --> 03:29:18.160 align:start position:0%
with the power vested in them and not
 
03:29:18.160 --> 03:29:18.990 align:start position:0%
with the power vested in them and not
the

03:29:18.990 --> 03:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:29:21.710 --> 03:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
state postponing puberty to address and
 
03:29:24.150 --> 03:29:24.160 align:start position:0%
discuss dysphoria does not cause harm
 
03:29:25.750 --> 03:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
and is reversible by ceasing the
 
03:29:27.870 --> 03:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
medication furthermore being able to
 
03:29:29.429 --> 03:29:29.439 align:start position:0%
address those symptoms early through
 
03:29:31.750 --> 03:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care changes lives for
 
03:29:33.950 --> 03:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
the better the prevalence of suicide and
 
03:29:36.070 --> 03:29:36.080 align:start position:0%
self harm so often used to discredit
 
03:29:37.830 --> 03:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
people who are transgender and the
 
03:29:40.469 --> 03:29:40.479 align:start position:0%
treatments they undertake only exists
 
03:29:42.469 --> 03:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
because of the ignorant and hurtful acts
 
03:29:44.590 --> 03:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
of others their learned intolerance
 
03:29:46.670 --> 03:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
stemming from pathologically maladaptive
 
03:29:48.990 --> 03:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
ideas of what normal should be this
 
03:29:50.750 --> 03:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
litigation limits common access and
 
03:29:52.469 --> 03:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
knowledge about gender care and will
 
03:29:55.030 --> 03:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
propagate harassment because of this
 
03:29:57.269 --> 03:29:57.279 align:start position:0%
personally I'm concerned this bill is
 
03:29:59.269 --> 03:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
primarily a stepping stone to try and
 
03:30:01.550 --> 03:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
block the same treatments and gender
 
03:30:03.790 --> 03:30:03.800 align:start position:0%
affirming care for adults it seeks to
 
03:30:05.870 --> 03:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
Chisel a small foothold of constraint
 
03:30:08.790 --> 03:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
against excuse me transgender rights to
 
03:30:10.429 --> 03:30:10.439 align:start position:0%
use in the future to introduce laws
 
03:30:12.389 --> 03:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
targeting everyone for the purpose of
 
03:30:14.950 --> 03:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
banning hormonal replacement therapy
 
03:30:17.349 --> 03:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
this bill only serves to answer problems
 
03:30:19.870 --> 03:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
that do not exist and to be intimidating
 
03:30:23.189 --> 03:30:23.199 align:start position:0%
please vote no on HB 377 it helps
 
03:30:26.349 --> 03:30:26.359 align:start position:0%
nothing thank you any questions
 
03:30:29.030 --> 03:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative kessle ring so thank you
 
03:30:30.309 --> 03:30:30.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:30:32.910 --> 03:30:32.920 align:start position:0%
question if there was studies to prove
 
03:30:34.670 --> 03:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
that children are being harmed or
 
03:30:36.670 --> 03:30:36.680 align:start position:0%
there's possible long-term effects would
 
03:30:38.990 --> 03:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
you change your stance and say that we
 
03:30:42.030 --> 03:30:42.040 align:start position:0%
should pass a bill that would stop these
 
03:30:43.950 --> 03:30:43.960 align:start position:0%
procedures from be going forward thank
 
03:30:45.710 --> 03:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
you for the question um I think that
 
03:30:45.720 --> 03:30:46.790 align:start position:0%
you for the question um I think that
that

03:30:46.790 --> 03:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:30:49.469 --> 03:30:49.479 align:start position:0%
still the the decision would still have
 
03:30:52.229 --> 03:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
to lie with the medical professional um
 
03:30:53.429 --> 03:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
administering the treatment and the
 
03:30:55.550 --> 03:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
family um all treatments and all
 
03:30:57.469 --> 03:30:57.479 align:start position:0%
medications come with side effects and
 
03:30:59.550 --> 03:30:59.560 align:start position:0%
it would be a matter of weighing what
 
03:31:01.110 --> 03:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
those negatives versus positives would
 
03:31:03.269 --> 03:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
be based off how severe they would be if
 
03:31:05.590 --> 03:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
that hypothetically were to
 
03:31:08.189 --> 03:31:08.199 align:start position:0%
happen other
 
03:31:13.550 --> 03:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:16.110 --> 03:31:16.120 align:start position:0%
you okay and also signed up to speak is
 
03:31:16.120 --> 03:31:21.950 align:start position:0%
you okay and also signed up to speak is
Donna

03:31:21.950 --> 03:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:24.790 --> 03:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
Peterson thank you very much chair Vice
 
03:31:26.950 --> 03:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee for
 
03:31:29.950 --> 03:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak um I'm coming
 
03:31:32.510 --> 03:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
because I'm going to ask you to vote a
 
03:31:34.710 --> 03:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
to pass on HB
 
03:31:37.590 --> 03:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
377 I firmly believe it is for the
 
03:31:41.189 --> 03:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
protection of children um I have
 
03:31:45.030 --> 03:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
personally known um young women who have
 
03:31:45.040 --> 03:31:46.349 align:start position:0%
personally known um young women who have
transgender

03:31:46.349 --> 03:31:46.359 align:start position:0%
transgender
 
03:31:49.469 --> 03:31:49.479 align:start position:0%
as teenagers and have regretted it and
 
03:31:52.349 --> 03:31:52.359 align:start position:0%
have then gone on to De
 
03:31:55.429 --> 03:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
detransition and it is not true that the
 
03:31:58.750 --> 03:31:58.760 align:start position:0%
hormone blockers and the um the puberty
 
03:32:01.030 --> 03:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
blockers and the hormones do not have
 
03:32:03.510 --> 03:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
any longlasting effect they will attest
 
03:32:05.870 --> 03:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
to that they will have to shave their
 
03:32:08.349 --> 03:32:08.359 align:start position:0%
face for the rest of their life their vo
 
03:32:11.110 --> 03:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
is deeper and I know at least one of
 
03:32:13.630 --> 03:32:13.640 align:start position:0%
them is deeply distressed by the fact
 
03:32:16.150 --> 03:32:16.160 align:start position:0%
that if she ever decides to marry and
 
03:32:18.110 --> 03:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
wants to have children she'll never be
 
03:32:21.550 --> 03:32:21.560 align:start position:0%
able to breastfeed her children children
 
03:32:24.070 --> 03:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
under the age of 18 young people do not
 
03:32:27.269 --> 03:32:27.279 align:start position:0%
have an adult brain they cannot make and
 
03:32:30.309 --> 03:32:30.319 align:start position:0%
should not be expected to make
 
03:32:32.510 --> 03:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
life-altering decisions over their
 
03:32:35.510 --> 03:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
bodies that can never be reversed these
 
03:32:38.269 --> 03:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
treatments sterilize children and if
 
03:32:40.070 --> 03:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
they decide later on in life that they
 
03:32:42.750 --> 03:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
want to have a family they will be
 
03:32:46.229 --> 03:32:46.239 align:start position:0%
prohibited from being able to do so you
 
03:32:48.110 --> 03:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
have a child you have a six-year-old
 
03:32:51.110 --> 03:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
child a young boy for example you know
 
03:32:53.590 --> 03:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
one day they want to be Batman two days
 
03:32:56.670 --> 03:32:56.680 align:start position:0%
later they want to be a girl five years
 
03:32:58.070 --> 03:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
from now they wish they didn't
 
03:32:59.790 --> 03:32:59.800 align:start position:0%
transgender and they wish they were
 
03:33:02.790 --> 03:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
still a boy they need to be I have
 
03:33:05.269 --> 03:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
friends who are transgender I have
 
03:33:07.189 --> 03:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
relatives who are transgender and I love
 
03:33:10.510 --> 03:33:10.520 align:start position:0%
them dearly but they had the benefit of
 
03:33:13.630 --> 03:33:13.640 align:start position:0%
making these decisions as adults with
 
03:33:15.830 --> 03:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
the ability the cognitive thinking
 
03:33:19.510 --> 03:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
skills to look at all the um issues and
 
03:33:22.229 --> 03:33:22.239 align:start position:0%
look at all the potential long-term
 
03:33:25.110 --> 03:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
consequences and I think every person in
 
03:33:27.790 --> 03:33:27.800 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire deserves the
 
03:33:30.389 --> 03:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
right to make a decision that they're
 
03:33:32.950 --> 03:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
capable of making just as has been said
 
03:33:35.750 --> 03:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
before you can't you know buy cigarettes
 
03:33:38.630 --> 03:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
if you're under 18 you can't buy um
 
03:33:40.950 --> 03:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
alcohol you can't get your ears pierced
 
03:33:42.670 --> 03:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
without a parents permission you can't
 
03:33:45.870 --> 03:33:45.880 align:start position:0%
get a tattoo so why are we having them
 
03:33:48.229 --> 03:33:48.239 align:start position:0%
make life-altering permanent changes to
 
03:33:49.830 --> 03:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
their bodies that they might regret
 
03:33:52.950 --> 03:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
later granted not all of them regret it
 
03:33:54.590 --> 03:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
but they should be making these
 
03:33:57.389 --> 03:33:57.399 align:start position:0%
decisions as adults when they're 18 so
 
03:33:59.590 --> 03:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
this is U my testimony and I thank you
 
03:34:01.710 --> 03:34:01.720 align:start position:0%

03:34:41.710 --> 03:34:41.720 align:start position:0%
watched your segment on conquered

conversations and I wish I could say
 
03:34:45.950 --> 03:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
that I could accept what you said at
 
03:34:48.189 --> 03:34:48.199 align:start position:0%
face value that I could believe that you
 
03:34:50.030 --> 03:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
introduced this bill with no hate or
 
03:34:51.670 --> 03:34:51.680 align:start position:0%
discrimination addressing the committee
 
03:34:53.990 --> 03:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
ma'am not just one individual oh my
 
03:34:57.309 --> 03:34:57.319 align:start position:0%
apologies I can withdraw
 
03:35:01.950 --> 03:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
that all right um You may actually
 
03:35:04.950 --> 03:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
believe that anyone who introduced this
 
03:35:06.550 --> 03:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
bill can believe that they have nothing
 
03:35:09.070 --> 03:35:09.080 align:start position:0%
against trans people but that's all this
 
03:35:11.189 --> 03:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
bill is if we actually thought that
 
03:35:13.590 --> 03:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
puberty blockers were dangerous this
 
03:35:15.110 --> 03:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
would be a hearing about whether or not
 
03:35:17.030 --> 03:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
puberty loers should be legal for all
 
03:35:19.950 --> 03:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
youth under 18 years old it is not this
 
03:35:21.910 --> 03:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
bill specifically outlines that this
 
03:35:23.309 --> 03:35:23.319 align:start position:0%
intervention should be denied
 
03:35:25.670 --> 03:35:25.680 align:start position:0%

to new and developing science and
 
03:35:34.550 --> 03:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
information so far I have yet to hear
 
03:35:36.469 --> 03:35:36.479 align:start position:0%
anything compelling enough to agree that
 
03:35:38.469 --> 03:35:38.479 align:start position:0%
a bill outlining puberty blockers
 
03:35:41.429 --> 03:35:41.439 align:start position:0%
altogether should be pushed through if
 
03:35:43.630 --> 03:35:43.640 align:start position:0%
these are these medications are as
 
03:35:45.870 --> 03:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
dangerous as you are implying come back
 
03:35:47.790 --> 03:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
with a bill that supposedly protects all
 
03:35:50.389 --> 03:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
youth from these medications and if you
 
03:35:52.110 --> 03:35:52.120 align:start position:0%
want to make these medications less
 
03:35:54.670 --> 03:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
necessary may I recommend ceasing to use
 
03:35:56.590 --> 03:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
trans youth as political pwns of
 
03:35:59.469 --> 03:35:59.479 align:start position:0%
division if you truly love all people I
 
03:36:00.950 --> 03:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
implore you to do some
 
03:36:03.070 --> 03:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
self-reflection how do you advocate for
 
03:36:05.349 --> 03:36:05.359 align:start position:0%
the protection safety and acceptance of
 
03:36:08.750 --> 03:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
trans youth especially non-binary youth
 
03:36:10.309 --> 03:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
because take it from someone with
 
03:36:12.469 --> 03:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
Decades of experience sharing Community
 
03:36:14.670 --> 03:36:14.680 align:start position:0%
with both teens and adults who are trans
 
03:36:16.269 --> 03:36:16.279 align:start position:0%
and non-binary
 
03:36:17.790 --> 03:36:17.800 align:start position:0%
nothing is more destructive than
 
03:36:19.790 --> 03:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
watching people and politicians argue
 
03:36:21.990 --> 03:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
about your identity as if you know
 
03:36:24.229 --> 03:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
nothing of your own lived experience or
 
03:36:25.710 --> 03:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
that you have no understanding of
 
03:36:28.229 --> 03:36:28.239 align:start position:0%
yourself when ignorant politicians and
 
03:36:31.070 --> 03:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
antagonists claim their pronouns are USA
 
03:36:33.189 --> 03:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
and kiss my ass do you push back on
 
03:36:35.630 --> 03:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
their egregious misunderstanding of the
 
03:36:37.910 --> 03:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
English language or point out how
 
03:36:41.110 --> 03:36:41.120 align:start position:0%
offensive they're being to the valid
 
03:36:43.030 --> 03:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
expressions of gender that fall outside
 
03:36:46.229 --> 03:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
of our traditional understanding outs
 
03:36:48.389 --> 03:36:48.399 align:start position:0%
outside of outlawing these medications
 
03:36:50.710 --> 03:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
that help buy time for youth to explore
 
03:36:53.110 --> 03:36:53.120 align:start position:0%
and realize their identity what else do
 
03:36:54.990 --> 03:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
you do to help these folks you claim to
 
03:36:57.910 --> 03:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
care so much about one of the biggest
 
03:37:00.750 --> 03:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
causes of suicidal ideation and using
 
03:37:03.269 --> 03:37:03.279 align:start position:0%
drugs and alcohol as a coping mechanism
 
03:37:05.630 --> 03:37:05.640 align:start position:0%
come from isolation from the society and
 
03:37:08.150 --> 03:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
Community you're surrounded by every
 
03:37:09.990 --> 03:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
time one of you introduces the bill
 
03:37:12.150 --> 03:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
targeting the trans identity you
 
03:37:14.389 --> 03:37:14.399 align:start position:0%
validate those who look to dismiss
 
03:37:17.550 --> 03:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
ridicule and isolate Youth and adults
 
03:37:19.590 --> 03:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
for that matter who don't conform or
 
03:37:22.030 --> 03:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
find Comfort 15 seconds please wrap up
 
03:37:24.910 --> 03:37:24.920 align:start position:0%

Birth I'm not here to say puberty
 
03:37:28.870 --> 03:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
blockers are for everyone figuring out
 
03:37:30.790 --> 03:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
their gender identity I'm here to say
 
03:37:32.710 --> 03:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
that puberty blockers may be for some
 
03:37:34.830 --> 03:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
youth in some circumstances and that's
 
03:37:36.389 --> 03:37:36.399 align:start position:0%
enough reason for me to oppose the

03:38:27.870 --> 03:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
raised significant concerns among

parents as responsible adults and
 
03:38:31.590 --> 03:38:31.600 align:start position:0%

03:38:42.550 --> 03:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
underscore the urgency of protecting our

children from puberty blockers and

03:38:57.309 --> 03:38:57.319 align:start position:0%
lead to irreversible changes including

ster uh being sterile and loss of sexual

later regret in
 
03:39:07.110 --> 03:39:07.120 align:start position:0%
life puberty is a crucial phase of

significant physical and psychological
 
03:39:14.229 --> 03:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
changes by interfering with this natural

03:39:25.469 --> 03:39:25.479 align:start position:0%
self-identity the complexity of the

risks and consequences associated with
 
03:39:28.950 --> 03:39:28.960 align:start position:0%
puberty blockers and hormone treatments
 
03:39:30.630 --> 03:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
can be difficult for adolescence to
 
03:39:33.070 --> 03:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
fully comprehend this raises questions
 
03:39:34.950 --> 03:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
about their ability to provide informed
 
03:39:37.189 --> 03:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
consent and increases the likelihood of
 
03:39:40.110 --> 03:39:40.120 align:start position:0%
regret or negative
 
03:39:42.630 --> 03:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
outcomes many adolescents experiencing
 
03:39:45.790 --> 03:39:45.800 align:start position:0%
gender dysphoria may be struggling with
 
03:39:48.070 --> 03:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
occurring mental health challenges it is
 
03:39:49.750 --> 03:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
crucial to address these underlying
 
03:39:51.590 --> 03:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
issues before considering invasive
 
03:39:53.910 --> 03:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
irreversible treatments ensuring that we
 
03:39:57.910 --> 03:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
are promoting long-term psychological
 
03:40:01.070 --> 03:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
well-being that being said I don't think
 
03:40:04.150 --> 03:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
there's a person in this room who is not
 
03:40:06.750 --> 03:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
that doesn't possess compassion for
 
03:40:09.030 --> 03:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
these children I think there's some
 
03:40:12.550 --> 03:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
sense that we all want what is best for
 
03:40:16.870 --> 03:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
these kids it is our job as a adults to
 
03:40:19.189 --> 03:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
protect our
 
03:40:22.349 --> 03:40:22.359 align:start position:0%
children our children cannot give
 
03:40:25.830 --> 03:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
consent for medical procedures why would
 
03:40:28.309 --> 03:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
we go ahead and give that consent for
 
03:40:32.630 --> 03:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
them thank you thank you any
 
03:40:37.349 --> 03:40:37.359 align:start position:0%

good afternoon members uh thank you for

Hampshire well uh and have been a New
 
03:41:06.429 --> 03:41:06.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident for well over 40
 
03:41:10.790 --> 03:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
years um and
 
03:41:14.070 --> 03:41:14.080 align:start position:0%
um I I want to talk about the the
 
03:41:14.080 --> 03:41:15.710 align:start position:0%
um I I want to talk about the the
Medical

03:41:15.710 --> 03:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
Medical
 
03:41:18.189 --> 03:41:18.199 align:start position:0%
uh interventions that we're talking
 
03:41:21.189 --> 03:41:21.199 align:start position:0%
about and H uh some people brought up
 
03:41:24.750 --> 03:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
the cash report and with and uh and also
 
03:41:27.670 --> 03:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
the fact that it's been debunked a lot
 
03:41:29.670 --> 03:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
um so I was looking up some things and I
 
03:41:33.670 --> 03:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
came across a a report from France that
 
03:41:35.910 --> 03:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
was their medical team and what they
 
03:41:38.030 --> 03:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
thought would be appropriate
 
03:41:41.229 --> 03:41:41.239 align:start position:0%
treatments um and it it did it did
 
03:41:44.070 --> 03:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
debunk a lot of the cast report but to
 
03:41:45.750 --> 03:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
tell you the truth
 
03:41:48.429 --> 03:41:48.439 align:start position:0%
when I read through that report I
 
03:41:51.110 --> 03:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't really understand it because
 
03:41:53.710 --> 03:41:53.720 align:start position:0%
there were medical terms in there that I
 
03:41:57.710 --> 03:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
didn't know about um and and even if I
 
03:42:00.030 --> 03:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
got a definition of those terms I didn't
 
03:42:02.590 --> 03:42:02.600 align:start position:0%
have the background uh in medicine to
 
03:42:06.469 --> 03:42:06.479 align:start position:0%
really understand um so this is why I
 
03:42:12.070 --> 03:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
think that the the medical experts who
 
03:42:13.269 --> 03:42:13.279 align:start position:0%
have given
 
03:42:15.750 --> 03:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
testimony should be the ones making
 
03:42:18.670 --> 03:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
these kind of decisions I think that
 
03:42:21.750 --> 03:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
that when a parent brings their child to
 
03:42:24.830 --> 03:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
a medical professional and they have a
 
03:42:27.389 --> 03:42:27.399 align:start position:0%
discussion that that should be
 
03:42:30.630 --> 03:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
respected I don't think that a political
 
03:42:34.110 --> 03:42:34.120 align:start position:0%
body should be making these
 
03:42:38.830 --> 03:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
decisions uh this so this is a
 
03:42:40.790 --> 03:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
fundamental uh disagreement with this
 
03:42:44.870 --> 03:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
whole process and why I oppose this um
 
03:42:46.590 --> 03:42:46.600 align:start position:0%
at I've heard a lot of testimony very
 
03:42:49.269 --> 03:42:49.279 align:start position:0%
interesting which I frankly disagree
 
03:42:52.590 --> 03:42:52.600 align:start position:0%
with um at one point people have kept
 
03:42:54.990 --> 03:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
talk talking about how this is
 
03:42:57.189 --> 03:42:57.199 align:start position:0%
irreversible I know a lot of trans
 
03:43:00.510 --> 03:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
people I know a a trans non-binary
 
03:43:03.550 --> 03:43:03.560 align:start position:0%
person who has who has um gone back and
 
03:43:06.870 --> 03:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
forth you might say she's taken male
 
03:43:10.070 --> 03:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
hormones then they then then they
 
03:43:12.469 --> 03:43:12.479 align:start position:0%
decided to have children they have two
 
03:43:15.670 --> 03:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
lovely children now so the idea that
 
03:43:17.389 --> 03:43:17.399 align:start position:0%
things are
 
03:43:20.710 --> 03:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
irreversible is not actually
 
03:43:24.189 --> 03:43:24.199 align:start position:0%
true and and in in
 
03:43:28.710 --> 03:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
um in other aspects of this uh I I I

uh came out to their parents that they
 
03:43:34.399 --> 03:43:35.830 align:start position:0%
uh came out to their parents that they
were

03:43:35.830 --> 03:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
were
 
03:43:39.229 --> 03:43:39.239 align:start position:0%
transgender and their mother who
 
03:43:43.429 --> 03:43:43.439 align:start position:0%

case you want to have your biological
 
03:43:52.349 --> 03:43:52.359 align:start position:0%

seconds thank you very much um that's my
 
03:43:58.429 --> 03:43:58.439 align:start position:0%
main point let's listen to the doctors
 
03:44:00.429 --> 03:44:00.439 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions representative
 
03:44:03.229 --> 03:44:03.239 align:start position:0%
Castle ring just have a quick one um
 
03:44:05.469 --> 03:44:05.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and when it comes to
 
03:44:06.950 --> 03:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
the other states that have passed laws I
 
03:44:08.710 --> 03:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
believe it's around 26 uh that have
 
03:44:10.469 --> 03:44:10.479 align:start position:0%
passed different types of laws and all
 
03:44:12.070 --> 03:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
the other countries I'm sorry I'm hard
 
03:44:13.469 --> 03:44:13.479 align:start position:0%
of hearing I can't hear what you're
 
03:44:15.790 --> 03:44:15.800 align:start position:0%
saying could you speak Lou
 
03:44:17.189 --> 03:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
yes I can trying to get
 
03:44:20.469 --> 03:44:20.479 align:start position:0%
this so the other I believe it's 26
 
03:44:23.070 --> 03:44:23.080 align:start position:0%
states that pass laws to you block
 
03:44:25.149 --> 03:44:25.159 align:start position:0%
puberty blockers and things like that um
 
03:44:26.630 --> 03:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
including the other countries have you
 
03:44:28.349 --> 03:44:28.359 align:start position:0%
done any research on what their findings
 
03:44:31.070 --> 03:44:31.080 align:start position:0%
were because you said you disagree with
 
03:44:33.870 --> 03:44:33.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of what was said today yes I think
 
03:44:36.349 --> 03:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
I think this is um
 
03:44:39.590 --> 03:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
basically uh a political climate that
 
03:44:41.830 --> 03:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
we're in and these are political
 
03:44:45.469 --> 03:44:45.479 align:start position:0%
decisions that are are targeting a small
 
03:44:48.189 --> 03:44:48.199 align:start position:0%
minority of people as somebody that they
 
03:44:51.349 --> 03:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
can control and then that that control
 
03:44:54.389 --> 03:44:54.399 align:start position:0%
then starts to extend to the rest of us
 
03:44:56.229 --> 03:44:56.239 align:start position:0%
that's what I think is what is happening
 
03:45:01.269 --> 03:45:01.279 align:start position:0%
here and it's uh uh people and I I do
 
03:45:03.309 --> 03:45:03.319 align:start position:0%
think there's Prejudice I think people
 
03:45:06.149 --> 03:45:06.159 align:start position:0%
in their mind have been brought up to
 
03:45:09.990 --> 03:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
fear people who are different and then
 
03:45:12.750 --> 03:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
that that makes them want to say I've
 
03:45:14.469 --> 03:45:14.479 align:start position:0%
got to get I've got to eliminate them
 
03:45:16.309 --> 03:45:16.319 align:start position:0%
they're SC of
 
03:45:19.389 --> 03:45:19.399 align:start position:0%
them follow up so the question
 
03:45:21.030 --> 03:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
specifically would be have you
 
03:45:24.189 --> 03:45:24.199 align:start position:0%
researched any of their findings have I
 
03:45:26.950 --> 03:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
read well I'm not a medical doctor U so
 
03:45:29.630 --> 03:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
I can't research that but there are
 
03:45:31.910 --> 03:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
medical doctors who will answer those
 
03:45:34.750 --> 03:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
questions and so I will defer to them
 
03:45:37.030 --> 03:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
and I hope you ask the that when a
 
03:45:39.550 --> 03:45:39.560 align:start position:0%
medical doctor stands up here please ask
 
03:45:41.710 --> 03:45:41.720 align:start position:0%
that question because it's a very
 
03:45:45.590 --> 03:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
important question yeah thank you the

03:46:05.429 --> 03:46:05.439 align:start position:0%
Hughes did they have to leave I'll put
 
03:46:06.630 --> 03:46:06.640 align:start position:0%

my testimony today new Futures is a
 
03:46:52.630 --> 03:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan nonprofit uh organization
 
03:46:55.469 --> 03:46:55.479 align:start position:0%
that supports uh polic supports change
 
03:46:57.750 --> 03:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
through policy change or supports Health
 
03:46:59.950 --> 03:46:59.960 align:start position:0%
through policy change sorry uh new
 
03:47:01.950 --> 03:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
future is here in strong opposition to
 
03:47:03.950 --> 03:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
House Bill 377 because it attacks a
 
03:47:05.630 --> 03:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
Minor's ability to feel supported by
 
03:47:07.950 --> 03:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
their families and communities and it is
 
03:47:09.670 --> 03:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
go governmental overreach that will
 
03:47:11.030 --> 03:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
limit transgender Youth and their
 
03:47:13.550 --> 03:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
family's ability to seek necessary
 
03:47:18.550 --> 03:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
care trans youth face um higher rates of
 
03:47:20.830 --> 03:47:20.840 align:start position:0%
discrimination in bills like this and in
 
03:47:23.950 --> 03:47:23.960 align:start position:0%
their uh daily lives and communities
 
03:47:26.149 --> 03:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
that feeling of rejection contributes to
 
03:47:28.870 --> 03:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
higher rates of anxiety depression and
 
03:47:31.469 --> 03:47:31.479 align:start position:0%
poor mental health outcomes they are not
 
03:47:35.590 --> 03:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:38.830 --> 03:47:38.840 align:start position:0%
uh they're not inherently more subject
 
03:47:41.189 --> 03:47:41.199 align:start position:0%
to uh poor mental health outcomes it's
 
03:47:43.830 --> 03:47:43.840 align:start position:0%
because of instances of
 
03:47:46.030 --> 03:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
discrimination hibiting gender affirming
 
03:47:48.710 --> 03:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
care such as this eliminates the Privacy
 
03:47:50.309 --> 03:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
rights of those minors and their family
 
03:47:51.830 --> 03:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
to choose the most effective level of
 
03:47:54.990 --> 03:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
care for their needs these um feelings
 
03:47:57.670 --> 03:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
of rejection and lack of privacy are
 
03:48:00.070 --> 03:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
also contributors to poor mental health
 
03:48:01.790 --> 03:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
outcomes this goes against
 
03:48:03.469 --> 03:48:03.479 align:start position:0%
recommendations from the American
 
03:48:05.590 --> 03:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
Academy of Pediatrics the American
 
03:48:08.309 --> 03:48:08.319 align:start position:0%
Medical Association and other major
 
03:48:11.229 --> 03:48:11.239 align:start position:0%
bodies that of medical
 
03:48:13.710 --> 03:48:13.720 align:start position:0%
professionals um early intervention and
 
03:48:16.149 --> 03:48:16.159 align:start position:0%
treatment using G affirming approaches
 
03:48:18.229 --> 03:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
May alleviate some of the mental health
 
03:48:19.870 --> 03:48:19.880 align:start position:0%
consequences that are associated with
 
03:48:21.550 --> 03:48:21.560 align:start position:0%
these feelings of rejection and
 
03:48:23.710 --> 03:48:23.720 align:start position:0%
discrimination and so for those reasons
 
03:48:25.870 --> 03:48:25.880 align:start position:0%
new Futures ask the committee to itl
 
03:48:28.710 --> 03:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
senate or House Bill 377 happy to take
 
03:48:30.990 --> 03:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you any questions
 
03:48:33.149 --> 03:48:33.159 align:start position:0%
representative Castle I'm gonna thank
 
03:48:34.870 --> 03:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
03:48:36.710 --> 03:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
question I want to pose the same
 
03:48:38.309 --> 03:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
question in a different way that I just
 
03:48:41.469 --> 03:48:41.479 align:start position:0%
asked last time there's approximately 26
 
03:48:43.710 --> 03:48:43.720 align:start position:0%
States and several countries that have
 
03:48:46.670 --> 03:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
banned the use of puberty blockers and
 
03:48:49.710 --> 03:48:49.720 align:start position:0%
minors do you agree that they are on the
 
03:48:52.630 --> 03:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
wrong side of this issue or are they
 
03:48:54.990 --> 03:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
completely making laws and rules that
 
03:48:58.389 --> 03:48:58.399 align:start position:0%
are not right for the country I haven't
 
03:49:00.750 --> 03:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
had the chance to review those laws so I
 
03:49:02.469 --> 03:49:02.479 align:start position:0%
can't say whether or not they are right
 
03:49:04.389 --> 03:49:04.399 align:start position:0%
or wrong but I can say the
 
03:49:06.429 --> 03:49:06.439 align:start position:0%
discriminatory laws that prohibit
 
03:49:09.149 --> 03:49:09.159 align:start position:0%
medical care for are necessary medical
 
03:49:10.469 --> 03:49:10.479 align:start position:0%
care for individuals who face
 
03:49:13.630 --> 03:49:13.640 align:start position:0%
discrimination and uh have been shown to
 
03:49:16.309 --> 03:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
improve uh increased poor mental health
 
03:49:20.429 --> 03:49:20.439 align:start position:0%
outcomes are are uh not an appropriate
 
03:49:24.469 --> 03:49:24.479 align:start position:0%
use of time follow thank you um as a
 
03:49:26.429 --> 03:49:26.439 align:start position:0%
followup you said necessary care could
 
03:49:28.429 --> 03:49:28.439 align:start position:0%
you define how this would be necessary
 
03:49:31.189 --> 03:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
care for a minor um I think that is
 
03:49:33.630 --> 03:49:33.640 align:start position:0%
between a minor a family and their
 
03:49:37.229 --> 03:49:37.239 align:start position:0%
provider um what is necessary and what
 
03:49:39.389 --> 03:49:39.399 align:start position:0%
isn't other
 
03:49:41.630 --> 03:49:41.640 align:start position:0%

this is done in close collaboration with

their parents Banning this medically
 
03:51:10.349 --> 03:51:10.359 align:start position:0%
necessary care puts transgender youth at
 
03:51:13.510 --> 03:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
increased risk of serious harm including
 
03:51:16.229 --> 03:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
depression self harm suicidal thoughts
 
03:51:19.590 --> 03:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
or behavior and more when trans youth
 
03:51:21.630 --> 03:51:21.640 align:start position:0%
like all youth receive the medical care
 
03:51:24.149 --> 03:51:24.159 align:start position:0%
they need they are able to thrive and
 
03:51:26.990 --> 03:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
have access to a happy healthy childhood
 
03:51:29.389 --> 03:51:29.399 align:start position:0%
that sets them up to go on for Success
 
03:51:32.030 --> 03:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
are outright young people have grown up
 
03:51:34.110 --> 03:51:34.120 align:start position:0%

military serve our communities and More
 
03:51:39.590 --> 03:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
in part because of access to this kind
 
03:51:42.630 --> 03:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
of care it can be hard to understand
 
03:51:44.910 --> 03:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
what it is like for parents and famili
 
03:51:47.670 --> 03:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
to have a transgender child our parents
 
03:51:49.870 --> 03:51:49.880 align:start position:0%
and caregivers like all parents and
 
03:51:52.630 --> 03:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
caregivers want their children to have
 
03:51:55.030 --> 03:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
access to the best possible medical and
 
03:51:57.870 --> 03:51:57.880 align:start position:0%
health care and the spaces and places
 
03:52:00.149 --> 03:52:00.159 align:start position:0%
that their children need to thrive they
 
03:52:01.910 --> 03:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
want their children to grow up into
 
03:52:04.510 --> 03:52:04.520 align:start position:0%
healthy and Wells supported adults when
 
03:52:06.269 --> 03:52:06.279 align:start position:0%
I sit in a room with our parents and
 
03:52:08.990 --> 03:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
caregivers right now I can feel their
 
03:52:11.870 --> 03:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
fear that these life-saving well-vetted
 
03:52:14.710 --> 03:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
supports for their children will be lost
 
03:52:16.950 --> 03:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
no parent or caregiver should have to
 
03:52:19.590 --> 03:52:19.600 align:start position:0%
fear losing their child due to a loss of
 
03:52:21.870 --> 03:52:21.880 align:start position:0%

have a definition of what you feel is
 
03:53:04.950 --> 03:53:04.960 align:start position:0%

other

03:53:10.830 --> 03:53:10.840 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:53:13.030 --> 03:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
questions seeing on thank thank you very
 
03:53:13.040 --> 03:53:16.469 align:start position:0%
questions seeing on thank thank you very
much

03:53:16.469 --> 03:53:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:30.990 --> 03:53:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:33.630 --> 03:53:33.640 align:start position:0%
scare good afternoon chairman and
 
03:53:36.110 --> 03:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
distinguished committee
 
03:53:38.590 --> 03:53:38.600 align:start position:0%
members I'm speaking in favor of this
 
03:53:40.990 --> 03:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
bill the state already interferes with
 
03:53:43.830 --> 03:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
medical care with its conversion therapy
 
03:53:46.349 --> 03:53:46.359 align:start position:0%
ban which makes it a crime for a
 
03:53:49.110 --> 03:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
therapist to question a gender identity
 
03:53:50.990 --> 03:53:51.000 align:start position:0%
even though gender identities are
 
03:53:51.000 --> 03:53:52.550 align:start position:0%
even though gender identities are
entirely

03:53:52.550 --> 03:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
entirely
 
03:53:55.189 --> 03:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
imaginary also medical decisions that
 
03:53:57.469 --> 03:53:57.479 align:start position:0%
are made out of coercion with suicide
 
03:54:00.189 --> 03:54:00.199 align:start position:0%
threats aren't informed decisions and
 
03:54:02.990 --> 03:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
and parents are emotionally
 
03:54:05.070 --> 03:54:05.080 align:start position:0%
blackmailed you any of you could check
 
03:54:07.550 --> 03:54:07.560 align:start position:0%
this quickly the 1% regret rate doesn't
 
03:54:10.229 --> 03:54:10.239 align:start position:0%
even measure regret the main feeder into
 
03:54:13.389 --> 03:54:13.399 align:start position:0%
this group of studies um measures regret
 
03:54:16.670 --> 03:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
or detransition is someone who went
 
03:54:18.469 --> 03:54:18.479 align:start position:0%
ahead and went on the hormones the
 
03:54:21.269 --> 03:54:21.279 align:start position:0%
opposite sex then reapplied to be the
 
03:54:23.070 --> 03:54:23.080 align:start position:0%
other sex and went ahead and changes
 
03:54:25.269 --> 03:54:25.279 align:start position:0%
their name I didn't I know a lot of D
 
03:54:27.830 --> 03:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
transitioners but not one would qualify
 
03:54:31.429 --> 03:54:31.439 align:start position:0%
under these conditions and even by the
 
03:54:32.950 --> 03:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
those standards we don't know the regret
 
03:54:35.309 --> 03:54:35.319 align:start position:0%
rates because the Dropout rates was
 
03:54:37.990 --> 03:54:38.000 align:start position:0%
about 30% the follow-up rates were as
 
03:54:40.910 --> 03:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
short as less than one year for for
 
03:54:43.750 --> 03:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
these studies and some of them have
 
03:54:45.710 --> 03:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with actual regret like
 
03:54:49.950 --> 03:54:49.960 align:start position:0%
one was a choice of um a surgeries and
 
03:54:52.550 --> 03:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
did you regret your choice of
 
03:54:54.910 --> 03:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
surgeries the also these were done on
 
03:54:57.870 --> 03:54:57.880 align:start position:0%
adults who were heavily vetted with not
 
03:54:59.670 --> 03:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
under the affirmation and there has
 
03:55:01.710 --> 03:55:01.720 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with this puberty blocker
 
03:55:04.309 --> 03:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
cross-x hormones protocol that we have
 
03:55:06.990 --> 03:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
now and the goal of healthc care isn't
 
03:55:08.910 --> 03:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
lack of regret it's health and right now
 
03:55:11.750 --> 03:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing on social media is um
 
03:55:13.910 --> 03:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
media influenc who identifi as the
 
03:55:16.110 --> 03:55:16.120 align:start position:0%
opposite sex who are letting clinicians
 
03:55:17.830 --> 03:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
torture them to death without ever
 
03:55:20.469 --> 03:55:20.479 align:start position:0%
expressing regret these don't measure
 
03:55:23.389 --> 03:55:23.399 align:start position:0%
Health as far as asking for the data no
 
03:55:26.229 --> 03:55:26.239 align:start position:0%
one's been keeping it in 2009 when the
 
03:55:28.429 --> 03:55:28.439 align:start position:0%
gems clinic in Boston started this
 
03:55:29.870 --> 03:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
letting kids say I've got this gender
 
03:55:31.670 --> 03:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
identity and what's affirmed with
 
03:55:33.830 --> 03:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
puberty blockers and hormones right away
 
03:55:34.790 --> 03:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
they should have been enrolled in
 
03:55:37.030 --> 03:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
clinical studies they aren't Dartmouth H
 
03:55:39.070 --> 03:55:39.080 align:start position:0%
is a CL clinical Hospital why aren't
 
03:55:41.070 --> 03:55:41.080 align:start position:0%
they showing you their their data so we
 
03:55:44.389 --> 03:55:44.399 align:start position:0%
have absolutely nothing W path started
 
03:55:46.630 --> 03:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
regulates this or sets the standards
 
03:55:49.630 --> 03:55:49.640 align:start position:0%
started um a a systematic study they
 
03:55:51.229 --> 03:55:51.239 align:start position:0%
didn't like the results so they told
 
03:55:53.469 --> 03:55:53.479 align:start position:0%
John Hopkins who's conducting it don't
 
03:55:56.469 --> 03:55:56.479 align:start position:0%
release these results at all more
 
03:55:59.429 --> 03:55:59.439 align:start position:0%
recently uh researcher Olson Kennedy
 
03:56:01.510 --> 03:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
took 10 million bucks from the federal
 
03:56:03.630 --> 03:56:03.640 align:start position:0%
government and then after she looked at
 
03:56:06.870 --> 03:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
her her results deci decided they would
 
03:56:09.229 --> 03:56:09.239 align:start position:0%
be weaponized in situations like this
 
03:56:11.189 --> 03:56:11.199 align:start position:0%
and refuse to release them so what we
 
03:56:12.910 --> 03:56:12.920 align:start position:0%
have are the European studies not only
 
03:56:15.550 --> 03:56:15.560 align:start position:0%
the cast review but but also from
 
03:56:18.189 --> 03:56:18.199 align:start position:0%
Finland and swen Sweden and we know the
 
03:56:20.429 --> 03:56:20.439 align:start position:0%
drill if it doesn't support this
 
03:56:22.550 --> 03:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
ideology then of course someone put some
 
03:56:24.469 --> 03:56:24.479 align:start position:0%
something on paper saying they're
 
03:56:26.870 --> 03:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
immediate they're discredited the
 
03:56:29.469 --> 03:56:29.479 align:start position:0%
suicide stats people quote by the way
 
03:56:32.469 --> 03:56:32.479 align:start position:0%
are meaningless suicide ideation so you
 
03:56:33.670 --> 03:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
have 15
 
03:56:36.990 --> 03:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
seconds is suicide ideation is very
 
03:56:41.189 --> 03:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
common among teens 30% of all girl high
 
03:56:43.149 --> 03:56:43.159 align:start position:0%
school girls seriously contemplated
 
03:56:45.110 --> 03:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
suicide in the last
 
03:56:48.510 --> 03:56:48.520 align:start position:0%
year so thank you thank you any
 
03:56:50.469 --> 03:56:50.479 align:start position:0%
questions representative CLE R thank you
 
03:56:52.389 --> 03:56:52.399 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I have a question I'm reading
 
03:56:54.389 --> 03:56:54.399 align:start position:0%
testimony of a previous uh person that
 
03:56:57.590 --> 03:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
spoke and it says in 2024 46% of all
 
03:56:59.429 --> 03:56:59.439 align:start position:0%
transgender and non-binary youth
 
03:57:02.469 --> 03:57:02.479 align:start position:0%
seriously considered attempting suicide
 
03:57:04.389 --> 03:57:04.399 align:start position:0%
um as you said the statistics are not
 
03:57:07.389 --> 03:57:07.399 align:start position:0%
really uh taken well or not given
 
03:57:09.030 --> 03:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
information they don't really cite the
 
03:57:11.030 --> 03:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
statistics here so what would you say
 
03:57:13.510 --> 03:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
about that my guess is that's the Trevor
 
03:57:15.590 --> 03:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
Project sta St istics the Trevor Project
 
03:57:19.630 --> 03:57:19.640 align:start position:0%
is a and like the transgender survey
 
03:57:21.910 --> 03:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
they solicit these online through social
 
03:57:24.870 --> 03:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
media from young people and we what we
 
03:57:26.990 --> 03:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
have for all high school students is the
 
03:57:30.590 --> 03:57:30.600 align:start position:0%
cdc's youth risk survey and what what
 
03:57:33.750 --> 03:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
that tells us is
 
03:57:38.870 --> 03:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
that about 30% as I said of all teens of
 
03:57:41.510 --> 03:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
all high school R seriously contemplate
 
03:57:45.510 --> 03:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
suicide 12% of all high school girls
 
03:57:47.550 --> 03:57:47.560 align:start position:0%
will will report they attempted suicide
 
03:57:50.189 --> 03:57:50.199 align:start position:0%
in the previous years the good news year
 
03:57:51.389 --> 03:57:51.399 align:start position:0%
the good news is if you look at the
 
03:57:55.990 --> 03:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
cdc's suicide completion rate is only
 
03:57:58.229 --> 03:57:58.239 align:start position:0%
0.14% people that have actually studied
 
03:58:00.429 --> 03:58:00.439 align:start position:0%
the suicide rate for transgender youth
 
03:58:03.070 --> 03:58:03.080 align:start position:0%
find it again to be extremely rare and
 
03:58:05.269 --> 03:58:05.279 align:start position:0%
someone mentioned uh people at Taven
 
03:58:07.229 --> 03:58:07.239 align:start position:0%
stock dying while they were waiting for
 
03:58:09.389 --> 03:58:09.399 align:start position:0%
care people studied the youth at the
 
03:58:11.349 --> 03:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
tavestock whether they're waiting or not
 
03:58:14.110 --> 03:58:14.120 align:start position:0%
out of 15,000 people four people died
 
03:58:16.910 --> 03:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
died of suicide and what they concluded
 
03:58:18.550 --> 03:58:18.560 align:start position:0%
is that people are dying of suicide not
 
03:58:21.349 --> 03:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
because they're transgender but because
 
03:58:24.990 --> 03:58:25.000 align:start position:0%
of the coexisting um conditions that
 
03:58:26.550 --> 03:58:26.560 align:start position:0%
lead to their confusion about their
 
03:58:30.030 --> 03:58:30.040 align:start position:0%
gender especially autism and
 
03:58:32.510 --> 03:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
PTSD other
 
03:58:39.710 --> 03:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:42.349 --> 03:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Chris
 
03:58:44.750 --> 03:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
Urkel from
 
03:59:02.710 --> 03:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:05.110 --> 03:59:05.120 align:start position:0%
or thank you chairman members of the
 
03:59:07.309 --> 03:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Chris urell I'm a
 
03:59:10.550 --> 03:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire licens attorney I have u a
 
03:59:13.590 --> 03:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
lot of experience litigating um about
 
03:59:15.469 --> 03:59:15.479 align:start position:0%
barriers to access to health care for
 
03:59:17.110 --> 03:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
transgender people I was on the
 
03:59:18.710 --> 03:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
litigation team that challenged
 
03:59:21.790 --> 03:59:21.800 align:start position:0%
Florida's ban on um medical care for
 
03:59:23.710 --> 03:59:23.720 align:start position:0%
transgender adolescence and I'm here on
 
03:59:25.750 --> 03:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
behalf of glbtq legal Advocates and
 
03:59:29.110 --> 03:59:29.120 align:start position:0%
Defenders also known as glad law um
 
03:59:30.950 --> 03:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
denying people access to Medical Care
 
03:59:33.229 --> 03:59:33.239 align:start position:0%
that they need is unconscionable but
 
03:59:35.550 --> 03:59:35.560 align:start position:0%
it's also unconstitutional and I'm just
 
03:59:37.990 --> 03:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
going to tell you three reasons why the
 
03:59:39.950 --> 03:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
bill that you're considering today is
 
03:59:42.309 --> 03:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional number one it singles
 
03:59:44.590 --> 03:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
out transgender people for different
 
03:59:48.030 --> 03:59:48.040 align:start position:0%
treatment number two it deprives parents
 
03:59:49.630 --> 03:59:49.640 align:start position:0%
of their fundamental right to consult
 
03:59:51.550 --> 03:59:51.560 align:start position:0%
with medical experts and make decisions
 
03:59:54.030 --> 03:59:54.040 align:start position:0%
about their children's healthare number
 
03:59:57.030 --> 03:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
three it targets the speech of not only
 
03:59:59.269 --> 03:59:59.279 align:start position:0%
Health Care Providers but everyone else
 
04:00:01.510 --> 04:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
by criminalizing the mere suggestion
 
04:00:03.910 --> 04:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
that an adolescent with gender dysphoria
 
04:00:05.269 --> 04:00:05.279 align:start position:0%
might need medical
 
04:00:07.389 --> 04:00:07.399 align:start position:0%
treatment as you probably know the
 
04:00:09.510 --> 04:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court is currently considering a
 
04:00:12.149 --> 04:00:12.159 align:start position:0%
constitutional challenge to Tennessee's
 
04:00:14.830 --> 04:00:14.840 align:start position:0%
ban on medical care for transgender
 
04:00:17.309 --> 04:00:17.319 align:start position:0%
adolescence and I'll admit that I don't
 
04:00:19.349 --> 04:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
know what the outcome of that case will
 
04:00:23.149 --> 04:00:23.159 align:start position:0%
be nobody does uh but we may not know is
 
04:00:25.590 --> 04:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
that this bill will be challenged
 
04:00:27.710 --> 04:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
regardless and it will be if and um
 
04:00:29.550 --> 04:00:29.560 align:start position:0%
depending on the outcome of that case uh
 
04:00:30.630 --> 04:00:30.640 align:start position:0%
in the Supreme Court it could be
 
04:00:35.149 --> 04:00:35.159 align:start position:0%
challenged on a different basis um it is
 
04:00:39.349 --> 04:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
never ever a legitimate or compelling uh
 
04:00:41.670 --> 04:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
government interest to stop people from
 
04:00:44.070 --> 04:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
living as a different sex and that's
 
04:00:46.030 --> 04:00:46.040 align:start position:0%
really what's motivating this bill to
 
04:00:47.630 --> 04:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
stop people from living as a different
 
04:00:49.670 --> 04:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
sex and how do I know that that's what's
 
04:00:51.510 --> 04:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
the Met what's the real motivation here
 
04:00:54.630 --> 04:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
it's because um there are other bills
 
04:00:56.389 --> 04:00:56.399 align:start position:0%
that could be introduced that would
 
04:00:58.429 --> 04:00:58.439 align:start position:0%
address some of the justifications that
 
04:01:00.269 --> 04:01:00.279 align:start position:0%
people are raising here including
 
04:01:02.870 --> 04:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
concerns about access to Quality Care
 
04:01:05.870 --> 04:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:08.349 --> 04:01:08.359 align:start position:0%
people for several decades the Supreme
 
04:01:10.389 --> 04:01:10.399 align:start position:0%
Court has been clear that discrimination
 
04:01:13.429 --> 04:01:13.439 align:start position:0%
on the basis of sex is anathema to our
 
04:01:13.439 --> 04:01:14.510 align:start position:0%
on the basis of sex is anathema to our
constitution

04:01:14.510 --> 04:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
04:01:17.349 --> 04:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
tion uh yet this legislation does
 
04:01:19.349 --> 04:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
exactly that the basis for denying
 
04:01:21.950 --> 04:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
medication to an individual under this
 
04:01:25.030 --> 04:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
bill is that individual's sex whether
 
04:01:27.030 --> 04:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
you define it based on their birth sex
 
04:01:30.030 --> 04:01:30.040 align:start position:0%
or based on the sex in which they live
 
04:01:32.389 --> 04:01:32.399 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court has also said that
 
04:01:34.349 --> 04:01:34.359 align:start position:0%
it's impossible to discriminate against
 
04:01:36.630 --> 04:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
a person for being transgender without
 
04:01:39.149 --> 04:01:39.159 align:start position:0%
also discriminating against them based
 
04:01:42.189 --> 04:01:42.199 align:start position:0%
on sex that is why this bill is a
 
04:01:44.870 --> 04:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
violation of every gender person's right
 
04:01:48.110 --> 04:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
to equal protection of the
 
04:01:52.269 --> 04:01:52.279 align:start position:0%
laws the parental rights um sorry the
 
04:01:53.870 --> 04:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
right to direct the upbringing of your
 
04:01:55.269 --> 04:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
children is enshrined in the 14th
 
04:01:57.349 --> 04:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment and has been uh is deeply
 
04:01:59.670 --> 04:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
rooted in this nation's uh
 
04:02:02.990 --> 04:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
constitutional history and this bill
 
04:02:04.670 --> 04:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
clearly takes away parents rights to
 
04:02:06.389 --> 04:02:06.399 align:start position:0%
make medical decisions on behalf of
 
04:02:10.030 --> 04:02:10.040 align:start position:0%
their children um and uh all right I'll
 
04:02:11.389 --> 04:02:11.399 align:start position:0%
just leave it at that and I'll let you
 
04:02:12.670 --> 04:02:12.680 align:start position:0%
know that I'm open to taking any
 
04:02:14.389 --> 04:02:14.399 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee might have
 
04:02:17.229 --> 04:02:17.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Weber and then
 
04:02:17.239 --> 04:02:19.149 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Weber and then
representative

04:02:19.149 --> 04:02:19.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:02:23.149 --> 04:02:23.159 align:start position:0%
Castle thank you so much um I'm
 
04:02:25.870 --> 04:02:25.880 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could elaborate a
 
04:02:29.189 --> 04:02:29.199 align:start position:0%
little bit more what are the um issues
 
04:02:33.229 --> 04:02:33.239 align:start position:0%
with speech both for um medical
 
04:02:35.990 --> 04:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
providers and others that you have
 
04:02:38.229 --> 04:02:38.239 align:start position:0%
concerns about yeah let's look directly
 
04:02:39.550 --> 04:02:39.560 align:start position:0%
at the thank you so much for the
 
04:02:41.269 --> 04:02:41.279 align:start position:0%
question uh representative let's look
 
04:02:43.189 --> 04:02:43.199 align:start position:0%
directly at the text of the bill where
 
04:02:46.830 --> 04:02:46.840 align:start position:0%
on line 17 of page one it says no person
 
04:02:48.910 --> 04:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
and of course person is defined as any
 
04:02:51.590 --> 04:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
individual above no person shall engage
 
04:02:55.990 --> 04:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
in counsel make a referral for or cause
 
04:02:57.510 --> 04:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
any of the following practices to be
 
04:02:59.870 --> 04:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
performed and then it goes on to list um
 
04:03:01.590 --> 04:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
you know prescription of uh puberty
 
04:03:04.870 --> 04:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
blocking medication or uh prescription
 
04:03:07.910 --> 04:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
of crossx hormones and so that is a
 
04:03:10.830 --> 04:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
pretty broad swath it encompasses uh I
 
04:03:13.070 --> 04:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
mean on its face the language says I
 
04:03:16.429 --> 04:03:16.439 align:start position:0%
mean the the words Council and uh make a
 
04:03:18.510 --> 04:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
referral for aren't defined but on its
 
04:03:21.229 --> 04:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
face it would appear that uh having a
 
04:03:23.710 --> 04:03:23.720 align:start position:0%
conversation with somebody who uh you
 
04:03:25.830 --> 04:03:25.840 align:start position:0%
think you know who any individual thinks
 
04:03:28.030 --> 04:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
might need access to Medical Care would
 
04:03:29.630 --> 04:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
violate the plain terms and it would be
 
04:03:29.640 --> 04:03:30.830 align:start position:0%
violate the plain terms and it would be
a

04:03:30.830 --> 04:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:03:30.840 --> 04:03:32.590 align:start position:0%
a
felony

04:03:32.590 --> 04:03:32.600 align:start position:0%
felony
 
04:03:36.750 --> 04:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
followup could that also um be construed
 
04:03:40.670 --> 04:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
to prohibit um somebody counseling for
 
04:03:45.750 --> 04:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
example um a parent to have a child um
 
04:03:47.149 --> 04:03:47.159 align:start position:0%
do social
 
04:03:50.469 --> 04:03:50.479 align:start position:0%
transitioning uh living in the clothing
 
04:03:52.870 --> 04:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
and under the names and pronouns of the
 
04:03:55.590 --> 04:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
other gender as opposed to something
 
04:03:59.309 --> 04:03:59.319 align:start position:0%
which is actual hormon hormonal
 
04:04:02.070 --> 04:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
changes well what I will say is that the
 
04:04:04.670 --> 04:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
language is is pretty vague and
 
04:04:06.229 --> 04:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
undefined right I mean we don't know
 
04:04:08.590 --> 04:04:08.600 align:start position:0%
what it means to engage in counsel or
 
04:04:11.590 --> 04:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
make a referral for uh medication that
 
04:04:13.830 --> 04:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
that that that uh could lead to to
 
04:04:16.670 --> 04:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
gender transition and and um and so I I
 
04:04:19.149 --> 04:04:19.159 align:start position:0%
would just say that the text is
 
04:04:21.349 --> 04:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
unclear representative
 
04:04:23.389 --> 04:04:23.399 align:start position:0%
Kastle thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:04:25.149 --> 04:04:25.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm hoping that you
 
04:04:26.830 --> 04:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
being a lawyer and dealing with this can
 
04:04:28.349 --> 04:04:28.359 align:start position:0%
answer a lot of my questions and I can
 
04:04:31.189 --> 04:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
stop asking so many of them um first you
 
04:04:33.790 --> 04:04:33.800 align:start position:0%
outlined uh here in this first paragraph
 
04:04:35.309 --> 04:04:35.319 align:start position:0%
but I want to bring you to uh paragraph
 
04:04:37.910 --> 04:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
28 where it breaks in it basically adds
 
04:04:40.429 --> 04:04:40.439 align:start position:0%
a provision so that certain uh people
 
04:04:42.070 --> 04:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
don't fall under this category or
 
04:04:44.630 --> 04:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
certain uh health conditions do not um
 
04:04:46.830 --> 04:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
would you say removing that uh or
 
04:04:49.070 --> 04:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
leaving that changes the bill in any way
 
04:04:52.229 --> 04:04:52.239 align:start position:0%
because you're you're citing issues of
 
04:04:55.309 --> 04:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
constitutional constitutionality well so
 
04:04:56.870 --> 04:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean that's a really good point
 
04:04:58.349 --> 04:04:58.359 align:start position:0%
right so you're you're you're making the
 
04:05:00.510 --> 04:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
point that there's an exception to
 
04:05:02.349 --> 04:05:02.359 align:start position:0%
prescribing this kind of medication if
 
04:05:04.469 --> 04:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
it's to treat a disorder of sex
 
04:05:07.149 --> 04:05:07.159 align:start position:0%
development and uh a disorder of sex
 
04:05:12.590 --> 04:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
development is defined in a um in a in a
 
04:05:15.389 --> 04:05:15.399 align:start position:0%
different you know subse of um the same
 
04:05:19.590 --> 04:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
chapter um in the rsas and I'm I think I
 
04:05:21.670 --> 04:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
have it here let me see if I can find it
 
04:05:23.870 --> 04:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
it's um happens to be in the bill text
 
04:05:25.349 --> 04:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
of a bill that's being considered this
 
04:05:29.149 --> 04:05:29.159 align:start position:0%
afternoon anyway um regardless yes it
 
04:05:30.830 --> 04:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
makes an exception for certain kinds of
 
04:05:33.950 --> 04:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
care so it shows that this bill is in
 
04:05:35.630 --> 04:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
fact targeting one class of people and
 
04:05:37.070 --> 04:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
that class of people is transgender
 
04:05:40.469 --> 04:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
people um and so the very fact that it
 
04:05:42.389 --> 04:05:42.399 align:start position:0%
carves out an exception for people who
 
04:05:45.110 --> 04:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
are not transgender um shows that yes
 
04:05:46.910 --> 04:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
this is in fact a discriminatory piece
 
04:05:49.550 --> 04:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
of legislation follow up follow up so I
 
04:05:51.110 --> 04:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
guess the legal question that I'd ask
 
04:05:53.149 --> 04:05:53.159 align:start position:0%
you um what would the legal
 
04:05:55.550 --> 04:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
clarification of what a gender
 
04:05:57.830 --> 04:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
is because that would be your your
 
04:05:59.349 --> 04:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
argument here is there a legal
 
04:06:02.070 --> 04:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
classification of what a gender is I I'm
 
04:06:03.269 --> 04:06:03.279 align:start position:0%
not sure that I understand the question
 
04:06:05.269 --> 04:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
repres is there a differentiation in the
 
04:06:08.269 --> 04:06:08.279 align:start position:0%
legal side for a gender versus male or
 
04:06:10.590 --> 04:06:10.600 align:start position:0%
female oh your question is is there a
 
04:06:12.550 --> 04:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
legal difference between the word sex
 
04:06:14.429 --> 04:06:14.439 align:start position:0%
and the word gender well just how it's
 
04:06:17.510 --> 04:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
clarified under law okay um legally the
 
04:06:19.510 --> 04:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
terms have historically been considered
 
04:06:21.830 --> 04:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
interchangeable in Court decisions and
 
04:06:24.389 --> 04:06:24.399 align:start position:0%
other and other places and um the way
 
04:06:25.950 --> 04:06:25.960 align:start position:0%
that they've been used in statutes has
 
04:06:27.990 --> 04:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
been inconsistent so there's not really
 
04:06:29.389 --> 04:06:29.399 align:start position:0%
a clear answer to the question of what
 
04:06:31.950 --> 04:06:31.960 align:start position:0%
the difference between gender and sex is
 
04:06:34.590 --> 04:06:34.600 align:start position:0%
okay one last question One Last Promise
 
04:06:36.910 --> 04:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
um okay so comparing this to the Florida
 
04:06:38.750 --> 04:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
law that you said you spoke against how
 
04:06:40.550 --> 04:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
is this what where current bill is
 
04:06:43.070 --> 04:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
differ from that um that's a really good
 
04:06:45.309 --> 04:06:45.319 align:start position:0%
question I mean a lot of a lot the
 
04:06:46.830 --> 04:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
differences are extensive right I mean
 
04:06:47.910 --> 04:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
we could talk about the differences
 
04:06:49.429 --> 04:06:49.439 align:start position:0%
between the plain text of the bills but
 
04:06:51.030 --> 04:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's really um
 
04:06:52.550 --> 04:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
significant because they block the same
 
04:06:54.750 --> 04:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
essential set of medications I mean one
 
04:06:56.830 --> 04:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
difference in the Florida bill is or
 
04:06:58.510 --> 04:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
sorry the Florida law is that it
 
04:07:00.590 --> 04:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
included a grandfather pres provision
 
04:07:02.990 --> 04:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
that allowed people to continue care uh
 
04:07:05.630 --> 04:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
this bill does not have such a provision
 
04:07:08.189 --> 04:07:08.199 align:start position:0%
um another issue with the legislation in
 
04:07:11.429 --> 04:07:11.439 align:start position:0%
Florida was that it um also impeded uh
 
04:07:13.590 --> 04:07:13.600 align:start position:0%
access to medical care for transgender
 
04:07:15.590 --> 04:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
adults in some respects which this bill
 
04:07:18.630 --> 04:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
does not um but you know the there are
 
04:07:20.790 --> 04:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
many other differences as well it's they
 
04:07:22.830 --> 04:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
just to be the legislative history
 
04:07:24.309 --> 04:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
behind the two bills is completely
 
04:07:27.950 --> 04:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
different and um you know so so so it's
 
04:07:30.550 --> 04:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
comparable in that it's also a legis a
 
04:07:31.990 --> 04:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation that singles out a
 
04:07:33.469 --> 04:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
class of people to deny them access to
 
04:07:34.910 --> 04:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
Medical Care that they need solely
 
04:07:36.910 --> 04:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
because of a characteristic that's
 
04:07:38.510 --> 04:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
protected under the
 
04:07:40.870 --> 04:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution other questions
 
04:07:41.910 --> 04:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
representative Weber and then
 
04:07:43.950 --> 04:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
representative delus
 
04:07:45.590 --> 04:07:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking another
 
04:07:47.389 --> 04:07:47.399 align:start position:0%
question from me that's arrives out of
 
04:07:50.950 --> 04:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
your answer to um an earlier one so um
 
04:07:54.710 --> 04:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
online 28 and 29 it says paragraph one
 
04:07:56.309 --> 04:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
of the section shall not apply to a
 
04:07:58.590 --> 04:07:58.600 align:start position:0%
procedure undertaken to treat a minor
 
04:08:01.109 --> 04:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
born with a medically verifiable
 
04:08:04.189 --> 04:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
disorder of sex development as defined
 
04:08:08.990 --> 04:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
in RSA 332 M2 comma colon
 
04:08:12.910 --> 04:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
to so am I right in thinking that if
 
04:08:17.429 --> 04:08:17.439 align:start position:0%
that ction does not manage to completely
 
04:08:20.189 --> 04:08:20.199 align:start position:0%
capture every
 
04:08:24.389 --> 04:08:24.399 align:start position:0%
possible um verifiable disorder of sex
 
04:08:27.109 --> 04:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
development that the people who don't
 
04:08:29.630 --> 04:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
fall under that definition would also be
 
04:08:31.630 --> 04:08:31.640 align:start position:0%
forbidden treatment even though they
 
04:08:34.269 --> 04:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
have a verifiable disorder thank you for
 
04:08:35.349 --> 04:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
the question for sure I would be
 
04:08:36.870 --> 04:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
concerned about access to care for
 
04:08:39.790 --> 04:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
people who have uh who have uh disorders
 
04:08:41.229 --> 04:08:41.239 align:start position:0%
of sexual development that aren't
 
04:08:43.510 --> 04:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
enumerated in the other um statute this
 
04:08:45.710 --> 04:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
referenced in here thank
 
04:08:50.469 --> 04:08:50.479 align:start position:0%
you I'll set uh one more if if you know
 
04:08:52.429 --> 04:08:52.439 align:start position:0%
because this may not be your Bailey Wick
 
04:08:54.870 --> 04:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
um do you have any indication from other
 
04:08:58.389 --> 04:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions that have proposed bans
 
04:08:58.399 --> 04:08:59.590 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions that have proposed bans
that

04:08:59.590 --> 04:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:09:04.109 --> 04:09:04.119 align:start position:0%
um um pediatric endocrinologists are not
 
04:09:06.630 --> 04:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily as willing to practice there
 
04:09:08.950 --> 04:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
is there any kind of information on that
 
04:09:11.790 --> 04:09:11.800 align:start position:0%
if there isn't that's fine um I will
 
04:09:13.910 --> 04:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
just I'll answer that by explaining that
 
04:09:16.149 --> 04:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
many pediatric endocrinologists have had
 
04:09:18.710 --> 04:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
to close their practices and leave
 
04:09:20.189 --> 04:09:20.199 align:start position:0%
states where they were previously
 
04:09:22.790 --> 04:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
providing care because uh because of
 
04:09:25.109 --> 04:09:25.119 align:start position:0%
laws that prohibit them from from um
 
04:09:26.790 --> 04:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
from from prescribing medication to
 
04:09:26.800 --> 04:09:28.469 align:start position:0%
from from prescribing medication to
transgender

04:09:28.469 --> 04:09:28.479 align:start position:0%
transgender
 
04:09:31.109 --> 04:09:31.119 align:start position:0%
adolescence representative
 
04:09:36.349 --> 04:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
damus thank you Mr chairman um as I read
 
04:09:39.710 --> 04:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
this intended uh uh new chapter
 
04:09:41.590 --> 04:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
prohibiting medical procedures and
 
04:09:43.389 --> 04:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
treatments intended to alter a mind
 
04:09:45.349 --> 04:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
minor gender and you had said that it
 
04:09:48.309 --> 04:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
was all about sex
 
04:09:51.590 --> 04:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
I'm just just thinking that you're sex
 
04:09:54.790 --> 04:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
meaning male female whatever but isn't
 
04:09:57.670 --> 04:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
it really more about age this bill this
 
04:09:59.950 --> 04:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
bill is I believe isn't it supposed to
 
04:10:02.990 --> 04:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
be addressing age thank you for the
 
04:10:06.990 --> 04:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
question representative um I'll just REM
 
04:10:09.229 --> 04:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
um bring up a a Supreme Court case from
 
04:10:11.030 --> 04:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
the 1950s Brown versus Board of
 
04:10:13.510 --> 04:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
Education which was about segregation of
 
04:10:15.950 --> 04:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
school children based on race and of
 
04:10:17.389 --> 04:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
course the people who are being
 
04:10:19.790 --> 04:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
segregated were all children yet the
 
04:10:21.790 --> 04:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court looked at their race as
 
04:10:23.710 --> 04:10:23.720 align:start position:0%
the cause for the Discrimination in this
 
04:10:26.510 --> 04:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
case it is the sex of the children that
 
04:10:28.269 --> 04:10:28.279 align:start position:0%
is the cause for the Constitutional
 
04:10:30.990 --> 04:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
infirmity that I'm um talking about here
 
04:10:35.790 --> 04:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
today thank you any other
 
04:10:39.149 --> 04:10:39.159 align:start position:0%
questions okay all right I'm seeing none
 
04:10:44.630 --> 04:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:47.750 --> 04:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you to the committee thank you

04:10:56.109 --> 04:10:56.119 align:start position:0%

04:11:11.309 --> 04:11:11.319 align:start position:0%
so to the members of the committee my
 
04:11:13.389 --> 04:11:13.399 align:start position:0%
name is McKenzie West and I and I am I'm
 
04:11:16.590 --> 04:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
here to testify an opposition against HP
 
04:11:19.429 --> 04:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
377 ignoring the simple and reductive
 
04:11:21.590 --> 04:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
definition of Sex and the rudimentary
 
04:11:23.349 --> 04:11:23.359 align:start position:0%
understanding of biology that is put
 
04:11:25.229 --> 04:11:25.239 align:start position:0%
forth in this bill to make the
 
04:11:27.710 --> 04:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
definition that it does and ignoring the
 
04:11:29.630 --> 04:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
fact that medical consensus is
 
04:11:31.830 --> 04:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly in support of gender
 
04:11:34.189 --> 04:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
affirming care for minors from the
 
04:11:37.269 --> 04:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
American Psychological Association to
 
04:11:39.670 --> 04:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
the American Academy of Pediatrics and
 
04:11:41.750 --> 04:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
the world professional association for
 
04:11:44.710 --> 04:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
transgender health
 
04:11:46.309 --> 04:11:46.319 align:start position:0%
we know that treatment is safe and
 
04:11:48.109 --> 04:11:48.119 align:start position:0%
effective in lowering rates of suicide
 
04:11:50.189 --> 04:11:50.199 align:start position:0%
and depression while providing better
 
04:11:52.910 --> 04:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
outcomes for Trans youth but what
 
04:11:54.510 --> 04:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
message does this send to the people of
 
04:11:56.950 --> 04:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and Beyond it tells
 
04:11:58.870 --> 04:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
families that they are not welcome here
 
04:12:00.910 --> 04:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
that ch's children will not be able to
 
04:12:03.189 --> 04:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
find care in this state and that famili
 
04:12:05.670 --> 04:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
is looking to flee these laws elsewhere
 
04:12:07.830 --> 04:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
in this country that they should keep
 
04:12:10.510 --> 04:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
looking because this is not a state for
 
04:12:13.189 --> 04:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
them I was recently doubting my future
 
04:12:14.710 --> 04:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
as a transom in the state when
 
04:12:17.630 --> 04:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
testifying against HP 148 and as the
 
04:12:19.630 --> 04:12:19.640 align:start position:0%
daughter of a trans woman when I think
 
04:12:21.870 --> 04:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
about starting a family of my own bills
 
04:12:25.389 --> 04:12:25.399 align:start position:0%
like HB 377 further my doubt that this
 
04:12:28.389 --> 04:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
state is worth staying in if I am to
 
04:12:30.830 --> 04:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
have children and start a family what
 
04:12:33.550 --> 04:12:33.560 align:start position:0%
would I tell them that you can be any
 
04:12:35.469 --> 04:12:35.479 align:start position:0%
that you can be who you are and you can
 
04:12:38.149 --> 04:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
be anything just maybe not
 
04:12:40.870 --> 04:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
here it leaves me sad and seeing how the
 
04:12:44.349 --> 04:12:44.359 align:start position:0%
state I've long wanted to call home may
 
04:12:45.990 --> 04:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
be closing the door to Bright Futures
 
04:12:48.389 --> 04:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
for already for already marginalized
 
04:12:50.429 --> 04:12:50.439 align:start position:0%
people like me and the families that
 
04:12:52.309 --> 04:12:52.319 align:start position:0%
thrive with resilience and hope through
 
04:12:54.750 --> 04:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
the attacks of the State live for a die
 
04:12:57.750 --> 04:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
is the motto of the state but now is
 
04:12:59.870 --> 04:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
this not increasingly an illusion when
 
04:13:01.469 --> 04:13:01.479 align:start position:0%
we put the state in decisions that
 
04:13:04.269 --> 04:13:04.279 align:start position:0%
should be between F between families and
 
04:13:06.790 --> 04:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
medical professionals dedicated to doing
 
04:13:08.429 --> 04:13:08.439 align:start position:0%
the right
 
04:13:13.710 --> 04:13:13.720 align:start position:0%
thing thank you any questions no good
 
04:13:17.590 --> 04:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:30.030 --> 04:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:32.189 --> 04:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
pounds you've written four minutes I
 
04:13:34.550 --> 04:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
would remind you please keep it to
 
04:13:38.030 --> 04:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
three yeah thank you thank you Mr chair
 
04:13:40.309 --> 04:13:40.319 align:start position:0%
and thank you committee
 
04:13:44.550 --> 04:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
um appreciate being able to do this
 
04:13:46.950 --> 04:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
first I'm going to be candid I think
 
04:13:51.269 --> 04:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
um surgery and hormones to people
 
04:13:54.910 --> 04:13:54.920 align:start position:0%
minors um is child abuse in my
 
04:13:54.920 --> 04:13:57.790 align:start position:0%
minors um is child abuse in my
opinion

04:13:57.790 --> 04:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
04:14:01.910 --> 04:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
um I have a friend who has lifelong
 
04:14:05.469 --> 04:14:05.479 align:start position:0%
damage from hormone treatment he had
 
04:14:07.630 --> 04:14:07.640 align:start position:0%
surgery and hormone treatments he had s
 
04:14:10.590 --> 04:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
suffered childhood trauma that led him
 
04:14:11.830 --> 04:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
down this
 
04:14:14.510 --> 04:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
path um
 
04:14:17.070 --> 04:14:17.080 align:start position:0%
when he got correct psychological
 
04:14:19.429 --> 04:14:19.439 align:start position:0%
counseling the gender issues just just
 
04:14:19.439 --> 04:14:20.710 align:start position:0%
counseling the gender issues just just
fell

04:14:20.710 --> 04:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
fell
 
04:14:25.349 --> 04:14:25.359 align:start position:0%
away um now he tried to commit suicide
 
04:14:28.109 --> 04:14:28.119 align:start position:0%
twice he he he he got jokes about it he
 
04:14:29.469 --> 04:14:29.479 align:start position:0%
said you know I almost succeeded the
 
04:14:31.870 --> 04:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
second time like he was proud of it and
 
04:14:35.389 --> 04:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
he was uh told me that it wasn't because
 
04:14:37.070 --> 04:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
of the issues the transgender issues
 
04:14:38.990 --> 04:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's that it didn't you know
 
04:14:41.030 --> 04:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
going down the path didn't solve the
 
04:14:43.309 --> 04:14:43.319 align:start position:0%
trauma and once and it was the
 
04:14:45.070 --> 04:14:45.080 align:start position:0%
underlying conditions that let him down
 
04:14:47.309 --> 04:14:47.319 align:start position:0%
there and that's what L
 
04:14:50.389 --> 04:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
him um he you know he he's cried on my
 
04:14:52.349 --> 04:14:52.359 align:start position:0%
shoulder as a result of you know
 
04:14:55.030 --> 04:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
realizing now that after going through
 
04:14:57.990 --> 04:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
surgery it cannot be undone and then
 
04:15:00.630 --> 04:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
hormones it's well understood that
 
04:15:02.790 --> 04:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
depending on how long and how many and
 
04:15:07.630 --> 04:15:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:12.670 --> 04:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
damage um also um I've heard the story
 
04:15:13.469 --> 04:15:13.479 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:15:18.429 --> 04:15:18.439 align:start position:0%
know um parents are told that if you
 
04:15:20.109 --> 04:15:20.119 align:start position:0%
don't allow your child to go down that
 
04:15:23.309 --> 04:15:23.319 align:start position:0%
path they'll commit suicide it's uh they
 
04:15:26.389 --> 04:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
say psychologists are trained to say
 
04:15:28.429 --> 04:15:28.439 align:start position:0%
would you rather have let's say a uh a
 
04:15:31.590 --> 04:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
dead son or a live daughter and my wife
 
04:15:33.950 --> 04:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
and I have experienced that
 
04:15:37.950 --> 04:15:37.960 align:start position:0%
firsthand um also I'd like to note it's
 
04:15:41.349 --> 04:15:41.359 align:start position:0%
well established from Dr Ken Zucker that
 
04:15:44.229 --> 04:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
90% of Youth out of their gender
 
04:15:47.269 --> 04:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
dysphoria if they're just left alone so
 
04:15:48.910 --> 04:15:48.920 align:start position:0%
that's a pretty significant number and I
 
04:15:50.349 --> 04:15:50.359 align:start position:0%
think if they're allowed
 
04:15:53.990 --> 04:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
to um or push towards the transition it
 
04:15:57.269 --> 04:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
can do irreparable harm um when they
 
04:16:01.309 --> 04:16:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:04.070 --> 04:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
it um there's a high-profile
 
04:16:07.950 --> 04:16:07.960 align:start position:0%
psychologist Dr Keith ablo um I've
 
04:16:12.950 --> 04:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
talked to and um often times when people
 
04:16:15.550 --> 04:16:15.560 align:start position:0%
are given the cross sex hormones it
 
04:16:17.830 --> 04:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
brings them out of depression and I
 
04:16:20.469 --> 04:16:20.479 align:start position:0%
think that falsely leads them to
 
04:16:22.670 --> 04:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
believe that they actually may be the
 
04:16:24.830 --> 04:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
opposite sex and he said that's because
 
04:16:26.990 --> 04:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
they're a steroid and those will do that
 
04:16:29.990 --> 04:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
and it's only a temporary effect and he
 
04:16:32.429 --> 04:16:32.439 align:start position:0%
said he he he he was kind of candid he
 
04:16:34.550 --> 04:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
said I can do the same thing with
 
04:16:38.870 --> 04:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
cocaine so um you have 15 seconds please
 
04:16:40.710 --> 04:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
wrap up yeah thank you well I'm just
 
04:16:42.950 --> 04:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
wrapping it up so um anyways these are
 
04:16:44.790 --> 04:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
these are some of the things dealt with
 
04:16:46.389 --> 04:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
personally and from what I understand
 
04:16:48.670 --> 04:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
from um a medical
 
04:16:51.309 --> 04:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
perspective um and so I'm I'm in favor
 
04:16:53.389 --> 04:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
of passing this bill to protect our
 
04:16:57.349 --> 04:16:57.359 align:start position:0%

School and a lifelong resident of New
 
04:18:17.070 --> 04:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire like every other teenager I
 
04:18:18.469 --> 04:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
worry about school grades and what my
 
04:18:20.349 --> 04:18:20.359 align:start position:0%
future will look like after graduation I
 
04:18:21.910 --> 04:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
work I spend time with my friends and I
 
04:18:23.429 --> 04:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
try to navigate the ups and downs of
 
04:18:25.710 --> 04:18:25.720 align:start position:0%
being a teenager in almost every way I'm
 
04:18:27.790 --> 04:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
just normal kid except for one thing I'm
 
04:18:29.830 --> 04:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
transgender I've always known that I was
 
04:18:31.229 --> 04:18:31.239 align:start position:0%
different my family has always supported
 
04:18:33.349 --> 04:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
me no matter what As I Grew Older I
 
04:18:35.109 --> 04:18:35.119 align:start position:0%
realized the truth I'm transgender and
 
04:18:38.109 --> 04:18:38.119 align:start position:0%
that's okay I can live a full productive
 
04:18:41.070 --> 04:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
and happy life exactly as I am just like
 
04:18:43.389 --> 04:18:43.399 align:start position:0%
any other person but I can only do that
 
04:18:45.590 --> 04:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
if I if I have access to the med
 
04:18:47.349 --> 04:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
medically necessary care that allows me
 
04:18:51.710 --> 04:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
to be myself I believe that much of the
 
04:18:53.229 --> 04:18:53.239 align:start position:0%
fear and misinformation surrounding
 
04:18:54.510 --> 04:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
transgender people especially
 
04:18:56.469 --> 04:18:56.479 align:start position:0%
transgender youth comes from the lack of
 
04:18:58.469 --> 04:18:58.479 align:start position:0%
understanding I would bet that many
 
04:19:01.670 --> 04:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
people of of many of the people writing
 
04:19:03.990 --> 04:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
bills like HB 377 have never met or
 
04:19:06.189 --> 04:19:06.199 align:start position:0%
spoken with a transgender person so let
 
04:19:08.109 --> 04:19:08.119 align:start position:0%
me say this clearly there is nothing
 
04:19:09.950 --> 04:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
wrong with me I am not a danger to
 
04:19:11.710 --> 04:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
anyone I just want to live my life in
 
04:19:13.030 --> 04:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
peace like every other person person in
 
04:19:16.229 --> 04:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
this room I'm here to ask you today why
 
04:19:18.349 --> 04:19:18.359 align:start position:0%
am I not worthy of the same Medical Care
 
04:19:19.670 --> 04:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
as any other
 
04:19:21.990 --> 04:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
teenager my family supports me my
 
04:19:23.950 --> 04:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
friends support me my doctors coaches
 
04:19:25.990 --> 04:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
and therapists all support me so why
 
04:19:28.229 --> 04:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
can't my government do the same why am I
 
04:19:30.469 --> 04:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
being singled out every other teenager
 
04:19:32.189 --> 04:19:32.199 align:start position:0%
in this state is trusted to make Med
 
04:19:33.670 --> 04:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
medical decisions with their parents and
 
04:19:35.510 --> 04:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
doctors why am I treat treated
 
04:19:37.149 --> 04:19:37.159 align:start position:0%
differently why don't I deserve the same
 
04:19:38.229 --> 04:19:38.239 align:start position:0%
level of
 
04:19:40.550 --> 04:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
respect can you look me in the eye and
 
04:19:41.990 --> 04:19:42.000 align:start position:0%

rights this same medical Freedom the
 
04:19:46.030 --> 04:19:46.040 align:start position:0%

effects of what could happen by taking
 
04:20:20.189 --> 04:20:20.199 align:start position:0%
those just before the even thought of
 
04:20:22.389 --> 04:20:22.399 align:start position:0%
taking any kind of hormones I had to go
 
04:20:24.910 --> 04:20:24.920 align:start position:0%
through years of therapy I they told me
 
04:20:27.030 --> 04:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
every symptom multiple times many times
 
04:20:29.309 --> 04:20:29.319 align:start position:0%
time again after every single cons
 
04:20:32.429 --> 04:20:32.439 align:start position:0%
consultation they told me that there if
 
04:20:34.030 --> 04:20:34.040 align:start position:0%
I would didn't want certain effects to
 
04:20:35.469 --> 04:20:35.479 align:start position:0%
happen there were ways that they could
 
04:20:36.910 --> 04:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
prevent that and different things I
 
04:20:40.349 --> 04:20:40.359 align:start position:0%
could do to purer uh pursue my right to

effects you'd tell me I'm just curious

it for myself um I don't think I could
 
04:20:54.510 --> 04:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
think of any side effects that I'm
 
04:20:56.309 --> 04:20:56.319 align:start position:0%

good
 
04:21:24.750 --> 04:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you for having me here
 
04:21:28.389 --> 04:21:28.399 align:start position:0%
my name is Corey con at the age of 15 I
 
04:21:31.910 --> 04:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
was diagnosed with what today would have
 
04:21:34.309 --> 04:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
would be called gender dysphoria or in a
 
04:21:36.550 --> 04:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
previous generation gender identity
 
04:21:41.070 --> 04:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
disorder at age 18 I undertook estrogen
 
04:21:42.870 --> 04:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
hormone replacement therapy and at the
 
04:21:46.229 --> 04:21:46.239 align:start position:0%
age of 19 I had what is Cally known as
 
04:21:48.269 --> 04:21:48.279 align:start position:0%
sex reassignment
 
04:21:51.870 --> 04:21:51.880 align:start position:0%
surgery as a result of these treatments
 
04:21:54.429 --> 04:21:54.439 align:start position:0%
uh particularly the surgery I was I've
 
04:21:59.189 --> 04:21:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:02.429 --> 04:22:02.439 align:start position:0%
functional and uh nevertheless
 
04:22:04.630 --> 04:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
immediately after commencing these
 
04:22:08.149 --> 04:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
treatments I went from being a lonely
 
04:22:12.229 --> 04:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
isolated boy to a much more confident
 
04:22:17.349 --> 04:22:17.359 align:start position:0%
and outgoing woman or so I thought so
 
04:22:20.189 --> 04:22:20.199 align:start position:0%
over the course of the years one of the
 
04:22:23.750 --> 04:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
things that I realized is that it's
 
04:22:25.670 --> 04:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
impossible to change
 
04:22:28.590 --> 04:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
sex and unless we understand that as a
 
04:22:31.229 --> 04:22:31.239 align:start position:0%
fundamental truth that your sex is
 
04:22:34.910 --> 04:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
innate and immutable and that the only
 
04:22:37.910 --> 04:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
thing that these treatments can do is
 
04:22:42.710 --> 04:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
change your sex characteristics
 
04:22:46.870 --> 04:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
then we can't even create uh rational
 
04:22:48.910 --> 04:22:48.920 align:start position:0%
policy and that's part of what you are
 
04:22:50.990 --> 04:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
here to
 
04:22:54.149 --> 04:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
do before I gave my testimony I engaged
 
04:22:56.389 --> 04:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
with some of the people who have come
 
04:22:57.870 --> 04:22:57.880 align:start position:0%
here with different
 
04:23:00.870 --> 04:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
opinions and uh many of them had never
 
04:23:03.710 --> 04:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
even heard of wpath which is the
 
04:23:05.630 --> 04:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
organization which sets the guidelines
 
04:23:08.229 --> 04:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
for this but I wanted to address
 
04:23:10.109 --> 04:23:10.119 align:start position:0%
something very important because the
 
04:23:12.950 --> 04:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
term medical necessity has been
 
04:23:15.830 --> 04:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
spoken about again and again in this
 
04:23:20.389 --> 04:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
committee I'm in I am a witness in the
 
04:23:23.389 --> 04:23:23.399 align:start position:0%
Alabama lawsuit which surfaced some of
 
04:23:25.349 --> 04:23:25.359 align:start position:0%
the internal Communications from
 
04:23:28.990 --> 04:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
wpath among those Communications is a
 
04:23:32.070 --> 04:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
discussion that medical necessity is
 
04:23:35.510 --> 04:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
only for insurance companies to have the
 
04:23:38.030 --> 04:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
justification to cover these procedures
 
04:23:40.750 --> 04:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
under their policies there is no
 
04:23:44.149 --> 04:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
evidence of medical necessity I also
 
04:23:47.309 --> 04:23:47.319 align:start position:0%
want to point out a log logical fallacy
 
04:23:49.670 --> 04:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
that I've heard a number of times which
 
04:23:53.269 --> 04:23:53.279 align:start position:0%
is do we really need this regulation
 
04:23:57.510 --> 04:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
barring evidence that uh this is a
 
04:24:00.149 --> 04:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
harmful treatment this is not the
 
04:24:03.550 --> 04:24:03.560 align:start position:0%
standard for medical uh research the
 
04:24:05.750 --> 04:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
standard of medical research is are
 
04:24:07.469 --> 04:24:07.479 align:start position:0%
these treatments
 
04:24:10.630 --> 04:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
helpful I have heard a number of people
 
04:24:14.349 --> 04:24:14.359 align:start position:0%
from uh the other opinion come up and
 
04:24:16.590 --> 04:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
present to you outdated evidence and
 
04:24:18.990 --> 04:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
outdated talking points but every single
 
04:24:20.349 --> 04:24:20.359 align:start position:0%
day we are finding more and more
 
04:24:23.189 --> 04:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
evidence that these treatments are not
 
04:24:25.469 --> 04:24:25.479 align:start position:0%
beneficial you have 15 seconds left to
 
04:24:29.149 --> 04:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
the health or to the mental health and
 
04:24:31.630 --> 04:24:31.640 align:start position:0%
they are not they're not means to find
 
04:24:33.750 --> 04:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
out who we truly are the only way to do
 
04:24:35.510 --> 04:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
that is to live your life and experience
 
04:24:38.950 --> 04:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
the world thank you any
 
04:24:41.990 --> 04:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative castling thank
 
04:24:45.389 --> 04:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
you Mr share so it sounds like you speak
 
04:24:47.590 --> 04:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
with a little bit of regret could you
 
04:24:49.790 --> 04:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
maybe give us a little bit of your like
 
04:24:51.429 --> 04:24:51.439 align:start position:0%
history and where you got and if there's
 
04:24:54.550 --> 04:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
any regret you have uh thank you
 
04:24:56.229 --> 04:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
representative that's such an
 
04:24:58.389 --> 04:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
interesting word to you is
 
04:25:00.149 --> 04:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
Regret I
 
04:25:02.990 --> 04:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
have it is it's difficult for me to
 
04:25:05.790 --> 04:25:05.800 align:start position:0%
understand this as regret because it
 
04:25:08.469 --> 04:25:08.479 align:start position:0%
would be like if you were a child and
 
04:25:10.469 --> 04:25:10.479 align:start position:0%
you had accidentally knocked over a
 
04:25:12.750 --> 04:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
candle and burned down your house it
 
04:25:14.830 --> 04:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
would be difficult to experience that as
 
04:25:17.189 --> 04:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
regret even though a tragedy happened
 
04:25:19.389 --> 04:25:19.399 align:start position:0%
because of of something that involved
 
04:25:22.070 --> 04:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
your actions but there are so many for
 
04:25:25.149 --> 04:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
these children and and as was the case
 
04:25:28.710 --> 04:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
when I was 15 and and a teenager there
 
04:25:31.349 --> 04:25:31.359 align:start position:0%
are so many people adults in these
 
04:25:35.109 --> 04:25:35.119 align:start position:0%
children's lives who are providing
 
04:25:39.349 --> 04:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
affirmation but uh when all of this is
 
04:25:41.750 --> 04:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
happening to you even though you may be
 
04:25:45.710 --> 04:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
traumatized by it even though it may be
 
04:25:48.109 --> 04:25:48.119 align:start position:0%
confusing to sort out even though it may
 
04:25:50.510 --> 04:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
cause challenges that are unique to the
 
04:25:53.229 --> 04:25:53.239 align:start position:0%
situation it's difficult to understand
 
04:25:58.429 --> 04:25:58.439 align:start position:0%
something this large and uh mind-bending
 
04:26:01.109 --> 04:26:01.119 align:start position:0%
as as a form of regret so I regret
 
04:26:03.870 --> 04:26:03.880 align:start position:0%
offending friends um I regret attending
 
04:26:06.269 --> 04:26:06.279 align:start position:0%
law school for a year uh it's a lot
 
04:26:08.550 --> 04:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
harder for me to regret this because
 
04:26:11.109 --> 04:26:11.119 align:start position:0%
it's it's the enormity of it is is too
 
04:26:15.790 --> 04:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:19.349 --> 04:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
that um yes representative
 
04:26:23.349 --> 04:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
Drew thank you Mr chairman
 
04:26:26.309 --> 04:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
um how thoroughly did you understand the
 
04:26:28.349 --> 04:26:28.359 align:start position:0%
long-term medical impact you said you
 
04:26:30.830 --> 04:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
were diagnosed when you were 15 and at
 
04:26:33.630 --> 04:26:33.640 align:start position:0%
18 you undertook HRT did you understand
 
04:26:36.109 --> 04:26:36.119 align:start position:0%
then what you know now about the
 
04:26:39.189 --> 04:26:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:42.510 --> 04:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
through from my own experience and from
 
04:26:45.830 --> 04:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
listening to the other testimony today I
 
04:26:47.469 --> 04:26:47.479 align:start position:0%
can tell you I don't think very much has
 
04:26:50.590 --> 04:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
changed in the last 30 years as you get
 
04:26:54.149 --> 04:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
involved in these communities of
 
04:26:54.159 --> 04:26:55.309 align:start position:0%
involved in these communities of
affirming

04:26:55.309 --> 04:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
affirming
 
04:26:58.670 --> 04:26:58.680 align:start position:0%
individuals what you will hear 99% of
 
04:27:02.269 --> 04:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
the time are the benefits and what you
 
04:27:05.349 --> 04:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
hear about 1% of the time are the
 
04:27:09.189 --> 04:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
drawbacks or the damages and and in fact
 
04:27:11.030 --> 04:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
and I know that this is true today
 
04:27:13.109 --> 04:27:13.119 align:start position:0%
whenever there are people who Express
 
04:27:16.269 --> 04:27:16.279 align:start position:0%
regret or talk about the side effects
 
04:27:18.710 --> 04:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
that that are medically harmful to any
 
04:27:19.630 --> 04:27:19.640 align:start position:0%
of these
 
04:27:22.070 --> 04:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
treatments those individuals are told
 
04:27:24.070 --> 04:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
not to talk about their experiences
 
04:27:25.790 --> 04:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
because it causes anxiety to other
 
04:27:27.990 --> 04:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
people or they are told not to talk
 
04:27:29.590 --> 04:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
about it because it could threaten their
 
04:27:32.269 --> 04:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
ability to gain access to what they
 
04:27:35.429 --> 04:27:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:38.389 --> 04:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
Healthcare I did because although the
 
04:27:41.349 --> 04:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
information was presented to me it was
 
04:27:45.349 --> 04:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
not something that I was able to
 
04:27:48.349 --> 04:27:48.359 align:start position:0%
adequately develop informed consent to
 
04:27:53.870 --> 04:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
understand because I was in a a state
 
04:27:57.109 --> 04:27:57.119 align:start position:0%
of basically Obsession on my my target
 
04:28:01.910 --> 04:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
for transition so in my opinion medical
 
04:28:05.070 --> 04:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
providers have a higher Duty than to
 
04:28:08.510 --> 04:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
Simply present a form to patients or a
 
04:28:11.109 --> 04:28:11.119 align:start position:0%
packet I think one one person said that
 
04:28:13.389 --> 04:28:13.399 align:start position:0%
they received a a large packet of
 
04:28:15.389 --> 04:28:15.399 align:start position:0%
information I don't understand how
 
04:28:17.990 --> 04:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
anybody can take that packet and uh
 
04:28:20.590 --> 04:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
synthesize it and turn that into an
 
04:28:24.030 --> 04:28:24.040 align:start position:0%
input for their decision it's too much
 
04:28:26.990 --> 04:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
and in my opinion talking with other
 
04:28:28.309 --> 04:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
people who've been through these
 
04:28:31.950 --> 04:28:31.960 align:start position:0%
procedures doctors do not tend to
 
04:28:34.790 --> 04:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
develop to their own assurance and
 
04:28:36.070 --> 04:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
understanding that the patient that
 
04:28:38.309 --> 04:28:38.319 align:start position:0%
they're treating has received the
 
04:28:42.550 --> 04:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:44.950 --> 04:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
was that follow
 
04:28:49.910 --> 04:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
up okay um and during this process where
 
04:28:51.710 --> 04:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
were your parents or caregivers were
 
04:28:55.830 --> 04:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
they able to do that uh that is a great
 
04:28:58.630 --> 04:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
question although there are I've I've
 
04:29:00.469 --> 04:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
seen today there there are very
 
04:29:02.550 --> 04:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
passionate parents that are involved and
 
04:29:04.349 --> 04:29:04.359 align:start position:0%
I I think that there's some great
 
04:29:07.309 --> 04:29:07.319 align:start position:0%
upsides to that in my case my parents
 
04:29:10.349 --> 04:29:10.359 align:start position:0%
were not involved but in either case one
 
04:29:12.590 --> 04:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
of the things that was
 
04:29:16.389 --> 04:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
part of my experience learning more and
 
04:29:20.590 --> 04:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
more about being trans is to be
 
04:29:24.149 --> 04:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
inculcated with the idea that parents
 
04:29:27.309 --> 04:29:27.319 align:start position:0%
are going to try to stop you or
 
04:29:29.870 --> 04:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
interfere with your abilities to be able
 
04:29:34.030 --> 04:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
to access these types of care um I have
 
04:29:39.109 --> 04:29:39.119 align:start position:0%
I have seen from forums and uh talk
 
04:29:42.349 --> 04:29:42.359 align:start position:0%
channels uh like Discord where young
 
04:29:44.590 --> 04:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
people are coached on what to say to
 
04:29:46.670 --> 04:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
their parents I've heard stories of
 
04:29:49.349 --> 04:29:49.359 align:start position:0%
parents who receive notes that are
 
04:29:51.790 --> 04:29:51.800 align:start position:0%
coming out out notes that are basically
 
04:29:53.910 --> 04:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh matched to online templates that they
 
04:29:55.510 --> 04:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
can use
 
04:29:55.520 --> 04:29:57.070 align:start position:0%
can use
so

04:29:57.070 --> 04:29:57.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:30:00.630 --> 04:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
it's in some cases there may be uh
 
04:30:02.510 --> 04:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
enough clear communication between the
 
04:30:04.189 --> 04:30:04.199 align:start position:0%
parent and the child that the child
 
04:30:07.389 --> 04:30:07.399 align:start position:0%
knows what's happening my belief is that
 
04:30:09.990 --> 04:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
particularly the social aspects of this
 
04:30:12.030 --> 04:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
issue cause there to be a lot of
 
04:30:14.590 --> 04:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
Division and and lack of alignment
 
04:30:16.429 --> 04:30:16.439 align:start position:0%
between children who identify as trans
 
04:30:17.910 --> 04:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
and their
 
04:30:21.349 --> 04:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
parents any other questions seeing none
 
04:30:21.359 --> 04:30:22.510 align:start position:0%
parents any other questions seeing none
thank

04:30:22.510 --> 04:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:30:26.109 --> 04:30:26.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:29.149 --> 04:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
you is a Courtney Tanner come
 
04:30:32.510 --> 04:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
back or is she expect oh there she
 
04:30:35.750 --> 04:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
is that's okay they're working on that
 
04:30:39.070 --> 04:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
two places in one thing you perfect it
 
04:30:41.990 --> 04:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
let me know I'm working as a mom I I'm
 
04:30:45.030 --> 04:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
working on it it's getting better um so
 
04:30:46.269 --> 04:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
for the record Courtney Tanner I'm the
 
04:30:47.590 --> 04:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
senior director of government relations
 
04:30:50.070 --> 04:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
at Dartmouth health and
 
04:30:53.389 --> 04:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
um we oppose this bill um we have some
 
04:30:56.550 --> 04:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
concerns we have a lot of concerns about
 
04:31:00.389 --> 04:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
the prohibition of access to care um the
 
04:31:02.149 --> 04:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
the implications that this would mean
 
04:31:03.990 --> 04:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
for our providers and their ability to
 
04:31:07.710 --> 04:31:07.720 align:start position:0%
practice care within um uh within their
 
04:31:10.670 --> 04:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
license and uh you've heard today uh
 
04:31:11.790 --> 04:31:11.800 align:start position:0%
this I know this hearing was scheduled
 
04:31:13.349 --> 04:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
for for 90 minutes and we're well into
 
04:31:15.269 --> 04:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
your lunch hour so you've heard a lot of
 
04:31:17.950 --> 04:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
testimony today about um concerns about
 
04:31:20.790 --> 04:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
access to care I am want to just
 
04:31:23.750 --> 04:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
highlight a couple of those um pieces
 
04:31:26.910 --> 04:31:26.920 align:start position:0%
that have not been raised up to put a
 
04:31:28.830 --> 04:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
finer point on concerns about
 
04:31:30.389 --> 04:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention of our
 
04:31:34.429 --> 04:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
Workforce we are um the largest health
 
04:31:36.109 --> 04:31:36.119 align:start position:0%
system in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:31:38.030 --> 04:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
we're also the largest provider of
 
04:31:39.389 --> 04:31:39.399 align:start position:0%
psychiatric services here in New
 
04:31:42.950 --> 04:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire including um we just now um
 
04:31:44.910 --> 04:31:44.920 align:start position:0%
have taken operational control of the
 
04:31:47.790 --> 04:31:47.800 align:start position:0%
Hamstead um facility which is the uh us
 
04:31:49.750 --> 04:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
psychiatric facility in the state in the
 
04:31:53.109 --> 04:31:53.119 align:start position:0%
southern state of New Hampshire and um
 
04:31:55.229 --> 04:31:55.239 align:start position:0%
we have concerns about the implications
 
04:31:58.149 --> 04:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
for um our patients that are receiving
 
04:31:59.550 --> 04:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
psychiatric and Behavioral Health
 
04:32:02.990 --> 04:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
Services and also those who are um
 
04:32:06.990 --> 04:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
accessing pediatric um endocrin endr
 
04:32:09.309 --> 04:32:09.319 align:start position:0%
Chron these are big words sorry endr
 
04:32:12.269 --> 04:32:12.279 align:start position:0%
chronology Services too when we think
 
04:32:14.550 --> 04:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
about what a pediatric endocrinologist
 
04:32:18.389 --> 04:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
does they are um not just treating
 
04:32:20.109 --> 04:32:20.119 align:start position:0%
patients who are seeking gender from in
 
04:32:22.149 --> 04:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
care they may be treating patients who
 
04:32:25.269 --> 04:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
have uh adrenal disorders diabetes
 
04:32:28.149 --> 04:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
calcium metabolism other genetic um
 
04:32:30.710 --> 04:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
syndromes and so when we as an
 
04:32:33.229 --> 04:32:33.239 align:start position:0%
institution have to recruit and retain
 
04:32:36.309 --> 04:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
um specialty providers it's not just for
 
04:32:37.389 --> 04:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
providers that are going to provide
 
04:32:38.750 --> 04:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
gender firing care but we need to make
 
04:32:41.870 --> 04:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
sure we're providing services for um our
 
04:32:43.469 --> 04:32:43.479 align:start position:0%
young patients across the state that
 
04:32:46.109 --> 04:32:46.119 align:start position:0%
need access to other services like
 
04:32:49.550 --> 04:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
Diabetes Care I do have some questions
 
04:32:52.630 --> 04:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
about the bill as drafted there's is an
 
04:32:56.510 --> 04:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
effective date of um January I believe
 
04:32:58.950 --> 04:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2026 and so what would this
 
04:33:00.510 --> 04:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
mean for patients who are receiving
 
04:33:03.389 --> 04:33:03.399 align:start position:0%
puberty blockers today and would need
 
04:33:05.029 --> 04:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
potentially need to be tie traded down
 
04:33:07.230 --> 04:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
from their care I am not a clinician I'm
 
04:33:09.310 --> 04:33:09.320 align:start position:0%
an attorney so would have some grave
 
04:33:12.310 --> 04:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
concerns about a um a quick stop and
 
04:33:13.949 --> 04:33:13.959 align:start position:0%
care and what the implications of that
 
04:33:15.070 --> 04:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
would mean
 
04:33:17.029 --> 04:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
clinically there's been a lot of talk
 
04:33:19.349 --> 04:33:19.359 align:start position:0%
today about parental rights and informed
 
04:33:23.150 --> 04:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
consent and um pediatric ascent and I
 
04:33:26.029 --> 04:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
just want to underscore that um informed
 
04:33:27.830 --> 04:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
consent is something that is not only
 
04:33:29.109 --> 04:33:29.119 align:start position:0%
important to Dart Health it's a
 
04:33:31.830 --> 04:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
principle and a value but also the law
 
04:33:33.910 --> 04:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
and something that we um take very
 
04:33:36.349 --> 04:33:36.359 align:start position:0%
seriously so that all of our practices
 
04:33:37.629 --> 04:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
all of our policies and procedures
 
04:33:40.470 --> 04:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
contemplate informed consent both with
 
04:33:42.629 --> 04:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
um parents and also for those
 
04:33:44.390 --> 04:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
adolescence that are engaged in this
 
04:33:46.990 --> 04:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
treatment we also engage in Ascent too
 
04:33:50.310 --> 04:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
so that PA patients and parent patients
 
04:33:52.830 --> 04:33:52.840 align:start position:0%
parents and their provider are working
 
04:33:54.551 --> 04:33:54.561 align:start position:0%
collaboratively as they engage in this
 
04:33:56.830 --> 04:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
care you're down to 15 seconds sure one
 
04:33:58.830 --> 04:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
other point just to put a a finer point
 
04:34:01.830 --> 04:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
on this um questions around clinical
 
04:34:04.310 --> 04:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
collaboration and whether or not um
 
04:34:06.990 --> 04:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
patients providers are exploring
 
04:34:08.510 --> 04:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
Innovative treatments we see this
 
04:34:09.949 --> 04:34:09.959 align:start position:0%
outside of the gender affirming care
 
04:34:11.990 --> 04:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
spaces we see this in rare disease
 
04:34:15.869 --> 04:34:15.879 align:start position:0%
States we see this in oncology and um
 
04:34:18.150 --> 04:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
without access to care and without
 
04:34:19.670 --> 04:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
access to research we're not going to
 
04:34:21.551 --> 04:34:21.561 align:start position:0%
see medical Innovation so I just want to
 
04:34:23.470 --> 04:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
underscore that too I'm I am happy to
 
04:34:24.990 --> 04:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
take questions any questions
 
04:34:27.949 --> 04:34:27.959 align:start position:0%
representative Castle thank you Mr chair
 
04:34:30.510 --> 04:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
so I have a I know you're not a medical
 
04:34:31.990 --> 04:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
professional you're a lawyer so I'm
 
04:34:33.910 --> 04:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
going to ask you this in a legal term so
 
04:34:36.949 --> 04:34:36.959 align:start position:0%
on Dartmouth hedgcock website um it
 
04:34:39.109 --> 04:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
specifically says for most transgender
 
04:34:41.789 --> 04:34:41.799 align:start position:0%
patients hormone therapy is the first
 
04:34:44.510 --> 04:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
step so we've heard different things
 
04:34:46.910 --> 04:34:46.920 align:start position:0%
about requiring you know therapies and
 
04:34:48.990 --> 04:34:49.000 align:start position:0%
different things ahead of time but why
 
04:34:51.750 --> 04:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
would Dart Hitchcock take the on their
 
04:34:53.349 --> 04:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
website take the approach that that's
 
04:34:55.830 --> 04:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
the first step I wish I had the website
 
04:34:58.830 --> 04:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
up in front of me because I I don't um
 
04:35:00.349 --> 04:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
that's not our first step for this
 
04:35:01.869 --> 04:35:01.879 align:start position:0%
patient population I have learned a lot
 
04:35:03.390 --> 04:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
about gender affirming care because
 
04:35:05.189 --> 04:35:05.199 align:start position:0%
we've contemplated it in this state
 
04:35:08.629 --> 04:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
house in the last couple of years um for
 
04:35:10.670 --> 04:35:10.680 align:start position:0%
children young families who are
 
04:35:14.029 --> 04:35:14.039 align:start position:0%
accessing this care um it's a multi a
 
04:35:15.910 --> 04:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
multi-disciplined team that's working
 
04:35:19.470 --> 04:35:19.480 align:start position:0%
with um these families and we are
 
04:35:21.429 --> 04:35:21.439 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more social transition
 
04:35:23.230 --> 04:35:23.240 align:start position:0%
that's happening even before puberty
 
04:35:24.949 --> 04:35:24.959 align:start position:0%
blockers which puberty blockers is the
 
04:35:27.349 --> 04:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
only thing contemplated in this bill and
 
04:35:30.949 --> 04:35:30.959 align:start position:0%
that social supports is a a child that
 
04:35:33.590 --> 04:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
is supported by a multi-disciplinary
 
04:35:35.789 --> 04:35:35.799 align:start position:0%
team the provider is only one person
 
04:35:37.230 --> 04:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
there are social workers there are
 
04:35:39.830 --> 04:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
psychologists that are supporting the
 
04:35:41.269 --> 04:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
patient and their family as they
 
04:35:41.279 --> 04:35:42.269 align:start position:0%
patient and their family as they
navigate

04:35:42.269 --> 04:35:42.279 align:start position:0%
navigate
 
04:35:44.990 --> 04:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
what is this um next step for us as a
 
04:35:47.990 --> 04:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
family so that's number one that social
 
04:35:49.429 --> 04:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
piece then there's questions around
 
04:35:50.990 --> 04:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
puberty blockers you've heard from
 
04:35:52.629 --> 04:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
families today that have that have
 
04:35:54.429 --> 04:35:54.439 align:start position:0%
shared their journe Journey with great
 
04:35:55.390 --> 04:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
courage and so I'm not going to
 
04:35:58.189 --> 04:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
reiterate their stories but um that
 
04:35:59.629 --> 04:35:59.639 align:start position:0%
would be puberty blockers would be that
 
04:36:02.109 --> 04:36:02.119 align:start position:0%
next step and then uh hormone therapy
 
04:36:04.310 --> 04:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
and patients are going to navigate that
 
04:36:05.670 --> 04:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
with their providers they're going to be
 
04:36:07.510 --> 04:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
very unique I was listening to the
 
04:36:09.789 --> 04:36:09.799 align:start position:0%
testimony uh with a young man who has
 
04:36:12.109 --> 04:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
Turner syndrome and talk about a very
 
04:36:14.189 --> 04:36:14.199 align:start position:0%
unique patient who's going to be
 
04:36:16.150 --> 04:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
navigating some medical complexities
 
04:36:18.150 --> 04:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
with their provider who's not a state
 
04:36:20.990 --> 04:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
provider not Dartmouth health and um
 
04:36:23.869 --> 04:36:23.879 align:start position:0%
their and their their parents okay
 
04:36:26.629 --> 04:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
followup perck followup okay so uh Trump
 
04:36:28.551 --> 04:36:28.561 align:start position:0%
had an executive order that blocked or
 
04:36:30.750 --> 04:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
changed this how does that affect the
 
04:36:32.470 --> 04:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
because you're legal legal side things
 
04:36:33.830 --> 04:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
how does that affect what what's
 
04:36:35.429 --> 04:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
happening in the state when it comes to
 
04:36:36.590 --> 04:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
that yeah it's my understanding there's
 
04:36:39.269 --> 04:36:39.279 align:start position:0%
a stay on that executive order to date
 
04:36:43.029 --> 04:36:43.039 align:start position:0%
okay Al set I got one quick follow up
 
04:36:45.510 --> 04:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
okay um so does the dmouth Hitchcock
 
04:36:48.470 --> 04:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
metal I've asked this several times does
 
04:36:50.429 --> 04:36:50.439 align:start position:0%
background t are do you take a stance
 
04:36:53.230 --> 04:36:53.240 align:start position:0%
that P puberty blockers are safe and
 
04:36:56.150 --> 04:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
effective it's Dartmouth Croc has
 
04:36:57.551 --> 04:36:57.561 align:start position:0%
concerns with this bill because it
 
04:36:59.869 --> 04:36:59.879 align:start position:0%
prohibits access to care for a specific
 
04:36:59.879 --> 04:37:02.189 align:start position:0%
prohibits access to care for a specific
patient

04:37:02.189 --> 04:37:02.199 align:start position:0%
patient
 
04:37:05.990 --> 04:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
population anyone else yes uh
 
04:37:08.869 --> 04:37:08.879 align:start position:0%
representative ran thank you Mr chair
 
04:37:10.949 --> 04:37:10.959 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question how
 
04:37:13.150 --> 04:37:13.160 align:start position:0%
many children are we talking
 
04:37:15.670 --> 04:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
about um so I've asked this question of
 
04:37:20.070 --> 04:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
our it's very small um of our patient
 
04:37:23.109 --> 04:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
population um the amount of children
 
04:37:25.109 --> 04:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
that are receiving puberty blockers
 
04:37:27.949 --> 04:37:27.959 align:start position:0%
after much uh careful consideration with
 
04:37:30.551 --> 04:37:30.561 align:start position:0%
their parents and their providers is is
 
04:37:33.750 --> 04:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
extremely small a percentage of a of a a
 
04:37:35.590 --> 04:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
small percent I'm going to represent R
 
04:37:36.709 --> 04:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
so okay I'm going to circle back with
 
04:37:38.390 --> 04:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
you because I don't want to give uh
 
04:37:40.349 --> 04:37:40.359 align:start position:0%
definitive numbers here but it's a small
 
04:37:41.949 --> 04:37:41.959 align:start position:0%
percent of patients who need puberty
 
04:37:44.429 --> 04:37:44.439 align:start position:0%
blockers and an even smaller percent um
 
04:37:47.629 --> 04:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
who even walk to that next step and so I
 
04:37:49.310 --> 04:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
want to be really careful about
 
04:37:51.390 --> 04:37:51.400 align:start position:0%
protecting this patient population
 
04:37:53.990 --> 04:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas thank you Mr chair
 
04:37:56.551 --> 04:37:56.561 align:start position:0%
and thanks for taking my question um is
 
04:37:59.789 --> 04:37:59.799 align:start position:0%
it true that pediatric
 
04:38:02.109 --> 04:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
endocrinologists also care for children
 
04:38:04.629 --> 04:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
with uh type 1 and type two
 
04:38:07.750 --> 04:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
diabetes thyroid disorders adrenal
 
04:38:10.709 --> 04:38:10.719 align:start position:0%
diseases and pituitary abnormalities yes
 
04:38:12.390 --> 04:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely along with with turn Turner
 
04:38:16.070 --> 04:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
syndrome calcium metabolism um disorders
 
04:38:18.910 --> 04:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
yes followup followup and do you have
 
04:38:22.390 --> 04:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
any idea how many of those different
 
04:38:26.029 --> 04:38:26.039 align:start position:0%
disorders maybe total attend uh are
 
04:38:29.470 --> 04:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
attended by Dartmouth uh pediatric
 
04:38:31.070 --> 04:38:31.080 align:start position:0%
endocrinologist yeah I'm happy to get
 
04:38:32.869 --> 04:38:32.879 align:start position:0%
numbers for patient volumes for this
 
04:38:34.709 --> 04:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
committee thank
 
04:38:38.349 --> 04:38:38.359 align:start position:0%
you okay anyone else I'm almost afraid
 
04:38:52.670 --> 04:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:57.390 --> 04:38:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:59.629 --> 04:38:59.639 align:start position:0%
right so my question thank you Mr
 
04:39:04.590 --> 04:39:04.600 align:start position:0%
chairman um do you as an organization
 
04:39:07.869 --> 04:39:07.879 align:start position:0%
track statistics and outcomes for the
 
04:39:09.709 --> 04:39:09.719 align:start position:0%
patients who go through this care and if
 
04:39:12.709 --> 04:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
you do how long do you do so is this a
 
04:39:12.719 --> 04:39:14.629 align:start position:0%
you do how long do you do so is this a
lifelong

04:39:14.629 --> 04:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
lifelong
 
04:39:14.639 --> 04:39:16.470 align:start position:0%
lifelong
process

04:39:16.470 --> 04:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:39:18.429 --> 04:39:18.439 align:start position:0%
um I am going to have to take that
 
04:39:19.670 --> 04:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
representative jman have to take that
 
04:39:23.551 --> 04:39:23.561 align:start position:0%
question back to our team um there are
 
04:39:25.670 --> 04:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
so I think you're asking about clinical
 
04:39:28.590 --> 04:39:28.600 align:start position:0%
trials and it's not I don't have my
 
04:39:29.910 --> 04:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
finger on the pulse of what clinical
 
04:39:32.869 --> 04:39:32.879 align:start position:0%
trials we're engaged in um but I'm happy
 
04:39:34.070 --> 04:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
to take that back to the team the
 
04:39:36.230 --> 04:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
clinical team I'm specifically not
 
04:39:37.390 --> 04:39:37.400 align:start position:0%
talking about clinical trials I'm
 
04:39:38.510 --> 04:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
talking about the work that Dartmouth
 
04:39:40.070 --> 04:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock is doing with specific
 
04:39:40.080 --> 04:39:42.550 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock is doing with specific
patients

04:39:42.550 --> 04:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
patients
 
04:39:43.948 --> 04:39:43.958 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'm not understanding the
 
04:39:46.590 --> 04:39:46.600 align:start position:0%
detail of the question I'm
 
04:39:48.788 --> 04:39:48.798 align:start position:0%
sorry okay I'll try to explain it better
 
04:39:50.830 --> 04:39:50.840 align:start position:0%
does Darth does Dartmouth
 
04:39:53.470 --> 04:39:53.480 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock a after these treatments are
 
04:39:55.910 --> 04:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
performed do you have an understanding
 
04:39:57.590 --> 04:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
of what the outcomes of those treatments
 
04:40:00.070 --> 04:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
are for example if you have someone who
 
04:40:02.390 --> 04:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
goes through these treatments and then
 
04:40:04.310 --> 04:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
regrets it or de transitions or you have
 
04:40:05.670 --> 04:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
someone who goes through the treatment
 
04:40:07.590 --> 04:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
and is happy with it and continues on
 
04:40:09.670 --> 04:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
with their life do do you have any idea
 
04:40:11.868 --> 04:40:11.878 align:start position:0%
of how those outcomes turn out I think
 
04:40:13.510 --> 04:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
that that I think that information would
 
04:40:15.310 --> 04:40:15.320 align:start position:0%
be contemplated in clinical trials I'm
 
04:40:17.868 --> 04:40:17.878 align:start position:0%
happy to talk about I'm happy to to ask
 
04:40:20.310 --> 04:40:20.320 align:start position:0%
our team that but I think that that type
 
04:40:21.788 --> 04:40:21.798 align:start position:0%
of information that you're seeking would
 
04:40:23.830 --> 04:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
have to be contemplated in a clinical
 
04:40:26.550 --> 04:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
trial and I also um am very concerned
 
04:40:28.310 --> 04:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
about treating this patient population
 
04:40:30.150 --> 04:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
different from other patient populations
 
04:40:33.830 --> 04:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
for example if there's a Peds um a Peds
 
04:40:36.350 --> 04:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
GI patient who has a rare esophageal
 
04:40:39.788 --> 04:40:39.798 align:start position:0%
disorder and is engaged in an FDA um a
 
04:40:42.510 --> 04:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
not yet FDA approved clinical trial
 
04:40:44.590 --> 04:40:44.600 align:start position:0%
there's not we're not looking to follow
 
04:40:46.868 --> 04:40:46.878 align:start position:0%
that patient for the life of the patient
 
04:40:49.708 --> 04:40:49.718 align:start position:0%
so I I would take concern if we're going
 
04:40:51.470 --> 04:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
to be talking about treating one patient
 
04:40:54.270 --> 04:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
population in a different way but I will
 
04:40:55.590 --> 04:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
take the question back to the team I'm
 
04:40:58.510 --> 04:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:01.510 --> 04:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
that yes sign out of a castle I'm gonna
 
04:41:03.628 --> 04:41:03.638 align:start position:0%
ask one targeting question do you know
 
04:41:05.310 --> 04:41:05.320 align:start position:0%
the number of children that have
 
04:41:06.910 --> 04:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
transition through Dartmouth Hitchcock
 
04:41:08.350 --> 04:41:08.360 align:start position:0%
Medical Center I will take the number
 
04:41:09.670 --> 04:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
back I will take the question back to
 
04:41:11.990 --> 04:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
the team thank you
 
04:41:14.390 --> 04:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
okay let's move on thank you very much
 
04:41:16.390 --> 04:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
oh representative
 
04:41:18.628 --> 04:41:18.638 align:start position:0%
delus thank you Mr chair you may never
 
04:41:21.868 --> 04:41:21.878 align:start position:0%
leave today oh just well I am hungry we
 
04:41:24.350 --> 04:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
needed lunch at some point so I I may
 
04:41:26.070 --> 04:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
have missed I may have missed some of
 
04:41:28.230 --> 04:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
the information that you imparted sure
 
04:41:32.150 --> 04:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh what are the ages of the children
 
04:41:35.510 --> 04:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
that you treat sure roughly yeah so as I
 
04:41:38.430 --> 04:41:38.440 align:start position:0%
was explaining um we we have a gender
 
04:41:41.230 --> 04:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
affirming care clinic and so there are
 
04:41:42.750 --> 04:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
patients and their families that come to
 
04:41:44.830 --> 04:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
us that are seeking gender affirming
 
04:41:48.190 --> 04:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
care that would start with a social um
 
04:41:52.110 --> 04:41:52.120 align:start position:0%
uh transition and then may nav they may
 
04:41:54.030 --> 04:41:54.040 align:start position:0%
navigate to puberty blockers they may
 
04:41:56.310 --> 04:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
navigate to hormone uh treatment and
 
04:41:59.788 --> 04:41:59.798 align:start position:0%
they and Beyond um and so children can
 
04:42:01.550 --> 04:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
come to us at a at a very young age and
 
04:42:03.110 --> 04:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
are supported by a multi-disciplinary
 
04:42:05.190 --> 04:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
team you've heard today from patients so
 
04:42:06.830 --> 04:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
I don't want to their their stories are
 
04:42:08.150 --> 04:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
much more important than the testimony
 
04:42:12.390 --> 04:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
that I'm giving follow
 
04:42:14.030 --> 04:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
what's the youngest patient that you
 
04:42:16.750 --> 04:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
have who is on blockers oh
 
04:42:18.550 --> 04:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
representative D I'd have to get that
 
04:42:20.470 --> 04:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
that back to you and and I have to be
 
04:42:22.470 --> 04:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
very careful too because this these are
 
04:42:23.910 --> 04:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
this is sensitive patient information
 
04:42:25.708 --> 04:42:25.718 align:start position:0%
and none of us would want our patient
 
04:42:27.510 --> 04:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
information to be public and so I have
 
04:42:33.590 --> 04:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:37.990 --> 04:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
too okay representative TZ uh thank you
 
04:42:39.150 --> 04:42:39.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:42:41.190 --> 04:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
question then you can run the lunch um
 
04:42:42.948 --> 04:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
we heard previously and I apologize if
 
04:42:44.990 --> 04:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
you while we grabbed lunch if you
 
04:42:46.708 --> 04:42:46.718 align:start position:0%
mentioned this but we heard previously
 
04:42:50.350 --> 04:42:50.360 align:start position:0%
that there's um Workforce impacts in
 
04:42:51.948 --> 04:42:51.958 align:start position:0%
places where these kinds of laws are
 
04:42:54.910 --> 04:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
enacted yeah um and you mentioned how
 
04:42:56.270 --> 04:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
you have a team of pediatric
 
04:42:57.910 --> 04:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
endocrinologists we know that you were
 
04:43:00.948 --> 04:43:00.958 align:start position:0%
the premier tertiary care academic
 
04:43:04.310 --> 04:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
center for our state um what is sort of
 
04:43:06.430 --> 04:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
the um and we and and how much the
 
04:43:07.990 --> 04:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
Pediatric endocrinologist care for
 
04:43:09.628 --> 04:43:09.638 align:start position:0%
children with many other conditions as
 
04:43:11.708 --> 04:43:11.718 align:start position:0%
well can you paint for us a picture of
 
04:43:13.510 --> 04:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
like what kind of impact this would have
 
04:43:15.750 --> 04:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
on the workforce if at all possible this
 
04:43:17.550 --> 04:43:17.560 align:start position:0%
would have a significant impact on our
 
04:43:19.990 --> 04:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
Workforce particularly um it's really
 
04:43:21.550 --> 04:43:21.560 align:start position:0%
challenging for us in New Hampshire
 
04:43:23.310 --> 04:43:23.320 align:start position:0%
we're a very rural State our patient
 
04:43:25.350 --> 04:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
volumes are pretty low it's very hard
 
04:43:28.110 --> 04:43:28.120 align:start position:0%
for us to attract specialty providers
 
04:43:30.590 --> 04:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
and it's even more hard to attract
 
04:43:33.948 --> 04:43:33.958 align:start position:0%
pediatric specialty providers and so um
 
04:43:36.550 --> 04:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
we uh would have grave concerns about
 
04:43:38.430 --> 04:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
our ability to attract and retain the
 
04:43:41.788 --> 04:43:41.798 align:start position:0%
ped's Endo Endocrinology um Workforce
 
04:43:43.590 --> 04:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire we've actually
 
04:43:46.190 --> 04:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
been the recipients um
 
04:43:48.670 --> 04:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
of other types of providers that have
 
04:43:49.990 --> 04:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
come to New Hampshire because they don't
 
04:43:51.350 --> 04:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
want to practice in certain states that
 
04:43:53.190 --> 04:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
have other restrictions and so we are
 
04:43:56.590 --> 04:43:56.600 align:start position:0%
seeing that patients are um deciding
 
04:43:58.310 --> 04:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
where they live based on their ability
 
04:43:58.320 --> 04:44:00.830 align:start position:0%
where they live based on their ability
to

04:44:00.830 --> 04:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:03.190 --> 04:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
practice the final question on this
 
04:44:04.788 --> 04:44:04.798 align:start position:0%
subject with this witness and I'm here
 
04:44:07.910 --> 04:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
as long as you all are so final question
 
04:44:12.070 --> 04:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um oh dear now I've
 
04:44:14.708 --> 04:44:14.718 align:start position:0%
lost the question are you federally
 
04:44:18.708 --> 04:44:18.718 align:start position:0%
funded yes you are okay we um well
 
04:44:21.190 --> 04:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
there's some nuances there um Dartmouth
 
04:44:24.390 --> 04:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Health has um we are a public
 
04:44:27.628 --> 04:44:27.638 align:start position:0%
um institution that has um patients who
 
04:44:30.150 --> 04:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
have Medicaid coverage Medicare coverage
 
04:44:33.470 --> 04:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
um we we take all um patients regardless
 
04:44:35.510 --> 04:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
of their ability to pay we also our
 
04:44:37.510 --> 04:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
research institution very proud of the
 
04:44:39.948 --> 04:44:39.958 align:start position:0%
the work that our um our facilities are
 
04:44:42.350 --> 04:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
doing and so yes we have we do receive
 
04:44:44.230 --> 04:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
federal funds for research as
 
04:44:46.390 --> 04:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
well I I believe that was the question
 
04:44:48.110 --> 04:44:48.120 align:start position:0%
let's move on
 
04:44:53.670 --> 04:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:57.948 --> 04:44:57.958 align:start position:0%
much did Patricia Hughes ever come
 
04:45:01.708 --> 04:45:01.718 align:start position:0%
back no no apparently not okay also
 
04:45:05.110 --> 04:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak is Simon
 
04:45:16.150 --> 04:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:18.350 --> 04:45:18.360 align:start position:0%
um that's Simon Amaya price I have two
 
04:45:21.470 --> 04:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
last names sorry no worries it happens
 
04:45:21.480 --> 04:45:24.550 align:start position:0%
last names sorry no worries it happens
database

04:45:24.550 --> 04:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:27.590 --> 04:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
breaker um good afternoon thank you for
 
04:45:29.150 --> 04:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill and allowing me to
 
04:45:31.830 --> 04:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
testify my name is Simon Maya price
 
04:45:33.190 --> 04:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
today I had sit in front of you as a
 
04:45:35.590 --> 04:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
20-year-old man but for 3 years I
 
04:45:37.670 --> 04:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
thought I was a girl I received my
 
04:45:39.510 --> 04:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree in music last December
 
04:45:41.190 --> 04:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
with additional coursework at Harvard
 
04:45:43.350 --> 04:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
University and statistics I remember
 
04:45:45.510 --> 04:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
being 14 I was sitting in my
 
04:45:47.708 --> 04:45:47.718 align:start position:0%
pediatrician's office explaining to him
 
04:45:49.750 --> 04:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
that I was transgender and that my
 
04:45:51.750 --> 04:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
father wasn't affirming my new identity
 
04:45:53.948 --> 04:45:53.958 align:start position:0%
so my pediatrician asked my father would
 
04:45:56.788 --> 04:45:56.798 align:start position:0%
you like a dead son or a living
 
04:45:59.190 --> 04:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
daughter I was in the room when he asked
 
04:46:01.670 --> 04:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
this question there's no other situation
 
04:46:03.310 --> 04:46:03.320 align:start position:0%
when a doctor is allowed to suggest
 
04:46:05.350 --> 04:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
suicide like this to a patient and quite
 
04:46:07.470 --> 04:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
frankly it's medical malpractice if you
 
04:46:09.750 --> 04:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
ask parents of trans identified kids and
 
04:46:11.470 --> 04:46:11.480 align:start position:0%
other d transitioners you'll discover
 
04:46:13.310 --> 04:46:13.320 align:start position:0%
that this is a common line used to
 
04:46:15.310 --> 04:46:15.320 align:start position:0%
manipulate parents du to consenting to
 
04:46:17.830 --> 04:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
these procedures despite being referred
 
04:46:19.948 --> 04:46:19.958 align:start position:0%
to my local gender Clinic three times by
 
04:46:21.788 --> 04:46:21.798 align:start position:0%
three separate doctors the emotional
 
04:46:23.708 --> 04:46:23.718 align:start position:0%
blackmail and my gender dysphoria
 
04:46:26.670 --> 04:46:26.680 align:start position:0%
diagnosis my father refused me to take
 
04:46:28.788 --> 04:46:28.798 align:start position:0%
refused to take me to be medicalized and
 
04:46:32.310 --> 04:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
I hated him for it at the time but now I
 
04:46:36.510 --> 04:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
am deeply grateful and it's not just me
 
04:46:39.830 --> 04:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
3% of my generation identifies as
 
04:46:41.910 --> 04:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
transgender between the time I left my
 
04:46:44.070 --> 04:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
high school in 10th Grade and my class
 
04:46:46.548 --> 04:46:46.558 align:start position:0%
graduated one sixth of the boys in my
 
04:46:48.868 --> 04:46:48.878 align:start position:0%
class started identifying as trans many
 
04:46:51.270 --> 04:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
of whom medicalized my girlfriend is a d
 
04:46:53.390 --> 04:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
transitioner and I can't do much more
 
04:46:55.430 --> 04:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
than pray that if and when we decide to
 
04:46:57.150 --> 04:46:57.160 align:start position:0%
have kids that despite the double
 
04:47:00.230 --> 04:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
mastectomy which prudes her from ever
 
04:47:02.230 --> 04:47:02.240 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding and the four years of
 
04:47:04.030 --> 04:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
cross- seex hormones she was given
 
04:47:05.990 --> 04:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
starting from when she was a minor that
 
04:47:07.948 --> 04:47:07.958 align:start position:0%
she is able to carry a pregnancy DET
 
04:47:11.230 --> 04:47:11.240 align:start position:0%
term the other side believes that if you
 
04:47:13.150 --> 04:47:13.160 align:start position:0%
don't give trans identified kids puberty
 
04:47:14.510 --> 04:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
blockers cross- seex hormones and
 
04:47:16.310 --> 04:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
surgeries they will kill themselves that
 
04:47:19.150 --> 04:47:19.160 align:start position:0%
is a damned lie I am living proof of
 
04:47:21.470 --> 04:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
that fact I was not put on hormones I
 
04:47:23.548 --> 04:47:23.558 align:start position:0%
was not operated on and I've grown up to
 
04:47:25.990 --> 04:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
be a healthy and happy 20-year-old man
 
04:47:27.310 --> 04:47:27.320 align:start position:0%
I've also talked to parents with
 
04:47:29.270 --> 04:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
d-transition or children who killed
 
04:47:30.430 --> 04:47:30.440 align:start position:0%
themselves after realizing they
 
04:47:31.628 --> 04:47:31.638 align:start position:0%
regretted what they had done to their
 
04:47:34.430 --> 04:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
bodies what would you say to those
 
04:47:37.190 --> 04:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
parents the other side of this issue has
 
04:47:39.270 --> 04:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
both psychological and economic
 
04:47:41.230 --> 04:47:41.240 align:start position:0%
incentives to oppose this spill imagine
 
04:47:42.788 --> 04:47:42.798 align:start position:0%
if you will having administered cross-
 
04:47:44.150 --> 04:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
seex hormones or puberty blockers or
 
04:47:45.310 --> 04:47:45.320 align:start position:0%
referred children to have such
 
04:47:47.310 --> 04:47:47.320 align:start position:0%
procedures what would you do if you were
 
04:47:48.910 --> 04:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
presented with the evidence that what
 
04:47:50.510 --> 04:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
you were doing wasn't helping your
 
04:47:52.708 --> 04:47:52.718 align:start position:0%
patients but indeed permanently harming
 
04:47:55.190 --> 04:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
your patients I know I would have a very
 
04:47:57.628 --> 04:47:57.638 align:start position:0%
hard time accepting that transgender
 
04:47:59.510 --> 04:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
healthcare is a multi-billion dollar
 
04:48:01.788 --> 04:48:01.798 align:start position:0%
industry though estimates vary the
 
04:48:03.150 --> 04:48:03.160 align:start position:0%
lifetime cost of providing a
 
04:48:04.430 --> 04:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
trans-identified individual with
 
04:48:06.910 --> 04:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
hormones and surgeries exceeds $100,000
 
04:48:08.868 --> 04:48:08.878 align:start position:0%
on average what would you do if you were
 
04:48:10.868 --> 04:48:10.878 align:start position:0%
a hospital administrator or doctor who
 
04:48:12.670 --> 04:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
made a million dollars for every 10
 
04:48:15.350 --> 04:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
patients you treated if you are serious
 
04:48:16.868 --> 04:48:16.878 align:start position:0%
about protecting families and the health
 
04:48:19.548 --> 04:48:19.558 align:start position:0%
of children you must Vote for This Bill
 
04:48:22.310 --> 04:48:22.320 align:start position:0%

um what influenced your transgender
 
04:48:50.788 --> 04:48:50.798 align:start position:0%
identification I experienced two years
 
04:48:52.548 --> 04:48:52.558 align:start position:0%
of near daily homophobic bullying in
 
04:48:53.830 --> 04:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
seventh and eighth
 
04:48:56.750 --> 04:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
grade I was called the F slur which I
 
04:48:59.030 --> 04:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
will not repeat on a near daily basis by
 
04:49:01.990 --> 04:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
my classmates and I received little to
 
04:49:04.868 --> 04:49:04.878 align:start position:0%
no sympathy from the administration I
 
04:49:07.150 --> 04:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
moved to a new school in nth grade um
 
04:49:10.708 --> 04:49:10.718 align:start position:0%
shortly after my my friend group left me
 
04:49:12.310 --> 04:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
and I was sexually assaulted by an older
 
04:49:15.750 --> 04:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
boy who was 18 at the time on a school
 
04:49:18.390 --> 04:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
trip I started looking for answers I
 
04:49:20.470 --> 04:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
didn't understand what I was going
 
04:49:22.708 --> 04:49:22.718 align:start position:0%
through this distress I was feeling was
 
04:49:25.868 --> 04:49:25.878 align:start position:0%
real I joined the gay trade Alliance or
 
04:49:28.670 --> 04:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
the gender and sexuality Alliance and we
 
04:49:30.948 --> 04:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
watched this trans YouTuber called
 
04:49:33.390 --> 04:49:33.400 align:start position:0%
Contra points who is a male to female
 
04:49:35.190 --> 04:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
transitioner this is where I learned
 
04:49:36.788 --> 04:49:36.798 align:start position:0%
about the concept of gender dysphoria
 
04:49:39.030 --> 04:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
and the fact that there is a a clear
 
04:49:41.830 --> 04:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
pathway to solve what I thought I was
 
04:49:43.548 --> 04:49:43.558 align:start position:0%
feeling I was uncomfortable with my
 
04:49:45.548 --> 04:49:45.558 align:start position:0%
secondary sexual characteristics I was
 
04:49:47.510 --> 04:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with being a man and I was
 
04:49:49.948 --> 04:49:49.958 align:start position:0%
dissociated from my body it didn't help
 
04:49:51.390 --> 04:49:51.400 align:start position:0%
that in my health class I was taught
 
04:49:54.110 --> 04:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
about the gender unicorn and the teacher
 
04:49:58.030 --> 04:49:58.040 align:start position:0%
asked me and my classmates to place our
 
04:50:01.750 --> 04:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
our identities on of sex gender identity
 
04:50:04.670 --> 04:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
gender expression um romantic attraction
 
04:50:08.868 --> 04:50:08.878 align:start position:0%
and sexual attraction on these these
 
04:50:11.430 --> 04:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
Spectra and um
 
04:50:13.110 --> 04:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
I think that that sums it up pretty well
 
04:50:16.110 --> 04:50:16.120 align:start position:0%
additionally um I am bisexual and I am
 
04:50:19.190 --> 04:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
autistic and I suffered from a lot of um
 
04:50:22.230 --> 04:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
internalized homophobia obviously and um
 
04:50:24.910 --> 04:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
difficulties pertaining to socialization
 
04:50:27.590 --> 04:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that I am
 
04:50:30.750 --> 04:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
autistic just actually a second question
 
04:50:34.190 --> 04:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
act uh with kind of coat tailing off of
 
04:50:37.390 --> 04:50:37.400 align:start position:0%
uh representative tus um so why are you
 
04:50:41.110 --> 04:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
here today to testify to us then
 
04:50:44.750 --> 04:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
I am here today because I have I have
 
04:50:47.670 --> 04:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
lost two of my friends to
 
04:50:51.110 --> 04:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
suicide in my generation and in my age
 
04:50:53.910 --> 04:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
group rather suicide is the second
 
04:50:58.150 --> 04:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:01.670 --> 04:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
death this is a large population level
 
04:51:05.470 --> 04:51:05.480 align:start position:0%
problem and it sickens me that trans
 
04:51:07.628 --> 04:51:07.638 align:start position:0%
rights activists are using my dead
 
04:51:09.270 --> 04:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
friends as bargaining
 
04:51:12.948 --> 04:51:12.958 align:start position:0%
chips my girlfriend has been permanently
 
04:51:15.110 --> 04:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
harmed by these Medical Treatments my
 
04:51:16.788 --> 04:51:16.798 align:start position:0%
friend Corey over there has been
 
04:51:18.310 --> 04:51:18.320 align:start position:0%
permanently harmed by these Medical
 
04:51:20.470 --> 04:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
Treatments kids are being lied to
 
04:51:21.868 --> 04:51:21.878 align:start position:0%
parents are being emotionally
 
04:51:24.190 --> 04:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
manipulated and I personally think that
 
04:51:25.590 --> 04:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
this is the worst medical
 
04:51:27.310 --> 04:51:27.320 align:start position:0%
experimentation we have seen since World
 
04:51:29.548 --> 04:51:29.558 align:start position:0%
War II the same hormones we are giving
 
04:51:31.548 --> 04:51:31.558 align:start position:0%
young boys were the same hormones we
 
04:51:33.670 --> 04:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
administered to Alan Turing in Britain
 
04:51:36.470 --> 04:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
to cure his homosexuality this is
 
04:51:39.230 --> 04:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
unforgivable additionally I take deep
 
04:51:41.390 --> 04:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
offense with those to
 
04:51:44.150 --> 04:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
compare people like me advocating for my
 
04:51:48.070 --> 04:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
side to to Nazis I'm
 
04:51:51.110 --> 04:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
Jewish people have called me a Nazi for
 
04:51:52.910 --> 04:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
speaking up about this yesterday
 
04:51:55.990 --> 04:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
somebody tried to dox me the other side
 
04:51:58.030 --> 04:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't want people like me to exist
 
04:52:00.030 --> 04:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
because I invalidate a central tenant of
 
04:52:03.190 --> 04:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
their ideology that's why I'm here today
 
04:52:05.510 --> 04:52:05.520 align:start position:0%

25% of it was maybe my dad saying no he
 
04:53:00.910 --> 04:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
did not affirm me and 5% of it was my
 
04:53:02.430 --> 04:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
own critical thinking skills the more I
 
04:53:04.910 --> 04:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
talk to other D transitioners um the
 
04:53:07.350 --> 04:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
more I realized just how close I was to
 
04:53:10.110 --> 04:53:10.120 align:start position:0%
doing irreparable harm to my body and
 
04:53:12.390 --> 04:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
I've had nightmares for years about
 
04:53:16.190 --> 04:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
waking up paralyzed on a surgeon's table
 
04:53:18.548 --> 04:53:18.558 align:start position:0%
looking down at my genitalia and seeing
 
04:53:20.470 --> 04:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
the penile and virgin surgeries which
 
04:53:23.590 --> 04:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
are done on boys like
 
04:53:25.750 --> 04:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
me Al
 
04:53:28.750 --> 04:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
set one final question
 
04:53:31.390 --> 04:53:31.400 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr
 
04:53:36.150 --> 04:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
chairman um so what would you say to
 
04:53:43.910 --> 04:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:46.708 --> 04:53:46.718 align:start position:0%
it might be hard to understand right
 
04:53:46.718 --> 04:53:48.830 align:start position:0%
it might be hard to understand right
now

04:53:48.830 --> 04:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:53:51.430 --> 04:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
but if you don't do anything to
 
04:53:53.590 --> 04:53:53.600 align:start position:0%
permanently alter your body you'll be
 
04:53:57.070 --> 04:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
healthier in the long run you won't risk
 
04:53:59.150 --> 04:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
regretting the permanent harm you've
 
04:54:02.628 --> 04:54:02.638 align:start position:0%
done to your body and someday somebody
 
04:54:05.670 --> 04:54:05.680 align:start position:0%
will love you for who and what you are I
 
04:54:08.030 --> 04:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
didn't believe it when I was 14 I didn't
 
04:54:10.430 --> 04:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
believe that for years but I have been
 
04:54:12.830 --> 04:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
lucky to meet some very special people
 
04:54:15.590 --> 04:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
you know my girlfriend um not least of
 
04:54:19.270 --> 04:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
which of wh whom rather um have loved me
 
04:54:22.070 --> 04:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
for me and accepted the fact that I am a
 
04:54:24.430 --> 04:54:24.440 align:start position:0%
man it was very difficult for me growing
 
04:54:26.990 --> 04:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
up because I felt like masculinity and
 
04:54:30.230 --> 04:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
being a man was villainized I grew up in
 
04:54:33.788 --> 04:54:33.798 align:start position:0%
in Boston which is a very liberal City
 
04:54:37.750 --> 04:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
and I felt like I was the the kind of
 
04:54:40.788 --> 04:54:40.798 align:start position:0%
the the subject of this Collective guilt
 
04:54:43.110 --> 04:54:43.120 align:start position:0%
that all of the crimes that men commit
 
04:54:44.628 --> 04:54:44.638 align:start position:0%
people would talk about how men commit
 
04:54:46.030 --> 04:54:46.040 align:start position:0%
all of the murders all of the rape all
 
04:54:47.510 --> 04:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
of the sexual
 
04:54:49.788 --> 04:54:49.798 align:start position:0%
assault and that all men Were Somehow
 
04:54:52.470 --> 04:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
guilty of that that weighed very hardly
 
04:54:58.590 --> 04:54:58.600 align:start position:0%
on me and um I'm you're loved you will
 
04:55:01.110 --> 04:55:01.120 align:start position:0%
be loved
 
04:55:06.030 --> 04:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
regardless of the fact that you are a
 
04:55:09.590 --> 04:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
man we need men there are many ways to
 
04:55:10.868 --> 04:55:10.878 align:start position:0%
be a man
 
04:55:13.670 --> 04:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
you don't have to be a gun toing
 
04:55:17.230 --> 04:55:17.240 align:start position:0%
Southern cowboy hat Yeehaw type of guy
 
04:55:20.150 --> 04:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
you can be feminine you can be pretty
 
04:55:22.390 --> 04:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
you can love other men and none of that
 
04:55:24.750 --> 04:55:24.760 align:start position:0%

button on your
 
05:07:57.230 --> 05:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
mic um I just want to preface this by
 
05:07:59.350 --> 05:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
saying that I have done an online
 
05:08:02.190 --> 05:08:02.200 align:start position:0%
testimony already and I just wanted to
 
05:08:05.150 --> 05:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
uh make a few comments to clarify some
 
05:08:07.430 --> 05:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
things that people have been asking
 
05:08:10.070 --> 05:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
about um gender affirming care
 
05:08:13.030 --> 05:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
I am the parent of a trans child and I
 
05:08:16.270 --> 05:08:16.280 align:start position:0%
have seen them through their
 
05:08:19.110 --> 05:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
transition and I want to clear up some
 
05:08:21.110 --> 05:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
misconceptions about
 
05:08:25.548 --> 05:08:25.558 align:start position:0%
how um the availability and the ease of
 
05:08:29.590 --> 05:08:29.600 align:start position:0%
getting transgender affirming care
 
05:08:32.470 --> 05:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
because my child started showing signs
 
05:08:36.868 --> 05:08:36.878 align:start position:0%
of being trans right around four by the
 
05:08:39.430 --> 05:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
time they were in fifth grade they were
 
05:08:42.430 --> 05:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
referring to themselves as a male and a
 
05:08:43.628 --> 05:08:43.638 align:start position:0%
male name
 
05:08:48.628 --> 05:08:48.638 align:start position:0%
also and by the time they were 14 they
 
05:08:50.708 --> 05:08:50.718 align:start position:0%
decided that they wanted to besides
 
05:08:53.750 --> 05:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
socially transitioning all this time it
 
05:08:58.590 --> 05:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
was a long process they wanted to do um
 
05:09:02.430 --> 05:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
hormones now the process is not very
 
05:09:04.910 --> 05:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
easy first you need to call your doctor
 
05:09:07.510 --> 05:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
and you need to get a referral and those
 
05:09:10.230 --> 05:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
referrals take at least six months to
 
05:09:13.430 --> 05:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
get an appointment and when you
 
05:09:13.440 --> 05:09:15.190 align:start position:0%
get an appointment and when you
get

05:09:15.190 --> 05:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
get
 
05:09:17.948 --> 05:09:17.958 align:start position:0%
there you have to be psychologically
 
05:09:19.910 --> 05:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
evaluated you have to have a physical
 
05:09:22.628 --> 05:09:22.638 align:start position:0%
exam you have to State out why and how
 
05:09:25.030 --> 05:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
long you have been transitioning and how
 
05:09:28.830 --> 05:09:28.840 align:start position:0%
you feel about it and then after all of
 
05:09:30.830 --> 05:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
that which takes months it could take up
 
05:09:35.670 --> 05:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
to six months to or more then the child
 
05:09:38.990 --> 05:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
decides if and when they're going to
 
05:09:39.000 --> 05:09:40.230 align:start position:0%
decides if and when they're going to
take

05:09:40.230 --> 05:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
take
 
05:09:43.070 --> 05:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
Purity blockers or hormones my child
 
05:09:45.110 --> 05:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
they gave them a choice how would you
 
05:09:46.270 --> 05:09:46.280 align:start position:0%
like to
 
05:09:49.390 --> 05:09:49.400 align:start position:0%
proceed in your gender affirming care
 
05:09:51.788 --> 05:09:51.798 align:start position:0%
and my child says I would like to take
 
05:09:54.788 --> 05:09:54.798 align:start position:0%
hormone blockers and hormones and they
 
05:09:57.548 --> 05:09:57.558 align:start position:0%
said okay make sure all of the health
 
05:09:59.708 --> 05:09:59.718 align:start position:0%
things and all of the uh psychological
 
05:10:02.628 --> 05:10:02.638 align:start position:0%
things are in place between all that
 
05:10:04.788 --> 05:10:04.798 align:start position:0%
time from the very beginning to the
 
05:10:04.798 --> 05:10:06.470 align:start position:0%
time from the very beginning to the
journey

05:10:06.470 --> 05:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
journey
 
05:10:09.390 --> 05:10:09.400 align:start position:0%
of getting that referral to getting
 
05:10:12.590 --> 05:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
hormones was over two
 
05:10:15.310 --> 05:10:15.320 align:start position:0%
years now my child has already spoken
 
05:10:18.708 --> 05:10:18.718 align:start position:0%
today my child was on hormones like he
 
05:10:21.548 --> 05:10:21.558 align:start position:0%
said for a year and then he got cancer
 
05:10:24.030 --> 05:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
and he made the choice to get off of
 
05:10:26.230 --> 05:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
hormone therapy because he didn't want
 
05:10:28.470 --> 05:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
it to interrupt he was given a choice to
 
05:10:31.310 --> 05:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
stay on hormone therapy if he wanted to
 
05:10:33.510 --> 05:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
he chose not to and during that time
 
05:10:35.030 --> 05:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
while he was going through Cancer
 
05:10:38.350 --> 05:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
Treatments he reverted back to having
 
05:10:38.360 --> 05:10:40.190 align:start position:0%
Treatments he reverted back to having
menstruation

05:10:40.190 --> 05:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
menstruation
 
05:10:43.788 --> 05:10:43.798 align:start position:0%
being more feminine likee there were no
 
05:10:46.510 --> 05:10:46.520 align:start position:0%
effects that were not
 
05:10:49.830 --> 05:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
reversible and then after he finally
 
05:10:52.788 --> 05:10:52.798 align:start position:0%
became you know cancer-free thank
 
05:10:56.470 --> 05:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
goodness stage four cancer he went back
 
05:10:58.510 --> 05:10:58.520 align:start position:0%

kitzy I'm not speak just speaking to you
 
05:12:43.030 --> 05:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
today as a concerned citizen I'm
 
05:12:45.948 --> 05:12:45.958 align:start position:0%
speaking to you as a mother a mother who
 
05:12:47.948 --> 05:12:47.958 align:start position:0%
loves her child more than anything in
 
05:12:52.190 --> 05:12:52.200 align:start position:0%
the world a mother who like every parent
 
05:12:54.350 --> 05:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
wants nothing more than for her child to
 
05:12:58.350 --> 05:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
be safe healthy and happy and yet I find
 
05:13:01.510 --> 05:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
myself here once again pleading for my
 
05:13:03.310 --> 05:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
right to provide my daughter with the
 
05:13:06.110 --> 05:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
life-saving medical care she
 
05:13:09.110 --> 05:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
needs in every other circumstance our
 
05:13:12.030 --> 05:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
State trusts parents to make medical
 
05:13:15.150 --> 05:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
decisions for their own children parents
 
05:13:17.190 --> 05:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
decide when their child needs therapy
 
05:13:18.750 --> 05:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
when they need surgery and when they
 
05:13:21.230 --> 05:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
need medication but with this bill the
 
05:13:22.990 --> 05:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
government is telling me that I as a
 
05:13:24.910 --> 05:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
mother am incapable of making the right
 
05:13:27.868 --> 05:13:27.878 align:start position:0%
medical decisions for my child that I
 
05:13:30.590 --> 05:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
don't know what is best for her that my
 
05:13:33.150 --> 05:13:33.160 align:start position:0%
daughter's life her very existence is a
 
05:13:35.910 --> 05:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
political issue rather than a deeply
 
05:13:39.788 --> 05:13:39.798 align:start position:0%
personal medical bill medical one let me
 
05:13:41.868 --> 05:13:41.878 align:start position:0%
be clear this bill does not protect
 
05:13:44.948 --> 05:13:44.958 align:start position:0%
children it puts them in danger I
 
05:13:48.030 --> 05:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
strongly oppose this bill the risks to
 
05:13:51.030 --> 05:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
transgender youth are not hypothetical
 
05:13:53.430 --> 05:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
they are real Studies by the American
 
05:13:55.350 --> 05:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
Academy of Pediatrics have found that
 
05:13:57.190 --> 05:13:57.200 align:start position:0%
more than half of transgender male
 
05:13:59.590 --> 05:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
adolescents attempt suicide for
 
05:14:02.310 --> 05:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
non-binary youth the number is
 
05:14:05.270 --> 05:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
41% for transgender female adolescence
 
05:14:08.590 --> 05:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
it is 30% these are not just numbers the
 
05:14:10.510 --> 05:14:10.520 align:start position:0%
a real children children like my
 
05:14:13.030 --> 05:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
daughter who are crying out for help and
 
05:14:15.628 --> 05:14:15.638 align:start position:0%
we have the power to help them I'm not
 
05:14:17.310 --> 05:14:17.320 align:start position:0%
willing to gamble with my daughter's
 
05:14:19.510 --> 05:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
life I am not willing to sit by why
 
05:14:22.190 --> 05:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
politicians who have never met her who
 
05:14:25.110 --> 05:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
do not know her heart or her struggles
 
05:14:28.230 --> 05:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
make medical decisions on her behalf I
 
05:14:30.230 --> 05:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
refuse to let my government strip me of
 
05:14:32.948 --> 05:14:32.958 align:start position:0%
my right and my responsibility to
 
05:14:35.830 --> 05:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
protect her every time I come before a
 
05:14:37.868 --> 05:14:37.878 align:start position:0%
committee like this I look each of you
 
05:14:40.310 --> 05:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
in the eye and beg beg you to help me

05:15:51.390 --> 05:15:51.400 align:start position:0%
this as Speedy as I can I just want to
 
05:15:53.070 --> 05:15:53.080 align:start position:0%
start with a few relevant points here
 
05:15:54.628 --> 05:15:54.638 align:start position:0%
that came up during the course of
 
05:15:56.270 --> 05:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
conversation that as a father of a
 
05:15:58.030 --> 05:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
transgender child that I would like to
 
05:16:00.070 --> 05:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
give my uh my insight on I've been doing
 
05:16:02.788 --> 05:16:02.798 align:start position:0%
this for quite some time now since about
 
05:16:05.430 --> 05:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
2017 uh so our growing International
 
05:16:06.750 --> 05:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
consensus that was brought up during
 
05:16:08.670 --> 05:16:08.680 align:start position:0%
here today of some European countries
 
05:16:10.470 --> 05:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
that are on they're trying to outlaw
 
05:16:11.548 --> 05:16:11.558 align:start position:0%
this sort of practice I don't know
 
05:16:13.310 --> 05:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
anything about that but uh I don't I'm
 
05:16:14.990 --> 05:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
just wondering when uh New Hampshire
 
05:16:16.430 --> 05:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
started caring about what other other
 
05:16:19.990 --> 05:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
people did right uh I also want to say
 
05:16:23.430 --> 05:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
that the result of transgender suicide
 
05:16:25.390 --> 05:16:25.400 align:start position:0%
is not the fact that people are
 
05:16:27.990 --> 05:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
transgender the result is federal state
 
05:16:31.548 --> 05:16:31.558 align:start position:0%
and local governments social uh problems
 
05:16:33.948 --> 05:16:33.958 align:start position:0%
and and unsupported family members drive
 
05:16:36.110 --> 05:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
people to have to feel like there's
 
05:16:38.390 --> 05:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
nowhere else for them to go so suicide
 
05:16:41.150 --> 05:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
is not is not a byproduct of being
 
05:16:44.110 --> 05:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
transgender uh no no support system in
 
05:16:46.150 --> 05:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
place is really the cause and that's
 
05:16:49.110 --> 05:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
what this bill uh is is will only serve
 
05:16:49.120 --> 05:16:51.708 align:start position:0%
what this bill uh is is will only serve
to

05:16:51.708 --> 05:16:51.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:59.030 --> 05:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:02.510 --> 05:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
um this bill flies in the
 
05:17:07.270 --> 05:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
face of the trusted relationship between
 
05:17:09.708 --> 05:17:09.718 align:start position:0%
mental health care providers
 
05:17:12.548 --> 05:17:12.558 align:start position:0%
and medical providers and the ability of
 
05:17:14.270 --> 05:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
families to be able to navigate this
 
05:17:18.910 --> 05:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:21.708 --> 05:17:21.718 align:start position:0%
homes people talk about well we don't we
 
05:17:24.270 --> 05:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
Outlaw tattoos we Outlaw cigarettes we
 
05:17:26.910 --> 05:17:26.920 align:start position:0%
Outlaw tobacco but these things are are
 
05:17:28.910 --> 05:17:28.920 align:start position:0%
publicly available over the
 
05:17:31.990 --> 05:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
counter my child has to go through
 
05:17:34.868 --> 05:17:34.878 align:start position:0%
mental health evaluations it's been
 
05:17:37.430 --> 05:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
she's been going through this for years
 
05:17:38.830 --> 05:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
it's not something we just walked into
 
05:17:40.708 --> 05:17:40.718 align:start position:0%
to the doctor's office and decided that
 
05:17:42.948 --> 05:17:42.958 align:start position:0%
hey let's do this oh you know you're
 
05:17:44.670 --> 05:17:44.680 align:start position:0%
transgender great let's get you on
 
05:17:46.548 --> 05:17:46.558 align:start position:0%
hormones it doesn't work like that and
 
05:17:47.990 --> 05:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
if anyone's telling you that it does
 
05:17:49.590 --> 05:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
they're lying to you or they don't know
 
05:17:51.628 --> 05:17:51.638 align:start position:0%
what they're talking about so thank you
 
05:17:54.270 --> 05:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
for that I would just leave it one more
 
05:17:55.628 --> 05:17:55.638 align:start position:0%
one more
 
05:17:58.910 --> 05:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
thing to in rhetorical question to our
 
05:18:01.190 --> 05:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
cisgender people in this room when you
 
05:18:02.868 --> 05:18:02.878 align:start position:0%
were four when you were three when you
 
05:18:05.670 --> 05:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
were five did you question at all what
 
05:18:05.680 --> 05:18:06.990 align:start position:0%
were five did you question at all what
you

05:18:06.990 --> 05:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:18:10.708 --> 05:18:10.718 align:start position:0%
were and if not which probably the
 
05:18:14.910 --> 05:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
answer is no why is that opinion any
 
05:18:17.270 --> 05:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
less relevant than a child who does
 
05:18:18.670 --> 05:18:18.680 align:start position:0%
question who they
 
05:18:24.788 --> 05:18:24.798 align:start position:0%

gtown I didn't really prepare for this
 
05:21:23.110 --> 05:21:23.120 align:start position:0%

TTI okay great thank you yeah um these
 
05:21:35.270 --> 05:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
kinds of legislative proposals are
 
05:21:37.310 --> 05:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
rooted in nothing other than Prejudice
 
05:21:39.230 --> 05:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
and therefore fallacy
 
05:21:41.750 --> 05:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
I haven't heard a bit of reason or
 
05:21:43.350 --> 05:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
legitimate evidence to prove why this
 
05:21:45.548 --> 05:21:45.558 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff should be codified by law
 
05:21:47.390 --> 05:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
only disputing a personal fears and
 
05:21:49.868 --> 05:21:49.878 align:start position:0%
opinions from both sides the difference
 
05:21:51.470 --> 05:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
between the queer community's fears and
 
05:21:53.110 --> 05:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
opinions is that we aren't asking for
 
05:21:55.230 --> 05:21:55.240 align:start position:0%
them to be made Superior or necessary
 
05:21:57.110 --> 05:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
for anyone else to believe Through The
 
05:22:00.030 --> 05:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
Binding force of law all we want is to
 
05:22:02.548 --> 05:22:02.558 align:start position:0%
exist without being afraid of who we are
 
05:22:04.788 --> 05:22:04.798 align:start position:0%
not be anointed righteous by her majesty
 
05:22:06.628 --> 05:22:06.638 align:start position:0%
Elon Musk I don't know why I wrote that
 
05:22:08.350 --> 05:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
I was just sitting right there um we
 
05:22:10.590 --> 05:22:10.600 align:start position:0%
could could easily agree to disagree if
 
05:22:12.390 --> 05:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
those who disagreed with us would end
 
05:22:14.310 --> 05:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
there instead of further persecuting Us
 
05:22:16.910 --> 05:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
by making our livelihoods illegal Our
 
05:22:19.750 --> 05:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
Lives us people were only as harmful or
 
05:22:21.990 --> 05:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
harmless as anyone else as a person's
 
05:22:23.830 --> 05:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
Worth or moral goodness has nothing to
 
05:22:25.430 --> 05:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
do with physicality there's a
 
05:22:27.150 --> 05:22:27.160 align:start position:0%
fundamental problem with having to argue
 
05:22:28.670 --> 05:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
about this type of stuff and it's one of
 
05:22:30.868 --> 05:22:30.878 align:start position:0%
extremes you can't sit up here saying
 
05:22:32.470 --> 05:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
all trans people are this and I can't
 
05:22:34.070 --> 05:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
sit up here saying all Republicans or
 
05:22:35.548 --> 05:22:35.558 align:start position:0%
whoever are that because we don't live
 
05:22:37.430 --> 05:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
in a world nor have we ever lived in a
 
05:22:39.270 --> 05:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
world where it is reason or intelligent
 
05:22:41.628 --> 05:22:41.638 align:start position:0%
to generalize anything since the dawn of
 
05:22:43.150 --> 05:22:43.160 align:start position:0%
time all that's happened is a bunch of
 
05:22:45.150 --> 05:22:45.160 align:start position:0%
natural exceptions quite literally the
 
05:22:46.470 --> 05:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
reason we're standing here today is
 
05:22:48.150 --> 05:22:48.160 align:start position:0%
because something wildly unexpected
 
05:22:49.788 --> 05:22:49.798 align:start position:0%
happened in a tiny concentration of
 
05:22:51.830 --> 05:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
immeasurable energy randomly started to
 
05:22:54.190 --> 05:22:54.200 align:start position:0%
expand the point is some of us
 
05:22:56.030 --> 05:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
desperately need to reevaluate what we
 
05:22:57.750 --> 05:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
believe to be true because the world is
 
05:22:59.510 --> 05:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
not black and white never has been and
 
05:23:01.948 --> 05:23:01.958 align:start position:0%
never will be stop making it so hard to
 
05:23:04.670 --> 05:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
just be okay with being gray making it
 
05:23:07.868 --> 05:23:07.878 align:start position:0%
illegal won't change the laws of nature
 
05:23:09.270 --> 05:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
I would also like to address the thing
 
05:23:10.868 --> 05:23:10.878 align:start position:0%
that that guy said he asked the question
 
05:23:12.670 --> 05:23:12.680 align:start position:0%
he was like did they tell you the side
 
05:23:15.030 --> 05:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
effects before you got on hormones um
 
05:23:16.470 --> 05:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
yeah they did you know when they didn't
 
05:23:18.110 --> 05:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
tell me the side effects of sorry
 
05:23:20.470 --> 05:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
things when I took birth control when I
 
05:23:21.708 --> 05:23:21.718 align:start position:0%
they gave me the pill they didn't tell
 
05:23:23.708 --> 05:23:23.718 align:start position:0%
me the side effects of those and those
 
05:23:25.470 --> 05:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
are the same as the hormones I'm taking
 
05:23:27.788 --> 05:23:27.798 align:start position:0%
to be trans same thing same with
 
05:23:29.030 --> 05:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
anti-depressants they didn't tell me
 
05:23:30.470 --> 05:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
those side effects like you know when
 
05:23:32.310 --> 05:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
you hear the end of a commercial on TV
 
05:23:33.830 --> 05:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
and it's all those horrible things they
 
05:23:36.270 --> 05:23:36.280 align:start position:0%
told me that for testosterone not for
 
05:23:38.470 --> 05:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
other things so I just want to make that
 
05:23:41.150 --> 05:23:41.160 align:start position:0%
that abundantly clear and then the 99%
 
05:23:43.190 --> 05:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
of the time things someone said 99% of
 
05:23:44.510 --> 05:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
the time you hear about how people are
 
05:23:45.948 --> 05:23:45.958 align:start position:0%
all happy about it and not that they
 
05:23:47.708 --> 05:23:47.718 align:start position:0%
were like upset by their decision to
 
05:23:50.110 --> 05:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
transition probably because 99% of the
 
05:23:52.750 --> 05:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
time people are happy about it and I'm
 
05:23:54.750 --> 05:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
genuinely sorry for the people who have
 
05:23:57.030 --> 05:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
had terrible experiences but how many
 
05:23:58.910 --> 05:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
times are we going to treat the symptom
 
05:24:01.190 --> 05:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
and not the cause because someone
 
05:24:04.990 --> 05:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
someone who literally told us why they
 
05:24:06.110 --> 05:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
thought that they were Trans in the
 
05:24:08.830 --> 05:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
first place was not because of the woke
 
05:24:10.708 --> 05:24:10.718 align:start position:0%
liberals it was because they were
 
05:24:13.788 --> 05:24:13.798 align:start position:0%
already being persecuted for being a
 
05:24:16.948 --> 05:24:16.958 align:start position:0%
feminite as a man so like isn't the
 
05:24:19.110 --> 05:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
cause here a little bit different than
 
05:24:20.470 --> 05:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to get at with this
 
05:24:24.270 --> 05:24:24.280 align:start position:0%
bill seconds that's I'm I mean actually
 
05:24:26.350 --> 05:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
let me just make
 
05:24:29.030 --> 05:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
sure yeah I don't know it is life saving
 
05:24:31.910 --> 05:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
for some people um what are we defining
 
05:24:33.990 --> 05:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
life saving or safe by is something safe
 
05:24:35.548 --> 05:24:35.558 align:start position:0%
completely harmless and never has hurt
 
05:24:37.230 --> 05:24:37.240 align:start position:0%
anyone in the world cuz then safe
 
05:24:38.788 --> 05:24:38.798 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist everything on this God
 
05:24:41.070 --> 05:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
Green Earth can hurt you anyway okay
 
05:24:44.070 --> 05:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's it thank
 
05:24:46.470 --> 05:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
you well did you have questions probably
 
05:24:48.750 --> 05:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
not you guys want to get out here we're
 
05:24:50.070 --> 05:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
gonna we're gonna be here for a while we
 
05:24:54.030 --> 05:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
got another bill yet so I have latero
 
05:24:56.548 --> 05:24:56.558 align:start position:0%
okay for
 
05:24:59.750 --> 05:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
L okay thank you also signed up to speak
 
05:25:08.830 --> 05:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:12.070 --> 05:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:15.070 --> 05:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
you yeah after a bunch of Massachusetts
 
05:25:17.548 --> 05:25:17.558 align:start position:0%
people testified but thank you for
 
05:25:21.548 --> 05:25:21.558 align:start position:0%
listening yeah I'm a New Hampshire
 
05:25:26.230 --> 05:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
resident so um I'm not going to read
 
05:25:28.190 --> 05:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
this whole thing you have a copy and a
 
05:25:30.670 --> 05:25:30.680 align:start position:0%
lot of it's been reiterated but I will
 
05:25:33.110 --> 05:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
tell you that as a parent of a
 
05:25:36.628 --> 05:25:36.638 align:start position:0%
transgender now 24 year old or almost 24
 
05:25:39.910 --> 05:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
year old who came out as transgender a
 
05:25:42.590 --> 05:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:44.708 --> 05:25:44.718 align:start position:0%
15 he's still
 
05:25:47.110 --> 05:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
transgender he will always be
 
05:25:50.590 --> 05:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
transgender he knows who he is and so do
 
05:25:53.708 --> 05:25:53.718 align:start position:0%
we as parents and I believe in science
 
05:25:56.190 --> 05:25:56.200 align:start position:0%
I'm a registered nurse and I find it
 
05:25:59.788 --> 05:25:59.798 align:start position:0%
deeply offending offensive that some
 
05:26:02.708 --> 05:26:02.718 align:start position:0%
people in here accuse me of doing things
 
05:26:05.628 --> 05:26:05.638 align:start position:0%
like mutilate allowing me to mutilate my
 
05:26:09.548 --> 05:26:09.558 align:start position:0%
child excuse me I work with a population
 
05:26:12.910 --> 05:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
that um terrorizes and abuses their
 
05:26:16.430 --> 05:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
children do not how dare you do not
 
05:26:20.030 --> 05:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
compare me to one of those people how
 
05:26:20.040 --> 05:26:22.868 align:start position:0%
compare me to one of those people how
dare

05:26:22.868 --> 05:26:22.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:26.628 --> 05:26:26.638 align:start position:0%
you I've had I've been doing this since
 
05:26:30.670 --> 05:26:30.680 align:start position:0%
2018 my child is transgender he's not
 
05:26:33.270 --> 05:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
going to change his mind we went through
 
05:26:36.270 --> 05:26:36.280 align:start position:0%
like everybody else said multiple time
 
05:26:39.470 --> 05:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
multiple sessions of therapy with
 
05:26:43.230 --> 05:26:43.240 align:start position:0%
psychologist therapist psychiatrist
 
05:26:46.270 --> 05:26:46.280 align:start position:0%
endocrinologist primary care doctors
 
05:26:48.230 --> 05:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
we've been through it all and you don't
 
05:26:51.548 --> 05:26:51.558 align:start position:0%
just walk in nilly Willy and say oh I'm
 
05:26:55.190 --> 05:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
transgender give me some testosterone
 
05:26:58.470 --> 05:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
today it's stupid and I'll tell you
 
05:26:58.480 --> 05:26:59.390 align:start position:0%
today it's stupid and I'll tell you
something

05:26:59.390 --> 05:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:27:02.590 --> 05:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
else the Republicans are the ones that
 
05:27:05.390 --> 05:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
always seem to have a problem with
 
05:27:09.628 --> 05:27:09.638 align:start position:0%
transgender people stop using my child
 
05:27:12.110 --> 05:27:12.120 align:start position:0%
and other transgender people as
 
05:27:16.990 --> 05:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:17.000 --> 05:27:21.030 align:start position:0%
 
it

05:27:21.030 --> 05:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:26.750 --> 05:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:29.270 --> 05:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Dr
 
05:27:29.280 --> 05:27:34.750 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Dr
Michael

05:27:34.750 --> 05:27:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:38.230 --> 05:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
Lon I'll take less than two hours k I
 
05:27:41.190 --> 05:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
think we're almost done um Mr chairman
 
05:27:42.390 --> 05:27:42.400 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
05:27:44.670 --> 05:27:44.680 align:start position:0%
allowing me the three minutes to testify
 
05:27:47.310 --> 05:27:47.320 align:start position:0%
um hearing previous testimony I want to
 
05:27:49.430 --> 05:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
call out that my testimony will be
 
05:27:52.070 --> 05:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
limited to normal physiology and
 
05:27:54.910 --> 05:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
specifically to Pediatric and Adolescent
 
05:27:56.868 --> 05:27:56.878 align:start position:0%
young adults under the age 18 years of
 
05:27:59.070 --> 05:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
age as that's how the bill is
 
05:28:01.548 --> 05:28:01.558 align:start position:0%
written going through um I'm going to go
 
05:28:03.510 --> 05:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
kind of fast here um I'm going to start
 
05:28:05.270 --> 05:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
by going back 3,000
 
05:28:07.708 --> 05:28:07.718 align:start position:0%
years I think everyone in here has heard
 
05:28:11.030 --> 05:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh someone named hypocrates primum non
 
05:28:14.990 --> 05:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
noer first Do no harm for those of you
 
05:28:16.430 --> 05:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
who have actually read the Hippocratic
 
05:28:19.190 --> 05:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
Oath literally the very next sentence is
 
05:28:21.910 --> 05:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
a promise by physicians not to offer
 
05:28:25.070 --> 05:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
poison to their patients even if the
 
05:28:27.310 --> 05:28:27.320 align:start position:0%
patients ask for
 
05:28:30.030 --> 05:28:30.040 align:start position:0%
it slightly past
 
05:28:33.190 --> 05:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
hypocrates a man named
 
05:28:35.708 --> 05:28:35.718 align:start position:0%
Aristotle came up with the term sexual
 
05:28:38.788 --> 05:28:38.798 align:start position:0%
dimorphism and actually pondered how not
 
05:28:40.590 --> 05:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
only humans but other animals are
 
05:28:44.750 --> 05:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
sexually dimorphic that is there are two
 
05:28:47.788 --> 05:28:47.798 align:start position:0%
Sexes skipping forward just a little bit
 
05:28:49.350 --> 05:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
of History because I think we are here
 
05:28:51.548 --> 05:28:51.558 align:start position:0%
to understand are we actually doing harm
 
05:28:55.788 --> 05:28:55.798 align:start position:0%
or potentially doing harm um to
 
05:28:58.990 --> 05:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
Children normal physiology I have heard
 
05:29:02.190 --> 05:29:02.200 align:start position:0%
people say sex assigned at Birth that is
 
05:29:06.708 --> 05:29:06.718 align:start position:0%
absolutely asinine it does not follow
 
05:29:10.230 --> 05:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
science after conception whether you XX
 
05:29:13.590 --> 05:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
or XY whether you have testes in a penis
 
05:29:16.310 --> 05:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
is determined by a gene called sry it's
 
05:29:20.070 --> 05:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
actually normally found on Dy chromosome
 
05:29:21.670 --> 05:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
people who have things such as Turner
 
05:29:23.830 --> 05:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
syndrome which would be not covered by
 
05:29:25.548 --> 05:29:25.558 align:start position:0%
this law they're actually accepted by
 
05:29:28.750 --> 05:29:28.760 align:start position:0%
this um can be explained by the SR y
 
05:29:30.990 --> 05:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
Gene actually being transcribed instead
 
05:29:32.670 --> 05:29:32.680 align:start position:0%
of being on the Y chromosome it can be
 
05:29:35.310 --> 05:29:35.320 align:start position:0%
found on the X chromosome this was found
 
05:29:35.320 --> 05:29:36.190 align:start position:0%
found on the X chromosome this was found
in

05:29:36.190 --> 05:29:36.200 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:29:39.750 --> 05:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
1990 um that particular Gene if we're
 
05:29:41.788 --> 05:29:41.798 align:start position:0%
looking at development normal physiology
 
05:29:44.670 --> 05:29:44.680 align:start position:0%
at 6 weeks begins to be expressed at
 
05:29:47.470 --> 05:29:47.480 align:start position:0%
that point normal human fetus developing
 
05:29:49.430 --> 05:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
has both male and female
 
05:29:52.788 --> 05:29:52.798 align:start position:0%
genitalia as soon as sry is expressed at
 
05:29:54.070 --> 05:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
eight weeks of
 
05:29:56.190 --> 05:29:56.200 align:start position:0%
development if the person is going to
 
05:29:59.070 --> 05:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
become a male all of the female tracks
 
05:30:01.310 --> 05:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
have already degraded takes a little
 
05:30:02.628 --> 05:30:02.638 align:start position:0%
longer than women it's actually out to
 
05:30:05.990 --> 05:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
about 12 weeks at which point um the
 
05:30:08.990 --> 05:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
wolfy and ducks and women would have um
 
05:30:13.390 --> 05:30:13.400 align:start position:0%
degraded at six months six months baby's
 
05:30:14.270 --> 05:30:14.280 align:start position:0%
still in the
 
05:30:17.548 --> 05:30:17.558 align:start position:0%
womb testosterone reaches a level in the
 
05:30:20.030 --> 05:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
developing fetus that Rivals that of an
 
05:30:23.310 --> 05:30:23.320 align:start position:0%
adult 20-year-old male which I'm far
 
05:30:26.270 --> 05:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
past um but when males have um really
 
05:30:27.990 --> 05:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
their their Peak conditioning around the
 
05:30:30.230 --> 05:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
20year age
 
05:30:32.510 --> 05:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
range I think it's important to
 
05:30:34.030 --> 05:30:34.040 align:start position:0%
understand when we're talking about
 
05:30:36.868 --> 05:30:36.878 align:start position:0%
normal physiology that hormones are
 
05:30:39.510 --> 05:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for long term remodeling of
 
05:30:43.150 --> 05:30:43.160 align:start position:0%
the human body okay um if you want to
 
05:30:45.708 --> 05:30:45.718 align:start position:0%
look whether drugs are reversible um
 
05:30:47.510 --> 05:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
please don't don't look to me don't look
 
05:30:50.628 --> 05:30:50.638 align:start position:0%
to anyone in this pull up the drugs
 
05:30:52.310 --> 05:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
which have been approved by the FDA
 
05:30:53.750 --> 05:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
every one of them carries the strongest
 
05:30:55.548 --> 05:30:55.558 align:start position:0%
warning possible for
 
05:30:57.708 --> 05:30:57.718 align:start position:0%
suicide thank you thank you are you
 
05:30:59.670 --> 05:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
taking questions happy to take questions
 
05:31:01.788 --> 05:31:01.798 align:start position:0%
any questions for Dr L representative
 
05:31:05.190 --> 05:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
delus thank you Mr chairman um do you
 
05:31:08.430 --> 05:31:08.440 align:start position:0%
have experience in hormone research
 
05:31:11.868 --> 05:31:11.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um I'm a nerd
 
05:31:14.510 --> 05:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
um I actually started doing biomedical
 
05:31:17.430 --> 05:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
research when I was in high school after
 
05:31:20.750 --> 05:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
college I had studied both biochemistry
 
05:31:23.070 --> 05:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
chemistry I was offered an opportunity
 
05:31:24.708 --> 05:31:24.718 align:start position:0%
to join a lab which I never thought I
 
05:31:26.470 --> 05:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
would do it was a wonderful opportunity
 
05:31:27.670 --> 05:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
and I studied female hormone
 
05:31:29.470 --> 05:31:29.480 align:start position:0%
biosynthesis for over a year before I
 
05:31:30.750 --> 05:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
went to Dartmouth medical school I have
 
05:31:34.990 --> 05:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
a PhD not MD um that was wonderful I
 
05:31:37.470 --> 05:31:37.480 align:start position:0%
learned their hormones it's like a
 
05:31:37.480 --> 05:31:38.350 align:start position:0%
learned their hormones it's like a
chorus

05:31:38.350 --> 05:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
chorus
 
05:31:42.070 --> 05:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
my my mentor there hormones in the human
 
05:31:45.030 --> 05:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
body are a chorus it's an orchestra if
 
05:31:48.190 --> 05:31:48.200 align:start position:0%
you will you can't simply change out one
 
05:31:50.030 --> 05:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
tenor you can't change out one person
 
05:31:54.430 --> 05:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:57.150 --> 05:31:57.160 align:start position:0%
Orchestra representative King thank you
 
05:31:59.948 --> 05:31:59.958 align:start position:0%
Mr chair question um was asked before
 
05:32:02.270 --> 05:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
about if uh puberty blocking hormones
 
05:32:04.990 --> 05:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
are FDA approved are any of them FDA
 
05:32:08.190 --> 05:32:08.200 align:start position:0%
approved are they FDA so yes with a
 
05:32:10.070 --> 05:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
caveat are they approved and how they're
 
05:32:12.350 --> 05:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
used Physicians can use anyone who can
 
05:32:14.030 --> 05:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
prescribe a drug in the state of New
 
05:32:15.150 --> 05:32:15.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I don't remember where the
 
05:32:17.270 --> 05:32:17.280 align:start position:0%
line is drawn between NPS and other
 
05:32:18.788 --> 05:32:18.798 align:start position:0%
qualified Healthcare Providers can
 
05:32:20.910 --> 05:32:20.920 align:start position:0%
prescribe drugs beyond their intended
 
05:32:23.110 --> 05:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
use it it happens all the time I work in
 
05:32:25.350 --> 05:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
oncology cancer medicine we very
 
05:32:28.070 --> 05:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
regularly use that if you look at the
 
05:32:30.868 --> 05:32:30.878 align:start position:0%
G&amp;R agonists if you look at the drugs
 
05:32:32.390 --> 05:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
that are called puberty blockers now
 
05:32:35.150 --> 05:32:35.160 align:start position:0%
they're used in other things um are they
 
05:32:37.190 --> 05:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
approved as intended have they been
 
05:32:38.430 --> 05:32:38.440 align:start position:0%
researched there
 
05:32:39.830 --> 05:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
um I would encourage you and other
 
05:32:41.708 --> 05:32:41.718 align:start position:0%
members of this committee they're called
 
05:32:43.750 --> 05:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
um the package insert you can literally
 
05:32:44.788 --> 05:32:44.798 align:start position:0%
if you go to one of them it's called
 
05:32:46.708 --> 05:32:46.718 align:start position:0%
Lupron I'm not bias towards any I have
 
05:32:49.390 --> 05:32:49.400 align:start position:0%
no financial interest in this ad.com at
 
05:32:51.670 --> 05:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
the end lie and say you're a healthcare
 
05:32:53.270 --> 05:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
provider right at the top it'll say
 
05:32:53.280 --> 05:32:55.310 align:start position:0%
provider right at the top it'll say
prescribing

05:32:55.310 --> 05:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
prescribing
 
05:32:57.390 --> 05:32:57.400 align:start position:0%
information it's very easy to read
 
05:32:58.788 --> 05:32:58.798 align:start position:0%
what's on there you don't need to
 
05:33:00.628 --> 05:33:00.638 align:start position:0%
understand the doses Etc all of the
 
05:33:02.708 --> 05:33:02.718 align:start position:0%
warnings are provided right there the
 
05:33:05.390 --> 05:33:05.400 align:start position:0%
most strong warnings that the FDA issues
 
05:33:07.030 --> 05:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
are called blackbox warning there's a
 
05:33:09.670 --> 05:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
thin black line around it um as I
 
05:33:12.030 --> 05:33:12.040 align:start position:0%
remember Lupron actually has some pretty
 
05:33:15.548 --> 05:33:15.558 align:start position:0%
strong warnings on it that uh if you're
 
05:33:17.708 --> 05:33:17.718 align:start position:0%
going to give the drugs to children it's
 
05:33:19.070 --> 05:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
up to this committee to take a look at
 
05:33:23.390 --> 05:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
and see followup so as a followup in
 
05:33:24.868 --> 05:33:24.878 align:start position:0%
your extensive research it sounds like
 
05:33:26.708 --> 05:33:26.718 align:start position:0%
you've done research on this on hormone
 
05:33:29.030 --> 05:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
stuff would you say that changing
 
05:33:32.110 --> 05:33:32.120 align:start position:0%
hormone makeup at an adolescent age
 
05:33:34.190 --> 05:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
definitely changes the a lot of
 
05:33:35.470 --> 05:33:35.480 align:start position:0%
different things and not just one
 
05:33:36.910 --> 05:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
specific thing that we can point to
 
05:33:39.390 --> 05:33:39.400 align:start position:0%
could cause other issues so the impact
 
05:33:42.310 --> 05:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
of hormones is absolutely multifactorial
 
05:33:44.310 --> 05:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
it goes through a whole list of body
 
05:33:47.430 --> 05:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
processes your the brain the muscles um
 
05:33:48.830 --> 05:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
the the volume that you're able to take
 
05:33:50.910 --> 05:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
into your lungs the endurance that you
 
05:33:53.830 --> 05:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
have um psychosocial there there are
 
05:33:55.470 --> 05:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
many many things that the hormones can
 
05:33:57.628 --> 05:33:57.638 align:start position:0%
do have there been formal studies
 
05:34:00.470 --> 05:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
evaluating this to say if I give someone
 
05:34:03.310 --> 05:34:03.320 align:start position:0%
a hormone what spec and we start at
 
05:34:05.628 --> 05:34:05.638 align:start position:0%
childhood what specific changes are done
 
05:34:08.628 --> 05:34:08.638 align:start position:0%
there are not many um well-controlled
 
05:34:11.150 --> 05:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
studies uh describing that so I I I
 
05:34:13.470 --> 05:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
can't say because the data is not
 
05:34:16.990 --> 05:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:19.868 --> 05:34:19.878 align:start position:0%
questions representative lontine thank
 
05:34:21.830 --> 05:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:34:24.910 --> 05:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
question um but it it seems like you're
 
05:34:26.948 --> 05:34:26.958 align:start position:0%
saying that there's a whole mix of
 
05:34:29.590 --> 05:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
hormones in our bodies and that all of
 
05:34:32.510 --> 05:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
us are born with
 
05:34:35.788 --> 05:34:35.798 align:start position:0%
um testosterone and estrogen and it
 
05:34:38.150 --> 05:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
manifests in different to different
 
05:34:41.270 --> 05:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
degrees correct we all have some
 
05:34:45.910 --> 05:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
both ye so that is true there are males
 
05:34:45.920 --> 05:34:47.270 align:start position:0%
both ye so that is true there are males
have

05:34:47.270 --> 05:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:34:50.430 --> 05:34:50.440 align:start position:0%
a the sex related hormones testosterone
 
05:34:52.948 --> 05:34:52.958 align:start position:0%
is dominant there it generally is formed
 
05:34:53.990 --> 05:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
in the
 
05:34:56.230 --> 05:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
testes it can also be formed in other
 
05:34:58.030 --> 05:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
tissues fatty tissues the research is
 
05:34:59.510 --> 05:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
still ongoing and that this has been a
 
05:35:02.708 --> 05:35:02.718 align:start position:0%
big curiosity um and interestingly men
 
05:35:04.430 --> 05:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
you may want to know without estrogen
 
05:35:05.910 --> 05:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have the same bone density
 
05:35:09.628 --> 05:35:09.638 align:start position:0%
that you have now um similarly in women
 
05:35:11.470 --> 05:35:11.480 align:start position:0%
the estrogens which is actually a class
 
05:35:13.590 --> 05:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
of steroids are the dominant hormone
 
05:35:15.910 --> 05:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
that are there yes they generally come
 
05:35:18.030 --> 05:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
from the ovaries they can also be
 
05:35:20.548 --> 05:35:20.558 align:start position:0%
produced in other tissues as well um and
 
05:35:22.548 --> 05:35:22.558 align:start position:0%
this whole cycle actually when we were
 
05:35:24.590 --> 05:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
talking about puberty blockers I call
 
05:35:26.270 --> 05:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
those out specifically they actually
 
05:35:29.030 --> 05:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
Target the pituitary gland um to stop
 
05:35:30.868 --> 05:35:30.878 align:start position:0%
two hormones there a different class of
 
05:35:32.830 --> 05:35:32.840 align:start position:0%
hormones they're not steroidal hormones
 
05:35:34.390 --> 05:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
but those are signals that come down and
 
05:35:36.868 --> 05:35:36.878 align:start position:0%
actually directly impact um the goads in
 
05:35:39.430 --> 05:35:39.440 align:start position:0%
both male and female
 
05:35:41.788 --> 05:35:41.798 align:start position:0%
else hopefully answered the question we
 
05:35:44.430 --> 05:35:44.440 align:start position:0%
could spend hours on this just a brief
 
05:35:46.868 --> 05:35:46.878 align:start position:0%
followup followup it's okay
 
05:35:50.910 --> 05:35:50.920 align:start position:0%
um I believe it's um one half of a
 
05:35:54.470 --> 05:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
percent and possibly more babies are
 
05:35:58.628 --> 05:35:58.638 align:start position:0%
born with ambiguous sexual genitalia and
 
05:36:02.830 --> 05:36:02.840 align:start position:0%
also their hormones may also not fit in
 
05:36:05.910 --> 05:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
what we normally would see as male or
 
05:36:08.430 --> 05:36:08.440 align:start position:0%
female and do you think it's
 
05:36:14.110 --> 05:36:14.120 align:start position:0%
possible that um it's harder to
 
05:36:17.628 --> 05:36:17.638 align:start position:0%
identify individuals who are male or
 
05:36:20.868 --> 05:36:20.878 align:start position:0%
female um because they lack having
 
05:36:23.868 --> 05:36:23.878 align:start position:0%
something so visible as ambiguous
 
05:36:26.868 --> 05:36:26.878 align:start position:0%
genitalia and that perhaps for certain
 
05:36:29.548 --> 05:36:29.558 align:start position:0%
percent of the population they truly
 
05:36:33.070 --> 05:36:33.080 align:start position:0%
feel that they're not male or female or
 
05:36:37.350 --> 05:36:37.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps have the wrong um manifestation
 
05:36:39.390 --> 05:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
of what in their body they feel is
 
05:36:40.670 --> 05:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
something else do you believe that's
 
05:36:42.788 --> 05:36:42.798 align:start position:0%
possible so that's an excellent question
 
05:36:44.590 --> 05:36:44.600 align:start position:0%
that was actually the topic of a plenary
 
05:36:47.670 --> 05:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
talk I believe it was 2017 at the
 
05:36:50.750 --> 05:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
American Urology Association back in
 
05:36:53.310 --> 05:36:53.320 align:start position:0%
1973 the United States passed
 
05:36:56.110 --> 05:36:56.120 align:start position:0%
legislation um I believe it was DDT that
 
05:36:57.948 --> 05:36:57.958 align:start position:0%
had been the Hot Topic at the
 
05:37:01.150 --> 05:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
time drugs called estrogen memetics if
 
05:37:02.628 --> 05:37:02.638 align:start position:0%
you think of soybeans these are one of
 
05:37:05.788 --> 05:37:05.798 align:start position:0%
the classic ones you can have drugs that
 
05:37:07.990 --> 05:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
mimic estrogen and if they happen at the
 
05:37:09.548 --> 05:37:09.558 align:start position:0%
right point in development you can
 
05:37:12.270 --> 05:37:12.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely get androgynous genitalia um
 
05:37:14.628 --> 05:37:14.638 align:start position:0%
following in that same class are also a
 
05:37:16.670 --> 05:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
condition called hypospadius and
 
05:37:20.310 --> 05:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
micropenis um well micropenis is obvious
 
05:37:22.390 --> 05:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
what it is hypospadius don't Google it
 
05:37:25.708 --> 05:37:25.718 align:start position:0%
around lunch it's also a devastating um
 
05:37:27.390 --> 05:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
condition are these people potentially
 
05:37:29.830 --> 05:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
confused absolutely they re they require
 
05:37:32.070 --> 05:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
Medical Care and compassion does it mean
 
05:37:34.230 --> 05:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
they're trans not
 
05:37:36.390 --> 05:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily they absolutely need care
 
05:37:38.350 --> 05:37:38.360 align:start position:0%
this has been something that uh has been
 
05:37:41.590 --> 05:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
brewing for quite a while and I it this
 
05:37:45.190 --> 05:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
it's multifactorial how that uh how that
 
05:37:47.390 --> 05:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
arises anyone
 
05:37:50.110 --> 05:37:50.120 align:start position:0%
else seeing no one else thank you thank
 
05:37:52.548 --> 05:37:52.558 align:start position:0%
you thanks for staying so long oh thanks
 
05:37:54.270 --> 05:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
for your
 
05:37:56.670 --> 05:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
patience also signed up to speak is
 
05:37:56.680 --> 05:37:59.990 align:start position:0%
patience also signed up to speak is

05:38:02.910 --> 05:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
leond okay thank
 
05:38:09.030 --> 05:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:19.030 --> 05:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:24.788 --> 05:38:24.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:27.430 --> 05:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
testimony the direct harm that this bill
 
05:38:29.030 --> 05:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
would do has been thoroughly stated
 
05:38:30.910 --> 05:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
today I'm going to talk a little bit
 
05:38:32.430 --> 05:38:32.440 align:start position:0%
about the secondary
 
05:38:34.708 --> 05:38:34.718 align:start position:0%
effects the Bill's short title is the
 
05:38:36.230 --> 05:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
vulnerable child compassion and
 
05:38:38.070 --> 05:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
protection act
 
05:38:40.788 --> 05:38:40.798 align:start position:0%
transg excuse me transgender children
 
05:38:44.070 --> 05:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
exist they are at risk what they need is
 
05:38:45.910 --> 05:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
understanding and compassion and most
 
05:38:47.830 --> 05:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
importantly belief from the important
 
05:38:50.150 --> 05:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
people in their lives they exist and
 
05:38:51.910 --> 05:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
this bill further stigmatizes something
 
05:38:53.670 --> 05:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
that is already incredibly hard to deal
 
05:38:56.350 --> 05:38:56.360 align:start position:0%
with for the person going through
 
05:38:58.990 --> 05:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
it researchers at the Trapper project
 
05:39:00.708 --> 05:39:00.718 align:start position:0%
the leading Suicide Prevention and
 
05:39:02.750 --> 05:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
Crisis Intervention Organization for
 
05:39:05.070 --> 05:39:05.080 align:start position:0%
lgbtq plus
 
05:39:07.670 --> 05:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
people published a study in a PE review
 
05:39:10.110 --> 05:39:10.120 align:start position:0%
journal Nature human behavior that found
 
05:39:12.750 --> 05:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
anti-transgender state level laws have a
 
05:39:15.270 --> 05:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
significant and causal impact on suicide
 
05:39:17.390 --> 05:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
risk among transgender and non-binary
 
05:39:20.430 --> 05:39:20.440 align:start position:0%
young people across the United States
 
05:39:22.310 --> 05:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
laws like this one increase suic rates
 
05:39:24.708 --> 05:39:24.718 align:start position:0%
of suicide attempts by lgbtqia plus
 
05:39:26.830 --> 05:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
youth by as much as
 
05:39:29.110 --> 05:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
72% and that's among a group that is
 
05:39:30.708 --> 05:39:30.718 align:start position:0%
already more than four times more likely
 
05:39:32.708 --> 05:39:32.718 align:start position:0%
to attempt suicide than the general
 
05:39:35.548 --> 05:39:35.558 align:start position:0%
population previous testimony that cited
 
05:39:37.430 --> 05:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
outdated and debunked studies would
 
05:39:39.030 --> 05:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
happy believe that suicidality in
 
05:39:41.910 --> 05:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
transgender people isn't a real problem
 
05:39:44.788 --> 05:39:44.798 align:start position:0%
I would encourage you to do your own
 
05:39:47.310 --> 05:39:47.320 align:start position:0%
research there have been accounts today
 
05:39:49.030 --> 05:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
related to people being pushed into
 
05:39:51.230 --> 05:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
transition I'm not here to advocate for
 
05:39:52.548 --> 05:39:52.558 align:start position:0%
that and you've heard from parents today
 
05:39:54.270 --> 05:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
who've told you that that's not what
 
05:39:55.708 --> 05:39:55.718 align:start position:0%
happened with their
 
05:39:58.708 --> 05:39:58.718 align:start position:0%
kids the medication should be prescribed
 
05:40:00.990 --> 05:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
along with therapy and only after long
 
05:40:02.708 --> 05:40:02.718 align:start position:0%
and careful consideration together with
 
05:40:04.150 --> 05:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
the child and their
 
05:40:06.510 --> 05:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
parents the aim of these medications in
 
05:40:08.310 --> 05:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
regard to chance gender health is to
 
05:40:10.468 --> 05:40:10.478 align:start position:0%
reduce harm and banning their use is not
 
05:40:10.478 --> 05:40:12.750 align:start position:0%
reduce harm and banning their use is not
the

05:40:12.750 --> 05:40:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:15.070 --> 05:40:15.080 align:start position:0%
answer the decision of whether or not to
 
05:40:16.830 --> 05:40:16.840 align:start position:0%
use prity blockers ought to rest with
 
05:40:18.830 --> 05:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
the physician their parents and the
 
05:40:20.868 --> 05:40:20.878 align:start position:0%
child and not with the government this
 
05:40:22.990 --> 05:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
bill would deny access to medication
 
05:40:25.230 --> 05:40:25.240 align:start position:0%
that can save lives and in all
 
05:40:26.830 --> 05:40:26.840 align:start position:0%
likelihood lead to an increase of
 
05:40:28.510 --> 05:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
suicide attempts by vulnerable children
 
05:40:30.868 --> 05:40:30.878 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I oppose this
 
05:40:34.390 --> 05:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you any
 
05:40:36.670 --> 05:40:36.680 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thanks
 
05:40:40.350 --> 05:40:40.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:42.750 --> 05:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
okay one last call Patricia Hughes did
 
05:40:46.150 --> 05:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
Patricia Hughes ever come back I don't
 
05:40:49.468 --> 05:40:49.478 align:start position:0%
see her apparently not okay thank you
 
05:40:52.030 --> 05:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
and the final person to that as far as I
 
05:40:53.510 --> 05:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
know at least that who signed up to
 
05:40:55.590 --> 05:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
speak Jamie Reid from the courage
 
05:40:55.600 --> 05:41:07.548 align:start position:0%
speak Jamie Reid from the courage
coalition

05:41:07.548 --> 05:41:07.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:09.468 --> 05:41:09.478 align:start position:0%
please put your microphone on good
 
05:41:11.628 --> 05:41:11.638 align:start position:0%
afternoon my name is Jamie Reid I hold a
 
05:41:13.110 --> 05:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
master's of Science and clinical
 
05:41:14.948 --> 05:41:14.958 align:start position:0%
research management I am a lifelong
 
05:41:17.150 --> 05:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
Democrat a mom of five boys three of
 
05:41:18.750 --> 05:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
whom were adopted out of the foster care
 
05:41:21.468 --> 05:41:21.478 align:start position:0%
system and I am a lesbian I am also the
 
05:41:23.270 --> 05:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
public whistleblower from a pediatric
 
05:41:25.548 --> 05:41:25.558 align:start position:0%
gender Center where I worked where I saw
 
05:41:27.310 --> 05:41:27.320 align:start position:0%
patients from the age of three until the
 
05:41:30.670 --> 05:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
age of 26 and I worked with nearly 1,500
 
05:41:33.270 --> 05:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
unique patients I worked in pediatric
 
05:41:35.510 --> 05:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
gender medicine for nearly 5 years and I
 
05:41:37.910 --> 05:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
was once a True Believer what I learned
 
05:41:39.830 --> 05:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
is that these are interventions based on
 
05:41:42.070 --> 05:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
poor research with poor evidence and
 
05:41:44.708 --> 05:41:44.718 align:start position:0%
poor outcomes I believe that my time
 
05:41:46.390 --> 05:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
best today will be used simply
 
05:41:48.070 --> 05:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
explaining how a puberty blocker is
 
05:41:49.868 --> 05:41:49.878 align:start position:0%
clinically used and how it came to be
 
05:41:52.590 --> 05:41:52.600 align:start position:0%
used in children three mental health
 
05:41:54.150 --> 05:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
providers in the Netherlands
 
05:41:56.150 --> 05:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
hypothesized that the reason why
 
05:41:59.390 --> 05:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
transsexual adults were not doing well
 
05:42:01.868 --> 05:42:01.878 align:start position:0%
was because they could not pass
 
05:42:04.948 --> 05:42:04.958 align:start position:0%
primarily men could not pass as women
 
05:42:07.468 --> 05:42:07.478 align:start position:0%
they hypothesized that they could inter
 
05:42:10.708 --> 05:42:10.718 align:start position:0%
in early childhood to cosmetically help
 
05:42:13.390 --> 05:42:13.400 align:start position:0%
them look better as adults so they
 
05:42:16.310 --> 05:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
devised a study giving a puberty blocker
 
05:42:19.628 --> 05:42:19.638 align:start position:0%
when children reach Tanner stage 2 they
 
05:42:21.430 --> 05:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
believe that the puberty blocker could
 
05:42:24.190 --> 05:42:24.200 align:start position:0%
be part of a diagnostic determination
 
05:42:27.670 --> 05:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
giving children quote a time to think it
 
05:42:29.910 --> 05:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
did not work that way it became a
 
05:42:32.590 --> 05:42:32.600 align:start position:0%
one-way pathway and nearly every child
 
05:42:34.670 --> 05:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
ever put on a puberty blocker has gone
 
05:42:37.948 --> 05:42:37.958 align:start position:0%
on to cross- sex hormones they tested
 
05:42:41.590 --> 05:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
this thre part protocol step one a
 
05:42:44.070 --> 05:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
puberty blocker step two cross- seex
 
05:42:47.548 --> 05:42:47.558 align:start position:0%
hormon step three surgery they tried
 
05:42:51.070 --> 05:42:51.080 align:start position:0%
this first on 70 children so-called
 
05:42:56.788 --> 05:42:56.798 align:start position:0%
patient X is a young lesbian in fact 68
 
05:43:00.270 --> 05:43:00.280 align:start position:0%
of the 70 young people admitted that
 
05:43:03.468 --> 05:43:03.478 align:start position:0%
they were same sex attracted as a
 
05:43:06.510 --> 05:43:06.520 align:start position:0%
lesbian This concerns me because most of
 
05:43:08.868 --> 05:43:08.878 align:start position:0%
us EXP experienced profound questioning
 
05:43:11.510 --> 05:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
of our sexed bodies in childhood and
 
05:43:14.548 --> 05:43:14.558 align:start position:0%
Adolescence in the first study one young
 
05:43:17.948 --> 05:43:17.958 align:start position:0%
person died they died because the pubal
 
05:43:20.390 --> 05:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
blockade meant that their penis never
 
05:43:22.590 --> 05:43:22.600 align:start position:0%
developed and they were unable to have
 
05:43:24.868 --> 05:43:24.878 align:start position:0%
the type of vaginoplasty that would
 
05:43:28.070 --> 05:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
invert a penis instead the surgeons had
 
05:43:30.670 --> 05:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
to use a portion of their colon they
 
05:43:33.070 --> 05:43:33.080 align:start position:0%
developed a massive infection and this
 
05:43:35.750 --> 05:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
young person died the first study
 
05:43:37.708 --> 05:43:37.718 align:start position:0%
concluded that these patients might be
 
05:43:39.990 --> 05:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
feeling better because they actually
 
05:43:42.070 --> 05:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
completely switched the measurement
 
05:43:44.990 --> 05:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
scales the British then tried to repeat
 
05:43:47.708 --> 05:43:47.718 align:start position:0%
the puberty blockers study in 2011 the
 
05:43:51.110 --> 05:43:51.120 align:start position:0%
outcomes were so poor they refused to
 
05:43:53.468 --> 05:43:53.478 align:start position:0%
publish the results the researchers

completed in a New York Times article on
 
05:44:10.030 --> 05:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
October 23rd the reason why we have not
 
05:44:13.070 --> 05:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
yet read it was finally explained Quote
 
05:44:15.270 --> 05:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
us study on puberty blockers goes
 
05:44:19.190 --> 05:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
unpublished because of politics Dr said
 
05:44:21.670 --> 05:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
the leaders of this long running study
 
05:44:25.070 --> 05:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
said the drugs do not improve mental
 
05:44:29.628 --> 05:44:29.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:32.150 --> 05:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
distress thank
 
05:44:34.670 --> 05:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
you did
 
05:44:37.310 --> 05:44:37.320 align:start position:0%
I representative Kastle I me thank you
 
05:44:39.468 --> 05:44:39.478 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so I I've heard a lot today
 
05:44:40.628 --> 05:44:40.638 align:start position:0%
about statistics and different
 
05:44:42.510 --> 05:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
information uh it sounds like there's a
 
05:44:43.830 --> 05:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
growing concern there's not enough
 
05:44:45.708 --> 05:44:45.718 align:start position:0%
research uh is there any other specific
 
05:44:47.110 --> 05:44:47.120 align:start position:0%
research that you can cite because I
 
05:44:48.468 --> 05:44:48.478 align:start position:0%
haven't heard anything else that says
 
05:44:50.590 --> 05:44:50.600 align:start position:0%
that it could be to follow up to my
 
05:44:53.310 --> 05:44:53.320 align:start position:0%
question safe and effective absolutely
 
05:44:55.150 --> 05:44:55.160 align:start position:0%
so when we look at research we have to
 
05:44:57.390 --> 05:44:57.400 align:start position:0%
look at something called the Pyramid of
 
05:44:59.350 --> 05:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
evidence at the very top of that pyramid
 
05:45:01.230 --> 05:45:01.240 align:start position:0%
is something called a systematic review
 
05:45:03.190 --> 05:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
of evidence basically it looks at every
 
05:45:05.270 --> 05:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
single study that's published and they
 
05:45:07.030 --> 05:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
systematically review all of those
 
05:45:09.070 --> 05:45:09.080 align:start position:0%
studies to find out what the weight of
 
05:45:11.030 --> 05:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
the evidence is is it good evidence is
 
05:45:13.990 --> 05:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
it bad evidence we have had multiple
 
05:45:16.350 --> 05:45:16.360 align:start position:0%
Nations across the world complete
 
05:45:18.830 --> 05:45:18.840 align:start position:0%
systematic reviews of evidence they've
 
05:45:20.788 --> 05:45:20.798 align:start position:0%
reviewed puberty blockers cross- sex
 
05:45:22.590 --> 05:45:22.600 align:start position:0%
hormones surgeries they've reviewed
 
05:45:26.670 --> 05:45:26.680 align:start position:0%
everything even binding and tucking what
 
05:45:29.230 --> 05:45:29.240 align:start position:0%
they have found is systematically the
 
05:45:32.150 --> 05:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
reviews of evidence show that there is
 
05:45:37.390 --> 05:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
little to no statistical support that
 
05:45:40.708 --> 05:45:40.718 align:start position:0%
these interventions treat what they are
 
05:45:43.948 --> 05:45:43.958 align:start position:0%
intended to treat that does not mean
 
05:45:47.030 --> 05:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
that individuals will not say I quote
 
05:45:50.990 --> 05:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
feel better we do not judge a medical
 
05:45:53.990 --> 05:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
intervention based unfortunately on an
 
05:45:57.150 --> 05:45:57.160 align:start position:0%
individual's response we have to look at
 
05:46:00.468 --> 05:46:00.478 align:start position:0%
it from a systematic level the countries
 
05:46:02.430 --> 05:46:02.440 align:start position:0%
that have completed systematic reviews
 
05:46:05.190 --> 05:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
of evidence are almost all primarily
 
05:46:08.230 --> 05:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
liberal Northern countries in Europe
 
05:46:11.468 --> 05:46:11.478 align:start position:0%
Finland Sweden the UK the UK's
 
05:46:13.868 --> 05:46:13.878 align:start position:0%
systematic review of evidence took four
 
05:46:17.670 --> 05:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
years the outcome of that study was to
 
05:46:20.830 --> 05:46:20.840 align:start position:0%
ban puberty blockers in a bipartisan
 
05:46:24.670 --> 05:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
manner from the use in England Canada
 
05:46:27.270 --> 05:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
released two more systematic reviews of
 
05:46:30.548 --> 05:46:30.558 align:start position:0%
evidence just last month they reviewed
 
05:46:32.830 --> 05:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
puberty blockers and cross- sex hormones
 
05:46:34.350 --> 05:46:34.360 align:start position:0%
both of those systematic reviews of
 
05:46:37.788 --> 05:46:37.798 align:start position:0%
evidence show little to no so support
 
05:46:41.230 --> 05:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
for these treatments when you have poor
 
05:46:43.910 --> 05:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
support for the treatment you have to
 
05:46:48.030 --> 05:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
then look at how bad are the possible
 
05:46:50.788 --> 05:46:50.798 align:start position:0%
bad outcomes so if we can't prove that
 
05:46:53.830 --> 05:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
it works well we then have to make a
 
05:46:57.270 --> 05:46:57.280 align:start position:0%
decision could it really hurt and what
 
05:46:59.948 --> 05:46:59.958 align:start position:0%
we know is that we don't have evidence
 
05:47:02.350 --> 05:47:02.360 align:start position:0%
that they work well and what they really
 
05:47:05.350 --> 05:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
hurt is that they sterilize children
 
05:47:08.590 --> 05:47:08.600 align:start position:0%
they remove sexual function and they
 
05:47:13.948 --> 05:47:13.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:18.350 --> 05:47:18.360 align:start position:0%
systems that's it any other
 
05:47:20.468 --> 05:47:20.478 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:47:23.150 --> 05:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
Drew do you know of any other models
 
05:47:25.510 --> 05:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
where people treat based on a patient
 
05:47:25.520 --> 05:47:26.750 align:start position:0%
where people treat based on a patient
self-

05:47:26.750 --> 05:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
self-
 
05:47:30.070 --> 05:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
diagnosis no and what's so challenging
 
05:47:33.430 --> 05:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
with this is that so many people today
 
05:47:35.788 --> 05:47:35.798 align:start position:0%
said things like this take so long that
 
05:47:38.190 --> 05:47:38.200 align:start position:0%
the diagnostic process process is very
 
05:47:40.590 --> 05:47:40.600 align:start position:0%
you know indepth that they had to see a
 
05:47:42.948 --> 05:47:42.958 align:start position:0%
therapist what I can tell you is that
 
05:47:45.510 --> 05:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
this diagnostic process which is based
 
05:47:48.030 --> 05:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
on something called the dsm5 so this is
 
05:47:49.910 --> 05:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
a considered a mental health condition
 
05:47:51.310 --> 05:47:51.320 align:start position:0%
the reason why we pay for this with our
 
05:47:53.670 --> 05:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
insurance is because it's in the
 
05:47:57.310 --> 05:47:57.320 align:start position:0%
dsm5 the way that people actually
 
05:48:00.310 --> 05:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
diagnose this is based on written
 
05:48:03.830 --> 05:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
criteria that criteria includes things
 
05:48:06.430 --> 05:48:06.440 align:start position:0%
like a strong desire to be of the other
 
05:48:09.708 --> 05:48:09.718 align:start position:0%
G gend or insist that one is the other
 
05:48:14.270 --> 05:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
gender most gays and lesbians do this in
 
05:48:17.030 --> 05:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
childhood the other elements to this
 
05:48:20.830 --> 05:48:20.840 align:start position:0%
diagnosis include a strong preference
 
05:48:24.830 --> 05:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
for cross-gender roles and make believe
 
05:48:28.270 --> 05:48:28.280 align:start position:0%
so if a child wants to play the prince
 
05:48:29.310 --> 05:48:29.320 align:start position:0%
or the
 
05:48:32.468 --> 05:48:32.478 align:start position:0%
princess that is how the dsm5 is
 
05:48:35.628 --> 05:48:35.638 align:start position:0%
diagnosing gender dysphoria in childhood
 
05:48:39.030 --> 05:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
in addition if you prefer to play with
 
05:48:43.628 --> 05:48:43.638 align:start position:0%
toys of the quote other gender if a
 
05:48:46.430 --> 05:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
woman a girl grew up wanting to play
 
05:48:49.868 --> 05:48:49.878 align:start position:0%
with Legos instead of Barbie Dells she
 
05:48:53.310 --> 05:48:53.320 align:start position:0%
would meet the criteria in the dsm5 for
 
05:48:53.320 --> 05:48:54.390 align:start position:0%
would meet the criteria in the dsm5 for
gender

05:48:54.390 --> 05:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
gender
 
05:48:58.590 --> 05:48:58.600 align:start position:0%
dysphoria in boys if a boy rejects
 
05:49:02.708 --> 05:49:02.718 align:start position:0%
typical masculine toys games activities
 
05:49:06.430 --> 05:49:06.440 align:start position:0%
or prefers to play with girls they would
 
05:49:09.270 --> 05:49:09.280 align:start position:0%
meet meet criteria for gender dysphoria
 
05:49:10.190 --> 05:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
in the
 
05:49:13.030 --> 05:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
dsm5 when I have read all of the
 
05:49:16.030 --> 05:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
criteria in the dsm5 to Gay and Lesbian
 
05:49:21.110 --> 05:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
adults they meet every single diagnostic
 
05:49:25.150 --> 05:49:25.160 align:start position:0%
determination this is the most
 
05:49:28.110 --> 05:49:28.120 align:start position:0%
homophobic protocol I have ever seen
 
05:49:32.230 --> 05:49:32.240 align:start position:0%
devised and we were once forcibly raped
 
05:49:35.030 --> 05:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
to make us straight and we were once
 
05:49:35.040 --> 05:49:36.788 align:start position:0%
to make us straight and we were once
chemically

05:49:36.788 --> 05:49:36.798 align:start position:0%
chemically
 
05:49:39.190 --> 05:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
treated to make us straight and we are
 
05:49:42.788 --> 05:49:42.798 align:start position:0%
now using the current dsm5 to say if you
 
05:49:46.708 --> 05:49:46.718 align:start position:0%
are not a stereotypical boy or girl you
 
05:49:49.830 --> 05:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
meet criteria for gender
 
05:49:52.190 --> 05:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
dysphoria other
 
05:49:54.510 --> 05:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative Miller
 
05:49:56.548 --> 05:49:56.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr does Meeting those criteria
 
05:49:59.910 --> 05:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:02.590 --> 05:50:02.600 align:start position:0%
hormones no thank
 
05:50:05.830 --> 05:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
you no so what happened you answered the
 
05:50:08.310 --> 05:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
question thank you you can she can speak
 
05:50:10.310 --> 05:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
did did you want to elaborate or yes
 
05:50:12.910 --> 05:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely so what happens is when we
 
05:50:16.270 --> 05:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
have young people children who do not
 
05:50:18.310 --> 05:50:18.320 align:start position:0%
fit the stereotypical role of their
 
05:50:20.628 --> 05:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
Early Childhood what used to happen is
 
05:50:22.830 --> 05:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
those boys or those masculine
 
05:50:24.868 --> 05:50:24.878 align:start position:0%
little girls would be brought to a
 
05:50:27.110 --> 05:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
therapist and that therapist would tell
 
05:50:29.310 --> 05:50:29.320 align:start position:0%
the parents whether or not they should
 
05:50:31.788 --> 05:50:31.798 align:start position:0%
socially transition the child what's
 
05:50:36.390 --> 05:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
happening now is that older adolescents
 
05:50:38.830 --> 05:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
we see this as a true social contagion
 
05:50:41.628 --> 05:50:41.638 align:start position:0%
as well older adolescents are
 
05:50:44.590 --> 05:50:44.600 align:start position:0%
identifying and stating that they meet
 
05:50:47.350 --> 05:50:47.360 align:start position:0%
this criteria they will come in to a
 
05:50:50.230 --> 05:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
therapist and the therapist does not do
 
05:50:52.990 --> 05:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
anything else but say do you identify as
 
05:50:57.350 --> 05:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
trans the young person says yes I do and
 
05:50:59.990 --> 05:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
then in my own Center that was enough
 
05:51:02.190 --> 05:51:02.200 align:start position:0%
and yes children were receiving cross-
 
05:51:04.350 --> 05:51:04.360 align:start position:0%
seex hormones and puberty blockers after
 
05:51:06.830 --> 05:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
one meeting with the child therapist and
 
05:51:08.110 --> 05:51:08.120 align:start position:0%
one meeting with the Pediatric
 
05:51:11.670 --> 05:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
endocrinologist it was a very rapid
 
05:51:14.868 --> 05:51:14.878 align:start position:0%
protocol so yes you can essentially walk
 
05:51:17.628 --> 05:51:17.638 align:start position:0%
yourself right in and get yourself on
 
05:51:21.510 --> 05:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
hormones anyone else one one followup
 
05:51:23.750 --> 05:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
one question thank you Mr chair so that
 
05:51:25.390 --> 05:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
brought up a really good point uh I
 
05:51:26.788 --> 05:51:26.798 align:start position:0%
mentioned before the Dartmouth had it on
 
05:51:28.750 --> 05:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
their website that it was the first
 
05:51:30.548 --> 05:51:30.558 align:start position:0%
thing that they do when it comes to it
 
05:51:32.510 --> 05:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
was the hormone uh in the first step and
 
05:51:33.750 --> 05:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
their medical
 
05:51:37.190 --> 05:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
step in your professional experience
 
05:51:39.030 --> 05:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
how is It Broken Out In most other
 
05:51:41.070 --> 05:51:41.080 align:start position:0%
places or in your experience what is it
 
05:51:43.670 --> 05:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
how was that process done um thank you
 
05:51:45.948 --> 05:51:45.958 align:start position:0%
for your question I'm was really
 
05:51:47.830 --> 05:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
appalled that Dartmouth could not answer
 
05:51:49.390 --> 05:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
the question how many children they have
 
05:51:51.390 --> 05:51:51.400 align:start position:0%
medically transitioned I can let you
 
05:51:54.150 --> 05:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
know that between 209 and 2023 they
 
05:51:57.468 --> 05:51:57.478 align:start position:0%
medically transitioned 76 patients at
 
05:51:59.868 --> 05:51:59.878 align:start position:0%
the dartman hith Hitchcock Medical
 
05:52:02.350 --> 05:52:02.360 align:start position:0%
Center at the Dartmouth Hitchcock Clinic
 
05:52:03.910 --> 05:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
they medicalized three patients they
 
05:52:06.788 --> 05:52:06.798 align:start position:0%
wrote 353 prescriptions they buil build
 
05:52:09.590 --> 05:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
close to $100,000 in submitted charges
 
05:52:11.948 --> 05:52:11.958 align:start position:0%
this is over a 4-year period And this is
 
05:52:15.350 --> 05:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
only the patients that they collect
 
05:52:18.270 --> 05:52:18.280 align:start position:0%
correctly build to insurance so this
 
05:52:20.270 --> 05:52:20.280 align:start position:0%
data is there I cannot believe that they
 
05:52:21.708 --> 05:52:21.718 align:start position:0%
would not answer the question on how
 
05:52:24.548 --> 05:52:24.558 align:start position:0%
many people that they have done this too
 
05:52:27.230 --> 05:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
however in a center like that I also
 
05:52:29.750 --> 05:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
worked in a multidisciplinary center
 
05:52:31.270 --> 05:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
exactly like they have set up at
 
05:52:34.430 --> 05:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth the wath guidelines themselves
 
05:52:36.990 --> 05:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
essentially state if a child states that
 
05:52:39.468 --> 05:52:39.478 align:start position:0%
they are trans and at least one parent
 
05:52:41.468 --> 05:52:41.478 align:start position:0%
or legal guardian agrees with that
 
05:52:44.150 --> 05:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
assertion then that child can be
 
05:52:48.548 --> 05:52:48.558 align:start position:0%
medically transitioned no questions
 
05:52:50.830 --> 05:52:50.840 align:start position:0%
asked okay any final questions
 
05:52:50.840 --> 05:52:52.070 align:start position:0%
asked okay any final questions
representative

05:52:52.070 --> 05:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:52:55.628 --> 05:52:55.638 align:start position:0%
delus thank you Mr chairman um you
 
05:52:59.390 --> 05:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
referen the um cross- seex hormones do
 
05:53:02.670 --> 05:53:02.680 align:start position:0%
puberty blockers uh does a puberty
 
05:53:05.750 --> 05:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
blocker followed by sex hormones result
 
05:53:08.548 --> 05:53:08.558 align:start position:0%
in eventually permanent stability
 
05:53:10.310 --> 05:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely if you follow the protocol
 
05:53:12.390 --> 05:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
correctly as it was created by the Dutch
 
05:53:14.990 --> 05:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
you start a puberty blockade at Tanner
 
05:53:17.548 --> 05:53:17.558 align:start position:0%
stage two at Tanner stage two the penis
 
05:53:19.390 --> 05:53:19.400 align:start position:0%
is not developed the testicles have not
 
05:53:21.990 --> 05:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
dropped and the testicles do not have
 
05:53:26.310 --> 05:53:26.320 align:start position:0%
the pathways to create sperm so women
 
05:53:28.270 --> 05:53:28.280 align:start position:0%
are born with all of our eggs that we're
 
05:53:30.070 --> 05:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
ever going to have and ever be able to
 
05:53:33.350 --> 05:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
use for our fertility boys actually have
 
05:53:36.510 --> 05:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
to grow the pathways into their fertil
 
05:53:40.030 --> 05:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
ility if you block at Tanner stage
 
05:53:44.788 --> 05:53:44.798 align:start position:0%
two and go on to cross- sex hormones
 
05:53:49.468 --> 05:53:49.478 align:start position:0%
infertility and sterility is a 100%
 
05:53:54.590 --> 05:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
guaranteed in clinical Theory we were
 
05:53:57.230 --> 05:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
hypothesizing that if we go in and
 
05:54:00.230 --> 05:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
harvest a portion of that testicular
 
05:54:03.830 --> 05:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
tissue and freeze it if that young
 
05:54:06.110 --> 05:54:06.120 align:start position:0%
person later decides that they want to
 
05:54:08.788 --> 05:54:08.798 align:start position:0%
have biological children of their
 
05:54:10.948 --> 05:54:10.958 align:start position:0%
own what the
 
05:54:14.548 --> 05:54:14.558 align:start position:0%
hypothesized clinical idea is is that we
 
05:54:17.788 --> 05:54:17.798 align:start position:0%
could actually implant that testicular
 
05:54:20.430 --> 05:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
tissue into a pouch on the
 
05:54:23.750 --> 05:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
abdomen let that testicular tissue
 
05:54:26.948 --> 05:54:26.958 align:start position:0%
revascularize and grow and see if it
 
05:54:29.910 --> 05:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
could later go through the process to
 
05:54:35.750 --> 05:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
create sperm we have no no protocol to
 
05:54:37.150 --> 05:54:37.160 align:start position:0%
do that
 
05:54:40.310 --> 05:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
it is guaranteed that if you follow this
 
05:54:43.868 --> 05:54:43.878 align:start position:0%
protocol correctly a young male at 10an
 
05:54:46.830 --> 05:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
or two cross- sex hormones will be
 
05:54:50.468 --> 05:54:50.478 align:start position:0%
sterile it is a true human rights
 
05:54:56.510 --> 05:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:58.868 --> 05:54:58.878 align:start position:0%
people I believe it's a human rights
 
05:55:01.548 --> 05:55:01.558 align:start position:0%
violation to take away from my community
 
05:55:04.868 --> 05:55:04.878 align:start position:0%
from protog gay boys the right to their
 
05:55:07.110 --> 05:55:07.120 align:start position:0%
future fertility I think it's a human
 
05:55:09.230 --> 05:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
rights violation against
 
05:55:12.750 --> 05:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
them follow up is it a quick one yeah
 
05:55:16.510 --> 05:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um at what age does does this
 
05:55:20.510 --> 05:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
stability occur I mean is it later is it
 
05:55:22.868 --> 05:55:22.878 align:start position:0%
earlier than I would imagine I don't
 
05:55:26.190 --> 05:55:26.200 align:start position:0%
know so Tanner stage 2 is not an age
 
05:55:28.548 --> 05:55:28.558 align:start position:0%
Tanner staging is how we determine how
 
05:55:32.190 --> 05:55:32.200 align:start position:0%
far along someone is in puberty Tanner
 
05:55:34.868 --> 05:55:34.878 align:start position:0%
stage two in boys I think we actually
 
05:55:37.030 --> 05:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
even heard a young
 
05:55:39.868 --> 05:55:39.878 align:start position:0%
young man was started at the age of 10
 
05:55:43.070 --> 05:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
most girls start puberty earlier boys
 
05:55:45.390 --> 05:55:45.400 align:start position:0%
start puberty later we actually have a
 
05:55:47.468 --> 05:55:47.478 align:start position:0%
whole chemical question right now
 
05:55:49.590 --> 05:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
younger and younger ages are being seen
 
05:55:51.708 --> 05:55:51.718 align:start position:0%
in girls there's an issue here that does
 
05:55:53.830 --> 05:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
need to be looked at most girls will
 
05:55:57.830 --> 05:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
start puberty earlier than boys if you
 
05:56:00.948 --> 05:56:00.958 align:start position:0%
catch the boy at Tanner stage two and we
 
05:56:03.788 --> 05:56:03.798 align:start position:0%
give that puberty blocker as soon as we
 
05:56:05.750 --> 05:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
start dosing with that cross- seex
 
05:56:08.628 --> 05:56:08.638 align:start position:0%
hormone that fertility is essentially
 
05:56:11.990 --> 05:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
damaged for life in my Center we were
 
05:56:15.830 --> 05:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
putting Boys on a puberty blockade and
 
05:56:18.190 --> 05:56:18.200 align:start position:0%
leaving them on that I think also you
 
05:56:21.350 --> 05:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
heard from some older trans identified
 
05:56:24.190 --> 05:56:24.200 align:start position:0%
men yes it seems to me that the answer
 
05:56:27.430 --> 05:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
is going Way Beyond the question which
 
05:56:29.990 --> 05:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
was at what age and we are now talking
 
05:56:33.430 --> 05:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
about theal treatments and I'm a little
 
05:56:35.628 --> 05:56:35.638 align:start position:0%
concerned about those people who have
 
05:56:37.910 --> 05:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
been waiting for almost two hours to get
 
05:56:40.468 --> 05:56:40.478 align:start position:0%
to the next bill point of order she can
 
05:56:43.150 --> 05:56:43.160 align:start position:0%
speak she has a right to speak well she
 
05:56:45.788 --> 05:56:45.798 align:start position:0%
she does but but yes sorry age is just
 
05:56:47.590 --> 05:56:47.600 align:start position:0%
not the answer it's based on clinical
 
05:56:49.590 --> 05:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
question that was award it yes the
 
05:56:51.510 --> 05:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
answer is basically there is not an age
 
05:56:53.468 --> 05:56:53.478 align:start position:0%
this is based on clinical guidelines for
 
05:56:55.110 --> 05:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
when Tanner stage two
 
05:56:57.390 --> 05:56:57.400 align:start position:0%
occurs any final questions I would like
 
05:56:58.708 --> 05:56:58.718 align:start position:0%
to move
 
05:57:02.830 --> 05:57:02.840 align:start position:0%
on okay thank you thank you okay I
 
05:57:04.468 --> 05:57:04.478 align:start position:0%
hopefully have not missed anyone we had
 
05:57:06.670 --> 05:57:06.680 align:start position:0%
a huge stack of people Tes Ying huge
 
05:57:09.310 --> 05:57:09.320 align:start position:0%
stack of the pin cards hopefully I have
 
05:57:10.590 --> 05:57:10.600 align:start position:0%
not missed
 
05:57:13.670 --> 05:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
anyone I don't think I did all right so
 
05:57:14.990 --> 05:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
at this point I'm going to close the
 
05:57:18.548 --> 05:57:18.558 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HB 377 FN I am going
 
05:57:22.430 --> 05:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
to open the public hearing on HB 712 FN
 
05:57:24.190 --> 05:57:24.200 align:start position:0%
and recognize once again the prime

physical and psychological changes
 
06:01:41.670 --> 06:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
during adolescence medical experts
 
06:01:43.548 --> 06:01:43.558 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that breast development
 
06:01:45.948 --> 06:01:45.958 align:start position:0%
continues into the late teens and
 
06:01:48.468 --> 06:01:48.478 align:start position:0%
surgical interventions at a young age
 
06:01:51.350 --> 06:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
may carry unnecessary risks it is
 
06:01:53.948 --> 06:01:53.958 align:start position:0%
essential to ensure that miners have the
 
06:01:56.868 --> 06:01:56.878 align:start position:0%
maturity and informed consent capacity
 
06:01:58.670 --> 06:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
to make such life-altering
 
06:02:01.430 --> 06:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
decisions you will hear many compelling
 
06:02:04.310 --> 06:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
stories today and although an individual
 
06:02:06.310 --> 06:02:06.320 align:start position:0%
story can be very compelling and we've
 
06:02:08.468 --> 06:02:08.478 align:start position:0%
heard many of them today it is not a
 
06:02:10.510 --> 06:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
basis for an experimental medical
 
06:02:13.628 --> 06:02:13.638 align:start position:0%

on future breastfeeding ability and

sensation ation medical ethics emphasize
 
06:02:41.868 --> 06:02:41.878 align:start position:0%
the principle of Do no harm in cases
 
06:02:43.788 --> 06:02:43.798 align:start position:0%
where a Minor's physical health is not
 
06:02:46.110 --> 06:02:46.120 align:start position:0%
at risk postponing surgery until
 
06:02:48.510 --> 06:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
adulthood allows for fully informed
 
06:02:50.868 --> 06:02:50.878 align:start position:0%
decision making my testimony this
 
06:02:53.628 --> 06:02:53.638 align:start position:0%
morning applies to this bill as well
 
06:02:55.830 --> 06:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
while restricting elective procedures
 
06:02:58.110 --> 06:02:58.120 align:start position:0%
this legislation appropriately provides
 
06:03:00.548 --> 06:03:00.558 align:start position:0%
exceptions for medical necessity
 
06:03:03.910 --> 06:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
including severe cases of juvenile
 
06:03:06.430 --> 06:03:06.440 align:start position:0%
macromastia which is excessive breast
 
06:03:08.788 --> 06:03:08.798 align:start position:0%
overdevelopment that causes chronic pain
 
06:03:11.948 --> 06:03:11.958 align:start position:0%
or posture issues cases of significant
 
06:03:14.390 --> 06:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
asymmetry that result in physical or
 
06:03:17.468 --> 06:03:17.478 align:start position:0%
psychological distress reconstructive
 
06:03:20.350 --> 06:03:20.360 align:start position:0%
surgery due to trauma congenital
 
06:03:22.390 --> 06:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
conditions or other medically Justified
 
06:03:25.750 --> 06:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
needs and more these exceptions ensure
 
06:03:27.788 --> 06:03:27.798 align:start position:0%
that minors who truly need surgical
 
06:03:29.750 --> 06:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
intervention for health reasons can
 
06:03:32.590 --> 06:03:32.600 align:start position:0%
still receive appropriate care as I
 
06:03:34.270 --> 06:03:34.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier today you will hear
 
06:03:35.948 --> 06:03:35.958 align:start position:0%
today that if these children don't go
 
06:03:37.468 --> 06:03:37.478 align:start position:0%
through these procedures they are more
 
06:03:40.548 --> 06:03:40.558 align:start position:0%
likely to commit suicide I referenced it
 
06:03:43.070 --> 06:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
this morning but page 195 of the cast
 
06:03:45.670 --> 06:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
report showed that again child sex
 
06:03:48.110 --> 06:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
procedures don't actually prevent
 
06:03:51.190 --> 06:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
suicide and the ACLU attorney admitted
 
06:03:54.350 --> 06:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
that as well just last year a young
 
06:03:57.030 --> 06:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
autistic woman in New Hampshire filed a
 
06:03:58.990 --> 06:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
lawsuit against her former
 
06:04:00.990 --> 06:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
endocrinologist and other medical
 
06:04:04.270 --> 06:04:04.280 align:start position:0%
providers saying she was misled into
 
06:04:06.788 --> 06:04:06.798 align:start position:0%
inappropriate gender affirming surgeries
 
06:04:09.310 --> 06:04:09.320 align:start position:0%
and treatments that left her in pain and
 
06:04:11.948 --> 06:04:11.958 align:start position:0%
have ruined her life according to the
 
06:04:14.350 --> 06:04:14.360 align:start position:0%
lawsuit she cannot get back the life
 
06:04:16.708 --> 06:04:16.718 align:start position:0%
that was stolen from her she will never
 
06:04:19.230 --> 06:04:19.240 align:start position:0%
be able to conceive and bear a child
 
06:04:21.468 --> 06:04:21.478 align:start position:0%
even if she could conceive a child she
 
06:04:23.350 --> 06:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
would never be able to breastfeed her
 
06:04:26.150 --> 06:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
child she lives in Daily pain from the
 
06:04:28.868 --> 06:04:28.878 align:start position:0%
effects of the unnecessary surgeries and
 
06:04:30.788 --> 06:04:30.798 align:start position:0%
years of taking enormous amount of
 
06:04:33.510 --> 06:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
cross- seex hormones she will never look
 
06:04:35.910 --> 06:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
the same and has to deal daily with
 
06:04:38.708 --> 06:04:38.718 align:start position:0%
severe alterations to her female body
 
06:04:40.910 --> 06:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
such as bone structure and unwanted body
 
06:04:43.430 --> 06:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
and facial hair she cannot get back the
 
06:04:46.110 --> 06:04:46.120 align:start position:0%
life that was stolen from her as a child
 
06:04:48.390 --> 06:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
under Dartmouth Hitchcock's care they
 
06:04:50.948 --> 06:04:50.958 align:start position:0%
performed a double myectomy as well as
 
06:04:54.230 --> 06:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
removed her uterus ovaries and Fallopian
 
06:04:56.750 --> 06:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
tubes she also had a procedure to close
 
06:04:59.750 --> 06:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
her vagina according to the lawsuit
 
06:05:02.230 --> 06:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
already hospitals and medical facilities
 
06:05:05.030 --> 06:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
across the world and our country and yes
 
06:05:07.150 --> 06:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
someone mentioned earlier that why are
 
06:05:08.948 --> 06:05:08.958 align:start position:0%
we paying attention to all these other
 
06:05:11.350 --> 06:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
countries because they are doing studies
 
06:05:13.670 --> 06:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
that we are not and they are going
 
06:05:18.150 --> 06:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
through um way more protocols than we
 
06:05:20.310 --> 06:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
are here and we need to pay attention to
 
06:05:22.948 --> 06:05:22.958 align:start position:0%
that um
 
06:05:26.350 --> 06:05:26.360 align:start position:0%
so yes even Boston they're curta
 
06:05:29.030 --> 06:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
curtailing and ending miners access to
 
06:05:30.310 --> 06:05:30.320 align:start position:0%
these harmful
 
06:05:34.670 --> 06:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
procedures so this is Nationwide and
 
06:05:37.670 --> 06:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
global the Journal of sexual medicine
 
06:05:39.670 --> 06:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
and I mentioned this study this morning
 
06:05:43.350 --> 06:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
just put out a new study last week very
 
06:05:47.230 --> 06:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
recent of a 100,000 plus patients they
 
06:05:49.548 --> 06:05:49.558 align:start position:0%
found that those with surgery had
 
06:05:53.430 --> 06:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
significantly higher rates of depression
 
06:05:56.868 --> 06:05:56.878 align:start position:0%
anxiety suicidal ideation and substance
 
06:06:00.548 --> 06:06:00.558 align:start position:0%
use div disorder versus matched controls
 
06:06:00.558 --> 06:06:01.468 align:start position:0%
use div disorder versus matched controls
without

06:06:01.468 --> 06:06:01.478 align:start position:0%
without
 
06:06:04.150 --> 06:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
surgery this study found that gender
 
06:06:06.868 --> 06:06:06.878 align:start position:0%
affirming surgery is a associated with
 
06:06:10.468 --> 06:06:10.478 align:start position:0%
increased risk of mental health issues
 
06:06:12.590 --> 06:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
this legislation strikes a necessary
 
06:06:14.830 --> 06:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
balance between safeguarding miners from
 
06:06:17.390 --> 06:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
premature elective procedures and
 
06:06:19.868 --> 06:06:19.878 align:start position:0%
ensuring that those with legitimate
 
06:06:22.628 --> 06:06:22.638 align:start position:0%
medical needs can access care I urge the
 
06:06:24.590 --> 06:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
committee to support this measure to
 
06:06:25.868 --> 06:06:25.878 align:start position:0%
protect the well-being of young
 
06:06:28.468 --> 06:06:28.478 align:start position:0%
individuals while allowing room for
 
06:06:30.230 --> 06:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate medical
 
06:06:33.468 --> 06:06:33.478 align:start position:0%
discretion thank you
 
06:06:36.070 --> 06:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
questions representative Woods
 
06:06:38.270 --> 06:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um and thank you I
 
06:06:41.910 --> 06:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
just perhaps U these are sort of
 
06:06:46.868 --> 06:06:46.878 align:start position:0%
technical issues with the bill um on L
 
06:06:51.990 --> 06:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
page two uh line 21 it refers to
 
06:06:58.468 --> 06:06:58.478 align:start position:0%
uh surgery as defined in uh 329 colon
 
06:07:02.030 --> 06:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
53x um there's been an addition by the
 
06:07:07.310 --> 06:07:07.320 align:start position:0%
bill uh but there's no uh section 10
 
06:07:09.510 --> 06:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not seeing the line number
 
06:07:12.030 --> 06:07:12.040 align:start position:0%
that you mentioning uh line 21 on page
 
06:07:14.150 --> 06:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
two yeah minor me number the way yours
 
06:07:17.548 --> 06:07:17.558 align:start position:0%
are so I've Got Mine mine's taken right
 
06:07:19.830 --> 06:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
from the site so it's right under
 
06:07:22.948 --> 06:07:22.958 align:start position:0%
chapter 332 M it's about two sentences
 
06:07:27.990 --> 06:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
okay yep chap yep okay under uh three uh
 
06:07:32.548 --> 06:07:32.558 align:start position:0%
colon or Roman 3- a mhm the the second
 
06:07:36.270 --> 06:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
line down it says RSA 32953
 
06:07:40.750 --> 06:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
comma X that refers to what was added uh
 
06:07:45.788 --> 06:07:45.798 align:start position:0%
above U but there's no um section
 
06:07:49.030 --> 06:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
10 okay
 
06:07:53.628 --> 06:07:53.638 align:start position:0%
um also on same page line
 
06:07:56.990 --> 06:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
34 um it says breast surgery subject to
 
06:08:00.548 --> 06:08:00.558 align:start position:0%
the conditions of um
 
06:08:07.468 --> 06:08:07.478 align:start position:0%
um 329 colon 54 Roman 2 a through F uh
 
06:08:09.350 --> 06:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
and that refers to also what's been
 
06:08:11.708 --> 06:08:11.718 align:start position:0%
added but there's an e but no
 
06:08:15.868 --> 06:08:15.878 align:start position:0%
F okay we can make those changes I'll go
 
06:08:17.708 --> 06:08:17.718 align:start position:0%
back and look at them thank you just y
 
06:08:19.270 --> 06:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
technical issues sure thank you for
 
06:08:23.750 --> 06:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:25.990 --> 06:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
06:08:31.070 --> 06:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
Weber so this prohibits all
 
06:08:36.948 --> 06:08:36.958 align:start position:0%
surgeries with the exception of specific
 
06:08:39.830 --> 06:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
procedures referred to here and specific
 
06:08:41.510 --> 06:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
conditions referred to
 
06:08:44.430 --> 06:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
here can you guarantee that there are no
 
06:08:47.548 --> 06:08:47.558 align:start position:0%
other conditions that occur in miners
 
06:08:50.788 --> 06:08:50.798 align:start position:0%
that might require
 
06:08:54.948 --> 06:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
surgery uh this we went through when
 
06:08:57.390 --> 06:08:57.400 align:start position:0%
this bill was drafted we had a
 
06:09:01.310 --> 06:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
discussion with medical providers and
 
06:09:04.310 --> 06:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
encompassed every possible aspect of it
 
06:09:06.270 --> 06:09:06.280 align:start position:0%
that they thought would be applicable to
 
06:09:06.280 --> 06:09:07.948 align:start position:0%
that they thought would be applicable to
this

06:09:07.948 --> 06:09:07.958 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:09:07.958 --> 06:09:10.230 align:start position:0%
this
so

06:09:10.230 --> 06:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:09:13.990 --> 06:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
yes follow up and is there a
 
06:09:16.830 --> 06:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
concern when you testified you talked
 
06:09:21.590 --> 06:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
about medical necessity and um um you
 
06:09:21.600 --> 06:09:22.788 align:start position:0%
about medical necessity and um um you
talked

06:09:22.788 --> 06:09:22.798 align:start position:0%
talked
 
06:09:25.990 --> 06:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
about major needs for these
 
06:09:29.670 --> 06:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
surgeries um how are providers supposed
 
06:09:31.990 --> 06:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
to figure out where the line is between
 
06:09:33.510 --> 06:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
something that isn't bad enough for
 
06:09:35.110 --> 06:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
surgery or something that is bad enough
 
06:09:35.120 --> 06:09:36.030 align:start position:0%
surgery or something that is bad enough
for

06:09:36.030 --> 06:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:09:38.590 --> 06:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
surgery thank you I I believe the bill
 
06:09:40.910 --> 06:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
kind of takes that into consideration in
 
06:09:43.670 --> 06:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
the exceptions I mean it it it it Maps
 
06:09:56.150 --> 06:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:58.990 --> 06:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
so representative Lucas has a question
 
06:10:00.628 --> 06:10:00.638 align:start position:0%
okay representative Lucas
 
06:10:03.910 --> 06:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
sorry I you I was wait we're waiting for
 
06:10:06.030 --> 06:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
an answer still to your question
 
06:10:08.628 --> 06:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
she answered it okay go ahead represent
 
06:10:11.270 --> 06:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um just
 
06:10:15.590 --> 06:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh also was uh a kind of a point similar
 
06:10:19.708 --> 06:10:19.718 align:start position:0%
to what uh representative Woods made um
 
06:10:24.468 --> 06:10:24.478 align:start position:0%
in the uh last portion of the section
 
06:10:28.390 --> 06:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
above chapter 332
 
06:10:33.030 --> 06:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:36.030 --> 06:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
2B the procedure is needed to remove
 
06:10:38.910 --> 06:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
malignant tissue and an appropriate
 
06:10:42.750 --> 06:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
margin you see that M there's no mention
 
06:10:46.070 --> 06:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:49.390 --> 06:10:49.400 align:start position:0%
nodes lymph nodes
 
06:10:52.830 --> 06:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
okay lymph nodes are not breast tissue
 
06:10:56.190 --> 06:10:56.200 align:start position:0%
but they're often removed as part of a a
 
06:10:59.390 --> 06:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
surgery for breast malignancy if we feel
 
06:11:00.948 --> 06:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
that that needs to be part of amendment
 
06:11:03.590 --> 06:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
we can to we can add that if once we
 
06:11:05.590 --> 06:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm just I'm just pointing out that
 
06:11:09.628 --> 06:11:09.638 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you y anyone
 
06:11:17.230 --> 06:11:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:20.150 --> 06:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Courtney
 
06:11:41.310 --> 06:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:50.270 --> 06:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:52.628 --> 06:11:52.638 align:start position:0%
sure thank you honorable members of the
 
06:11:54.590 --> 06:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
committee for taking the time to hear my
 
06:11:56.468 --> 06:11:56.478 align:start position:0%
testimony for the record my name is
 
06:11:59.390 --> 06:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
Courtney Reid I serve as policy Advocate
 
06:12:02.030 --> 06:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
with the ACLU of New Hampshire speaking
 
06:12:05.670 --> 06:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
in opposition to House Bill 712
 
06:12:08.788 --> 06:12:08.798 align:start position:0%
uh the bottom line of this bill is that
 
06:12:11.070 --> 06:12:11.080 align:start position:0%
like the earlier uh bill that we
 
06:12:11.080 --> 06:12:12.030 align:start position:0%
like the earlier uh bill that we
considered

06:12:12.030 --> 06:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
considered
 
06:12:14.910 --> 06:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
today this bill would subject a class of
 
06:12:17.590 --> 06:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
people transgender adolescents to
 
06:12:19.948 --> 06:12:19.958 align:start position:0%
differential treatment by restricting
 
06:12:22.910 --> 06:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
Health Care to treat gender dysphoria
 
06:12:25.510 --> 06:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
with a specific carve out for treatments
 
06:12:27.788 --> 06:12:27.798 align:start position:0%
for gomasa and
 
06:12:29.750 --> 06:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
macromastia permitting the same
 
06:12:32.510 --> 06:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
treatment for cisgender adolescent
 
06:12:34.510 --> 06:12:34.520 align:start position:0%
experiencing different disorders of sex
 
06:12:36.468 --> 06:12:36.478 align:start position:0%
development but barring these same
 
06:12:39.390 --> 06:12:39.400 align:start position:0%
procedures for transgender
 
06:12:42.150 --> 06:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
adolescents this is unjust and
 
06:12:44.390 --> 06:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional sex
 
06:12:47.590 --> 06:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
classification and again this bill uh
 
06:12:49.390 --> 06:12:49.400 align:start position:0%
raises constitutional First Amendment
 
06:12:51.390 --> 06:12:51.400 align:start position:0%
concerns by prohibiting referrals for
 
06:12:54.468 --> 06:12:54.478 align:start position:0%
these procedures in other
 
06:12:57.070 --> 06:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
states this G this bill would prohibit
 
06:12:59.150 --> 06:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
families from making uh private
 
06:13:01.430 --> 06:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
healthcare decisions and it puts a
 
06:13:03.910 --> 06:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
legislature in the middle of medical
 
06:13:06.788 --> 06:13:06.798 align:start position:0%
decisions despite that surgery for
 
06:13:10.190 --> 06:13:10.200 align:start position:0%
transgender minors is extremely uncommon
 
06:13:12.628 --> 06:13:12.638 align:start position:0%
this language sends a message that the
 
06:13:14.590 --> 06:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
healthcare needs of trans people are
 
06:13:17.590 --> 06:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
less valid than those of other people it
 
06:13:20.190 --> 06:13:20.200 align:start position:0%
suggests that the Judgment of trans phys
 
06:13:22.510 --> 06:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
Physicians and Care teams can be
 
06:13:24.510 --> 06:13:24.520 align:start position:0%
dismissed and tossed to the
 
06:13:27.548 --> 06:13:27.558 align:start position:0%
wayside it also disregards associations
 
06:13:30.270 --> 06:13:30.280 align:start position:0%
like w paath the American Academy of
 
06:13:32.590 --> 06:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics and the endocrine
 
06:13:35.548 --> 06:13:35.558 align:start position:0%
Society further the criminal liability
 
06:13:37.628 --> 06:13:37.638 align:start position:0%
is hovering over the heads of Physicians
 
06:13:40.750 --> 06:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
is also concerning it is unclear how
 
06:13:43.510 --> 06:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
bills like this will affect access to
 
06:13:46.868 --> 06:13:46.878 align:start position:0%
care should it remain legal after dobs
 
06:13:48.788 --> 06:13:48.798 align:start position:0%
we know that bans and Care affect
 
06:13:50.590 --> 06:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
physician Recruitment and
 
06:13:52.948 --> 06:13:52.958 align:start position:0%
Retention and Within These Within These
 
06:13:55.310 --> 06:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
criminalized practice areas so the
 
06:13:57.270 --> 06:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
bottom line to keep this brief is that
 
06:13:59.788 --> 06:13:59.798 align:start position:0%
this bill singles out transgender Youth
 
06:14:03.110 --> 06:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
and again if safety and regret are
 
06:14:04.750 --> 06:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
really at the Forefront of concern for
 
06:14:06.430 --> 06:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
this committee there are different
 
06:14:09.990 --> 06:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
Avenues to address these like continued
 
06:14:12.948 --> 06:14:12.958 align:start position:0%
studies or uh considering guard rails
 
06:14:16.150 --> 06:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
and care so with that in mind I urge you
 
06:14:18.788 --> 06:14:18.798 align:start position:0%
to oppose House Bill 712 to protect the
 
06:14:20.628 --> 06:14:20.638 align:start position:0%
rights and well-being of transgender
 
06:14:22.868 --> 06:14:22.878 align:start position:0%
youth in their families and to keep
 
06:14:25.468 --> 06:14:25.478 align:start position:0%
medical decisions between doctors
 
06:14:27.788 --> 06:14:27.798 align:start position:0%
parents and adolescents thank you and
 
06:14:32.430 --> 06:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
I'm open to any questions thank you any
 
06:14:39.110 --> 06:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:40.910 --> 06:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak is
 
06:14:49.590 --> 06:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:14:51.948 --> 06:14:51.958 align:start position:0%
Alon thank you Mr chairman and members
 
06:14:53.510 --> 06:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
06:14:56.230 --> 06:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
is Erica Leon I represent Rockingham 13
 
06:14:58.190 --> 06:14:58.200 align:start position:0%
which is the town of
 
06:15:01.070 --> 06:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
dairy when it comes to medical
 
06:15:03.390 --> 06:15:03.400 align:start position:0%
procedures they get to be pretty complex
 
06:15:04.948 --> 06:15:04.958 align:start position:0%
you know I grew up in southern
 
06:15:07.708 --> 06:15:07.718 align:start position:0%
California when I've gone back to visit
 
06:15:09.310 --> 06:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
I've actually been shocked at the number
 
06:15:11.548 --> 06:15:11.558 align:start position:0%
of young High School age women who have
 
06:15:14.390 --> 06:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
had implants during sophomore junior
 
06:15:16.910 --> 06:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
year of school that was never acceptable
 
06:15:19.510 --> 06:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
that was never normal when I was a kid
 
06:15:23.510 --> 06:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
but today that's happening and today
 
06:15:26.948 --> 06:15:26.958 align:start position:0%
there are young minor girls who are
 
06:15:29.230 --> 06:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
receiving breast augmentations in this
 
06:15:31.750 --> 06:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
country with doctors performing
 
06:15:35.590 --> 06:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
that having a breast augmentation with
 
06:15:38.070 --> 06:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
implants means that you will be having
 
06:15:41.390 --> 06:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
surgeries and replacing them because
 
06:15:42.670 --> 06:15:42.680 align:start position:0%
they have health
 
06:15:46.270 --> 06:15:46.280 align:start position:0%
risks this is a health risk no matter
 
06:15:48.628 --> 06:15:48.638 align:start position:0%
how you were born but to have an
 
06:15:50.390 --> 06:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
augmentation and add an implant is a
 
06:15:53.390 --> 06:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
major risk um there's also the issues of
 
06:15:55.990 --> 06:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
removing breast tissue uh there's a
 
06:15:58.150 --> 06:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
young woman who was not able to join us
 
06:16:00.788 --> 06:16:00.798 align:start position:0%
today because she it's really difficult
 
06:16:02.548 --> 06:16:02.558 align:start position:0%
to testify on this she's a DD
 
06:16:05.670 --> 06:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
transitioner she had a double m to me
 
06:16:09.590 --> 06:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
she's had a child there's still stranded
 
06:16:11.910 --> 06:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
um tissue in there that's still creating
 
06:16:14.548 --> 06:16:14.558 align:start position:0%
milk that was causing her pain but she
 
06:16:17.230 --> 06:16:17.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to feed that baby that she
 
06:16:19.590 --> 06:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
was holding to her chest there's Real
 
06:16:22.430 --> 06:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
and True consequences here so it's
 
06:16:25.030 --> 06:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
important to make sure that any of these
 
06:16:28.910 --> 06:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
procedures are because we are treating a
 
06:16:31.350 --> 06:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
a physical medical need now this
 
06:16:33.708 --> 06:16:33.718 align:start position:0%
language um we've looked we we went
 
06:16:35.230 --> 06:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
through we tried to figure out all of
 
06:16:37.510 --> 06:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
the details and all the specifics on
 
06:16:40.548 --> 06:16:40.558 align:start position:0%
when breast surgery is indicated um it
 
06:16:42.548 --> 06:16:42.558 align:start position:0%
is possible that in the future we may
 
06:16:44.468 --> 06:16:44.478 align:start position:0%
have some new indication for breast
 
06:16:46.910 --> 06:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
surgery for young girls if that happens
 
06:16:48.430 --> 06:16:48.440 align:start position:0%
and that emerges in the medical
 
06:16:50.230 --> 06:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
literature we'd be able to add those
 
06:16:52.788 --> 06:16:52.798 align:start position:0%
exemptions but I I have a hard time
 
06:16:54.590 --> 06:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
seeing how that wouldn't be covered by
 
06:16:57.468 --> 06:16:57.478 align:start position:0%
malignancy or infection or damage
 
06:16:59.190 --> 06:16:59.200 align:start position:0%
because if there's malignancy infection
 
06:17:01.430 --> 06:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
or damage that breast tissue can be
 
06:17:05.430 --> 06:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
removed and that can be treated um
 
06:17:08.270 --> 06:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
right now when you talk about what mean
 
06:17:09.990 --> 06:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
what it talks about when you need to
 
06:17:11.868 --> 06:17:11.878 align:start position:0%
know whether or not it's allowed the
 
06:17:13.788 --> 06:17:13.798 align:start position:0%
specific definition definition of
 
06:17:15.548 --> 06:17:15.558 align:start position:0%
symptomatic m
 
06:17:17.830 --> 06:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
macromastia is the definition of when
 
06:17:20.590 --> 06:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
you have such large breasts they cause
 
06:17:23.310 --> 06:17:23.320 align:start position:0%
nerve problems they cause back problems
 
06:17:24.270 --> 06:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
and they
 
06:17:26.708 --> 06:17:26.718 align:start position:0%
symptomatically have a reason why you
 
06:17:28.510 --> 06:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
need to have a a breast reduction
 
06:17:31.708 --> 06:17:31.718 align:start position:0%
regardless of your age because it can be
 
06:17:33.670 --> 06:17:33.680 align:start position:0%
quite shocking um it can be quite
 
06:17:36.270 --> 06:17:36.280 align:start position:0%
significant and and that is specifically
 
06:17:39.750 --> 06:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
protected in this bill the point is to
 
06:17:42.708 --> 06:17:42.718 align:start position:0%
allow you to develop to figure out who
 
06:17:44.350 --> 06:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
you're going to be and learn how to
 
06:17:46.708 --> 06:17:46.718 align:start position:0%
become comfortable with that because
 
06:17:48.390 --> 06:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
watching the kids who grew up in the
 
06:17:51.548 --> 06:17:51.558 align:start position:0%
area where I did who instead of deciding
 
06:17:53.190 --> 06:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
that they need to figure out if they're
 
06:17:54.948 --> 06:17:54.958 align:start position:0%
comfortable with how they are and how
 
06:17:56.948 --> 06:17:56.958 align:start position:0%
they're developing instead they have the
 
06:17:58.548 --> 06:17:58.558 align:start position:0%
peer pressure to go and get implants to
 
06:18:00.548 --> 06:18:00.558 align:start position:0%
15 seconds yeah they go and get implants
 
06:18:02.110 --> 06:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
because there's a PE peer of pressure
 
06:18:03.868 --> 06:18:03.878 align:start position:0%
because they're allowed to do it let's
 
06:18:06.070 --> 06:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
protect childhood and hold off on these
 
06:18:07.830 --> 06:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
procedures unless there's cancer or an
 
06:18:10.910 --> 06:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
infection or trauma physical trauma
 
06:18:14.468 --> 06:18:14.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:16.910 --> 06:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none great thank you I
 
06:18:18.190 --> 06:18:18.200 align:start position:0%
could have gotten into all the details
 
06:18:21.788 --> 06:18:21.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:24.190 --> 06:18:24.200 align:start position:0%
questions also signed up to speak is
 
06:18:37.948 --> 06:18:37.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:40.548 --> 06:18:40.558 align:start position:0%
hello again Mr chair and my colleagues
 
06:18:42.590 --> 06:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
for the record I am representative
 
06:18:44.788 --> 06:18:44.798 align:start position:0%
alandre Murray from Manchester Ward n
 
06:18:46.628 --> 06:18:46.638 align:start position:0%
and I'm here testifying an opposition to
 
06:18:49.948 --> 06:18:49.958 align:start position:0%
this bill similar to my testimony on the
 
06:18:51.350 --> 06:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
other bill this morning at the end of
 
06:18:53.590 --> 06:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
the day I do not believe the legislature
 
06:18:55.110 --> 06:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
should be making healthc care decisions
 
06:18:57.590 --> 06:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
for any individual especially for
 
06:18:59.548 --> 06:18:59.558 align:start position:0%
children who are involving their doctors
 
06:19:02.310 --> 06:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
and parents in these decisions already I
 
06:19:03.948 --> 06:19:03.958 align:start position:0%
will share some data on the topic but I
 
06:19:05.750 --> 06:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
also wanted to share my own experiences
 
06:19:08.548 --> 06:19:08.558 align:start position:0%
with accessing gender affirming surgery
 
06:19:10.190 --> 06:19:10.200 align:start position:0%
I've been considering Top surgery for
 
06:19:12.708 --> 06:19:12.718 align:start position:0%
the past decade but have faced barrier
 
06:19:14.430 --> 06:19:14.440 align:start position:0%
after barrier and actually getting this
 
06:19:17.030 --> 06:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
care only two surgeons in the state are
 
06:19:19.270 --> 06:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
covered by my insurance policy and for
 
06:19:20.670 --> 06:19:20.680 align:start position:0%
different logistical reasons that I
 
06:19:22.628 --> 06:19:22.638 align:start position:0%
won't get into for the sake of time I'm
 
06:19:23.990 --> 06:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
not able to go to either of these
 
06:19:26.708 --> 06:19:26.718 align:start position:0%
surgeons my only option is to pursue out
 
06:19:28.750 --> 06:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
of network care considering these
 
06:19:31.110 --> 06:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
surgeries cost thousands of dollars and
 
06:19:33.150 --> 06:19:33.160 align:start position:0%
will likely put me out of work for weeks
 
06:19:34.990 --> 06:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
I have been at a standstill for years
 
06:19:37.270 --> 06:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
where I am literally unable to get
 
06:19:39.628 --> 06:19:39.638 align:start position:0%
health care that I need that my doctor
 
06:19:41.910 --> 06:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
knows I need and this is my experience
 
06:19:43.948 --> 06:19:43.958 align:start position:0%
as a 30-year-old now imagine how much
 
06:19:45.750 --> 06:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
harder it is to access these surgeries
 
06:19:48.350 --> 06:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
as a minor all of this is to say that
 
06:19:50.110 --> 06:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
not only are these surgeries uncommon
 
06:19:51.750 --> 06:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
but they are actually inaccessible to
 
06:19:53.990 --> 06:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
many people with gender dysphoria
 
06:19:55.750 --> 06:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
especially since trans individuals are
 
06:19:57.750 --> 06:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
more likely to experience poverty and
 
06:19:59.270 --> 06:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
less likely to have health insurance
 
06:20:01.430 --> 06:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
coverage you must intentionally seek
 
06:20:02.948 --> 06:20:02.958 align:start position:0%
this care out and you must be able to
 
06:20:05.708 --> 06:20:05.718 align:start position:0%
afford it those are two huge Turtles
 
06:20:07.270 --> 06:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
gender airic surgeries are rare in
 
06:20:10.190 --> 06:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
minors with 282 masectomy performed in
 
06:20:13.750 --> 06:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
2021 by contrast 20,000 people a year
 
06:20:16.230 --> 06:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
undergo treatment for male breast growth
 
06:20:18.350 --> 06:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
a study published in jamama Pediatrics
 
06:20:19.948 --> 06:20:19.958 align:start position:0%
medical journal researched the effects
 
06:20:22.030 --> 06:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
of female to male Top surgery on chest

non-binary adolescents and young adults
 
06:20:28.708 --> 06:20:28.718 align:start position:0%
it included 70 patients half of which
 
06:20:30.548 --> 06:20:30.558 align:start position:0%
underwent surgery and half of which did
 
06:20:32.788 --> 06:20:32.798 align:start position:0%
not this study found that gender
 
06:20:34.670 --> 06:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
affirming Top surgery across the board
 
06:20:36.990 --> 06:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
improved feelings of dysphoria gender

congruence and Body Image in young trans
 
06:20:40.628 --> 06:20:40.638 align:start position:0%
adults and that surgery complications
 
06:20:43.190 --> 06:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
were extremely minimal data has
 
06:20:44.708 --> 06:20:44.718 align:start position:0%
demonstrably proven that gender
 
06:20:46.590 --> 06:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
affirming surgeries not only have a low
 
06:20:48.110 --> 06:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
rate of regret but also one of the
 
06:20:49.948 --> 06:20:49.958 align:start position:0%
lowest rates of regret amongst all
 
06:20:52.750 --> 06:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
surgeries a total of 27 studies
 
06:20:54.390 --> 06:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
conducted by the American Society of
 
06:20:57.350 --> 06:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
plastic surgeons pulling
 
06:21:00.310 --> 06:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
7,928 transg transgender patients who
 
06:21:02.468 --> 06:21:02.478 align:start position:0%
underwent any type of gender affirming
 
06:21:04.590 --> 06:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
surgery concluded that the prevalence of
 
06:21:07.708 --> 06:21:07.718 align:start position:0%
regret after surgery was less than 1% in
 
06:21:09.110 --> 06:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
other words
 
06:21:11.548 --> 06:21:11.558 align:start position:0%
99.7% of trans individuals were
 
06:21:14.708 --> 06:21:14.718 align:start position:0%
satisfied with surgery meanwhile up to
 
06:21:16.990 --> 06:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
30% of individuals who undergo knee
 
06:21:20.030 --> 06:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
surgery experien regret up to 25% of
 
06:21:22.830 --> 06:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
people regret getting heart surgery 30%
 
06:21:24.948 --> 06:21:24.958 align:start position:0%
report regret after a prostate ectomy
 
06:21:24.958 --> 06:21:25.948 align:start position:0%
report regret after a prostate ectomy
and

06:21:25.948 --> 06:21:25.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:21:28.788 --> 06:21:28.798 align:start position:0%
19.5% express regret after a bariatric
 
06:21:31.510 --> 06:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
surgery yet all of these procedures are
 
06:21:33.708 --> 06:21:33.718 align:start position:0%
still legal when it comes to
 
06:21:36.070 --> 06:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
detransition according to 2022
 
06:21:38.310 --> 06:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
statistics only around 3% of trans
 
06:21:40.548 --> 06:21:40.558 align:start position:0%
people experience 15 seconds some form
 
06:21:42.830 --> 06:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
of regret but may not D transition
 
06:21:45.548 --> 06:21:45.558 align:start position:0%
conversely 97% of people who transition
 
06:21:47.628 --> 06:21:47.638 align:start position:0%
are happy with their decision I'll send
 
06:21:49.868 --> 06:21:49.878 align:start position:0%
more of these uh data points later to
 
06:21:52.430 --> 06:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
ensure you can understand them but only
 
06:21:55.110 --> 06:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
5% of people who detransitioned did so
 
06:21:56.590 --> 06:21:56.600 align:start position:0%
because they felt transition was not
 
06:21:59.910 --> 06:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
right for them that's 0 4% of all trans
 
06:22:02.948 --> 06:22:02.958 align:start position:0%
people we should not be changing laws
 
06:22:05.868 --> 06:22:05.878 align:start position:0%
based on the opinions of point 4% of a
 
06:22:09.468 --> 06:22:09.478 align:start position:0%
1% of the population okay thank you any
 
06:22:11.788 --> 06:22:11.798 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
06:22:14.350 --> 06:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you I wasn't writing fast
 
06:22:15.788 --> 06:22:15.798 align:start position:0%
enough so thank you for taking my
 
06:22:19.430 --> 06:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman um you
 
06:22:22.468 --> 06:22:22.478 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
06:22:27.150 --> 06:22:27.160 align:start position:0%
282 uh mastectomies for gender
 
06:22:30.190 --> 06:22:30.200 align:start position:0%
transition was that in state or is that
 
06:22:33.510 --> 06:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
nationally that was nationally okay and
 
06:22:35.910 --> 06:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
if I may have a followup follow up and
 
06:22:41.990 --> 06:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
what was the statistic for um reduction
 
06:22:45.070 --> 06:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
for um is it
 
06:22:47.270 --> 06:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
macromastia um for for male breast
 
06:22:52.430 --> 06:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
growth yes yes 20,000 people a year 20
 
06:22:55.150 --> 06:22:55.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much representative
 
06:22:57.948 --> 06:22:57.958 align:start position:0%
Kastle ring thank you Mr chair so I
 
06:22:59.708 --> 06:22:59.718 align:start position:0%
didn't hear it specifically did you say
 
06:23:02.788 --> 06:23:02.798 align:start position:0%
that these numbers were for people under
 
06:23:05.430 --> 06:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
the age of 18 for the um the
 
06:23:09.548 --> 06:23:09.558 align:start position:0%
mastectomies yes for the um for the uh
 
06:23:11.948 --> 06:23:11.958 align:start position:0%
for male surgery I'm not positive if
 
06:23:14.270 --> 06:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
that one was specific um but I will I'm
 
06:23:15.990 --> 06:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
going to send all of the um data I'm
 
06:23:17.190 --> 06:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
talking about in my testimony to the
 
06:23:17.200 --> 06:23:18.590 align:start position:0%
talking about in my testimony to the
committee

06:23:18.590 --> 06:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:23:21.190 --> 06:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
afterwards other
 
06:23:27.468 --> 06:23:27.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:29.708 --> 06:23:29.718 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is
 
06:23:44.030 --> 06:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:44.040 --> 06:23:47.788 align:start position:0%
 
thank

06:23:47.788 --> 06:23:47.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:50.190 --> 06:23:50.200 align:start position:0%
you there's a lot of testimony from
 
06:23:51.708 --> 06:23:51.718 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Health when we go through
 
06:23:51.718 --> 06:23:53.150 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Health when we go through
these

06:23:53.150 --> 06:23:53.160 align:start position:0%
these
 
06:23:56.430 --> 06:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
bills and they say a lot of things
 
06:23:58.628 --> 06:23:58.638 align:start position:0%
sometimes they say things don't
 
06:24:00.948 --> 06:24:00.958 align:start position:0%
happen well I wanted to just talk about
 
06:24:03.468 --> 06:24:03.478 align:start position:0%
something that I have seen myself with
 
06:24:05.910 --> 06:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
someone who is personally known to me
 
06:24:08.830 --> 06:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
and that would be a a girl who was about
 
06:24:11.150 --> 06:24:11.160 align:start position:0%
16 years old at the time and she had a
 
06:24:14.230 --> 06:24:14.240 align:start position:0%
double mastectomy it was um I consider
 
06:24:15.510 --> 06:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
it elective
 
06:24:19.468 --> 06:24:19.478 align:start position:0%
surgery myself because she had it in the
 
06:24:20.548 --> 06:24:20.558 align:start position:0%
process of
 
06:24:23.990 --> 06:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
transitioning she has detransitioned and
 
06:24:27.350 --> 06:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
has a child she would not be able to to
 
06:24:30.788 --> 06:24:30.798 align:start position:0%
breastfeed when I was a firsttime
 
06:24:30.798 --> 06:24:32.910 align:start position:0%
breastfeed when I was a firsttime
mom

06:24:32.910 --> 06:24:32.920 align:start position:0%
mom
 
06:24:35.868 --> 06:24:35.878 align:start position:0%
every uh Penny had to be watched very
 
06:24:39.750 --> 06:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
closely one thing that made life a lot
 
06:24:42.628 --> 06:24:42.638 align:start position:0%
better for myself and my CH my child was
 
06:24:44.350 --> 06:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
my ability to breastfeed it was much
 
06:24:46.468 --> 06:24:46.478 align:start position:0%
cheaper than using
 
06:24:48.670 --> 06:24:48.680 align:start position:0%
formula and there were a lot of times
 
06:24:50.830 --> 06:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
when I had to I was working full-time
 
06:24:52.708 --> 06:24:52.718 align:start position:0%
and a lot of times when I traveled for
 
06:24:55.230 --> 06:24:55.240 align:start position:0%
business and you couldn't you couldn't
 
06:24:56.910 --> 06:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
pump you were on the convention floor
 
06:24:56.920 --> 06:24:57.788 align:start position:0%
pump you were on the convention floor
all

06:24:57.788 --> 06:24:57.798 align:start position:0%
all
 
06:25:01.628 --> 06:25:01.638 align:start position:0%
day that was extremely painful and
 
06:25:04.628 --> 06:25:04.638 align:start position:0%
that's because you're
 
06:25:06.990 --> 06:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
you're used to nursing or pumping at a
 
06:25:09.590 --> 06:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
certain time and when you can't do that
 
06:25:10.590 --> 06:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
it's very
 
06:25:12.750 --> 06:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
painful I can only imagine what it's
 
06:25:14.590 --> 06:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
like for someone who has no way to
 
06:25:17.708 --> 06:25:17.718 align:start position:0%
relieve that no matter what after you
 
06:25:20.670 --> 06:25:20.680 align:start position:0%
have a a child your body does naturally
 
06:25:20.680 --> 06:25:22.990 align:start position:0%
have a a child your body does naturally
produce

06:25:22.990 --> 06:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
produce
 
06:25:25.270 --> 06:25:25.280 align:start position:0%
milk I would not like that I would not
 
06:25:27.468 --> 06:25:27.478 align:start position:0%
wish that on anyone I had some breast
 
06:25:30.708 --> 06:25:30.718 align:start position:0%
surgeries between my two children to
 
06:25:32.230 --> 06:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
remove tumors they turned out to be
 
06:25:33.990 --> 06:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
benign thankfully and then other times
 
06:25:36.150 --> 06:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
um other tumor that may not have been
 
06:25:36.160 --> 06:25:38.628 align:start position:0%
um other tumor that may not have been
benign

06:25:38.628 --> 06:25:38.638 align:start position:0%
benign
 
06:25:41.750 --> 06:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
but I wasn't able to nurse on one side
 
06:25:44.230 --> 06:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
it was a it made a big difference in my
 
06:25:46.948 --> 06:25:46.958 align:start position:0%
life and my ability to um take care of
 
06:25:50.110 --> 06:25:50.120 align:start position:0%
my child uh there are tremendous health
 
06:25:51.910 --> 06:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
benefits in
 
06:25:54.230 --> 06:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
breastfeeding uh I think
 
06:25:56.830 --> 06:25:56.840 align:start position:0%
that teenagers are too young to make
 
06:25:59.030 --> 06:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
these decisions we as a legislator have
 
06:26:01.190 --> 06:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
made decisions about teenagers we do it
 
06:26:02.868 --> 06:26:02.878 align:start position:0%
all the time that they're not allowed to
 
06:26:04.788 --> 06:26:04.798 align:start position:0%
buy scratch tickets they can't go to a
 
06:26:04.798 --> 06:26:06.350 align:start position:0%
buy scratch tickets they can't go to a
tanning

06:26:06.350 --> 06:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
tanning
 
06:26:09.548 --> 06:26:09.558 align:start position:0%
bed scratch tickets okay so if they're
 
06:26:11.390 --> 06:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
not allowed to buy scratch
 
06:26:13.830 --> 06:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
tickets this kind of surgery is also
 
06:26:14.990 --> 06:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
something that I think they're not
 
06:26:18.190 --> 06:26:18.200 align:start position:0%
mature enough for give it some time let
 
06:26:21.230 --> 06:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
them grow up thank you that's that's my

George hello
 
06:27:49.510 --> 06:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
again thank you for taking the time to
 
06:27:51.150 --> 06:27:51.160 align:start position:0%
listen to
 
06:27:54.510 --> 06:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
me I'm again not going to read my whole
 
06:27:57.230 --> 06:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
thing again because it's very similar to
 
06:27:59.150 --> 06:27:59.160 align:start position:0%
the last one but I will tell
 
06:28:02.270 --> 06:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
you that after my son started
 
06:28:03.788 --> 06:28:03.798 align:start position:0%
testosterone well first of all I'm going
 
06:28:05.230 --> 06:28:05.240 align:start position:0%
to tell you that I have permission from
 
06:28:09.230 --> 06:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
my 23-year-old son almost 24 to testify
 
06:28:12.548 --> 06:28:12.558 align:start position:0%
about this very very personal matter
 
06:28:15.910 --> 06:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
that is none of your businesses
 
06:28:21.030 --> 06:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
none but I will since you're forcing me
 
06:28:25.430 --> 06:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
to when my son after being on
 
06:28:28.510 --> 06:28:28.520 align:start position:0%
testosterone and puberty walkers for a
 
06:28:32.830 --> 06:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
couple of years he wanted to have what
 
06:28:35.030 --> 06:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
the transgender community refers to as
 
06:28:37.708 --> 06:28:37.718 align:start position:0%
Top surgery a double myectomy if if you
 
06:28:40.468 --> 06:28:40.478 align:start position:0%
want to be medical about
 
06:28:44.468 --> 06:28:44.478 align:start position:0%
it at first we were very
 
06:28:46.868 --> 06:28:46.878 align:start position:0%
hesitant it's a very very difficult
 
06:28:50.270 --> 06:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
decision to make as a parent for your
 
06:28:52.788 --> 06:28:52.798 align:start position:0%
child and it includes a lot of medical
 
06:28:55.430 --> 06:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
research in talking to your medical the
 
06:28:57.750 --> 06:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
medical doctors the therapists the
 
06:29:01.110 --> 06:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist and so on and at first we
 
06:29:05.110 --> 06:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
tried to ask to assuage him
 
06:29:07.628 --> 06:29:07.638 align:start position:0%
by allowing him to wear What's called a
 
06:29:07.638 --> 06:29:08.670 align:start position:0%
by allowing him to wear What's called a
breast

06:29:08.670 --> 06:29:08.680 align:start position:0%
breast
 
06:29:11.110 --> 06:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
binder I don't know if you guys have
 
06:29:14.070 --> 06:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
ever put one of those on it's similar to
 
06:29:18.190 --> 06:29:18.200 align:start position:0%
a sports bra but even more tighter it's
 
06:29:18.200 --> 06:29:20.310 align:start position:0%
a sports bra but even more tighter it's
extremely

06:29:20.310 --> 06:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
06:29:24.190 --> 06:29:24.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:26.750 --> 06:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
hot so we did this for a while and it
 
06:29:29.990 --> 06:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:31.868 --> 06:29:31.878 align:start position:0%
skin So
 
06:29:35.190 --> 06:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
eventually deciding that he knows who he
 
06:29:37.270 --> 06:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
is we've been doing this for several
 
06:29:37.280 --> 06:29:39.150 align:start position:0%
is we've been doing this for several
years

06:29:39.150 --> 06:29:39.160 align:start position:0%
years
 
06:29:41.708 --> 06:29:41.718 align:start position:0%
now we're going to allow him to do this
 
06:29:43.310 --> 06:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
and so we
 
06:29:46.868 --> 06:29:46.878 align:start position:0%
did he is now almost 24 years old he
 
06:29:50.468 --> 06:29:50.478 align:start position:0%
just graduated couple years ago from NYU
 
06:29:54.510 --> 06:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
Tish he's a successful thriving person
 
06:29:56.510 --> 06:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
and yes he doesn't have female breasts
 
06:29:59.468 --> 06:29:59.478 align:start position:0%
anymore because he is not a
 
06:30:02.628 --> 06:30:02.638 align:start position:0%
female he is male and he goes to the
 
06:30:04.750 --> 06:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
beach and he takes his shirt and yes he
 
06:30:07.310 --> 06:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
might have a few
 
06:30:11.628 --> 06:30:11.638 align:start position:0%
scars big deal he's happy he's thriving
 
06:30:14.670 --> 06:30:14.680 align:start position:0%
mind your own business and as for the
 
06:30:17.390 --> 06:30:17.400 align:start position:0%
person talking about breastfeeding not
 
06:30:20.510 --> 06:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
being able to breastfeed how stupid I'm
 
06:30:23.708 --> 06:30:23.718 align:start position:0%
a woman I tried to breastfeed it didn't
 
06:30:26.190 --> 06:30:26.200 align:start position:0%
work out so I switched to formula having
 
06:30:28.230 --> 06:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
being able to breastfeed is not all
 
06:30:32.628 --> 06:30:32.638 align:start position:0%
about being a woman or
 
06:30:37.350 --> 06:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:39.788 --> 06:30:39.798 align:start position:0%
okay moving

Courtney Tanner senior director of
 
06:31:02.388 --> 06:31:02.398 align:start position:0%
government relations at Dartmouth health
 
06:31:05.750 --> 06:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
and we are here to oppose um House Bill
 
06:31:09.628 --> 06:31:09.638 align:start position:0%
712 um as testified earlier we concerned
 
06:31:11.150 --> 06:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
about the interference with patient
 
06:31:13.948 --> 06:31:13.958 align:start position:0%
provider the patient provider uh
 
06:31:17.430 --> 06:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
relationship also have concerns about um
 
06:31:19.910 --> 06:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
access to Medical Care necessary medical
 
06:31:22.548 --> 06:31:22.558 align:start position:0%
care when we take a bill and codify the
 
06:31:24.788 --> 06:31:24.798 align:start position:0%
practice of medicine there was
 
06:31:27.070 --> 06:31:27.080 align:start position:0%
assertions made that um if there are
 
06:31:29.510 --> 06:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
exceptions that um need to be added to
 
06:31:32.868 --> 06:31:32.878 align:start position:0%
the bill later in time we can do that
 
06:31:35.070 --> 06:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
but we have we have
 
06:31:38.590 --> 06:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
concerns um in a broad brush way of when
 
06:31:41.150 --> 06:31:41.160 align:start position:0%
we when we codify medicine RIT large
 
06:31:44.990 --> 06:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
there are um there could be gaps in time
 
06:31:47.070 --> 06:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
where this legislative process takes
 
06:31:48.910 --> 06:31:48.920 align:start position:0%
time patients might need to access care
 
06:31:51.430 --> 06:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
in that time and so um always think that
 
06:31:54.230 --> 06:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
it's uh uh very dangerous to legislate
 
06:31:56.990 --> 06:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
medicine at large
 
06:32:02.468 --> 06:32:02.478 align:start position:0%
um we also have concerns about uh a the
 
06:32:04.388 --> 06:32:04.398 align:start position:0%
inability for a provider to prefer this
 
06:32:06.788 --> 06:32:06.798 align:start position:0%
type of care here in New Hampshire we
 
06:32:09.468 --> 06:32:09.478 align:start position:0%
actually don't provide Top surgery for
 
06:32:13.750 --> 06:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
minors so um while the vast majority of
 
06:32:15.628 --> 06:32:15.638 align:start position:0%
the bill wouldn't impact access to care
 
06:32:17.430 --> 06:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
for patients in New Hampshire right now
 
06:32:19.230 --> 06:32:19.240 align:start position:0%
we do have referrals for the this
 
06:32:20.788 --> 06:32:20.798 align:start position:0%
patient population that are referred to
 
06:32:23.708 --> 06:32:23.718 align:start position:0%
out of state so um we would be concerned
 
06:32:25.990 --> 06:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
about access to care for the very very
 
06:32:27.948 --> 06:32:27.958 align:start position:0%
very small number of patients who need
 
06:32:29.628 --> 06:32:29.638 align:start position:0%
referrals for this type of care that
 
06:32:31.590 --> 06:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
receive this type of care out outside of
 
06:32:34.030 --> 06:32:34.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I am happy to take
 
06:32:34.040 --> 06:32:36.190 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I am happy to take
questions

06:32:36.190 --> 06:32:36.200 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:32:38.948 --> 06:32:38.958 align:start position:0%
um that that's simple testimony uh
 
06:32:41.510 --> 06:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
chairman McDonald thank you very much
 
06:32:43.830 --> 06:32:43.840 align:start position:0%

06:32:45.868 --> 06:32:45.878 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you very much and thank you
 
06:32:47.990 --> 06:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question harking back to
 
06:32:50.270 --> 06:32:50.280 align:start position:0%
the uh Workforce concerns that we had in
 
06:32:52.670 --> 06:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
the earlier bill can you see anything in
 
06:32:55.190 --> 06:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
this bill which might impact the
 
06:32:58.548 --> 06:32:58.558 align:start position:0%
decision of somebody who provides this
 
06:32:59.868 --> 06:32:59.878 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
06:33:03.070 --> 06:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
surgery uh from that that might deter
 
06:33:04.628 --> 06:33:04.638 align:start position:0%
them from coming to the
 
06:33:08.708 --> 06:33:08.718 align:start position:0%
state and thus providing surgery not not
 
06:33:11.270 --> 06:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
to the very few but to the many who need
 
06:33:12.948 --> 06:33:12.958 align:start position:0%
them right so I think you're referring
 
06:33:16.070 --> 06:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
to patients who are over 18 and older um
 
06:33:18.310 --> 06:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
so yeah we would have concerns about um
 
06:33:20.750 --> 06:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
P providers who are providing gender
 
06:33:23.150 --> 06:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
affirming care for the adult population
 
06:33:25.548 --> 06:33:25.558 align:start position:0%
um who may be concerned about providing
 
06:33:27.270 --> 06:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
that type of care here in New Hampshire
 
06:33:28.948 --> 06:33:28.958 align:start position:0%
we also would have concerns about again
 
06:33:32.110 --> 06:33:32.120 align:start position:0%
that Peds and Endo um chronologist
 
06:33:35.430 --> 06:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
Specialty Care providers who um would
 
06:33:38.350 --> 06:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
have concerns about their ability to uh
 
06:33:39.948 --> 06:33:39.958 align:start position:0%
provide their patients with a warm
 
06:33:41.868 --> 06:33:41.878 align:start position:0%
handoff for care that they needed
 
06:33:43.948 --> 06:33:43.958 align:start position:0%
outside the state of New Hampshire this
 
06:33:46.788 --> 06:33:46.798 align:start position:0%
is um uh it's scary when the legislature
 
06:33:48.948 --> 06:33:48.958 align:start position:0%
starts to criminalize and penalize
 
06:33:52.230 --> 06:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
practice of medicine even a referral
 
06:33:55.230 --> 06:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
thereof other
 
06:34:00.070 --> 06:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:02.910 --> 06:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
you Al also signed up to speak is
 
06:34:04.388 --> 06:34:04.398 align:start position:0%
Katherine uh
 
06:34:17.830 --> 06:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:20.110 --> 06:34:20.120 align:start position:0%
time can you just turn on your
 
06:34:23.590 --> 06:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
mic there we go okay honorable members
 
06:34:25.190 --> 06:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Katherine
 
06:34:27.350 --> 06:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
sarus and I am a Performing Artist and
 
06:34:30.388 --> 06:34:30.398 align:start position:0%
educator I urge you today to pass this
 
06:34:34.708 --> 06:34:34.718 align:start position:0%
bill HB 712 during my early puberty I
 
06:34:37.230 --> 06:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
would often lie on my chest hoping and
 
06:34:38.948 --> 06:34:38.958 align:start position:0%
praying that I could keep my breasts
 
06:34:43.388 --> 06:34:43.398 align:start position:0%
from growing or um forming as a survival
 
06:34:45.190 --> 06:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
of childhood sexual assault I was
 
06:34:47.590 --> 06:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
terrified of becoming a woman I viewed
 
06:34:50.110 --> 06:34:50.120 align:start position:0%
being a woman as making me vulnerable to
 
06:34:53.310 --> 06:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
further sexual assault moreover because
 
06:34:55.708 --> 06:34:55.718 align:start position:0%
I had a dream of becoming a dancer I was
 
06:34:57.310 --> 06:34:57.320 align:start position:0%
convinced that I needed to lose weight
 
06:34:59.750 --> 06:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
and have a flat chest because within the
 
06:35:01.708 --> 06:35:01.718 align:start position:0%
classical Dance World emaciated
 
06:35:04.310 --> 06:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
prepubescent looking dancers were and
 
06:35:07.388 --> 06:35:07.398 align:start position:0%
still mostly are the ideal as a
 
06:35:10.070 --> 06:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
10-year-old I managed to lose 20 pounds
 
06:35:12.150 --> 06:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
in 10 weeks through self-
 
06:35:14.510 --> 06:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
starvation and I experienced routine
 
06:35:17.590 --> 06:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
suicidal ideation I've already expressed
 
06:35:20.270 --> 06:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
in my previous testimony how I weathered
 
06:35:22.548 --> 06:35:22.558 align:start position:0%
the storm of puberty and was able to
 
06:35:24.948 --> 06:35:24.958 align:start position:0%
heal from the trauma and the childhood
 
06:35:27.830 --> 06:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
sexual assault that I experienced the
 
06:35:29.788 --> 06:35:29.798 align:start position:0%
reason that you don't see more
 
06:35:31.990 --> 06:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
detransitioners and desisters coming
 
06:35:35.310 --> 06:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
forward isn't because they don't exist
 
06:35:36.990 --> 06:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
it's because standing up here in front
 
06:35:41.388 --> 06:35:41.398 align:start position:0%
of you is really hard every time any of
 
06:35:43.948 --> 06:35:43.958 align:start position:0%
us come and tell you a part of our story
 
06:35:47.230 --> 06:35:47.240 align:start position:0%
we have to relive part of that
 
06:35:50.150 --> 06:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
trauma it's absolutely impossible for
 
06:35:52.948 --> 06:35:52.958 align:start position:0%
many of these people because I I tell
 
06:35:54.910 --> 06:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
you I'm from the dance Community right
 
06:35:57.990 --> 06:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
and it's a hot bed of lgbtqia plus
 
06:36:00.708 --> 06:36:00.718 align:start position:0%
ideology I have listened for over 15
 
06:36:02.830 --> 06:36:02.840 align:start position:0%
years to the stories of my colleagues
 
06:36:04.110 --> 06:36:04.120 align:start position:0%
and co-workers
 
06:36:06.430 --> 06:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
many of them my dearest
 
06:36:10.830 --> 06:36:10.840 align:start position:0%
friends so many heart-rending stories of
 
06:36:14.590 --> 06:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
childhood drama sometimes inflicted by
 
06:36:14.600 --> 06:36:17.468 align:start position:0%
childhood drama sometimes inflicted by
their

06:36:17.468 --> 06:36:17.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:20.468 --> 06:36:20.478 align:start position:0%
parents it's really really
 
06:36:23.628 --> 06:36:23.638 align:start position:0%
important that you guys don't allow this
 
06:36:25.750 --> 06:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
kind of Mutilation of the body to
 
06:36:28.430 --> 06:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
continue to minors when people are
 
06:36:30.150 --> 06:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
adults they have their own ideas they
 
06:36:31.670 --> 06:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
can change their bodies however they
 
06:36:35.350 --> 06:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
want when we are children we should be
 
06:36:37.788 --> 06:36:37.798 align:start position:0%
protected and we're looking to you the
 
06:36:40.590 --> 06:36:40.600 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire is looking to you
 
06:36:43.670 --> 06:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
the next generation is looking to you
 
06:36:46.510 --> 06:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
are you going to protect these
 
06:36:48.750 --> 06:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
girls or are they just going to be a
 
06:36:48.760 --> 06:36:51.230 align:start position:0%
girls or are they just going to be a
casualty

06:36:51.230 --> 06:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
casualty
 
06:36:54.270 --> 06:36:54.280 align:start position:0%
again we've fought so hard to get to
 
06:36:57.788 --> 06:36:57.798 align:start position:0%
being having equality in sports to being
 
06:37:00.190 --> 06:37:00.200 align:start position:0%
able to be the women that we are to
 
06:37:03.070 --> 06:37:03.080 align:start position:0%
having women serving here in this room
 
06:37:06.110 --> 06:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
are you really ready to now Rob us I
 
06:37:07.670 --> 06:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
can't tell you how many times I go into
 
06:37:11.310 --> 06:37:11.320 align:start position:0%
an audition and the boys get like seven
 
06:37:13.628 --> 06:37:13.638 align:start position:0%
times that they're shown the the the
 
06:37:14.990 --> 06:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
combination and I'm shown the
 
06:37:17.150 --> 06:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
combination one time and then there's a
 
06:37:19.270 --> 06:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
guy who wants to do my part and put on
 
06:37:23.110 --> 06:37:23.120 align:start position:0%
my point shoes like I'm already 103
 
06:37:26.590 --> 06:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
girls to seven boys down 15 seconds so
 
06:37:29.350 --> 06:37:29.360 align:start position:0%
in short I just really want you to
 
06:37:32.110 --> 06:37:32.120 align:start position:0%

06:37:58.628 --> 06:37:58.638 align:start position:0%

herzler good afternoon my name is Seth

06:38:26.510 --> 06:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
21-year-old transgender man and I vly v
 
06:38:30.708 --> 06:38:30.718 align:start position:0%
I oppose this bill um I understand uh
 
06:38:32.670 --> 06:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
Lisa merer that you are the primary
 
06:38:35.310 --> 06:38:35.320 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill I request that you
 
06:38:36.388 --> 06:38:36.398 align:start position:0%
please address your comments to the
 
06:38:38.670 --> 06:38:38.680 align:start position:0%
committee as a whole okay yes but I
 
06:38:42.628 --> 06:38:42.638 align:start position:0%
request that you listen to what um the
 
06:38:44.590 --> 06:38:44.600 align:start position:0%
people that would be affected by this
 
06:38:48.868 --> 06:38:48.878 align:start position:0%
bill have to say like genuinely listen
 
06:38:51.750 --> 06:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
um I had a double mastectomy when I was
 
06:38:54.430 --> 06:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
16 we paid for it out of pocket after
 
06:38:57.510 --> 06:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
losing a year-long battle with insurance
 
06:39:00.670 --> 06:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
I assure you that I was told at every
 
06:39:03.708 --> 06:39:03.718 align:start position:0%
possible juncture about the risks I was
 
06:39:05.830 --> 06:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
not pushed into getting surgery in fact
 
06:39:08.590 --> 06:39:08.600 align:start position:0%
it was an uphill battle the entire time
 
06:39:10.590 --> 06:39:10.600 align:start position:0%
but when I woke up tired and in pain
 
06:39:12.750 --> 06:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
after my surgery I did not regret it and
 
06:39:14.548 --> 06:39:14.558 align:start position:0%
I have not regretted it in the 5 years
 
06:39:17.030 --> 06:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
since you are not proposing protections
 
06:39:18.548 --> 06:39:18.558 align:start position:0%
for children with this bill you are
 
06:39:20.708 --> 06:39:20.718 align:start position:0%
simply harming them your exception to
 
06:39:24.868 --> 06:39:24.878 align:start position:0%
the rule written out in chapter 3
 
06:39:28.468 --> 06:39:28.478 align:start position:0%
32 um M makes this painfully clear you
 
06:39:31.190 --> 06:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
allow for male circumcision surgery for
 
06:39:35.868 --> 06:39:35.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:39:38.788 --> 06:39:38.798 align:start position:0%
surgery on minor miners with disorders
 
06:39:40.990 --> 06:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
of sex development among others these
 
06:39:43.510 --> 06:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
are all gender affirming care fathers
 
06:39:45.070 --> 06:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
choose to circumcise their babies
 
06:39:47.150 --> 06:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
because it conforms to their perception
 
06:39:49.750 --> 06:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
of what a man's body ought to look like
 
06:39:53.910 --> 06:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
men and boys with gamasa chasa remove
 
06:39:56.468 --> 06:39:56.478 align:start position:0%
excess brush tissue for the same reason
 
06:39:58.510 --> 06:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
parents can sent to surgeries for their
 
06:40:00.350 --> 06:40:00.360 align:start position:0%
intersex newborns because they want
 
06:40:02.070 --> 06:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
their baby to conform to the
 
06:40:03.990 --> 06:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
expectations about the
 
06:40:07.750 --> 06:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
conflation of sex and gender these are
 
06:40:10.270 --> 06:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
surgeries why are these surgeries often
 
06:40:12.510 --> 06:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
done without the child's consent okay
 
06:40:14.788 --> 06:40:14.798 align:start position:0%
but a child a trans adolescent deciding
 
06:40:17.030 --> 06:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
to get Top surgery is
 
06:40:19.270 --> 06:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
not thank you for your time and have a
 
06:40:23.628 --> 06:40:23.638 align:start position:0%
good day thank you any
 
06:40:27.430 --> 06:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank
 
06:40:38.590 --> 06:40:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:40.468 --> 06:40:40.478 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
06:40:42.868 --> 06:40:42.878 align:start position:0%
again I've been testifying in a number
 
06:40:45.150 --> 06:40:45.160 align:start position:0%
of States including that in my home
 
06:40:49.388 --> 06:40:49.398 align:start position:0%
state of Indiana and so I wanted to make
 
06:40:51.590 --> 06:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
the committee aware of this anecdote
 
06:40:53.110 --> 06:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
which is not only in Indiana because
 
06:40:56.230 --> 06:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
I've I've heard similar cases from uh
 
06:40:58.910 --> 06:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
many different states and uh Jamie might
 
06:41:02.110 --> 06:41:02.120 align:start position:0%
be able to validate this as well um when
 
06:41:04.030 --> 06:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
I was giving testimony on a similar bill
 
06:41:07.270 --> 06:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
in Indiana that prohibited all
 
06:41:08.670 --> 06:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
clinicians from doing these types of
 
06:41:11.670 --> 06:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
procedures on children uh one of the
 
06:41:14.990 --> 06:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
heads the co-heads of the Riley
 
06:41:16.750 --> 06:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
Children's Medical Center in
 
06:41:19.708 --> 06:41:19.718 align:start position:0%
Indianapolis gave testimony that none of
 
06:41:22.270 --> 06:41:22.280 align:start position:0%
these surgeries were happening in the
 
06:41:26.350 --> 06:41:26.360 align:start position:0%
state I had independently been told uh I
 
06:41:27.430 --> 06:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
had no evidence but I'd been
 
06:41:29.270 --> 06:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
independently told by other sources that
 
06:41:30.670 --> 06:41:30.680 align:start position:0%
they were doing these surgeries in the
 
06:41:33.990 --> 06:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
state so after testimony and we went
 
06:41:36.310 --> 06:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
into the hallway I approached the other
 
06:41:38.150 --> 06:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
doctor who was the co-head of the clinic
 
06:41:42.270 --> 06:41:42.280 align:start position:0%
at the time and I said I've heard other
 
06:41:44.990 --> 06:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
evidence that they are doing uh double
 
06:41:47.628 --> 06:41:47.638 align:start position:0%
masectomy on girls in this state can you
 
06:41:51.070 --> 06:41:51.080 align:start position:0%
can you tell me why I've heard that and
 
06:41:53.468 --> 06:41:53.478 align:start position:0%
he said well you know we're not we're
 
06:41:57.350 --> 06:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
not doing gender affirming care but if
 
06:42:00.070 --> 06:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
these girls get referrals to surgeons
 
06:42:02.350 --> 06:42:02.360 align:start position:0%
and they do a little breast reduction
 
06:42:04.590 --> 06:42:04.600 align:start position:0%
that really has nothing to do with
 
06:42:08.150 --> 06:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
us uh in my own history I have had
 
06:42:10.910 --> 06:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
doctors um before before this was
 
06:42:12.548 --> 06:42:12.558 align:start position:0%
considered a field transgender medicine
 
06:42:14.030 --> 06:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
and what I was doing was considered a
 
06:42:16.868 --> 06:42:16.878 align:start position:0%
lot more uh subversive I had
 
06:42:20.230 --> 06:42:20.240 align:start position:0%
endocrinologists who would use false ICD
 
06:42:24.510 --> 06:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
codes to describe my care so as to avoid
 
06:42:26.070 --> 06:42:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh any problems with the insurance
 
06:42:28.708 --> 06:42:28.718 align:start position:0%
companies so my ICD code would have been
 
06:42:31.910 --> 06:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
listed as other endocrine condition uh
 
06:42:33.708 --> 06:42:33.718 align:start position:0%
likewise these girl who are being
 
06:42:36.788 --> 06:42:36.798 align:start position:0%
referred to breast reduction surgery uh
 
06:42:39.628 --> 06:42:39.638 align:start position:0%
coincidentally that they are patients of
 
06:42:42.510 --> 06:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care clinics are very
 
06:42:46.070 --> 06:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
likely being coated to have breast
 
06:42:48.670 --> 06:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
reductions when in fact they are having
 
06:42:52.070 --> 06:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
uh gender affirming double masectomy so
 
06:42:55.708 --> 06:42:55.718 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to make you aware of that
 
06:42:59.468 --> 06:42:59.478 align:start position:0%
because the the people who are who are
 
06:43:02.468 --> 06:43:02.478 align:start position:0%
providing these types of procedures know
 
06:43:04.310 --> 06:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
they have a place book on how to hide
 
06:43:06.830 --> 06:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
the ball so that they can either get
 
06:43:09.788 --> 06:43:09.798 align:start position:0%
around legislation or that they can get
 
06:43:09.798 --> 06:43:10.868 align:start position:0%
around legislation or that they can get
around

06:43:10.868 --> 06:43:10.878 align:start position:0%
around
 
06:43:12.868 --> 06:43:12.878 align:start position:0%
Regulators uh if it's happening in
 
06:43:16.548 --> 06:43:16.558 align:start position:0%
Indiana Midwest fly over country um it's
 
06:43:18.590 --> 06:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
not a surprise to me at all if it's
 
06:43:20.388 --> 06:43:20.398 align:start position:0%
happening in a state that is the
 
06:43:23.388 --> 06:43:23.398 align:start position:0%
neighbor of one of the largest child
 
06:43:26.468 --> 06:43:26.478 align:start position:0%
gender clinics in the country thank you
 
06:43:29.430 --> 06:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
06:43:33.788 --> 06:43:33.798 align:start position:0%
Drew thank you Mr chairman Corey as an
 
06:43:37.270 --> 06:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
adult who clearly has transitioned as
 
06:43:40.830 --> 06:43:40.840 align:start position:0%
far as one can go would you tell a young
 
06:43:43.190 --> 06:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
child that they can successfully
 
06:43:43.200 --> 06:43:45.070 align:start position:0%
child that they can successfully
transition

06:43:45.070 --> 06:43:45.080 align:start position:0%
transition
 
06:43:48.708 --> 06:43:48.718 align:start position:0%
uh uh representative uh transition to
 
06:43:48.718 --> 06:43:52.628 align:start position:0%
uh uh representative uh transition to
what

06:43:52.628 --> 06:43:52.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:56.310 --> 06:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
please transitioned uh from male to
 
06:43:59.750 --> 06:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
female from male to female um one cannot
 
06:44:01.788 --> 06:44:01.798 align:start position:0%
change sex one can have a number of
 
06:44:03.868 --> 06:44:03.878 align:start position:0%
procedures to create the
 
06:44:05.628 --> 06:44:05.638 align:start position:0%
the appearance The Superficial
 
06:44:09.190 --> 06:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
appearance of changing sex uh although
 
06:44:10.628 --> 06:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
as we're seeing more and more some of
 
06:44:13.190 --> 06:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
these procedures uh for the double
 
06:44:15.708 --> 06:44:15.718 align:start position:0%
masectomy uh have additional
 
06:44:17.948 --> 06:44:17.958 align:start position:0%
modifications I saw a photo of a girl
 
06:44:19.868 --> 06:44:19.878 align:start position:0%
recently who had her nipples fashioned
 
06:44:23.070 --> 06:44:23.080 align:start position:0%
into Hearts so uh that's I wouldn't call
 
06:44:24.910 --> 06:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
that uh to try to transition to the
 
06:44:29.868 --> 06:44:29.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:34.948 --> 06:44:34.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:37.830 --> 06:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you oh sorry
 
06:44:37.840 --> 06:44:39.510 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you oh sorry
representative

06:44:39.510 --> 06:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:44:43.150 --> 06:44:43.160 align:start position:0%
damus thank you Mr chairman um Do You
 
06:44:45.548 --> 06:44:45.558 align:start position:0%
Believe minors should be allowed uh to
 
06:44:47.868 --> 06:44:47.878 align:start position:0%
have surgical interventions related to
 
06:44:47.878 --> 06:44:49.468 align:start position:0%
have surgical interventions related to
their

06:44:49.468 --> 06:44:49.478 align:start position:0%
their
 
06:44:53.310 --> 06:44:53.320 align:start position:0%
gender surgical interventions for gender
 
06:44:56.270 --> 06:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
uh this is this is one of the weirdest
 
06:44:59.270 --> 06:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
conundrums for all of us to face which
 
06:45:02.388 --> 06:45:02.398 align:start position:0%
is that if you believe that you're
 
06:45:04.750 --> 06:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
authentic self is more feminine in your
 
06:45:08.468 --> 06:45:08.478 align:start position:0%
male or masculine in your woman then for
 
06:45:10.548 --> 06:45:10.558 align:start position:0%
some reason these surgeries are supposed
 
06:45:13.910 --> 06:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
to somehow confirmed that so if if you
 
06:45:16.548 --> 06:45:16.558 align:start position:0%
are already authentically suppose we
 
06:45:19.750 --> 06:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
take the uh presumption that that
 
06:45:22.070 --> 06:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
somebody does really identify as the
 
06:45:23.910 --> 06:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
opposite gender let's just take that
 
06:45:26.468 --> 06:45:26.478 align:start position:0%
sincerely uh there shouldn't be a need
 
06:45:29.430 --> 06:45:29.440 align:start position:0%
for additional surgical modifications to
 
06:45:33.270 --> 06:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
make that any truer or more factual than
 
06:45:34.510 --> 06:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
the assertion it doesn't it doesn't
 
06:45:36.750 --> 06:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
build on the assertion so really what
 
06:45:40.190 --> 06:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
we're doing is providing uh
 
06:45:44.230 --> 06:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
surgical uh affirmations to somebody's
 
06:45:46.750 --> 06:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
identity and I don't I don't know of any
 
06:45:48.670 --> 06:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
other use of medicine where we affirm
 
06:45:54.230 --> 06:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:45:56.948 --> 06:45:56.958 align:start position:0%
medically other
 
06:45:59.030 --> 06:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
questions okay I think it's safe this
 
06:46:03.110 --> 06:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:13.548 --> 06:46:13.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:15.670 --> 06:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
banama uh hello once again I just like
 
06:46:16.990 --> 06:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
to say that I had to write my legal name
 
06:46:18.468 --> 06:46:18.478 align:start position:0%
just because this is the legal setting
 
06:46:19.628 --> 06:46:19.638 align:start position:0%
uh but I would prefer that to be
 
06:46:21.388 --> 06:46:21.398 align:start position:0%
referred to by Oliver in future like
 
06:46:22.750 --> 06:46:22.760 align:start position:0%
questions I understand you just rating
 
06:46:25.350 --> 06:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
what I put I have no um issue with that
 
06:46:26.708 --> 06:46:26.718 align:start position:0%
um so I'd just like to start by the
 
06:46:28.270 --> 06:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
people who are saying that sex is binary
 
06:46:29.548 --> 06:46:29.558 align:start position:0%
it's actually not it's a bimodal
 
06:46:31.150 --> 06:46:31.160 align:start position:0%
distribution which essentially means
 
06:46:33.350 --> 06:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
that there are right it's on spectrum
 
06:46:34.830 --> 06:46:34.840 align:start position:0%
and there are two main categories people
 
06:46:36.548 --> 06:46:36.558 align:start position:0%
tend to fall into one certain range that
 
06:46:37.830 --> 06:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
we consider male and one certain range
 
06:46:39.388 --> 06:46:39.398 align:start position:0%
that we consider female the range in
 
06:46:41.190 --> 06:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
hormone levels the difference in various
 
06:46:42.868 --> 06:46:42.878 align:start position:0%
secondary sex characteristics are all
 
06:46:44.590 --> 06:46:44.600 align:start position:0%
examples of the fact that sex is in fact
 
06:46:47.788 --> 06:46:47.798 align:start position:0%
not a strict binary um I'd like to just
 
06:46:49.708 --> 06:46:49.718 align:start position:0%
address real quick the kind of people
 
06:46:50.628 --> 06:46:50.638 align:start position:0%
we're talking about so we're talking
 
06:46:52.510 --> 06:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
about people so the medium age for these
 
06:46:53.628 --> 06:46:53.638 align:start position:0%
surgeries this is according to the
 
06:46:55.388 --> 06:46:55.398 align:start position:0%
National Institute of Health by the way
 
06:46:56.910 --> 06:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
um the median age of these people is
 
06:46:59.628 --> 06:46:59.638 align:start position:0%
17.1 and the mean age is 16.9 so these
 
06:47:02.590 --> 06:47:02.600 align:start position:0%
people are very well close to adulthood
 
06:47:02.600 --> 06:47:03.350 align:start position:0%
people are very well close to adulthood
um

06:47:03.350 --> 06:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:47:05.270 --> 06:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
they also have had to have prevalence of
 
06:47:07.110 --> 06:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
dysphoria and diagnosis for four years
 
06:47:09.350 --> 06:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
as well as significant counseling um for
 
06:47:10.230 --> 06:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
those who are saying this is
 
06:47:11.830 --> 06:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
experimental this surgery has existed
 
06:47:12.830 --> 06:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
since the
 
06:47:15.388 --> 06:47:15.398 align:start position:0%
1930s um and this is only a surgery
 
06:47:19.070 --> 06:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
that's happening to point quote uh to 0
 
06:47:23.150 --> 06:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
2% not even uh children who are trans um
 
06:47:25.190 --> 06:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
there is a 0% rate of people attempting
 
06:47:27.270 --> 06:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
to reverse these Ser surgeries and they
 
06:47:30.468 --> 06:47:30.478 align:start position:0%
have a 90% success rate um in reducing
 
06:47:32.830 --> 06:47:32.840 align:start position:0%
suicidality and depression um compared
 
06:47:35.270 --> 06:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
compared to 20% for anti-depressants um
 
06:47:36.788 --> 06:47:36.798 align:start position:0%
the decrease in depression specifically
 
06:47:39.310 --> 06:47:39.320 align:start position:0%
diagnoses went from 68 to 44 and anxiety
 
06:47:40.948 --> 06:47:40.958 align:start position:0%
from 70 to
 
06:47:44.750 --> 06:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
44% um the median regret rate on the 100
 
06:47:48.070 --> 06:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
point scale was Zero um and additionally
 
06:47:49.628 --> 06:47:49.638 align:start position:0%
according to the American Society of
 
06:47:52.110 --> 06:47:52.120 align:start position:0%
plastic surgeons uh the to in order to
 
06:47:54.430 --> 06:47:54.440 align:start position:0%
access these surgeries they must have uh
 
06:47:56.070 --> 06:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
persistent documented distress informed
 
06:47:58.990 --> 06:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
consent and only before are these
 
06:48:00.468 --> 06:48:00.478 align:start position:0%
surgeries are only performed under the
 
06:48:02.510 --> 06:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
age of majority when delaying surgery
 
06:48:05.750 --> 06:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
would cause notable harm to the patient
 
06:48:07.110 --> 06:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
um so I'd like to just note that these
 
06:48:08.830 --> 06:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
are happening on an extremely rare basis
 
06:48:10.388 --> 06:48:10.398 align:start position:0%
is in the case where this child very
 
06:48:11.990 --> 06:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
often will not survive or will not
 
06:48:14.070 --> 06:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
survive very well to the age of
 
06:48:15.388 --> 06:48:15.398 align:start position:0%
adulthood when they would typically get
 
06:48:17.910 --> 06:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
these surgeries um I'd also like to
 
06:48:20.388 --> 06:48:20.398 align:start position:0%
bring up earlier how we t uh the the
 
06:48:22.468 --> 06:48:22.478 align:start position:0%
treatment of intersex children and
 
06:48:24.510 --> 06:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
circumcision is not brought up and this
 
06:48:26.670 --> 06:48:26.680 align:start position:0%
would more be re relevant to uh previous
 
06:48:28.110 --> 06:48:28.120 align:start position:0%
genitalia bills that have attempted to
 
06:48:30.788 --> 06:48:30.798 align:start position:0%
be passed um but those are not excluded
 
06:48:32.910 --> 06:48:32.920 align:start position:0%
in this bill which I find uh intriguing
 
06:48:34.230 --> 06:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
given it specifically seems to be
 
06:48:35.430 --> 06:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
transgender youth that you were
 
06:48:38.110 --> 06:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
targeting rather than the larger issue
 
06:48:40.030 --> 06:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
of for example CIS girls getting breast
 
06:48:41.750 --> 06:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
augmentation which actually has a much
 
06:48:43.110 --> 06:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
higher regret rate again which has
 
06:48:45.670 --> 06:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
already been stated um I'd also like to
 
06:48:48.628 --> 06:48:48.638 align:start position:0%
bring up the fact that um the majority
 
06:48:50.948 --> 06:48:50.958 align:start position:0%
of people who are trans um and go
 
06:48:52.270 --> 06:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
through these surgeries again have very
 
06:48:54.430 --> 06:48:54.440 align:start position:0%
low regret rates um and I'd also like to
 
06:48:57.990 --> 06:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
bring up the uh um descriptions of such
 
06:48:59.430 --> 06:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
treatment as child abuse I will be
 
06:49:01.030 --> 06:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
quoting my mother here who has a
 
06:49:03.030 --> 06:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
doctorate in Psychology and does trauma
 
06:49:04.350 --> 06:49:04.360 align:start position:0%
informed trainings and did her
 
06:49:07.190 --> 06:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
dissertation on gender and child abuse
 
06:49:09.150 --> 06:49:09.160 align:start position:0%
um so this is going by the state
 
06:49:10.868 --> 06:49:10.878 align:start position:0%
definition of child abuse it is harm
 
06:49:13.788 --> 06:49:13.798 align:start position:0%
inflicted Upon a Child um it tends it
 
06:49:15.310 --> 06:49:15.320 align:start position:0%
does psychological harm to the welfare
 
06:49:16.230 --> 06:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
of that
 
06:49:18.670 --> 06:49:18.680 align:start position:0%
child yep the research will show that
 
06:49:20.230 --> 06:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
transgender children who receive support
 
06:49:21.628 --> 06:49:21.638 align:start position:0%
from their caregivers including medical
 
06:49:23.030 --> 06:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
transition have better psychological
 
06:49:25.230 --> 06:49:25.240 align:start position:0%
outcomes contrary to the definition of
 
06:49:27.150 --> 06:49:27.160 align:start position:0%
psychological abuse and I'd also just
 
06:49:29.468 --> 06:49:29.478 align:start position:0%
like to add one last thing um the people
 
06:49:31.468 --> 06:49:31.478 align:start position:0%
who were saying the dsm5 just involved
 
06:49:33.910 --> 06:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
um how you perform gender and like the
 
06:49:35.388 --> 06:49:35.398 align:start position:0%
toys you play with that's just not true
 
06:49:36.708 --> 06:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
it's a market in congruence between
 
06:49:38.788 --> 06:49:38.798 align:start position:0%
one's uh experienced gender and primary
 
06:49:40.990 --> 06:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
and secondary sex characteristics and
 
06:49:42.590 --> 06:49:42.600 align:start position:0%
desire to move against those thank you
 
06:49:44.270 --> 06:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
very much does anyone have any questions
 
06:49:45.788 --> 06:49:45.798 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions representative
 
06:49:48.230 --> 06:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
Weber I just wanted to be sure thank you
 
06:49:49.948 --> 06:49:49.958 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and thank you Mr
 
06:49:51.868 --> 06:49:51.878 align:start position:0%
chairman I just wanted to be sure that I
 
06:49:53.548 --> 06:49:53.558 align:start position:0%
understood the statistics you were
 
06:49:56.670 --> 06:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
quoting on the median age of 17.1 and
 
06:50:00.030 --> 06:50:00.040 align:start position:0%
the mean of 16.9 that is the median and
 
06:50:03.990 --> 06:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
the mean matically among the very small
 
06:50:06.670 --> 06:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
percentage of minors who have breast
 
06:50:09.388 --> 06:50:09.398 align:start position:0%
surgery yes who like act specifically
 
06:50:10.990 --> 06:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
gender affirming care that is the mean
 
06:50:13.350 --> 06:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
and median age like mathematically okay
 
06:50:15.350 --> 06:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah representative Kastle
 
06:50:17.548 --> 06:50:17.558 align:start position:0%
rang thank you Mr chair so I was trying
 
06:50:19.548 --> 06:50:19.558 align:start position:0%
to follow you just to make sure I
 
06:50:22.070 --> 06:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
understood everything so you specified
 
06:50:25.230 --> 06:50:25.240 align:start position:0%
in there that about death for people
 
06:50:26.670 --> 06:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
that so you said something about death
 
06:50:28.910 --> 06:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
that doesn't happen for based on getting
 
06:50:30.750 --> 06:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
care I don't know if you remember what
 
06:50:32.750 --> 06:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
you said I don't believe I mentioned
 
06:50:34.990 --> 06:50:35.000 align:start position:0%
death can you put the context around it
 
06:50:36.430 --> 06:50:36.440 align:start position:0%
for me I'd have to go back and watch the
 
06:50:37.910 --> 06:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
video but there was a specific part
 
06:50:39.430 --> 06:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
where you said something about that
 
06:50:42.388 --> 06:50:42.398 align:start position:0%
causes death so just curious uh let me
 
06:50:43.388 --> 06:50:43.398 align:start position:0%
read through my notes real quick and
 
06:50:46.510 --> 06:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:49.468 --> 06:50:49.478 align:start position:0%
okay oh are you referring to the part
 
06:50:51.510 --> 06:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
where people who would typically either
 
06:50:53.388 --> 06:50:53.398 align:start position:0%
attempt like are notable I was referring
 
06:50:54.628 --> 06:50:54.638 align:start position:0%
to death in the sense that these
 
06:50:57.190 --> 06:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
children would typically attempt or
 
06:50:58.990 --> 06:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
possibly successfully attempt suicide by
 
06:51:00.388 --> 06:51:00.398 align:start position:0%
the time they reached 18 if they were
 
06:51:02.830 --> 06:51:02.840 align:start position:0%
not to acquire these surgeries okay okay
 
06:51:04.990 --> 06:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
yes yeah so it's specifically death
 
06:51:07.590 --> 06:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
usually related to extreme psychological
 
06:51:09.910 --> 06:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
distress that is being caused in part by
 
06:51:09.920 --> 06:51:10.868 align:start position:0%
distress that is being caused in part by
gender

06:51:10.868 --> 06:51:10.878 align:start position:0%
gender
 
06:51:13.910 --> 06:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
dysphoria and this is the uh like
 
06:51:15.510 --> 06:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
acknowledged course of treatment by
 
06:51:17.670 --> 06:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
pretty much every ma Major Medical
 
06:51:19.548 --> 06:51:19.558 align:start position:0%
Association in my previous uh written
 
06:51:21.670 --> 06:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
testimony there's a whole list that's
 
06:51:24.628 --> 06:51:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:28.510 --> 06:51:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:30.990 --> 06:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
else saying no one else thank you thanks
 
06:51:33.548 --> 06:51:33.558 align:start position:0%
so much
 
06:51:47.910 --> 06:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:50.750 --> 06:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
scare good afternoon distinguished
 
06:51:54.310 --> 06:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the
 
06:51:57.388 --> 06:51:57.398 align:start position:0%
committee I urge you to support this
 
06:51:59.750 --> 06:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
bill Claire a 20-year-old ER
 
06:52:01.628 --> 06:52:01.638 align:start position:0%
transitioner said of her mastectomy at
 
06:52:04.830 --> 06:52:04.840 align:start position:0%
14 if a 14-year-old girl comes to you
 
06:52:08.270 --> 06:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
and says this isn't just teenage angst I
 
06:52:10.110 --> 06:52:10.120 align:start position:0%
actually have a magical male gender
 
06:52:12.548 --> 06:52:12.558 align:start position:0%
spirit and you need to cut parts of my
 
06:52:14.990 --> 06:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
body off or I'm going to kill myself
 
06:52:16.670 --> 06:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
your response shouldn't be right away
 
06:52:19.628 --> 06:52:19.638 align:start position:0%
sir our bodies are real gender
 
06:52:22.190 --> 06:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
identities are imaginary based on
 
06:52:25.548 --> 06:52:25.558 align:start position:0%
stereotypes discomfort and fantasy if
 
06:52:27.628 --> 06:52:27.638 align:start position:0%
Health experts s think I'm mistaken I
 
06:52:30.350 --> 06:52:30.360 align:start position:0%
defy them to define gender identity
 
06:52:32.868 --> 06:52:32.878 align:start position:0%
without relying on circular reasoning
 
06:52:35.030 --> 06:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
but we teach girls the opposite troubled
 
06:52:37.350 --> 06:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
girls especially those with autism or
 
06:52:39.468 --> 06:52:39.478 align:start position:0%
trauma are taught that their bodies are
 
06:52:41.468 --> 06:52:41.478 align:start position:0%
mistakes that stand in the way of them
 
06:52:44.110 --> 06:52:44.120 align:start position:0%
being their authentic selves my friend
 
06:52:45.990 --> 06:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
pra Mosley was going to come here and
 
06:52:48.310 --> 06:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
testify she had a breakdown when she was
 
06:52:49.830 --> 06:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
on the flight and couldn't make it she
 
06:52:52.548 --> 06:52:52.558 align:start position:0%
sent me this I had complications as a
 
06:52:54.110 --> 06:52:54.120 align:start position:0%
result of the double myectomy I was
 
06:52:56.310 --> 06:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
prescribed to cure my mental distress
 
06:52:59.070 --> 06:52:59.080 align:start position:0%
years after the surgery I detransitioned
 
06:53:01.430 --> 06:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
my detransition led to a pregnancy and
 
06:53:03.868 --> 06:53:03.878 align:start position:0%
complications arose as a results result
 
06:53:06.110 --> 06:53:06.120 align:start position:0%
of giving birth my milk came in but
 
06:53:07.948 --> 06:53:07.958 align:start position:0%
because of the nature of my surgery my
 
06:53:09.868 --> 06:53:09.878 align:start position:0%
nipples are decorative they were removed
 
06:53:11.548 --> 06:53:11.558 align:start position:0%
reshaped and reattached in the wrong
 
06:53:13.868 --> 06:53:13.878 align:start position:0%
spot I had no way to feed my baby the
 
06:53:15.830 --> 06:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
pain was like none I've ever felt before
 
06:53:17.548 --> 06:53:17.558 align:start position:0%
and changed my whole perception of pain
 
06:53:20.070 --> 06:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
as a whole no girl should have her
 
06:53:22.990 --> 06:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
breast removed because she is sad no
 
06:53:25.350 --> 06:53:25.360 align:start position:0%
child should be deprived of his mother's
 
06:53:27.628 --> 06:53:27.638 align:start position:0%
milk because a surgeon made money from
 
06:53:30.110 --> 06:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
someone's pain I urge you to protect
 
06:53:32.830 --> 06:53:32.840 align:start position:0%
girls from this destructive ideology and
 
06:53:34.548 --> 06:53:34.558 align:start position:0%
let them reach adulthood with their
 
06:53:36.990 --> 06:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
bodies intact girls are wonderful as
 
06:53:39.150 --> 06:53:39.160 align:start position:0%
they are and they don't need to remove
 
06:53:42.388 --> 06:53:42.398 align:start position:0%
body parts in order to mature into Happy
 
06:53:45.270 --> 06:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
adults um I also remind you of my
 
06:53:47.788 --> 06:53:47.798 align:start position:0%
testimony about these regret rates and
 
06:53:50.350 --> 06:53:50.360 align:start position:0%
how they're entirely concocted with
 
06:53:54.110 --> 06:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
irrelevant data High Dropout rates and
 
06:53:54.120 --> 06:53:55.910 align:start position:0%
irrelevant data High Dropout rates and
shortterm

06:53:55.910 --> 06:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
shortterm
 
06:53:59.830 --> 06:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
follow-ups thank you any
 
06:54:05.110 --> 06:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:06.708 --> 06:54:06.718 align:start position:0%
also signed up to
 
06:54:23.150 --> 06:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:26.788 --> 06:54:26.798 align:start position:0%
Barry good afternoon um thank you for
 
06:54:28.990 --> 06:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
taking the time to hear my testimony my
 
06:54:30.948 --> 06:54:30.958 align:start position:0%
name is Brady Barry I'm a resident of
 
06:54:32.948 --> 06:54:32.958 align:start position:0%
Rochester and I'm here to test by an
 
06:54:34.910 --> 06:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
opposition of HP
 
06:54:37.388 --> 06:54:37.398 align:start position:0%
712 this bill would take away the rights
 
06:54:39.708 --> 06:54:39.718 align:start position:0%
of transgender non-binary kids and take
 
06:54:41.590 --> 06:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
away their autonomy to make healthc care
 
06:54:44.590 --> 06:54:44.600 align:start position:0%
decisions with their caregivers and
 
06:54:46.628 --> 06:54:46.638 align:start position:0%
doctors I personally got gender
 
06:54:49.430 --> 06:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
affirming Top surgery on June 29th
 
06:54:51.788 --> 06:54:51.798 align:start position:0%
2023 I was lucky to have my mom at my
 
06:54:53.910 --> 06:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
side as I woke up from the anesthesia
 
06:54:55.548 --> 06:54:55.558 align:start position:0%
and the first thing I remember saying is
 
06:54:57.310 --> 06:54:57.320 align:start position:0%
this is the best day of my
 
06:55:01.030 --> 06:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
life I can confidently say that getting
 
06:55:02.868 --> 06:55:02.878 align:start position:0%
surgery changed my life
 
06:55:05.070 --> 06:55:05.080 align:start position:0%
at the time I was 22 so while this bill
 
06:55:06.548 --> 06:55:06.558 align:start position:0%
would not have stopped me from receiving
 
06:55:08.510 --> 06:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
care there are many youth who deserve
 
06:55:10.468 --> 06:55:10.478 align:start position:0%
access to gender affirming care which
 
06:55:11.868 --> 06:55:11.878 align:start position:0%
includes these
 
06:55:14.150 --> 06:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
surgeries getting surgery and before
 
06:55:16.070 --> 06:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
that starting gender starting hormone
 
06:55:19.110 --> 06:55:19.120 align:start position:0%
replacement therapy saved my life I say
 
06:55:20.750 --> 06:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
that confidently and without
 
06:55:22.868 --> 06:55:22.878 align:start position:0%
exaggeration I'm part of the statistics
 
06:55:25.468 --> 06:55:25.478 align:start position:0%
you hear so often and you've heard today
 
06:55:28.468 --> 06:55:28.478 align:start position:0%
about lgbtq plus Youth and suicide and I
 
06:55:29.948 --> 06:55:29.958 align:start position:0%
spent years struggling with my mental
 
06:55:32.430 --> 06:55:32.440 align:start position:0%
health I was hospitalized twice at after
 
06:55:34.590 --> 06:55:34.600 align:start position:0%
attempting to end my own life but let me
 
06:55:37.030 --> 06:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
be clear the problem was never my gender
 
06:55:39.350 --> 06:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
or the fact that I'm transgender the
 
06:55:41.510 --> 06:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
problem was lack of access to care and
 
06:55:44.230 --> 06:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
the hate for the lgbtq lgbtq plus
 
06:55:46.788 --> 06:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
community that I'm a part of this bill
 
06:55:48.388 --> 06:55:48.398 align:start position:0%
would put young people at risk of mental
 
06:55:49.948 --> 06:55:49.958 align:start position:0%
health struggles that can be potentially
 
06:55:52.910 --> 06:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
fatal there's an easy to seee impact on
 
06:55:54.628 --> 06:55:54.638 align:start position:0%
my own mental health from before and
 
06:55:57.190 --> 06:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
after I received gender affirming care
 
06:55:58.990 --> 06:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
meaning that after I started hormones I
 
06:56:00.948 --> 06:56:00.958 align:start position:0%
stopped hurting myself and have not been
 
06:56:03.708 --> 06:56:03.718 align:start position:0%
hospitalized again after my top surgery
 
06:56:05.670 --> 06:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
this trend only continued and I have
 
06:56:08.510 --> 06:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
never been happier as a trans kid just a
 
06:56:10.948 --> 06:56:10.958 align:start position:0%
few years ago and having I was a trans
 
06:56:12.788 --> 06:56:12.798 align:start position:0%
kid just a few years ago and having
 
06:56:14.628 --> 06:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
access to gender affirming care ensured
 
06:56:16.868 --> 06:56:16.878 align:start position:0%
that I could grow into a happy trans
 
06:56:19.628 --> 06:56:19.638 align:start position:0%
adult I urge you not to take I urge you
 
06:56:21.310 --> 06:56:21.320 align:start position:0%
not to take this opportunity away from
 
06:56:23.150 --> 06:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
youth in a state where we so proudly
 
06:56:25.388 --> 06:56:25.398 align:start position:0%
tell our residents to Live Free or Die
 
06:56:26.868 --> 06:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
Why are we not giving this Val
 
06:56:28.388 --> 06:56:28.398 align:start position:0%
vulnerable group transgender and
 
06:56:30.590 --> 06:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
non-binary youth the opportunity to live
 
06:56:34.230 --> 06:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
free please consider opposing HB 712 to
 
06:56:36.628 --> 06:56:36.638 align:start position:0%
help ensure safe access to gender affing
 
06:56:38.430 --> 06:56:38.440 align:start position:0%
affirming surgery for youth thank you
 
06:56:42.750 --> 06:56:42.760 align:start position:0%
for your time thank you any
 
06:56:46.670 --> 06:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:49.230 --> 06:56:49.240 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Doug
 
06:56:49.240 --> 06:57:03.830 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Doug
pounds

06:57:03.830 --> 06:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:57:05.270 --> 06:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and committee thank you
 
06:57:08.030 --> 06:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
again um round
 
06:57:11.430 --> 06:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
two um I'll make this brief um I just
 
06:57:14.150 --> 06:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
want to make what I believe are some U
 
06:57:17.150 --> 06:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
my inter for some clear distinctions in
 
06:57:21.750 --> 06:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
the bill which I support one is um
 
06:57:24.670 --> 06:57:24.680 align:start position:0%
surgery for physical pathologies those
 
06:57:26.468 --> 06:57:26.478 align:start position:0%
exceptions I think are are pretty clear
 
06:57:28.788 --> 06:57:28.798 align:start position:0%
and I think um from the transgender
 
06:57:30.350 --> 06:57:30.360 align:start position:0%
perspective it's a
 
06:57:34.510 --> 06:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
psychological pathology and don't treat
 
06:57:38.590 --> 06:57:38.600 align:start position:0%
psychological pathologies with physical
 
06:57:40.628 --> 06:57:40.638 align:start position:0%
surgical responses in
 
06:57:42.948 --> 06:57:42.958 align:start position:0%
general um so I think the Bill's pretty
 
06:57:46.750 --> 06:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
clear on that and offers affords good
 
06:57:49.070 --> 06:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
protections um I just want to rate
 
06:57:50.628 --> 06:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
relate a quick
 
06:57:54.110 --> 06:57:54.120 align:start position:0%
story um my wife and I have had uh
 
06:57:55.990 --> 06:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock as a provider at one
 
06:57:59.708 --> 06:57:59.718 align:start position:0%
point and uh my uh my
 
06:58:03.270 --> 06:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
bride um was was talking with her
 
06:58:06.468 --> 06:58:06.478 align:start position:0%
provider I and the
 
06:58:09.430 --> 06:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
provider was kind of a little bit be
 
06:58:11.910 --> 06:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
beside himself of course you know not
 
06:58:13.310 --> 06:58:13.320 align:start position:0%
violating any of the HIPPA laws or
 
06:58:17.388 --> 06:58:17.398 align:start position:0%
anything but um had a patient
 
06:58:22.708 --> 06:58:22.718 align:start position:0%
um um who was 16 and and confided that
 
06:58:26.628 --> 06:58:26.638 align:start position:0%
the reason she was there was because she
 
06:58:30.388 --> 06:58:30.398 align:start position:0%
was dealing with um female changes as as
 
06:58:32.708 --> 06:58:32.718 align:start position:0%
an adolescent and
 
06:58:34.948 --> 06:58:34.958 align:start position:0%
lied about being transgendered to be
 
06:58:38.830 --> 06:58:38.840 align:start position:0%
able to have surgeries to um get rid of
 
06:58:41.868 --> 06:58:41.878 align:start position:0%
her female parts to not have to deal
 
06:58:45.110 --> 06:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
with um the the tribulations of
 
06:58:48.670 --> 06:58:48.680 align:start position:0%
menstration and whatnot um
 
06:58:53.750 --> 06:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
so I I just find it odd you know that a
 
06:58:56.548 --> 06:58:56.558 align:start position:0%
16-year-old um you know what it what
 
06:58:58.230 --> 06:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
what's going through their mind you know
 
06:58:59.910 --> 06:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
when you
 
06:59:02.830 --> 06:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
know at those times and and lied about
 
06:59:06.350 --> 06:59:06.360 align:start position:0%
it so
 
06:59:08.190 --> 06:59:08.200 align:start position:0%
um I
 
06:59:08.200 --> 06:59:09.948 align:start position:0%
um I
think

06:59:09.948 --> 06:59:09.958 align:start position:0%
think
 
06:59:14.990 --> 06:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
the our young uh minors need to be
 
06:59:16.590 --> 06:59:16.600 align:start position:0%
protected against things like that
 
06:59:19.788 --> 06:59:19.798 align:start position:0%
because that could be a very disastrous
 
06:59:22.910 --> 06:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
decision I think um if she was allowed
 
06:59:25.468 --> 06:59:25.478 align:start position:0%
to go through that and later had serious
 
06:59:29.388 --> 06:59:29.398 align:start position:0%
regrets um that's all I have to say on
 
06:59:31.430 --> 06:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
this topic for now thank you very much
 
06:59:34.070 --> 06:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
and any question questions thank you any
 
06:59:41.230 --> 06:59:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:53.750 --> 06:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:59:56.868 --> 06:59:56.878 align:start position:0%
lucier um hello again I am speaking in
 
07:00:00.110 --> 07:00:00.120 align:start position:0%
opposition of this bill and I'm going to
 
07:00:02.350 --> 07:00:02.360 align:start position:0%
go right into discussing the process of
 
07:00:05.548 --> 07:00:05.558 align:start position:0%
getting Top surgery to start this
 
07:00:08.830 --> 07:00:08.840 align:start position:0%
surgery cannot um be performed while the
 
07:00:10.590 --> 07:00:10.600 align:start position:0%
individual's breasts are still
 
07:00:13.310 --> 07:00:13.320 align:start position:0%
developing this is only performed on
 
07:00:13.320 --> 07:00:15.990 align:start position:0%
developing this is only performed on
older

07:00:15.990 --> 07:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
older
 
07:00:19.070 --> 07:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
teenagers now to even get access to this
 
07:00:21.590 --> 07:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
surgery you must get a referral to an
 
07:00:23.708 --> 07:00:23.718 align:start position:0%
endrocrinologist these doctors are not
 
07:00:25.948 --> 07:00:25.958 align:start position:0%
the ones who perform any surgery they
 
07:00:25.958 --> 07:00:27.110 align:start position:0%
the ones who perform any surgery they
prescribe

07:00:27.110 --> 07:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
prescribe
 
07:00:29.510 --> 07:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
HRT after waiting several months to get
 
07:00:31.350 --> 07:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
an appointment the individual must be
 
07:00:34.510 --> 07:00:34.520 align:start position:0%
evaluated by one sometimes two
 
07:00:37.788 --> 07:00:37.798 align:start position:0%
therapists before this surgery is even
 
07:00:40.350 --> 07:00:40.360 align:start position:0%
considered most surgeons require that
 
07:00:44.030 --> 07:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
the individual has been on HRT for one
 
07:00:46.708 --> 07:00:46.718 align:start position:0%
or sometimes two years as there are
 
07:00:48.670 --> 07:00:48.680 align:start position:0%
changes to muscle mass and fat
 
07:00:51.430 --> 07:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
distribution in those first two
 
07:00:53.910 --> 07:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
years after the work with the therapist
 
07:00:56.548 --> 07:00:56.558 align:start position:0%
or therapists the individual will will
 
07:00:59.628 --> 07:00:59.638 align:start position:0%
either start HRT or in those very rare
 
07:01:01.310 --> 07:01:01.320 align:start position:0%
cases they will get a referral to a
 
07:01:01.320 --> 07:01:03.788 align:start position:0%
cases they will get a referral to a
surgeon

07:01:03.788 --> 07:01:03.798 align:start position:0%
surgeon
 
07:01:05.708 --> 07:01:05.718 align:start position:0%
for that process they are first going to
 
07:01:08.628 --> 07:01:08.638 align:start position:0%
be evaluated by a therapist again to
 
07:01:10.788 --> 07:01:10.798 align:start position:0%
have a statement written deeming this
 
07:01:13.628 --> 07:01:13.638 align:start position:0%
person ready for this surgery that
 
07:01:16.030 --> 07:01:16.040 align:start position:0%
letter deeming them ready will be sent
 
07:01:17.548 --> 07:01:17.558 align:start position:0%
to the surgeon's office and the
 
07:01:20.230 --> 07:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
individual will again wait months for
 
07:01:21.868 --> 07:01:21.878 align:start position:0%
this consultation
 
07:01:24.070 --> 07:01:24.080 align:start position:0%
appointment that appointment the surgeon
 
07:01:26.628 --> 07:01:26.638 align:start position:0%
will also assess if they believe this
 
07:01:29.190 --> 07:01:29.200 align:start position:0%
individual is ready for this surgery and
 
07:01:32.430 --> 07:01:32.440 align:start position:0%
tell them all the side effects of it
 
07:01:34.948 --> 07:01:34.958 align:start position:0%
if they then pass that evaluation they
 
07:01:37.388 --> 07:01:37.398 align:start position:0%
will move on to health tests to make
 
07:01:40.548 --> 07:01:40.558 align:start position:0%
sure they are even capable of handling
 
07:01:43.948 --> 07:01:43.958 align:start position:0%
any sort of surgery only if those tests
 
07:01:46.230 --> 07:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
come back clear can they actually
 
07:01:48.510 --> 07:01:48.520 align:start position:0%
prepare for any surgical
 
07:01:51.190 --> 07:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
procedures this process takes several
 
07:01:54.388 --> 07:01:54.398 align:start position:0%
months sometimes years personally I've
 
07:01:56.510 --> 07:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
waited three years to even get into the
 
07:01:57.990 --> 07:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
process of this
 
07:02:00.350 --> 07:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
surgery this is not a procedure being
 
07:02:02.590 --> 07:02:02.600 align:start position:0%
done on a whim minor are not getting
 
07:02:05.350 --> 07:02:05.360 align:start position:0%
this surgery in schools or in their
 
07:02:08.230 --> 07:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
primary care physicians offices they are
 
07:02:10.070 --> 07:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
going through years of preparation to
 
07:02:12.948 --> 07:02:12.958 align:start position:0%
get to this point this bill aims to take
 
07:02:15.430 --> 07:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
away Top surgery for only those born
 
07:02:18.070 --> 07:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
female not those born male who develop
 
07:02:20.670 --> 07:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
excess breast tissue if you don't want
 
07:02:22.468 --> 07:02:22.478 align:start position:0%
people to change the body that they were
 
07:02:25.310 --> 07:02:25.320 align:start position:0%
born with because they aren't old enough
 
07:02:27.670 --> 07:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
to make that decision then CIS male
 
07:02:29.230 --> 07:02:29.240 align:start position:0%
miners shouldn't receive gender
 
07:02:32.110 --> 07:02:32.120 align:start position:0%

as a four-time breast as a four-time
 
07:04:10.110 --> 07:04:10.120 align:start position:0%
cancer survivor I am well acquainted
 
07:04:12.750 --> 07:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
with the pain of multiple
 
07:04:15.110 --> 07:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
surgeries in
 
07:04:20.230 --> 07:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
2006 2008 at 47 I was diagnosed with
 
07:04:23.948 --> 07:04:23.958 align:start position:0%
breast cancer upon my doctor's advice I
 
07:04:27.030 --> 07:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
chose to undergo a radical Mass ectomy
 
07:04:29.590 --> 07:04:29.600 align:start position:0%
with hormone suppression to give me the
 
07:04:34.190 --> 07:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
best chances of a five-year survival
 
07:04:36.548 --> 07:04:36.558 align:start position:0%
rate faced with that
 
07:04:39.670 --> 07:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
decision you can imagine I was under
 
07:04:39.680 --> 07:04:43.310 align:start position:0%
decision you can imagine I was under
much

07:04:43.310 --> 07:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
07:04:47.708 --> 07:04:47.718 align:start position:0%
duress I can personally attest that this
 
07:04:50.830 --> 07:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
surgery was extremely
 
07:04:55.070 --> 07:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
painful and extremely
 
07:04:58.070 --> 07:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
disfiguring my choice seemed obvious
 
07:05:01.030 --> 07:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
just get rid of it I was told we will
 
07:05:03.430 --> 07:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
build you a new breast
 
07:05:06.388 --> 07:05:06.398 align:start position:0%
Mound I noted that
 
07:05:10.910 --> 07:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
my surgeon my plastic surgeon refused to
 
07:05:13.830 --> 07:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
use the word new
 
07:05:16.868 --> 07:05:16.878 align:start position:0%
breast promises
 
07:05:21.270 --> 07:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
promises my Plastics oh I got that
 
07:05:24.788 --> 07:05:24.798 align:start position:0%
sorry also consider the emotional pain
 
07:05:27.030 --> 07:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
of losing such an intimate part of your
 
07:05:30.948 --> 07:05:30.958 align:start position:0%
body I was a very anxious young woman
 
07:05:33.990 --> 07:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
making a very difficult
 
07:05:37.430 --> 07:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
decision today I live with a hard
 
07:05:41.190 --> 07:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
Mound which no longer even looks like a
 
07:05:45.468 --> 07:05:45.478 align:start position:0%
breast I have no nipple and I have
 
07:05:47.670 --> 07:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
encapsulation I must not have been
 
07:05:51.628 --> 07:05:51.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:05:55.230 --> 07:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
part I must now pay close
 
07:05:59.070 --> 07:05:59.080 align:start position:0%
attention to everything my doctors tell
 
07:06:04.350 --> 07:06:04.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:08.030 --> 07:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
cancer these young girls I'm sorry I
 
07:06:10.150 --> 07:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
can't speak from this anymore these
 
07:06:10.160 --> 07:06:11.110 align:start position:0%
can't speak from this anymore these
young

07:06:11.110 --> 07:06:11.120 align:start position:0%
young
 
07:06:15.110 --> 07:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
girls depend on us their parents to make
 
07:06:19.310 --> 07:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
decisions for them I was not ready at 47
 
07:06:22.510 --> 07:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
years old to lose a breast and we're
 
07:06:25.830 --> 07:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
letting 18 year olds 17 year
 
07:06:30.030 --> 07:06:30.040 align:start position:0%
olds I'm sorry but even younger lose
 
07:06:30.040 --> 07:06:31.910 align:start position:0%
olds I'm sorry but even younger lose
theirs

07:06:31.910 --> 07:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
theirs
 
07:06:33.628 --> 07:06:33.638 align:start position:0%
when I was a young
 
07:06:38.388 --> 07:06:38.398 align:start position:0%
girl I hated my breasts they hurt I
 
07:06:42.468 --> 07:06:42.478 align:start position:0%
hated mensturation you seconds thank you
 
07:06:44.310 --> 07:06:44.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
07:06:49.590 --> 07:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:52.430 --> 07:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Chris
 
07:07:03.910 --> 07:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:07:07.430 --> 07:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
Chris herchel from clad law um I am not
 
07:07:09.628 --> 07:07:09.638 align:start position:0%
going to reiterate everything I said
 
07:07:12.910 --> 07:07:12.920 align:start position:0%
previously but uh I oppose this bill
 
07:07:14.310 --> 07:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
because of the same constitutional
 
07:07:15.830 --> 07:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
infirmities as the other Bill we were
 
07:07:17.830 --> 07:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
discussing this morning but I would like
 
07:07:21.628 --> 07:07:21.638 align:start position:0%
to talk specifically um about the uh
 
07:07:23.468 --> 07:07:23.478 align:start position:0%
referral provision in this bill uh
 
07:07:26.628 --> 07:07:26.638 align:start position:0%
surgery is very serious um and it's very
 
07:07:28.190 --> 07:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
rarely indicated for people under the
 
07:07:30.230 --> 07:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
age of 18 when it comes to gender
 
07:07:32.868 --> 07:07:32.878 align:start position:0%
transition um but I just want to draw
 
07:07:34.868 --> 07:07:34.878 align:start position:0%
attention to the fact that this bill
 
07:07:37.750 --> 07:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
prohibits referrals and you know free
 
07:07:40.990 --> 07:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
speech is a concept that is cherished in
 
07:07:43.070 --> 07:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
both our state and federal
 
07:07:46.590 --> 07:07:46.600 align:start position:0%
constitutions um and the right to free
 
07:07:48.830 --> 07:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
speech doesn't just include the right to
 
07:07:50.270 --> 07:07:50.280 align:start position:0%
communicate information to express
 
07:07:52.070 --> 07:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
yourself even if you're a medical care
 
07:07:55.030 --> 07:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
provider but also it includes
 
07:07:56.670 --> 07:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
encompasses the right to receive
 
07:07:58.830 --> 07:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
information the right to receive
 
07:08:00.310 --> 07:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
information and advice from people who
 
07:08:02.750 --> 07:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
have expertise to help you figure out
 
07:08:04.708 --> 07:08:04.718 align:start position:0%
what the best path forward is for you
 
07:08:06.990 --> 07:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
and for your family um I'm drawing
 
07:08:09.548 --> 07:08:09.558 align:start position:0%
attention to this because I want you I I
 
07:08:10.628 --> 07:08:10.638 align:start position:0%
really think it's important for
 
07:08:13.230 --> 07:08:13.240 align:start position:0%
everybody to imagine the situation in
 
07:08:15.230 --> 07:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
which there's there's a if it's possible
 
07:08:17.510 --> 07:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
that there's one 17-year-old who might
 
07:08:19.670 --> 07:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
need surgery maybe once they reach the
 
07:08:22.350 --> 07:08:22.360 align:start position:0%
age of 18 one 17-year-old whose distress
 
07:08:25.590 --> 07:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
is so severe and they are being blocked
 
07:08:27.310 --> 07:08:27.320 align:start position:0%
from getting information from doctors
 
07:08:28.910 --> 07:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
about possible courses of care that
 
07:08:30.788 --> 07:08:30.798 align:start position:0%
could relieve their distress if there's
 
07:08:32.788 --> 07:08:32.798 align:start position:0%
one person who could experience that
 
07:08:35.388 --> 07:08:35.398 align:start position:0%
level of distress that that could reach
 
07:08:37.430 --> 07:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
you then please consider amending this
 
07:08:40.990 --> 07:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
bill uh to eliminate the provision on
 
07:08:43.310 --> 07:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
referrals um I'm happy to take questions
 
07:08:45.388 --> 07:08:45.398 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions representative
 
07:08:47.510 --> 07:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
kessle thank you Mr chair so I had to
 
07:08:49.110 --> 07:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
look it up because I wanted to know
 
07:08:51.230 --> 07:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
after the last hearing you mentioned the
 
07:08:52.468 --> 07:08:52.478 align:start position:0%
constitutionality so I wanted to get
 
07:08:54.230 --> 07:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
your opinion on something um article
 
07:08:55.708 --> 07:08:55.718 align:start position:0%
four of the New Hampshire Constitution
 
07:08:57.628 --> 07:08:57.638 align:start position:0%
gives us the right under the law and all
 
07:08:59.350 --> 07:08:59.360 align:start position:0%
the challenges that have happened on
 
07:09:01.030 --> 07:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
specific cases where the legislature has
 
07:09:03.270 --> 07:09:03.280 align:start position:0%
enacted laws for health and safety I'm
 
07:09:05.830 --> 07:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
just curious how you would say that this
 
07:09:09.270 --> 07:09:09.280 align:start position:0%
article 4 uh let's say how that affects
 
07:09:10.388 --> 07:09:10.398 align:start position:0%
this because you're talking about the
 
07:09:13.190 --> 07:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of both of these bills
 
07:09:15.548 --> 07:09:15.558 align:start position:0%
okay so referring back to what I was
 
07:09:16.750 --> 07:09:16.760 align:start position:0%
talking about the Constitutional
 
07:09:18.510 --> 07:09:18.520 align:start position:0%
infirmities of the bill this morning I
 
07:09:20.910 --> 07:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
was referring to the 14th Amendment of
 
07:09:22.910 --> 07:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
the US Constitution which protects the
 
07:09:24.430 --> 07:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
right of individuals to be freed from
 
07:09:26.110 --> 07:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
discrimination and the rights of parents
 
07:09:28.670 --> 07:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
to make decisions on behalf of their uh
 
07:09:29.910 --> 07:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
of their children to direct the
 
07:09:32.590 --> 07:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
upbringing of their children um so when
 
07:09:34.788 --> 07:09:34.798 align:start position:0%
when the New Hampshire Constitution
 
07:09:37.388 --> 07:09:37.398 align:start position:0%
allows for uh the right for the state
 
07:09:39.350 --> 07:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
legislature to govern for safety and
 
07:09:43.150 --> 07:09:43.160 align:start position:0%
health which in fact is um you know um
 
07:09:45.468 --> 07:09:45.478 align:start position:0%
assumed or presumed to be the right of
 
07:09:47.150 --> 07:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
State legislatures under the US
 
07:09:48.388 --> 07:09:48.398 align:start position:0%
Constitution as well under the
 
07:09:50.388 --> 07:09:50.398 align:start position:0%
principles of federalism uh there are
 
07:09:53.388 --> 07:09:53.398 align:start position:0%
limitations on what that when when it
 
07:09:55.230 --> 07:09:55.240 align:start position:0%
comes to discriminating against people
 
07:09:56.948 --> 07:09:56.958 align:start position:0%
and when it comes to interfering with
 
07:09:59.150 --> 07:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
the right to raise your children right I
 
07:10:01.510 --> 07:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
mean the question when it comes to um
 
07:10:03.190 --> 07:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
the right to access medical care for
 
07:10:05.030 --> 07:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
your children it's who gets to decide do
 
07:10:07.030 --> 07:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
parents get to decide or does the state
 
07:10:09.350 --> 07:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
get to decide and I understand that the
 
07:10:10.910 --> 07:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
state is responsible for governing
 
07:10:12.990 --> 07:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
health and safety but the fundamental
 
07:10:14.830 --> 07:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
question about who gets to decide I
 
07:10:17.030 --> 07:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
think the our federal and state
 
07:10:19.150 --> 07:10:19.160 align:start position:0%
constitutions have long said that it's
 
07:10:21.150 --> 07:10:21.160 align:start position:0%
up to parents it's up to parents to
 
07:10:22.388 --> 07:10:22.398 align:start position:0%
decide what's best for their children
 
07:10:23.750 --> 07:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
because it's not the role of states to
 
07:10:26.190 --> 07:10:26.200 align:start position:0%
do that yeah I was just curious if you
 
07:10:27.510 --> 07:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
had any reference because I know the US
 
07:10:29.150 --> 07:10:29.160 align:start position:0%
Constitution but I was article four is a
 
07:10:30.230 --> 07:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
little different than other states
 
07:10:31.310 --> 07:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
because a lot of them don't have the
 
07:10:33.150 --> 07:10:33.160 align:start position:0%
same rules that we have and that's in
 
07:10:35.468 --> 07:10:35.478 align:start position:0%
court that's how the provisions have
 
07:10:36.830 --> 07:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
different things lawsuits have been put
 
07:10:38.788 --> 07:10:38.798 align:start position:0%
aside let's say so I'm just curious on
 
07:10:41.430 --> 07:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
that but oh so to clarify the US the
 
07:10:42.868 --> 07:10:42.878 align:start position:0%
14th Amendment of the United States
 
07:10:45.948 --> 07:10:45.958 align:start position:0%
Constitution applies uniformly to every
 
07:10:48.150 --> 07:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
in every state in the constit and sorry
 
07:10:49.788 --> 07:10:49.798 align:start position:0%
in every state in the country regardless
 
07:10:52.708 --> 07:10:52.718 align:start position:0%
of what the state constitution
 
07:10:54.990 --> 07:10:55.000 align:start position:0%
says anyone
 
07:11:03.150 --> 07:11:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:20.430 --> 07:11:20.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:11:23.388 --> 07:11:23.398 align:start position:0%
scare hi I'm Beth scare I'm a

protect girls from double mctoy D
 
07:11:35.590 --> 07:11:35.600 align:start position:0%

Mosley had their breasts removed Katie
 
07:11:40.510 --> 07:11:40.520 align:start position:0%

07:11:43.510 --> 07:11:43.520 align:start position:0%

Ducks too many girls are having this
 
07:12:04.510 --> 07:12:04.520 align:start position:0%
done at a young age what is the rush to
 
07:12:05.990 --> 07:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
have their breasts
 
07:12:08.350 --> 07:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
amputated why is it so critical to have
 
07:12:09.868 --> 07:12:09.878 align:start position:0%
this done when these vulnerable girls
 
07:12:15.070 --> 07:12:15.080 align:start position:0%

07:12:28.788 --> 07:12:28.798 align:start position:0%
from anxiety depression PTSD from sexual
 
07:12:32.670 --> 07:12:32.680 align:start position:0%
abuse or the difficulties of a DHD or
 
07:12:34.910 --> 07:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
Autism they are promised that when their

Euphoria of getting rid of the supposed

source of pain but then the reality hits
 
07:12:47.830 --> 07:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
that it didn't fix anything they have
 
07:12:49.708 --> 07:12:49.718 align:start position:0%
the same problems they had before
 
07:12:51.670 --> 07:12:51.680 align:start position:0%

with the uh transgender Youth and those
 
07:14:09.310 --> 07:14:09.320 align:start position:0%
who support their care I do not feel
 
07:14:13.030 --> 07:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
like this is a good bill um but I would
 
07:14:13.040 --> 07:14:14.110 align:start position:0%
like this is a good bill um but I would
be

07:14:14.110 --> 07:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
be
 
07:14:17.430 --> 07:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
remiss if I didn't say at some point
 
07:14:20.310 --> 07:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
today that this bill the one we heard
 
07:14:22.468 --> 07:14:22.478 align:start position:0%
this morning the one that just passed
 
07:14:25.628 --> 07:14:25.638 align:start position:0%
out of executive committee on bathrooms
 
07:14:31.788 --> 07:14:31.798 align:start position:0%
etc etc etc are part of a larger program
 
07:14:35.388 --> 07:14:35.398 align:start position:0%
to other and even eliminate the
 
07:14:39.070 --> 07:14:39.080 align:start position:0%
transgender Community we have a
 
07:14:41.468 --> 07:14:41.478 align:start position:0%
president who spent
 
07:14:41.478 --> 07:14:43.708 align:start position:0%
president who spent
$222

07:14:43.708 --> 07:14:43.718 align:start position:0%
$222
 
07:14:47.590 --> 07:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
million in hate ads before he got
 
07:14:51.708 --> 07:14:51.718 align:start position:0%
elected and he said on several occasions
 
07:14:53.590 --> 07:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
that little boys are going to school and
 
07:14:55.868 --> 07:14:55.878 align:start position:0%
when they come home they're little girls
 
07:14:59.190 --> 07:14:59.200 align:start position:0%
and I think you as legislators when you
 
07:15:01.270 --> 07:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
go to vote on these you need to do a
 
07:15:04.948 --> 07:15:04.958 align:start position:0%
couple of things one you need to make
 
07:15:08.270 --> 07:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
sure that all the
 
07:15:11.910 --> 07:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
socalled reviews and whistleblower
 
07:15:14.628 --> 07:15:14.638 align:start position:0%
reports and so forth that those are
 
07:15:18.310 --> 07:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
accurate you need to do your own
 
07:15:22.230 --> 07:15:22.240 align:start position:0%
research the other thing I'd ask is that
 
07:15:23.708 --> 07:15:23.718 align:start position:0%
pretend this
 
07:15:27.430 --> 07:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
bill exists on its own here in New
 
07:15:30.388 --> 07:15:30.398 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there we're not seeing this
 
07:15:33.190 --> 07:15:33.200 align:start position:0%
kind of thing happening across the
 
07:15:36.788 --> 07:15:36.798 align:start position:0%
country mostly in red States where
 
07:15:37.948 --> 07:15:37.958 align:start position:0%
people have
 
07:15:41.510 --> 07:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
decided politicians have decided that
 
07:15:45.030 --> 07:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
this group of people is one that we can
 
07:15:47.548 --> 07:15:47.558 align:start position:0%
go after you know there's a musical
 
07:15:50.708 --> 07:15:50.718 align:start position:0%
called wicked and in it the wizard says
 
07:15:54.030 --> 07:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
nothing brings people together like a
 
07:15:56.788 --> 07:15:56.798 align:start position:0%
common enemy and for the transgender
 
07:15:59.190 --> 07:15:59.200 align:start position:0%
community and their supporters as well
 
07:16:02.110 --> 07:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
as for the immigrants we have found
 
07:16:06.388 --> 07:16:06.398 align:start position:0%
those and I really hope you will look at
 
07:16:09.830 --> 07:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
the health what the experts say there
 
07:16:13.388 --> 07:16:13.398 align:start position:0%
are a lot of experts and I hope you will
 
07:16:15.990 --> 07:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
look at what they have to say when you
 
07:16:19.788 --> 07:16:19.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:24.510 --> 07:16:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:26.750 --> 07:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
questions okay also signed up to speak
 
07:16:35.110 --> 07:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:16:37.070 --> 07:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman sorry about my uh
 
07:16:39.110 --> 07:16:39.120 align:start position:0%

07:16:41.430 --> 07:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
little bit late uh thank you honorable
 
07:16:43.110 --> 07:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
chair and committee members my name is
 
07:16:44.788 --> 07:16:44.798 align:start position:0%
representative Heath Howard I represent
 
07:16:46.310 --> 07:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
the towns of straford and barington and
 
07:16:49.430 --> 07:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
straford District 4 it is my opinion
 
07:16:51.468 --> 07:16:51.478 align:start position:0%
that as legislators we should always be
 
07:16:54.590 --> 07:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
searching to do the most good and do the
 
07:16:57.830 --> 07:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
least harm but this legislation provide
 
07:16:59.670 --> 07:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
prevents access to a surgery that can
 
07:17:01.388 --> 07:17:01.398 align:start position:0%
benefit the day-to-day lives
 
07:17:03.548 --> 07:17:03.558 align:start position:0%
of its patients as someone who has had
 
07:17:05.590 --> 07:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
multiple surgeries unrelated to this
 
07:17:07.750 --> 07:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
topic it provides a perspective of how
 
07:17:10.150 --> 07:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
someone feels when they're in pain I had
 
07:17:12.590 --> 07:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
to wait four months with a broken back
 
07:17:15.270 --> 07:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
to get surgery during covid because it
 
07:17:17.670 --> 07:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
was quote an elective
 
07:17:20.270 --> 07:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
procedure while it is a different
 
07:17:22.150 --> 07:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
situation I understand what it's like to
 
07:17:24.708 --> 07:17:24.718 align:start position:0%
suffer after being denied more immediate
 
07:17:26.868 --> 07:17:26.878 align:start position:0%
treatment I see my situation no
 
07:17:28.830 --> 07:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
differently than any other individual
 
07:17:31.788 --> 07:17:31.798 align:start position:0%
seeking any treatment of any kind
 
07:17:33.270 --> 07:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
if you are suffering you should be able
 
07:17:35.030 --> 07:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
to you should be allowed to discuss
 
07:17:36.750 --> 07:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
treatment options with your physician
 
07:17:38.590 --> 07:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
and pursue whatever works best for that
 
07:17:41.788 --> 07:17:41.798 align:start position:0%
patients needs this tramples all over
 
07:17:43.750 --> 07:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
the individual liberties that we pride
 
07:17:46.310 --> 07:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
ourselves on and ultimately removes
 
07:17:48.910 --> 07:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
access to our right to bodily autonomy
 
07:17:51.310 --> 07:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
this is no different than access to an
 
07:17:54.230 --> 07:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
abortion or back surgery please leave
 
07:17:56.430 --> 07:17:56.440 align:start position:0%

07:18:47.788 --> 07:18:47.798 align:start position:0%
believe and she was placed on cross-
 
07:18:49.510 --> 07:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
seex hormones for four years starting
 
07:18:52.590 --> 07:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
from when she was a minor uh today she
 
07:18:54.990 --> 07:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
regrets those decisions and has to and
 
07:18:57.150 --> 07:18:57.160 align:start position:0%
has had to pay out of pocket for D
 
07:18:59.708 --> 07:18:59.718 align:start position:0%
transition procedures including her
 
07:19:02.310 --> 07:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
electrolysis and a tracheal shave to
 
07:19:05.388 --> 07:19:05.398 align:start position:0%
remove her atoms Apple induced by
 
07:19:08.310 --> 07:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
testosterone she is one of the many
 
07:19:12.310 --> 07:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
detransitioners and regretter and larger
 
07:19:15.190 --> 07:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh group of young women who have had
 
07:19:18.628 --> 07:19:18.638 align:start position:0%
their breasts removed in the name of
 
07:19:21.548 --> 07:19:21.558 align:start position:0%
what is essentially become a death
 
07:19:26.388 --> 07:19:26.398 align:start position:0%
cult they say that if we are not given
 
07:19:28.510 --> 07:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
these elective surgeries we will kill
 
07:19:30.670 --> 07:19:30.680 align:start position:0%
ourselves this sounds very famili
 
07:19:33.750 --> 07:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
familiar to me uh to Scientology for
 
07:19:35.670 --> 07:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
example and there are many people who
 
07:19:37.468 --> 07:19:37.478 align:start position:0%
have talked about these
 
07:19:40.110 --> 07:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
comparisons um I will also venture to
 
07:19:42.548 --> 07:19:42.558 align:start position:0%
add that my friend pra who unfortunately
 
07:19:43.750 --> 07:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't be here is another D
 
07:19:47.070 --> 07:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
transitioner who had her breast removed
 
07:19:49.990 --> 07:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh now has a child and is unable to
 
07:19:50.000 --> 07:19:52.548 align:start position:0%
uh now has a child and is unable to
breastfeed

07:19:52.548 --> 07:19:52.558 align:start position:0%
breastfeed
 
07:19:55.548 --> 07:19:55.558 align:start position:0%
um when I was 16 I was in my first year
 
07:19:57.030 --> 07:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
of college I went to college two years
 
07:19:58.788 --> 07:19:58.798 align:start position:0%
early and I went to college specifically
 
07:20:00.430 --> 07:20:00.440 align:start position:0%
for um people who want to go to college
 
07:20:00.440 --> 07:20:01.468 align:start position:0%
for um people who want to go to college
early

07:20:01.468 --> 07:20:01.478 align:start position:0%
early
 
07:20:03.670 --> 07:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
my first week was the first time I saw a
 
07:20:06.670 --> 07:20:06.680 align:start position:0%
mastectomy scar it was on a 16-year-old
 
07:20:08.310 --> 07:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
girl who had gotten it the year before
 
07:20:09.468 --> 07:20:09.478 align:start position:0%
when she was
 
07:20:12.110 --> 07:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
15 she was deeply
 
07:20:15.350 --> 07:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
distressed and knowing her and being
 
07:20:17.868 --> 07:20:17.878 align:start position:0%
close to her she was not in the right
 
07:20:19.830 --> 07:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
mind I could not imagine how she could
 
07:20:21.230 --> 07:20:21.240 align:start position:0%
have been in the right mind to make that
 
07:20:23.468 --> 07:20:23.478 align:start position:0%
decision I had many other friends
 
07:20:26.230 --> 07:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
growing up and recently who underwent
 
07:20:28.750 --> 07:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
double mastectomies and these gender
 
07:20:32.150 --> 07:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
affirming surgeries on February 25th a
 
07:20:34.110 --> 07:20:34.120 align:start position:0%
study came out with the biggest sample
 
07:20:37.190 --> 07:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
size of American patients we've seen yet
 
07:20:41.270 --> 07:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
107,000 published in the Oxford press of
 
07:20:43.708 --> 07:20:43.718 align:start position:0%
taking from NIH data this is a matched
 
07:20:46.830 --> 07:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
cohort so we compared uh gender
 
07:20:50.548 --> 07:20:50.558 align:start position:0%
dysphoric uh children or people
 
07:20:51.868 --> 07:20:51.878 align:start position:0%
generally speaking it's not just
 
07:20:55.070 --> 07:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
children um who did gender affirming
 
07:20:56.990 --> 07:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
surgery and those who did not do gender
 
07:20:58.948 --> 07:20:58.958 align:start position:0%
affirming surgery and those who did do
 
07:21:00.868 --> 07:21:00.878 align:start position:0%
gender affirming surgery ra of
 
07:21:03.110 --> 07:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
depression and anxiety were twice as
 
07:21:05.868 --> 07:21:05.878 align:start position:0%
high all of the research we've had up to
 
07:21:08.030 --> 07:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
this point is not longitudinal suffers
 
07:21:10.830 --> 07:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
from high Dropout rates and essentially
 
07:21:12.270 --> 07:21:12.280 align:start position:0%
is statistically
 
07:21:14.230 --> 07:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
insignificant my girlfriend didn't
 
07:21:16.548 --> 07:21:16.558 align:start position:0%
realize that what she did was wrong
 
07:21:18.430 --> 07:21:18.440 align:start position:0%
until she was four or five years into
 
07:21:20.670 --> 07:21:20.680 align:start position:0%
identifying as trans down to 15 seconds
 
07:21:22.948 --> 07:21:22.958 align:start position:0%
yeah if you pull uh those from the D
 
07:21:24.350 --> 07:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
transitioner subreddit how long they
 
07:21:25.990 --> 07:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
identified as trans it averages six
 
07:21:27.868 --> 07:21:27.878 align:start position:0%
seven eight years none of these studies
 
07:21:29.910 --> 07:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
account for that W path recently
 
07:21:31.750 --> 07:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
admitted that the D transition rate is
 
07:21:33.628 --> 07:21:33.638 align:start position:0%
at least 30% they're an activist
 
07:21:34.948 --> 07:21:34.958 align:start position:0%
organization so that's going to be
 
07:21:37.388 --> 07:21:37.398 align:start position:0%
conservative estimate I am happy and
 
07:21:39.070 --> 07:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
willing to answer any and all questions
 
07:21:41.190 --> 07:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
you may have of me thank you any
 
07:21:43.270 --> 07:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
07:21:46.868 --> 07:21:46.878 align:start position:0%
delus thank you Mr chairman um you
 
07:21:49.030 --> 07:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you know quite a few
 
07:21:50.510 --> 07:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
people who have had the double
 
07:21:53.670 --> 07:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
mastectomy and and regret it were most
 
07:21:56.310 --> 07:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
of them below the age of 18 all of them
 
07:21:58.468 --> 07:21:58.478 align:start position:0%
were below the age of
 
07:22:00.750 --> 07:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
18 um all of them were survivors of
 
07:22:05.110 --> 07:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
sexual assault as well oh my god
 
07:22:07.830 --> 07:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
07:22:10.868 --> 07:22:10.878 align:start position:0%
I anyone else representative K Castle R
 
07:22:12.670 --> 07:22:12.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I was just curious
 
07:22:13.990 --> 07:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
um with the experience that your
 
07:22:15.388 --> 07:22:15.398 align:start position:0%
girlfriend has gone through has there
 
07:22:17.350 --> 07:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
been any other adverse side effects and
 
07:22:18.628 --> 07:22:18.638 align:start position:0%
issues that you've had to deal with
 
07:22:20.468 --> 07:22:20.478 align:start position:0%
seeing it from the other side um the
 
07:22:22.270 --> 07:22:22.280 align:start position:0%
reason she can't be here today is
 
07:22:24.150 --> 07:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
because she suffers from chronic joint
 
07:22:26.468 --> 07:22:26.478 align:start position:0%
pain uh related to the fact that she was
 
07:22:28.350 --> 07:22:28.360 align:start position:0%
put on the wrong sex hormones for four
 
07:22:30.750 --> 07:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
years of her life
 
07:22:32.388 --> 07:22:32.398 align:start position:0%
um traveling is very difficult for her
 
07:22:35.548 --> 07:22:35.558 align:start position:0%
and it makes her joint problems uh worse
 
07:22:38.150 --> 07:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
um she would have liked to be an EMT she
 
07:22:40.990 --> 07:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
can't she can't stand for that long she
 
07:22:43.868 --> 07:22:43.878 align:start position:0%
she physically can't because these
 
07:22:46.590 --> 07:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
so-called gender affirming procedures
 
07:22:48.270 --> 07:22:48.280 align:start position:0%
have robbed her body's functional
 
07:22:50.510 --> 07:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
ability to do a job which she's dreamed
 
07:22:52.510 --> 07:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
of doing since she was a
 
07:22:54.948 --> 07:22:54.958 align:start position:0%
child so
 
07:22:58.030 --> 07:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
yes other questions representative
 
07:23:02.468 --> 07:23:02.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:05.708 --> 07:23:05.718 align:start position:0%
now tagging onto the qu onto this
 
07:23:08.948 --> 07:23:08.958 align:start position:0%
question were were was she informed was
 
07:23:12.628 --> 07:23:12.638 align:start position:0%
your girlfriend informed that this would
 
07:23:15.590 --> 07:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
possibly keep her from doing the thing
 
07:23:18.030 --> 07:23:18.040 align:start position:0%
that she wanted to do the most in life
 
07:23:20.590 --> 07:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
no not at all and the reason for this is
 
07:23:22.350 --> 07:23:22.360 align:start position:0%
poor Research into the side effects of
 
07:23:24.308 --> 07:23:24.318 align:start position:0%
these surgeries and these crossx
 
07:23:26.548 --> 07:23:26.558 align:start position:0%
hormones and the fact that in a lot of
 
07:23:28.628 --> 07:23:28.638 align:start position:0%
cases contrary to what others have said
 
07:23:31.388 --> 07:23:31.398 align:start position:0%
the evaluation period is very short uh
 
07:23:32.910 --> 07:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
there was an article recently about the
 
07:23:34.430 --> 07:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
Boston Children's gender Clinic which
 
07:23:35.708 --> 07:23:35.718 align:start position:0%
I'm sure many people in New Hampshire
 
07:23:37.830 --> 07:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
have gone to um they recently lowered
 
07:23:40.868 --> 07:23:40.878 align:start position:0%
their intake um period from about like
 
07:23:42.830 --> 07:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
some uh multiple meetings over a month
 
07:23:44.990 --> 07:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
or two uh to get hormones down to just
 
07:23:45.000 --> 07:23:47.030 align:start position:0%
or two uh to get hormones down to just
two

07:23:47.030 --> 07:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
two
 
07:23:50.190 --> 07:23:50.200 align:start position:0%
hours other
 
07:23:54.070 --> 07:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:23:56.868 --> 07:23:56.878 align:start position:0%
Drew why didn't you do this you were on
 
07:24:00.388 --> 07:24:00.398 align:start position:0%
track uh to get hormones and to to get
 
07:24:02.110 --> 07:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
Top surgery and possibly bottom surgery
 
07:24:05.628 --> 07:24:05.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:24:09.230 --> 07:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
it my father said no way in hell he
 
07:24:11.468 --> 07:24:11.478 align:start position:0%
cussed out my pediatrician he cussed out
 
07:24:13.230 --> 07:24:13.240 align:start position:0%
every single Doctor Who referred me to a
 
07:24:15.468 --> 07:24:15.478 align:start position:0%
gender Clinic my pediatrician quit a
 
07:24:17.750 --> 07:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
year later so I think that has something
 
07:24:20.548 --> 07:24:20.558 align:start position:0%
to do with it um if not for him if he
 
07:24:22.868 --> 07:24:22.878 align:start position:0%
were affirming I wouldn't be sitting
 
07:24:26.388 --> 07:24:26.398 align:start position:0%
here today maybe I would be dead maybe I
 
07:24:28.788 --> 07:24:28.798 align:start position:0%
would have osteoporosis maybe my
 
07:24:30.990 --> 07:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
genitalia wouldn't be intact
 
07:24:33.788 --> 07:24:33.798 align:start position:0%
maybe I would have one of the the many
 
07:24:36.150 --> 07:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
complications that so many of my friends
 
07:24:37.430 --> 07:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
have to live with for the rest of their
 
07:24:39.190 --> 07:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
life for example my friend Richie who
 
07:24:41.948 --> 07:24:41.958 align:start position:0%
has to um do dialysis on a daily or
 
07:24:44.788 --> 07:24:44.798 align:start position:0%
weekly basis for his Neo vagina uh for
 
07:24:46.628 --> 07:24:46.638 align:start position:0%
the rest of his life due to the penal
 
07:24:46.638 --> 07:24:48.788 align:start position:0%
the rest of his life due to the penal
inversion

07:24:48.788 --> 07:24:48.798 align:start position:0%
inversion
 
07:24:51.948 --> 07:24:51.958 align:start position:0%
surgery other
 
07:24:58.110 --> 07:24:58.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:03.708 --> 07:25:03.718 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:07.868 --> 07:25:07.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:07.878 --> 07:25:10.230 align:start position:0%
 
here

07:25:10.230 --> 07:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
here
 
07:25:21.468 --> 07:25:21.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:25:23.868 --> 07:25:23.878 align:start position:0%
black thank you I appreciate you
 
07:25:26.308 --> 07:25:26.318 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak
 
07:25:29.788 --> 07:25:29.798 align:start position:0%
chairman I submitted my testimony online
 
07:25:33.948 --> 07:25:33.958 align:start position:0%
um I also have this one written copy my
 
07:25:35.788 --> 07:25:35.798 align:start position:0%
name is Jennifer black I'm from Windam
 
07:25:35.798 --> 07:25:37.510 align:start position:0%
name is Jennifer black I'm from Windam
New

07:25:37.510 --> 07:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
New
 
07:25:40.468 --> 07:25:40.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I would have given anything to
 
07:25:41.430 --> 07:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
not have
 
07:25:44.230 --> 07:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
breasts when I was two I started
 
07:25:46.030 --> 07:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
screaming whenever my mother tried to
 
07:25:48.990 --> 07:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
put me in a dress and frankly if someone
 
07:25:51.510 --> 07:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
tried to put me in a dress now I might
 
07:25:55.110 --> 07:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
scream I despise dolls my favorite toy
 
07:25:57.110 --> 07:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
was a truck I wanted to be one of the
 
07:26:00.350 --> 07:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
guys and for a long time I was I played
 
07:26:02.308 --> 07:26:02.318 align:start position:0%
baseball climbed trees split wood jump
 
07:26:04.628 --> 07:26:04.638 align:start position:0%
bikes and hung out with the boys
 
07:26:06.110 --> 07:26:06.120 align:start position:0%
everything was
 
07:26:09.750 --> 07:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
great but then puberty reared its ugly
 
07:26:12.788 --> 07:26:12.798 align:start position:0%
head I watched in utter dismay as my
 
07:26:15.308 --> 07:26:15.318 align:start position:0%
body transformed the identity I had
 
07:26:18.350 --> 07:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
created for myself was upended I was no
 
07:26:20.670 --> 07:26:20.680 align:start position:0%
longer one of the guys they looked at me
 
07:26:23.270 --> 07:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
differently talked to me differently I
 
07:26:27.190 --> 07:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
felt like I was a no man's land no pun
 
07:26:29.830 --> 07:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
intended girls were not my friends I
 
07:26:31.590 --> 07:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
didn't really to them at all boys were
 
07:26:33.670 --> 07:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
treating me like an alien I became
 
07:26:36.468 --> 07:26:36.478 align:start position:0%
reclusive and shy if only I could have
 
07:26:39.868 --> 07:26:39.878 align:start position:0%
been born a boy if only I could stop the
 
07:26:41.468 --> 07:26:41.478 align:start position:0%
growth of these breasts that were a
 
07:26:43.628 --> 07:26:43.638 align:start position:0%
symbol that everyone could see that I
 
07:26:46.308 --> 07:26:46.318 align:start position:0%
was what I absolutely did not want to be
 
07:26:46.318 --> 07:26:47.468 align:start position:0%
was what I absolutely did not want to be
a

07:26:47.468 --> 07:26:47.478 align:start position:0%
a
 
07:26:51.110 --> 07:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
woman that was then I am now a happily
 
07:26:53.350 --> 07:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
married mom of six children all of whom
 
07:26:56.548 --> 07:26:56.558 align:start position:0%
I nursed including twins I stand here
 
07:26:59.190 --> 07:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
today grateful that I grew up in the 70s
 
07:27:02.230 --> 07:27:02.240 align:start position:0%
and 80s and not today I stand here today
 
07:27:04.150 --> 07:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
with my heartbreaking for the girls who
 
07:27:06.468 --> 07:27:06.478 align:start position:0%
are not given the privilege I had to
 
07:27:09.670 --> 07:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
grow up without chemicals and surgery I
 
07:27:11.308 --> 07:27:11.318 align:start position:0%
shudder to think where I would be if I
 
07:27:13.070 --> 07:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
grew up in today's environment of quick
 
07:27:15.628 --> 07:27:15.638 align:start position:0%
fixes and instant gratification I
 
07:27:17.150 --> 07:27:17.160 align:start position:0%
shudder to think what would have
 
07:27:19.308 --> 07:27:19.318 align:start position:0%
happened if the trans industry existed
 
07:27:22.070 --> 07:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
back then and offered me the opportunity
 
07:27:24.628 --> 07:27:24.638 align:start position:0%
to become a boy to remove my breast I
 
07:27:26.510 --> 07:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
have no doubt that I would have leapt at
 
07:27:28.350 --> 07:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
that opportunity and I would have faced
 
07:27:30.628 --> 07:27:30.638 align:start position:0%
a lifetime of regret
 
07:27:32.190 --> 07:27:32.200 align:start position:0%
my heart aches for the young girls who
 
07:27:33.590 --> 07:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
are being told that they were born in
 
07:27:35.708 --> 07:27:35.718 align:start position:0%
the wrong body and need irreversible
 
07:27:38.548 --> 07:27:38.558 align:start position:0%
surgery and chemicals to fix it that's
 
07:27:40.548 --> 07:27:40.558 align:start position:0%
not what they need what they need is
 
07:27:43.070 --> 07:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
what I was privileged to have they need
 
07:27:45.830 --> 07:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
the gift and privilege of time to mature
 
07:27:49.430 --> 07:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
and grow and gain perspective and time
 
07:27:51.708 --> 07:27:51.718 align:start position:0%
to learn to accept their body and
 
07:27:53.270 --> 07:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
understand that their body is a special
 
07:27:55.910 --> 07:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
gift they need affirmation that although
 
07:27:57.468 --> 07:27:57.478 align:start position:0%
being a woman is an immutable
 
07:27:59.350 --> 07:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
characteristic there are infinite ways
 
07:28:00.910 --> 07:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
to be a woman
 
07:28:02.590 --> 07:28:02.600 align:start position:0%
they need affirmation that we are all
 
07:28:04.430 --> 07:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
created in a unique way and bring a
 
07:28:06.510 --> 07:28:06.520 align:start position:0%
multitude of characteristics and traits
 
07:28:08.270 --> 07:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
that are combined in our body to make us
 
07:28:10.948 --> 07:28:10.958 align:start position:0%
a special person not one person is the
 
07:28:14.110 --> 07:28:14.120 align:start position:0%
same as another and above all they need
 
07:28:15.948 --> 07:28:15.958 align:start position:0%
adults to be
 
07:28:18.590 --> 07:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
adults we are tasked with raising and
 
07:28:21.110 --> 07:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
protecting children sometimes having to
 
07:28:23.388 --> 07:28:23.398 align:start position:0%
protect them from themselves you're down
 
07:28:25.670 --> 07:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
to 15 seconds we have the perspective
 
07:28:27.350 --> 07:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
and experience to be able to tell them
 
07:28:29.510 --> 07:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
that puberty is confusing and difficult
 
07:28:31.070 --> 07:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
but they are strong and will'll get
 
07:28:32.670 --> 07:28:32.680 align:start position:0%
through it just like we all did in
 
07:28:34.990 --> 07:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
conclusion I ask that you please be the
 
07:28:36.830 --> 07:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
adults in these girls' lives when so
 
07:28:39.150 --> 07:28:39.160 align:start position:0%
many others are failing them stand for
 
07:28:41.270 --> 07:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
keeping their beautiful bodies intact
 
07:28:42.990 --> 07:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
stand for allowing them the privilege
 
07:28:44.868 --> 07:28:44.878 align:start position:0%
and time to grow and mature and accept
 
07:28:47.110 --> 07:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
their bodies as God created them give
 
07:28:48.708 --> 07:28:48.718 align:start position:0%
them the opportunity to reach the
 
07:28:50.230 --> 07:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
conclusion that I have reached that
 
07:28:52.510 --> 07:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
being a woman and a mom is an incredible
 
07:28:54.628 --> 07:28:54.638 align:start position:0%
blessing that I wouldn't have traded for
 
07:28:57.308 --> 07:28:57.318 align:start position:0%
anything please vote for HB
 
07:29:02.990 --> 07:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:09.750 --> 07:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
07:29:12.628 --> 07:29:12.638 align:start position:0%
colot hello
 
07:29:15.110 --> 07:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
again all right this one I actually
 
07:29:17.708 --> 07:29:17.718 align:start position:0%
wrote at like prepared for it at the age
 
07:29:20.070 --> 07:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
of 19 and2 years old I underwent a
 
07:29:21.948 --> 07:29:21.958 align:start position:0%
double Mast ectomy Top surgery on
 
07:29:25.230 --> 07:29:25.240 align:start position:0%
January 14th 2025 my consultation for
 
07:29:27.110 --> 07:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
this surgery took place at the age of 17
 
07:29:29.548 --> 07:29:29.558 align:start position:0%
years old in early September 2022 you
 
07:29:30.788 --> 07:29:30.798 align:start position:0%
may be wondering wondering why it takes
 
07:29:32.628 --> 07:29:32.638 align:start position:0%
so long well cuz getting approved by
 
07:29:34.388 --> 07:29:34.398 align:start position:0%
insurance and on the o schedule for an
 
07:29:36.868 --> 07:29:36.878 align:start position:0%
elective surgery takes a long time this
 
07:29:38.388 --> 07:29:38.398 align:start position:0%
is one of countless reasons why these
 
07:29:40.030 --> 07:29:40.040 align:start position:0%
kinds of bills are pointless as their
 
07:29:41.910 --> 07:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
sponsors continue to draft them as if
 
07:29:43.510 --> 07:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
there's a pop-up gender clinic on every
 
07:29:45.830 --> 07:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
street corner offering walk-in Services
 
07:29:47.868 --> 07:29:47.878 align:start position:0%
clearly these people haven't a shred of
 
07:29:50.628 --> 07:29:50.638 align:start position:0%
a clue of what reality truly is members
 
07:29:52.190 --> 07:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
of both the state and the federal
 
07:29:54.150 --> 07:29:54.160 align:start position:0%
government's insistent comp incessant
 
07:29:55.868 --> 07:29:55.878 align:start position:0%
compulsion to propose legislation which
 
07:29:57.430 --> 07:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
targets our individual rights as
 
07:30:00.270 --> 07:30:00.280 align:start position:0%
Americans isn't just absurd but utter
 
07:30:02.230 --> 07:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
waste of everyone's energy you cannot
 
07:30:03.830 --> 07:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
call yourself a granite stator and rep
 
07:30:05.270 --> 07:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
to live for your die motto if you
 
07:30:07.350 --> 07:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
advocate for or comply with folks's
 
07:30:08.868 --> 07:30:08.878 align:start position:0%
private medical business being put in
 
07:30:11.070 --> 07:30:11.080 align:start position:0%
the hands of anyone but themselves or
 
07:30:13.150 --> 07:30:13.160 align:start position:0%
their doctors these kinds of bills would
 
07:30:15.150 --> 07:30:15.160 align:start position:0%
massively fail to Garner a whiff of
 
07:30:16.868 --> 07:30:16.878 align:start position:0%
support if instead of merely appearing
 
07:30:18.628 --> 07:30:18.638 align:start position:0%
to threaten queer people's ability to
 
07:30:20.750 --> 07:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
access proper care their true purpose
 
07:30:22.510 --> 07:30:22.520 align:start position:0%
was written in bold New Hampshire
 
07:30:24.350 --> 07:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
lawmakers should have more control over
 
07:30:26.468 --> 07:30:26.478 align:start position:0%
citizens' livelihoods than they do open
 
07:30:28.388 --> 07:30:28.398 align:start position:0%
your eyes people the fear that you've
 
07:30:30.030 --> 07:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
been conditioned to feel towards the
 
07:30:31.590 --> 07:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
your community is ruining your lives
 
07:30:33.628 --> 07:30:33.638 align:start position:0%
perhaps as much as it does ours because
 
07:30:35.670 --> 07:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
admit it or not we are the same as you
 
07:30:38.150 --> 07:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure sorry no I'll Circle
 
07:30:39.788 --> 07:30:39.798 align:start position:0%
back to that in a second we all struggle
 
07:30:41.430 --> 07:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
under and are subjugated by the system
 
07:30:43.308 --> 07:30:43.318 align:start position:0%
in which we live so I'm sorry that you
 
07:30:45.670 --> 07:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
see us as enemies for we could just as
 
07:30:47.430 --> 07:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
easily be your neighbor if you gave us
 
07:30:49.628 --> 07:30:49.638 align:start position:0%
the chance to show you who we really are
 
07:30:51.990 --> 07:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
not what someone tells you we are let us
 
07:30:53.750 --> 07:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
working folks stick together we are more
 
07:30:56.308 --> 07:30:56.318 align:start position:0%
powerful that way and then I also just
 
07:30:57.948 --> 07:30:57.958 align:start position:0%
wanted to address some crap that's been
 
07:31:00.628 --> 07:31:00.638 align:start position:0%
being said someone just said not one
 
07:31:03.070 --> 07:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
person is the same as another so why
 
07:31:06.350 --> 07:31:06.360 align:start position:0%
would they stand for a bill that is
 
07:31:07.990 --> 07:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
assimilating people or putting people
 
07:31:10.190 --> 07:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
into boxes it doesn't really make any
 
07:31:11.230 --> 07:31:11.240 align:start position:0%
sense to me it seems completely
 
07:31:12.788 --> 07:31:12.798 align:start position:0%
contradictory if you think there are
 
07:31:14.868 --> 07:31:14.878 align:start position:0%
countless countless ways to be a woman
 
07:31:16.670 --> 07:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
then why would you be in support of this
 
07:31:19.708 --> 07:31:19.718 align:start position:0%
kind of proposal that is giving strict
 
07:31:22.868 --> 07:31:22.878 align:start position:0%
definitions to certain things
 
07:31:25.788 --> 07:31:25.798 align:start position:0%
um yeah also people are told straight up
 
07:31:27.628 --> 07:31:27.638 align:start position:0%
the surgery you're receiving will not
 
07:31:30.788 --> 07:31:30.798 align:start position:0%
cure your dysphoria people are pred far
 
07:31:33.150 --> 07:31:33.160 align:start position:0%
in advance by everybody involved in the
 
07:31:35.910 --> 07:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
process so long as the doctors are good
 
07:31:37.750 --> 07:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
doctors like not every doctor is a good
 
07:31:40.110 --> 07:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
doctor and they might screw up but it
 
07:31:41.230 --> 07:31:41.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't have anything to do with it
 
07:31:43.230 --> 07:31:43.240 align:start position:0%
being trans care sometimes people suck
 
07:31:45.110 --> 07:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
at their jobs and are incompetent
 
07:31:46.308 --> 07:31:46.318 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to do with the fact that
 
07:31:47.590 --> 07:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
trans people are the ones receiving
 
07:31:49.150 --> 07:31:49.160 align:start position:0%
their care that doctor just might be
 
07:31:51.788 --> 07:31:51.798 align:start position:0%
inept but anyway if it isn't an inept
 
07:31:54.070 --> 07:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
medical system or facility or office or
 
07:31:57.110 --> 07:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
whatever you do get warned this is not
 
07:31:58.708 --> 07:31:58.718 align:start position:0%
going to solve all your problems you're
 
07:32:00.590 --> 07:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
just chopping your boobs off that's what
 
07:32:03.430 --> 07:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
it is that's what we all know it is I'm
 
07:32:05.308 --> 07:32:05.318 align:start position:0%
just happy I did it and that's the
 
07:32:07.548 --> 07:32:07.558 align:start position:0%
bottom line like we're happy about it
 
07:32:09.708 --> 07:32:09.718 align:start position:0%
some people aren't you're right some
 
07:32:11.628 --> 07:32:11.638 align:start position:0%
people are in so much pain from their
 
07:32:16.388 --> 07:32:16.398 align:start position:0%
decisions but why would we make a law
 
07:32:18.150 --> 07:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
that prohibits such a large portion of
 
07:32:21.430 --> 07:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
people to not feel Joy just so a couple
 
07:32:23.430 --> 07:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
of people can feel protected and
 
07:32:25.868 --> 07:32:25.878 align:start position:0%
comforted this is the name of safety not
 
07:32:27.830 --> 07:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
Comfort remember what this committee is
 
07:32:29.868 --> 07:32:29.878 align:start position:0%
for it is not public Comfort it is that
 
07:32:33.910 --> 07:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:52.590 --> 07:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:32:55.308 --> 07:32:55.318 align:start position:0%
jakow my name is Lind Jak housee I'm a
 
07:32:57.628 --> 07:32:57.638 align:start position:0%
non-binary person and I had Top surgery
 
07:33:00.868 --> 07:33:00.878 align:start position:0%
just before my 26th birthday day April
 
07:33:02.948 --> 07:33:02.958 align:start position:0%
will be the 9th anniversary of my top
 
07:33:04.750 --> 07:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
surgery and to this day it's one of the
 
07:33:06.868 --> 07:33:06.878 align:start position:0%
best decisions I ever made that improved
 
07:33:08.628 --> 07:33:08.638 align:start position:0%
my life for the better and the best
 
07:33:11.030 --> 07:33:11.040 align:start position:0%
money I ever spent when I was going
 
07:33:12.510 --> 07:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
through puberty I felt extremely
 
07:33:14.670 --> 07:33:14.680 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with my chest before I
 
07:33:17.230 --> 07:33:17.240 align:start position:0%
knew the words transgender or non-binary
 
07:33:19.388 --> 07:33:19.398 align:start position:0%
I wish I wished my chest could stay flat
 
07:33:21.708 --> 07:33:21.718 align:start position:0%
forever I would wear multiple sports
 
07:33:23.590 --> 07:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
bras in an attempt to flatten my chest
 
07:33:26.270 --> 07:33:26.280 align:start position:0%
starting around age 10 or 11 when I was
 
07:33:28.230 --> 07:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
a teenager I saw a documentary about a
 
07:33:30.388 --> 07:33:30.398 align:start position:0%
trans man getting tops or and was
 
07:33:32.750 --> 07:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
incredibly jealous of it and wished that
 
07:33:34.628 --> 07:33:34.638 align:start position:0%
I was a trans man so I could get top
 
07:33:36.910 --> 07:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
surgery in my early 20s I met a
 
07:33:38.750 --> 07:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
non-binary person who had gotten Top
 
07:33:40.868 --> 07:33:40.878 align:start position:0%
surgery and felt a ray of hope that I
 
07:33:43.510 --> 07:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
could too I started wearing a binder to
 
07:33:45.548 --> 07:33:45.558 align:start position:0%
flatten my chest which was very hot and
 
07:33:47.350 --> 07:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
got filled with sweat in the summer and
 
07:33:49.070 --> 07:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
I'll admit I wore it longer than the
 
07:33:51.430 --> 07:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
recommended 8 hours at a time which can
 
07:33:53.830 --> 07:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
make it hard to breathe qualifying for
 
07:33:55.708 --> 07:33:55.718 align:start position:0%
Top surgery was not a quick and easy
 
07:33:57.788 --> 07:33:57.798 align:start position:0%
process I had to see a gender therapist
 
07:33:59.230 --> 07:33:59.240 align:start position:0%
for at least a year before getting a
 
07:34:01.750 --> 07:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
letter of recommendation I was lucky to
 
07:34:03.628 --> 07:34:03.638 align:start position:0%
be on my mom's insurance and to have her
 
07:34:06.430 --> 07:34:06.440 align:start position:0%
support overall Top surgery cost around
 
07:34:08.590 --> 07:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
$8,000 half of which was covered by my
 
07:34:11.110 --> 07:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
mom's insurance and I saved every penny
 
07:34:12.788 --> 07:34:12.798 align:start position:0%
I could over the course of a year on a
 
07:34:15.230 --> 07:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
low salary job to come up with the other
 
07:34:18.548 --> 07:34:18.558 align:start position:0%
$4,000 I had to pay out of pocket when I
 
07:34:20.230 --> 07:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
woke up in the surgery room I had the
 
07:34:22.070 --> 07:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
biggest smile on my face and I felt like
 
07:34:24.190 --> 07:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
a weight had literally un figuratively
 
07:34:26.788 --> 07:34:26.798 align:start position:0%
lifted off my chest and shoulders I felt
 
07:34:28.590 --> 07:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
more confident and at home in my body
 
07:34:30.230 --> 07:34:30.240 align:start position:0%
than ever before
 
07:34:31.750 --> 07:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
many Studies have shown that regret
 
07:34:35.270 --> 07:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
rates for Top surgery are 1% or less I'm
 
07:34:36.948 --> 07:34:36.958 align:start position:0%
sorry for the small percentage of people
 
07:34:38.150 --> 07:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
who have gone through the lengthy
 
07:34:39.670 --> 07:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
process of being informed and then
 
07:34:41.868 --> 07:34:41.878 align:start position:0%
regret the procedure but again that's
 
07:34:43.830 --> 07:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
far lower regret rates than many other
 
07:34:45.270 --> 07:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
medical procedures that we wouldn't
 
07:34:48.110 --> 07:34:48.120 align:start position:0%
dream of banning I was fortunate to have
 
07:34:49.510 --> 07:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
excellent healthc care and to be able to
 
07:34:51.230 --> 07:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
make this decision for myself along with
 
07:34:53.030 --> 07:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
my therapist and the surgeon without
 
07:34:54.830 --> 07:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
politicians putting any additional
 
07:34:57.350 --> 07:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
barriers in my way I hope to be a parent
 
07:34:59.350 --> 07:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
someday and if my teenage child needed
 
07:35:01.230 --> 07:35:01.240 align:start position:0%
top surgery I would support them every
 
07:35:03.388 --> 07:35:03.398 align:start position:0%
step of the way although I was an adult
 
07:35:05.430 --> 07:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
when I received this care it's no secret
 
07:35:06.910 --> 07:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
that those who put barriers in the way
 
07:35:09.030 --> 07:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
of trans people accessing Health Care
 
07:35:11.110 --> 07:35:11.120 align:start position:0%
have moved the bar into bands on adult
 
07:35:13.788 --> 07:35:13.798 align:start position:0%
care Arizona Georgia Idaho Kentucky
 
07:35:16.430 --> 07:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
Mississippi Oklahoma Texas and Virginia
 
07:35:18.708 --> 07:35:18.718 align:start position:0%
are seeking seeking to stop medical
 
07:35:20.830 --> 07:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
Medicare Cade funds from being used for
 
07:35:22.868 --> 07:35:22.878 align:start position:0%
this Health Care furthermore it's
 
07:35:24.788 --> 07:35:24.798 align:start position:0%
discriminatory to ban the same procedure
 
07:35:26.868 --> 07:35:26.878 align:start position:0%
for Trans people while allowing it to
 
07:35:28.830 --> 07:35:28.840 align:start position:0%
continue on non-transgender girls who
 
07:35:30.910 --> 07:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
have cancer or boys who have unwanted
 
07:35:32.948 --> 07:35:32.958 align:start position:0%
breast growth it's the same procedure
 
07:35:34.910 --> 07:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
yet it's only stigmatized by certain
 
07:35:36.350 --> 07:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
politicians when it applies to
 
07:35:38.990 --> 07:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
transgender or non-binary people stop
 
07:35:41.948 --> 07:35:41.958 align:start position:0%
this double standard and oppose HB 712
 
07:35:45.830 --> 07:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take questions any
 
07:35:51.230 --> 07:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
07:35:53.708 --> 07:35:53.718 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is
 
07:35:56.430 --> 07:35:56.440 align:start position:0%
representative Timothy
 
07:35:58.590 --> 07:35:58.600 align:start position:0%
Horgan can take your code off first if
 
07:36:09.030 --> 07:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:10.788 --> 07:36:10.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um I don't want to
 
07:36:12.670 --> 07:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
prolong your long day too much although
 
07:36:16.110 --> 07:36:16.120 align:start position:0%
I did fill out a pink card so um this
 
07:36:18.830 --> 07:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
bill I think this is a as I'm sure
 
07:36:20.548 --> 07:36:20.558 align:start position:0%
you've heard uh heard before but just
 
07:36:22.270 --> 07:36:22.280 align:start position:0%
very quickly this is something that um
 
07:36:24.468 --> 07:36:24.478 align:start position:0%
you know young people and their families
 
07:36:27.670 --> 07:36:27.680 align:start position:0%
and their medical uh professionals are
 
07:36:30.030 --> 07:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
going to uh are going to should should
 
07:36:31.590 --> 07:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
decide for themselves without like a
 
07:36:33.430 --> 07:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
bunch of politicians like us inserting
 
07:36:36.788 --> 07:36:36.798 align:start position:0%
ourselves into into the decision and
 
07:36:36.798 --> 07:36:37.910 align:start position:0%
ourselves into into the decision and
also

07:36:37.910 --> 07:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
also
 
07:36:40.190 --> 07:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
uh and uh so there are certainly
 
07:36:43.910 --> 07:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances where uh so-called Top
 
07:36:47.270 --> 07:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
surgery is probably most most people get
 
07:36:49.230 --> 07:36:49.240 align:start position:0%
it are are
 
07:36:51.750 --> 07:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
are adult age but there are some
 
07:36:55.388 --> 07:36:55.398 align:start position:0%
legitimate reasons when minors uh miners
 
07:36:57.230 --> 07:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
when miners need to need to take
 
07:37:00.350 --> 07:37:00.360 align:start position:0%
advantage of it and um
 
07:37:02.788 --> 07:37:02.798 align:start position:0%
so this is uh I think this bill uh this
 
07:37:05.230 --> 07:37:05.240 align:start position:0%
bill is Bill is itl it's part of like
 
07:37:09.150 --> 07:37:09.160 align:start position:0%
frankly a lot of uh anti- anti-trans
 
07:37:12.190 --> 07:37:12.200 align:start position:0%
hatred you know directed at a uh
 
07:37:14.388 --> 07:37:14.398 align:start position:0%
directed a very small community whose
 
07:37:16.270 --> 07:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
lives are very difficult anyway and also
 
07:37:18.270 --> 07:37:18.280 align:start position:0%
point out just the whole process of
 
07:37:20.708 --> 07:37:20.718 align:start position:0%
transitioning is very very difficult so
 
07:37:22.628 --> 07:37:22.638 align:start position:0%
a lot of the comments I've heard in the
 
07:37:24.308 --> 07:37:24.318 align:start position:0%
past about it seem to think it's really
 
07:37:26.750 --> 07:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
simple like to say oh a guy can just
 
07:37:28.548 --> 07:37:28.558 align:start position:0%
foot of a wig or something but no it's
 
07:37:30.788 --> 07:37:30.798 align:start position:0%
there's is
 
07:37:32.948 --> 07:37:32.958 align:start position:0%
um regardless of whether you're adult or
 
07:37:34.190 --> 07:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
a minoring to start it's an
 
07:37:35.910 --> 07:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily difficult process and
 
07:37:39.590 --> 07:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
people do it just because they know know
 
07:37:41.590 --> 07:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
who they they already know who they are
 
07:37:45.230 --> 07:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
so they uh want their bodies to conform
 
07:37:48.548 --> 07:37:48.558 align:start position:0%
to who and what they already um know
 
07:37:51.548 --> 07:37:51.558 align:start position:0%
themselves to be and um I guess I'll
 
07:37:53.750 --> 07:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
just one thing I add new is that I have
 
07:37:56.750 --> 07:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
a uh some friends who uh one of their
 
07:37:59.230 --> 07:37:59.240 align:start position:0%
children belongs to a uh group on the
 
07:38:01.030 --> 07:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
west Coast kind of a fren religious
 
07:38:03.948 --> 07:38:03.958 align:start position:0%
group and they they firmly uh so they
 
07:38:05.510 --> 07:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
firmly believe that you shouldn't assign
 
07:38:08.110 --> 07:38:08.120 align:start position:0%
a gender to a child until the child's
 
07:38:10.030 --> 07:38:10.040 align:start position:0%
old enough to speak for themselves and
 
07:38:12.670 --> 07:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
so their their daughter gave birth to a
 
07:38:16.590 --> 07:38:16.600 align:start position:0%
child who um clearly would normally be
 
07:38:19.308 --> 07:38:19.318 align:start position:0%
assigned female at Birth everybody uh
 
07:38:20.830 --> 07:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
you know so it was hard hard for them
 
07:38:23.150 --> 07:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
for the first few years until the uh
 
07:38:25.110 --> 07:38:25.120 align:start position:0%
child began speaking not to refer her
 
07:38:27.308 --> 07:38:27.318 align:start position:0%
refer her as she but one of the very
 
07:38:30.110 --> 07:38:30.120 align:start position:0%
first utterances uh that little girl did
 
07:38:33.030 --> 07:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
who was a you know CIS female said I am
 
07:38:36.110 --> 07:38:36.120 align:start position:0%
a girl and that's the same for you know
 
07:38:39.150 --> 07:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
trans girls who maybe chromosomes aren't
 
07:38:41.350 --> 07:38:41.360 align:start position:0%
the standard XX or otherwise for some
 
07:38:44.030 --> 07:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
other reason are signed female male at
 
07:38:46.190 --> 07:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
Birth they usually know their girls
 
07:38:47.388 --> 07:38:47.398 align:start position:0%
right from the beginning from what I've
 
07:38:51.270 --> 07:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
heard and uh just and uh you trans trans
 
07:38:53.548 --> 07:38:53.558 align:start position:0%
boys usually know their boys right from
 
07:38:56.230 --> 07:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
right from the beginning and so um so
 
07:38:59.548 --> 07:38:59.558 align:start position:0%
this is a you know so usually the the
 
07:39:02.510 --> 07:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
vast majority of cases uh you know the
 
07:39:04.230 --> 07:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
person has an inkling right from when
 
07:39:05.670 --> 07:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
they begin to have a sense of themselves
 
07:39:07.150 --> 07:39:07.160 align:start position:0%
or be able to speak for themselves that
 
07:39:09.830 --> 07:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
they are they are trans rather than uh
 
07:39:12.510 --> 07:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
CIS like me so I'm just for the record I
 
07:39:15.350 --> 07:39:15.360 align:start position:0%
am a CIS male so I'm my gender identity
 
07:39:16.788 --> 07:39:16.798 align:start position:0%
is exactly what you'd expect from my
 
07:39:18.948 --> 07:39:18.958 align:start position:0%
gender expression the way I look so at
 
07:39:21.910 --> 07:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
least I hope that I you know I identify
 
07:39:24.590 --> 07:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
as male exactly exactly what you would
 
07:39:26.150 --> 07:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
probably think from from looking at me
 
07:39:27.670 --> 07:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
and deal with me but that's that's not
 
07:39:29.990 --> 07:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
true true for every 15 seconds okay
 
07:39:32.230 --> 07:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
thanks well just I would say just please
 
07:39:35.190 --> 07:39:35.200 align:start position:0%
itl this bill it's uh unnecessary and
 
07:39:37.110 --> 07:39:37.120 align:start position:0%
have many many bad consequences so
 
07:39:39.150 --> 07:39:39.160 align:start position:0%
thanks for your time okay thank you any
 
07:39:42.628 --> 07:39:42.638 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Oregan I'm
 
07:39:47.350 --> 07:39:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
07:39:49.548 --> 07:39:49.558 align:start position:0%
right also signed up to speak is
 
07:39:59.430 --> 07:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
07:40:02.388 --> 07:40:02.398 align:start position:0%
hello members of the committee turn
 
07:40:04.070 --> 07:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
hello members of the committee my name
 
07:40:06.670 --> 07:40:06.680 align:start position:0%
is McKenzie West and I and I am here to
 
07:40:08.468 --> 07:40:08.478 align:start position:0%
oppose HP
 
07:40:10.830 --> 07:40:10.840 align:start position:0%
712 the truth of the matter is that
 
07:40:12.468 --> 07:40:12.478 align:start position:0%
chest augmentation for gender
 
07:40:14.788 --> 07:40:14.798 align:start position:0%
confirmation is of great importance to
 
07:40:17.110 --> 07:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
many trans masculine and non-binary
 
07:40:19.548 --> 07:40:19.558 align:start position:0%
individuals and miners undergoing such
 
07:40:22.110 --> 07:40:22.120 align:start position:0%
procedures make a very small portion of
 
07:40:25.230 --> 07:40:25.240 align:start position:0%
such procedures this law specifically
 
07:40:27.990 --> 07:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
targets transmasculine and non-binary
 
07:40:30.548 --> 07:40:30.558 align:start position:0%
individuals in a blatant to attempt to
 
07:40:32.708 --> 07:40:32.718 align:start position:0%
discriminate this law cares out
 
07:40:34.990 --> 07:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
exceptions for the medical necessity of
 
07:40:38.110 --> 07:40:38.120 align:start position:0%
cisgender individuals often to reaffirm
 
07:40:40.708 --> 07:40:40.718 align:start position:0%
their gender identity but why do we give
 
07:40:42.628 --> 07:40:42.638 align:start position:0%
less Credence to trans masculine and
 
07:40:48.190 --> 07:40:48.200 align:start position:0%
non-binary identities the surgical pre
 
07:40:51.510 --> 07:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
prerequisits of chest augmentation of
 
07:40:54.868 --> 07:40:54.878 align:start position:0%
often require years of therapy and many
 
07:40:57.510 --> 07:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
many Hoops as others have stated the
 
07:40:59.708 --> 07:40:59.718 align:start position:0%
barriers are already high and we regret
 
07:41:02.628 --> 07:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
levels are low so why are we once again
 
07:41:04.868 --> 07:41:04.878 align:start position:0%
trying to insert the state into medical
 
07:41:08.350 --> 07:41:08.360 align:start position:0%
decisions of our families and their
 
07:41:11.548 --> 07:41:11.558 align:start position:0%
doctors the few adolescents that this
 
07:41:13.788 --> 07:41:13.798 align:start position:0%
bill affects know who they are and they
 
07:41:16.070 --> 07:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
have known for a while jumping through
 
07:41:18.030 --> 07:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
every hoop placed in their way to prove
 
07:41:20.708 --> 07:41:20.718 align:start position:0%
it to others if we look at the timeline
 
07:41:23.270 --> 07:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
of these surgeries for the few
 
07:41:25.590 --> 07:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
adolescence that this bill affects we
 
07:41:27.628 --> 07:41:27.638 align:start position:0%
can see that these kids are often coming
 
07:41:29.670 --> 07:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
out of high school or preparing to to do
 
07:41:32.070 --> 07:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
so and many are looking to go off to
 
07:41:33.948 --> 07:41:33.958 align:start position:0%
college and radically changing lives
 
07:41:36.150 --> 07:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
ahead of them often trying to escape the
 
07:41:38.190 --> 07:41:38.200 align:start position:0%
bigotry and harassment that has followed
 
07:41:39.230 --> 07:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
them for
 
07:41:41.628 --> 07:41:41.638 align:start position:0%
years when you ask why they don't just
 
07:41:44.350 --> 07:41:44.360 align:start position:0%
wait until adulthood it is simple it is
 
07:41:47.070 --> 07:41:47.080 align:start position:0%
a radically changing time for many young
 
07:41:49.030 --> 07:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
folks and they deserve to start a new
 
07:41:50.830 --> 07:41:50.840 align:start position:0%
chapter of their life without bigotry
 
07:41:52.788 --> 07:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
and dysphoria following them and
 
07:41:55.430 --> 07:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
allowing them to really feel themselves
 
07:42:00.308 --> 07:42:00.318 align:start position:0%
I urge you to vote itl on HP7 12 and to
 
07:42:05.030 --> 07:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:08.548 --> 07:42:08.558 align:start position:0%
Futures a set any
 
07:42:13.868 --> 07:42:13.878 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:24.990 --> 07:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:29.788 --> 07:42:29.798 align:start position:0%
bakus thank you hello again
 
07:42:32.030 --> 07:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm just going to quote something
 
07:42:34.070 --> 07:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
from the an article in the American
 
07:42:37.388 --> 07:42:37.398 align:start position:0%
Medical Association Journal of Ethics uh
 
07:42:38.910 --> 07:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
the article is called what's wrong with
 
07:42:41.030 --> 07:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
criminalizing gender affirming care of
 
07:42:45.070 --> 07:42:45.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:47.388 --> 07:42:47.398 align:start position:0%
Adolescence in the section
 
07:42:51.468 --> 07:42:51.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:42:53.708 --> 07:42:53.718 align:start position:0%
care the criminalization of gender
 
07:42:54.990 --> 07:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
affirming care for adolescence is
 
07:42:56.910 --> 07:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
emerged in multiple US states in the
 
07:42:59.548 --> 07:42:59.558 align:start position:0%
last two years 25 us states have
 
07:43:01.830 --> 07:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
introduced bills to restrict a access to
 
07:43:03.830 --> 07:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
gender affirming medical care for
 
07:43:06.708 --> 07:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
minors for example in 2021 Arkansas
 
07:43:07.948 --> 07:43:07.958 align:start position:0%
became the first state to Outlaw
 
07:43:09.230 --> 07:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
Physicians from providing gender
 
07:43:11.070 --> 07:43:11.080 align:start position:0%
affirming care both hormonal and
 
07:43:13.468 --> 07:43:13.478 align:start position:0%
surgical to minor patients via an
 
07:43:15.070 --> 07:43:15.080 align:start position:0%
override of the governor's veto of the
 
07:43:18.628 --> 07:43:18.638 align:start position:0%
bill in 2022 the Alabama legislature
 
07:43:20.708 --> 07:43:20.718 align:start position:0%
passed and the government signed into
 
07:43:23.750 --> 07:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
law a bill known as the Alabama
 
07:43:25.590 --> 07:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
vulnerable child compassion and
 
07:43:25.600 --> 07:43:27.150 align:start position:0%
vulnerable child compassion and
protection

07:43:27.150 --> 07:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
protection
 
07:43:29.388 --> 07:43:29.398 align:start position:0%
act prohibiting Physicians from
 
07:43:30.788 --> 07:43:30.798 align:start position:0%
providing gender affirming care both
 
07:43:31.868 --> 07:43:31.878 align:start position:0%
hormonal and
 
07:43:33.868 --> 07:43:33.878 align:start position:0%
surgical to
 
07:43:36.388 --> 07:43:36.398 align:start position:0%
minors often the motivation behind such
 
07:43:38.670 --> 07:43:38.680 align:start position:0%
bills is political a new front on the
 
07:43:40.548 --> 07:43:40.558 align:start position:0%
culture War targeting transgender
 
07:43:44.830 --> 07:43:44.840 align:start position:0%
citizens for example in 2020 in January
 
07:43:46.990 --> 07:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
2020 the South Dakota House
 
07:43:48.430 --> 07:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
Representatives passed a bill
 
07:43:50.350 --> 07:43:50.360 align:start position:0%
criminalizing provision of gender
 
07:43:53.110 --> 07:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
affirming treatment to transgender youth
 
07:43:55.388 --> 07:43:55.398 align:start position:0%
under the age of 16 shortly after the
 
07:43:57.708 --> 07:43:57.718 align:start position:0%
legislator's failure to pass a bathroom
 
07:43:59.948 --> 07:43:59.958 align:start position:0%
bill you might remember the bathroom
 
07:44:01.590 --> 07:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
bill that was in front of the house
 
07:44:04.150 --> 07:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Committee
 
07:44:06.910 --> 07:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
recently poos genders affirming care
 
07:44:08.910 --> 07:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
restrictions coming after failure of
 
07:44:11.510 --> 07:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
bathroom bills are not unique and are
 
07:44:14.030 --> 07:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
evidence of political animus as recently
 
07:44:15.948 --> 07:44:15.958 align:start position:0%
noted in the Harvard Law review the
 
07:44:17.468 --> 07:44:17.478 align:start position:0%
shift from stigmatization and
 
07:44:19.190 --> 07:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
vilification of trans youth in the
 
07:44:21.350 --> 07:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
bathroom bills to the victimization
 
07:44:22.868 --> 07:44:22.878 align:start position:0%
narrative embodied in the gender
 
07:44:25.708 --> 07:44:25.718 align:start position:0%
affirming care bands illustrates how
 
07:44:28.150 --> 07:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
opponents of trans identity are adopting
 
07:44:30.030 --> 07:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
their rhetoric in response to changing
 
07:44:32.270 --> 07:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
legal and social attitudes towards
 
07:44:32.280 --> 07:44:33.868 align:start position:0%
legal and social attitudes towards
transgender

07:44:33.868 --> 07:44:33.878 align:start position:0%
transgender
 
07:44:35.990 --> 07:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
children there's more to the article I'd
 
07:44:40.468 --> 07:44:40.478 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:44.270 --> 07:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
yourselves please leave trans kids alone
 
07:44:47.030 --> 07:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
I oppose this Bill thank you thank you
 
07:44:47.040 --> 07:44:48.150 align:start position:0%
I oppose this Bill thank you thank you
any

07:44:48.150 --> 07:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
any
 
07:44:52.670 --> 07:44:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:44:55.388 --> 07:44:55.398 align:start position:0%
you also signed up to speak is Jamie
 
07:45:08.670 --> 07:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
07:45:11.150 --> 07:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
good afternoon this bill is critically
 
07:45:15.070 --> 07:45:15.080 align:start position:0%
important for one simple statistic 73%
 
07:45:16.990 --> 07:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
of those going to Pediatric gender
 
07:45:19.190 --> 07:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
centers in the United States right now
 
07:45:21.990 --> 07:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
are girls this is at the heart of the
 
07:45:24.868 --> 07:45:24.878 align:start position:0%
huge debate over this care globally when
 
07:45:26.670 --> 07:45:26.680 align:start position:0%
I started working in a pediatric gender
 
07:45:28.628 --> 07:45:28.638 align:start position:0%
Center I had four to five new patients
 
07:45:31.670 --> 07:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
per month and most of them were boys
 
07:45:35.590 --> 07:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
when I left 5 years later I had 40 to 50
 
07:45:37.468 --> 07:45:37.478 align:start position:0%
new patients per month and most of them
 
07:45:40.230 --> 07:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
were adolescent females this sex
 
07:45:42.110 --> 07:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
reversal has been reported in clinics
 
07:45:44.190 --> 07:45:44.200 align:start position:0%
from Western Europe from Canada and the
 
07:45:46.030 --> 07:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
United States and this has left many
 
07:45:48.670 --> 07:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
scientists incredibly concerned in
 
07:45:51.990 --> 07:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
England 15 years ago there were just 250
 
07:45:53.868 --> 07:45:53.878 align:start position:0%
referrals to their gender service and
 
07:45:57.150 --> 07:45:57.160 align:start position:0%
nearly all of them were boys 5 years ago
 
07:45:59.510 --> 07:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
there were 5,000
 
07:46:03.830 --> 07:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
and 75% of those were adolescent girls
 
07:46:06.430 --> 07:46:06.440 align:start position:0%
this kind of complete and utter reversal
 
07:46:09.388 --> 07:46:09.398 align:start position:0%
for a clinical presentation is almost
 
07:46:13.510 --> 07:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
statistically never seen one hypothesis
 
07:46:16.150 --> 07:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
is that these girls are just now feeling
 
07:46:19.150 --> 07:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
free to identify as boys another
 
07:46:20.990 --> 07:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
hypothesis is that we are actually
 
07:46:24.708 --> 07:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
seeing a new kind of socially mediated
 
07:46:24.718 --> 07:46:26.190 align:start position:0%
seeing a new kind of socially mediated
looping

07:46:26.190 --> 07:46:26.200 align:start position:0%
looping
 
07:46:29.150 --> 07:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
Behavior what I know as a scientist is
 
07:46:31.628 --> 07:46:31.638 align:start position:0%
that the safe thing to do is not to
 
07:46:34.110 --> 07:46:34.120 align:start position:0%
remove any healthy body parts from any
 
07:46:36.910 --> 07:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
miners until we actually have clear data
 
07:46:39.110 --> 07:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
to understand what is occurring and that
 
07:46:41.830 --> 07:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
means that this bill is necessary I also
 
07:46:43.750 --> 07:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
work directly with patients who have had
 
07:46:46.070 --> 07:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
these bilateral momies as
 
07:46:48.308 --> 07:46:48.318 align:start position:0%
minors one of the most heart-wrenching
 
07:46:50.110 --> 07:46:50.120 align:start position:0%
patient cases that I worked with had
 
07:46:52.350 --> 07:46:52.360 align:start position:0%
this exact kind of surgery she was trans
 
07:46:54.270 --> 07:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
identified when she had the surgery and
 
07:46:56.708 --> 07:46:56.718 align:start position:0%
within 3 months she called the center
 
07:46:58.270 --> 07:46:58.280 align:start position:0%
and begged for the surgeon to put her
 
07:46:59.350 --> 07:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
breast back
 
07:47:03.468 --> 07:47:03.478 align:start position:0%
on the surgeon refused to take her call
 
07:47:06.350 --> 07:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
and refused to call her back the surgeon
 
07:47:09.510 --> 07:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
punted that follow-up call to
 
07:47:13.548 --> 07:47:13.558 align:start position:0%
me why because she had absolutely no
 
07:47:16.190 --> 07:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
idea what to do in this situation and
 
07:47:18.590 --> 07:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
she simply could not fathom that it
 
07:47:21.070 --> 07:47:21.080 align:start position:0%
would have ever occurred the surgeon
 
07:47:22.948 --> 07:47:22.958 align:start position:0%
also told me that she would not even
 
07:47:24.830 --> 07:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
meet with this patient again until she
 
07:47:26.948 --> 07:47:26.958 align:start position:0%
had an entire year worth of therapy and
 
07:47:30.670 --> 07:47:30.680 align:start position:0%
a full psychological evaluation
 
07:47:32.948 --> 07:47:32.958 align:start position:0%
that young woman re was required to have
 
07:47:34.990 --> 07:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
neither of those things before we cut
 
07:47:35.910 --> 07:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
off her
 
07:47:38.190 --> 07:47:38.200 align:start position:0%
breasts the last I heard in this
 
07:47:40.190 --> 07:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up case was that that young woman
 
07:47:42.468 --> 07:47:42.478 align:start position:0%
was now pregnant she also grew up in
 
07:47:45.230 --> 07:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
foster care and she had experienced
 
07:47:48.590 --> 07:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
sexual trauma and had a substance abuse
 
07:47:50.830 --> 07:47:50.840 align:start position:0%
disorder I also want to share that my
 
07:47:53.110 --> 07:47:53.120 align:start position:0%
former spouse has also had this surgery
 
07:47:55.030 --> 07:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
she was trans identified for years
 
07:47:57.190 --> 07:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
before she had it and she now
 
07:47:59.110 --> 07:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
permanently Mourns the loss of her
 
07:48:01.830 --> 07:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
breasts it took years for her to process
 
07:48:03.270 --> 07:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
this and to come to understand what
 
07:48:04.910 --> 07:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
occurred for
 
07:48:08.110 --> 07:48:08.120 align:start position:0%
her it was never in the original flawed
 
07:48:11.030 --> 07:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
study to perform surgery on any minors
 
07:48:14.350 --> 07:48:14.360 align:start position:0%
at all and it should not be allowed in
 
07:48:17.350 --> 07:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
any state in America for surgeries like
 
07:48:20.070 --> 07:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
this to continue I urge you to please
 
07:48:21.110 --> 07:48:21.120 align:start position:0%
pass this
 
07:48:23.468 --> 07:48:23.478 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you any questions
 
07:48:26.230 --> 07:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
representative kessle ring thank you Mr
 
07:48:27.830 --> 07:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
chair I have just one question is there
 
07:48:29.628 --> 07:48:29.638 align:start position:0%
any um SA Statics because you've talked
 
07:48:31.190 --> 07:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
a lot about statistics today and
 
07:48:33.070 --> 07:48:33.080 align:start position:0%
different things that specifically
 
07:48:35.788 --> 07:48:35.798 align:start position:0%
relate to uh other side effects that
 
07:48:38.388 --> 07:48:38.398 align:start position:0%
could come from having these uh this
 
07:48:38.398 --> 07:48:39.670 align:start position:0%
could come from having these uh this
breast

07:48:39.670 --> 07:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
breast
 
07:48:43.430 --> 07:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
surgery thank you for your question um
 
07:48:46.430 --> 07:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
in my own spouse's case she had her
 
07:48:49.670 --> 07:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
breast removed was in recovery and was
 
07:48:53.830 --> 07:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
being given morphine she
 
07:48:57.830 --> 07:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
coughed and suddenly had intense pain on
 
07:49:00.590 --> 07:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
the flank side of her chest she had
 
07:49:04.628 --> 07:49:04.638 align:start position:0%
actually torn open the inside sutures
 
07:49:07.150 --> 07:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
and began to bleed out inside of her
 
07:49:11.670 --> 07:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
chest she had to be taken in right away
 
07:49:14.468 --> 07:49:14.478 align:start position:0%
right back in put back under the entire
 
07:49:16.830 --> 07:49:16.840 align:start position:0%
thing had to be opened back up and she
 
07:49:20.548 --> 07:49:20.558 align:start position:0%
had to have this emergency surgery to
 
07:49:22.430 --> 07:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
repair the internal hemat she was
 
07:49:24.230 --> 07:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
bleeding out inside of her
 
07:49:27.628 --> 07:49:27.638 align:start position:0%
chest my close friend pra Mosley had
 
07:49:29.510 --> 07:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
this surgery as a minor
 
07:49:32.750 --> 07:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
she became pregnant she's had a baby we
 
07:49:35.548 --> 07:49:35.558 align:start position:0%
now are seeing D transitioners who have
 
07:49:38.750 --> 07:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
some of their milk Ducks still left in
 
07:49:41.868 --> 07:49:41.878 align:start position:0%
their chest wall milk Ducks will create
 
07:49:44.190 --> 07:49:44.200 align:start position:0%
and fill with milk once baby is born
 
07:49:46.868 --> 07:49:46.878 align:start position:0%
regardless of some of these surgeries or
 
07:49:50.308 --> 07:49:50.318 align:start position:0%
not she was in so much pain that she
 
07:49:52.230 --> 07:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
could not hold her baby because she
 
07:49:54.990 --> 07:49:55.000 align:start position:0%
could not put her baby to her chest
 
07:49:57.430 --> 07:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
without the milk Ducks tightening and
 
07:50:00.070 --> 07:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
hardening inside of chest wall so she
 
07:50:03.510 --> 07:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
had to physically hold her baby in the
 
07:50:06.308 --> 07:50:06.318 align:start position:0%
unnatural way that as a mom I've held
 
07:50:10.990 --> 07:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
all of my infants we simply do not know
 
07:50:13.230 --> 07:50:13.240 align:start position:0%
all of the outcomes that are going to
 
07:50:16.430 --> 07:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
occur when we're cutting off breasts of
 
07:50:19.548 --> 07:50:19.558 align:start position:0%
young women and seeing them mature into
 
07:50:21.990 --> 07:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
older women who might potentially want
 
07:50:23.750 --> 07:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
to have children of their own
 
07:50:27.150 --> 07:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
pregnancies or honestly even
 
07:50:30.030 --> 07:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
utilize this area area for sexual
 
07:50:33.388 --> 07:50:33.398 align:start position:0%
function many women who've never had sex
 
07:50:37.830 --> 07:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
before have no idea that removing this
 
07:50:40.628 --> 07:50:40.638 align:start position:0%
sexual organ could literally impact them
 
07:50:42.388 --> 07:50:42.398 align:start position:0%
for the rest of their life for their
 
07:50:45.628 --> 07:50:45.638 align:start position:0%
ability to have orgasmic pleasure or to
 
07:50:48.150 --> 07:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
have this part of their body be part of
 
07:50:49.948 --> 07:50:49.958 align:start position:0%
an intimate relationship that they might
 
07:50:52.350 --> 07:50:52.360 align:start position:0%
want to have with an adult later on we
 
07:50:53.750 --> 07:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
just simply don't know what we're doing
 
07:50:55.910 --> 07:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
to these
 
07:50:59.868 --> 07:50:59.878 align:start position:0%
kids other questions representative d
 
07:51:02.990 --> 07:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um how old were
 
07:51:04.468 --> 07:51:04.478 align:start position:0%
the uh patients that were being
 
07:51:06.910 --> 07:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
prescribed uh puberty blockers and
 
07:51:10.150 --> 07:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
hormones when these surgeries were being
 
07:51:13.750 --> 07:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
done so one one statement I heard was
 
07:51:15.510 --> 07:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
that there is a requirement you take
 
07:51:18.308 --> 07:51:18.318 align:start position:0%
testosterone first that's not in any
 
07:51:20.868 --> 07:51:20.878 align:start position:0%
guideline there are many people who are
 
07:51:23.388 --> 07:51:23.398 align:start position:0%
now stating that they are nonbinary and
 
07:51:25.430 --> 07:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
seeking to just have their breasts cut
 
07:51:27.388 --> 07:51:27.398 align:start position:0%
off without actually medically
 
07:51:29.468 --> 07:51:29.478 align:start position:0%
transitioning in any way
 
07:51:33.548 --> 07:51:33.558 align:start position:0%
um we had patients who were minors who
 
07:51:35.788 --> 07:51:35.798 align:start position:0%
we were directly referring to
 
07:51:38.388 --> 07:51:38.398 align:start position:0%
surgeons I
 
07:51:38.398 --> 07:51:41.030 align:start position:0%
surgeons I
personally

07:51:41.030 --> 07:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
personally
 
07:51:43.468 --> 07:51:43.478 align:start position:0%
helped uh go around insurance
 
07:51:46.430 --> 07:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
requirements so insurance will cover
 
07:51:49.430 --> 07:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
gynecomastia in insurance plans but will
 
07:51:52.110 --> 07:51:52.120 align:start position:0%
not cover Top surgery often for minors
 
07:51:56.070 --> 07:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
and so I was teaching parents how to lie
 
07:51:58.070 --> 07:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
to get this surgery for their minor
 
07:51:58.080 --> 07:52:01.308 align:start position:0%
to get this surgery for their minor
children

07:52:01.308 --> 07:52:01.318 align:start position:0%
 
07:52:01.318 --> 07:52:03.150 align:start position:0%
