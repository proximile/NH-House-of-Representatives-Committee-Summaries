00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
so I'm here today to introduce this bill
 
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 align:start position:0%
HB 489 as well as an amendment to it
 
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:02.600 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 align:start position:0%
2023-0238h which I've handed out copies
 
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
to everyone
 
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
my original bill
 
00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
as you have copies of that as well
 
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
my original Bill sought to set up a new
 
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
fund managed by business and economic
 
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
Affairs Bea
 
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
to help fund New Hampshire counties with
 
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
grant money to be used for County
 
00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 align:start position:0%
tourism development
 
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 align:start position:0%
in the original bill
 
00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 align:start position:0%
money to fund this initiative would have
 
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
come from the rooms and meals tax
 
00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 align:start position:0%
this has all been changed after
 
00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 align:start position:0%
conversations with Bea commissioner
 
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
Taylor Caswell and travel and tourism
 
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
director Lori harnois
 
00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:49.259 align:start position:0%
they had a better idea and thought to
 
00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:52.259 align:start position:0%
expand their existing joint promotional
 
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
program the jpp
 
00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 align:start position:0%
by adding an Operational Support Program
 
00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
I've also handed out copies of the
 
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 align:start position:0%
original statute that includes or that
 
00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 align:start position:0%
has the language for the joint
 
00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 align:start position:0%
promotional program
 
00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 align:start position:0%
so we came up with this amendment that I
 
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
have before you to the original bill
 
00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
which creates this new Operational
 
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 align:start position:0%
Support Program modeled after the jpp
 
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
this amendment changes the entire bill
 
00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 align:start position:0%
and the name of the bill has also been
 
00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.909 align:start position:0%
and the name of the bill has also been
changed

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:31.979 align:start position:0%
this new program managed through Bea
 
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
would make grant money available to
 
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
County governments to assist with
 
00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:38.819 align:start position:0%
operational costs of their tourism
 
00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:40.979 align:start position:0%
development efforts
 
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.100 align:start position:0%
currently Counties have no means to
 
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
obtain financial help from Bea for
 
00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
County tourism development programs
 
00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:53.220 align:start position:0%
because they're not eligible for the jpp
 
00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.309 align:start position:0%
because they're not eligible for the jpp
program

00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
this will be a great help to counties to
 
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
develop and expand their tourism and
 
00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.060 align:start position:0%
help businesses and the county tax base
 
00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:04.979 align:start position:0%
grow as a result
 
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:06.780 align:start position:0%
this will ultimately bring in more
 
00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:08.699 align:start position:0%
Revenue to the state
 
00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:10.919 align:start position:0%
I hope you can see the value to County
 
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
government in this new program
 
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
and pass this bill with its Amendment
 
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to ask answer any
 
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
questions that you have
 
00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:22.259 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Ahrens just to
 
00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:24.539 align:start position:0%
be clear for everybody here we are
 
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:25.740 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:34.500 align:start position:0%
yes there was another amendment that uh
 
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron had sent to
 
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
everybody and the difference between the
 
00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:41.819 align:start position:0%
two amendments is the elimination of one
 
00:07:41.819 --> 00:07:42.890 align:start position:0%
two amendments is the elimination of one
sentence

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:42.900 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
could you show explain uh tell us which
 
00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
sentence sure
 
00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:48.589 align:start position:0%
sentence sure
um

00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:50.819 align:start position:0%
I have copies of the old Amendment if
 
00:07:53.089 --> 00:07:53.099 align:start position:0%
you'd like me to hand that out to you as
 
00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:57.860 align:start position:0%
well but basically there was a a line
 
00:08:00.409 --> 00:08:00.419 align:start position:0%
let me let me just hand I can hand that
 
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
out to you
 
00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:04.979 align:start position:0%
I don't does everybody have one I think
 
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
everybody has the the First Amendment so
 
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
just tell us which okay line was struck
 
00:08:11.809 --> 00:08:11.819 align:start position:0%
sure this the line that was struck was
 
00:08:14.089 --> 00:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
the last sentence of
 
00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:16.919 align:start position:0%
um Roman numeral two
 
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
it's on line 17 to 21 actually it's
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
lines 20 to 21 which says such grants
 
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
shall only be given to those
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
organizations with which have been in
 
00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
existence for three years prior to the
 
00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
date of the Grant application so my new
 
00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
Amendment strikes that out because if a
 
00:08:38.089 --> 00:08:38.099 align:start position:0%
County Government
 
00:08:38.099 --> 00:08:39.829 align:start position:0%
County Government
is

00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:08:39.839 --> 00:08:41.750 align:start position:0%
is
um

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
seeking to essentially get seed money to
 
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
help in the operations of a new tourism
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
development program that program's not
 
00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
been in existence for three years so
 
00:08:58.370 --> 00:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
um I in my new amendment I struck that
 
00:09:01.009 --> 00:09:01.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for the clarification
 
00:09:03.949 --> 00:09:03.959 align:start position:0%
representative Brown you have a question
 
00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so the uh
 
00:09:06.839 --> 00:09:09.250 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so the uh
Amendment

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:09.260 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:11.820 align:start position:0%
2023-0238h that's the bill in its
 
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:15.180 align:start position:0%
entirety now yes sir thank you
 
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
representative Manchester
 
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:19.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:21.779 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
how does this change the responsibility
 
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:28.860 align:start position:0%
right now the county just has uh
 
00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Correction and Senior Care
 
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
are the two main uh focus and uh so this
 
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
would add to their portfolio of
 
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:45.300 align:start position:0%
responsibilities how would that change
 
00:09:50.449 --> 00:09:50.459 align:start position:0%
the whole dynamics of County
 
00:09:55.009 --> 00:09:55.019 align:start position:0%
well I guess if a county wants to
 
00:09:55.019 --> 00:09:55.790 align:start position:0%
well I guess if a county wants to
um

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:58.910 --> 00:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
allocate some resources to
 
00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
have people in their departments
 
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
maybe in the manager's department or you
 
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
know some of the other departments that
 
00:10:13.690 --> 00:10:13.700 align:start position:0%
they have if they want to establish
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
some folks to work on County tourism
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
they can do that I suppose
 
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
but in the example we have in Sullivan
 
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:23.870 align:start position:0%
but in the example we have in Sullivan
County

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
County
 
00:10:26.449 --> 00:10:26.459 align:start position:0%
we had some people who volunteered their
 
00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:27.290 align:start position:0%
we had some people who volunteered their
time

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
to uh and they they actually we we
 
00:10:32.509 --> 00:10:32.519 align:start position:0%
obtained a grant uh I don't remember
 
00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:35.940 align:start position:0%
from where but uh we we obtained a grant
 
00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
to do some work on uh tourism
 
00:10:41.329 --> 00:10:41.339 align:start position:0%
development and it was called The Sugar
 
00:10:44.569 --> 00:10:44.579 align:start position:0%
River destination Council which I served
 
00:10:49.009 --> 00:10:49.019 align:start position:0%
on I still serve on and what we did was
 
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
the council decided it would be a better
 
00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:54.260 align:start position:0%
thing to form a
 
00:10:58.730 --> 00:10:58.740 align:start position:0%
501c3 or 501c4 organization
 
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
to continue doing the work that the
 
00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
county had begun work on
 
00:11:04.079 --> 00:11:05.690 align:start position:0%
county had begun work on
so

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:05.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:07.860 align:start position:0%
it's possible that the county couldn't
 
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
initiate travel tourism development and
 
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
then help establish another organization
 
00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
within the county that would
 
00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:21.889 align:start position:0%
within the county that would
work

00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:21.899 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
with businesses and with tourism Opera
 
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
you know tourist operators and so forth
 
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:29.329 align:start position:0%
you know tourist operators and so forth
to

00:11:29.329 --> 00:11:29.339 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:11:29.339 --> 00:11:30.230 align:start position:0%
to
um

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
to actually promote and manage and
 
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:46.700 align:start position:0%
I mean it's a great idea in terms of
 
00:11:50.329 --> 00:11:50.339 align:start position:0%
diversification but my concern or have
 
00:11:53.949 --> 00:11:53.959 align:start position:0%
you considered the fact that currently
 
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
counties are experiencing acute shortage
 
00:12:01.009 --> 00:12:01.019 align:start position:0%
of Workforce to deliver services that
 
00:12:02.569 --> 00:12:02.579 align:start position:0%
they have
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
how would this impact the operations of
 
00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:11.220 align:start position:0%
a county I can you know uh would you uh
 
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:14.220 align:start position:0%
have you considered that in terms of the
 
00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:16.200 align:start position:0%
impact on the functioning of the
 
00:12:18.889 --> 00:12:18.899 align:start position:0%
counties as it exists well nobody would
 
00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839 align:start position:0%
be forcing counties to do this kind of
 
00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:23.820 align:start position:0%
work I think it's if the Commissioners
 
00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:25.980 align:start position:0%
in the county decide that this is
 
00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:28.740 align:start position:0%
something that is worthwhile to bring
 
00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
more tourism to their County they may
 
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:41.449 --> 00:12:41.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
um so looking at the amendment uh it
 
00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:47.420 align:start position:0%
says Grant applications
 
00:12:50.329 --> 00:12:50.339 align:start position:0%
shall be reviewed by appropriate staff
 
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
which I'll recommend approval or
 
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
disapproval of applications to the
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Bea um so I'm wondering
 
00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
would that be would they make new hires
 
00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
for this or would this be an additional
 
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:07.740 align:start position:0%
responsibility for existing staff this
 
00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:09.180 align:start position:0%
is this
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
this amendment is modeled exactly after
 
00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
how they run their how Bea runs their
 
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:18.180 align:start position:0%
joint promotional program
 
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
so they would just be doing an expansion
 
00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:24.839 align:start position:0%
and uh called the Operational Support
 
00:13:24.839 --> 00:13:26.329 align:start position:0%
and uh called the Operational Support
Program

00:13:26.329 --> 00:13:26.339 align:start position:0%
Program
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
which is modeled the same it would
 
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
operate the same way as jpp does but the
 
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
funds would be for
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
operations of of a tourism development
 
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:41.240 align:start position:0%
function that the county may have
 
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
or which a non-profit under the auspices
 
00:13:49.009 --> 00:13:49.019 align:start position:0%
of the county may have so it just allows
 
00:13:49.019 --> 00:13:51.230 align:start position:0%
of the county may have so it just allows
for

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:13:54.110 --> 00:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
funds to be used by the county which
 
00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
county the county doesn't have any means
 
00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
right now to access any months any grant
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
money through Bea so this just gives
 
00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
representative lasalles
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm just curious
 
00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:20.519 align:start position:0%
normally when I think of
 
00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
tourism and advertising for tourism I
 
00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:29.000 align:start position:0%
think of States doing this
 
00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:32.940 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering how the you don't
 
00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
normally think of
 
00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
like an ad running come to Sullivan
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
County you know
 
00:14:44.329 --> 00:14:44.339 align:start position:0%
you do see ads for the states and I'm
 
00:14:47.569 --> 00:14:47.579 align:start position:0%
just wondering how this would fit in
 
00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
with the overall State of New Hampshire
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
strategy in encouraging tourists that's
 
00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
a great question because what Bea even
 
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
told us was that their thrust is
 
00:15:07.129 --> 00:15:07.139 align:start position:0%
bringing tourism to New Hampshire in
 
00:15:07.139 --> 00:15:09.170 align:start position:0%
bringing tourism to New Hampshire in
general

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:09.180 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
um so there really is no mechanism
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
whereby the counties can participate and
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
and and do marketing and development
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
work to bring people specifically to a
 
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
particular County
 
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
so this this helps the counties if they
 
00:15:29.030 --> 00:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:15:31.250 --> 00:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
um do some sort of expansion of their
 
00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.569 align:start position:0%
um do some sort of expansion of their
tourism

00:15:32.569 --> 00:15:32.579 align:start position:0%
tourism
 
00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:38.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:40.129 --> 00:15:40.139 align:start position:0%
representative majority
 
00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:44.519 align:start position:0%
taking my question I I think this is a
 
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
great idea I hope this is a great idea
 
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking in section two I just
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
want to see if I fully understand I
 
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
understand the appropriation of 750 000
 
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
to be made out of the out of the current
 
00:15:57.170 --> 00:15:57.180 align:start position:0%
fiscal year and then everything else
 
00:15:59.689 --> 00:15:59.699 align:start position:0%
goes into effect but about the lapsing
 
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:03.300 align:start position:0%
portion in in 2025 I'm not sure I
 
00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.030 align:start position:0%
portion in in 2025 I'm not sure I
understand

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
that the the lapsing portion of that can
 
00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
you explain that to me that's how the
 
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
funds are done through
 
00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:15.540 align:start position:0%
um the regular jpp and again this was
 
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
modeled by uh
 
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
through okay the same it's the same kind
 
00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:23.459 align:start position:0%
of way they they appropriate money it's
 
00:16:25.009 --> 00:16:25.019 align:start position:0%
a biennium
 
00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:34.740 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative so
 
00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:37.380 align:start position:0%
when I look at this I'm I'm my I'm
 
00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:38.389 align:start position:0%
when I look at this I'm I'm my I'm
thinking

00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea as to what the
 
00:16:43.129 --> 00:16:43.139 align:start position:0%
return on investment is with such a
 
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
program and have you looked to any other
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
states that have implemented a similar
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
program and um
 
00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:52.740 align:start position:0%
to get a sense as to how successful
 
00:16:54.769 --> 00:16:54.779 align:start position:0%
something like this would be I don't
 
00:16:56.930 --> 00:16:56.940 align:start position:0%
know that would be a good question for
 
00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
Bea to answer because I don't know what
 
00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:01.860 align:start position:0%
their return on investment is for their
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
uh their promotional dollars so I I
 
00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:08.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:10.980 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
00:17:12.289 --> 00:17:12.299 align:start position:0%
seeing that I have a couple
 
00:17:12.299 --> 00:17:13.610 align:start position:0%
seeing that I have a couple
representative

00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
um kind of following up on what
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher spoke to and I
 
00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:20.540 align:start position:0%
I understand this is modeled after
 
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
existing language but
 
00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
um when I look at line 25 where it talks
 
00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
about appropriate staff to me that's a
 
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
little bit on the
 
00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
vague side as well as on lines 12 and 16
 
00:17:37.610 --> 00:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
pretty much any time where they just
 
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
mention organizations it seems overly
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
broad I don't know if there would be
 
00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
ways to make it more specific if we were
 
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
to move forward with this or not
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
um which lines I'm sorry uh 25 line 25
 
00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:58.850 --> 00:17:58.860 align:start position:0%
and like I say I do understand it's been
 
00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:01.740 align:start position:0%
modeled after existing language but to
 
00:18:03.409 --> 00:18:03.419 align:start position:0%
me that's just a little bit
 
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
I think what that is talking about is a
 
00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
grant applications shall be reviewed by
 
00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate staff from Bea
 
00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
understood which shall recommend
 
00:18:15.409 --> 00:18:15.419 align:start position:0%
approval or disapproval of applications
 
00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner of Bea so they're
 
00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:22.700 align:start position:0%
just saying how they're going to manage
 
00:18:25.490 --> 00:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
managing this program
 
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
understood but you get my drift that I
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
think some of the
 
00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
some of the wording might
 
00:18:34.669 --> 00:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
possibly be a little better maybe I'm
 
00:18:34.679 --> 00:18:35.570 align:start position:0%
possibly be a little better maybe I'm
wrong

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:38.460 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
00:18:42.049 --> 00:18:42.059 align:start position:0%
representative okay appreciate it I do
 
00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:43.799 align:start position:0%
not have any other pink cards does that
 
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
seeing none we'll close the hearing on
 
00:18:55.029 --> 00:18:55.039 align:start position:0%
HB 489 and as I said at the beginning
 
00:18:58.250 --> 00:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
uh the blue sheet has
 
00:19:03.250 --> 00:19:03.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
we have 10 minutes before our next
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
scheduled meeting I think this is a
 
00:19:09.169 --> 00:19:09.179 align:start position:0%
first where we're actually finished
 
00:19:09.179 --> 00:19:11.090 align:start position:0%
first where we're actually finished
early

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
early
 
00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:11.630 align:start position:0%
early
um

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:16.909 --> 00:19:16.919 align:start position:0%
we need to have a discussion
 
00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
two discussions one for Democrats it's
 
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
going to be the exact same discussion
 
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:24.600 align:start position:0%

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:28.020 align:start position:0%

three-minute limit if we can keep the
 
00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:14.110 align:start position:0%
three-minute limit if we can keep the
testimony

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:17.149 --> 00:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
non-repetitive that would be great and
 
00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
with that representative chinigian did I
 
00:33:23.049 --> 00:33:23.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:33.169 --> 00:33:33.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you committee
 
00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is representative
 
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
John janigian I represent Rockingham
 
00:33:39.769 --> 00:33:39.779 align:start position:0%
District 25 which is Salem
 
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
I'm here to introduce HB 202
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
which is a bill relative to property tax
 
00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.970 align:start position:0%
which is a bill relative to property tax
abatements

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:46.980 align:start position:0%
abatements
 
00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:50.940 align:start position:0%
um last session HB 411 was passed and it
 
00:33:53.230 --> 00:33:53.240 align:start position:0%
created a commission to study
 
00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:55.740 align:start position:0%
this issue and the equalization rate
 
00:33:58.250 --> 00:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
used for the calculation of property tax
 
00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:01.740 align:start position:0%
abatements by the New Hampshire Board of
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
tax and land appeals and the superior
 
00:34:07.549 --> 00:34:07.559 align:start position:0%
court and all cities towns and counties
 
00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:10.020 align:start position:0%
the commission met in the summer of last
 
00:34:12.409 --> 00:34:12.419 align:start position:0%
year came up with a wording that you see
 
00:34:14.329 --> 00:34:14.339 align:start position:0%
on HB 202
 
00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
that you have before you
 
00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
I volunteered to put this bill in but
 
00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:20.940 align:start position:0%
the experts testifying after me I think
 
00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:24.839 align:start position:0%
can give a much better idea of of the um
 
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
the why of this wording and then I just
 
00:34:29.869 --> 00:34:29.879 align:start position:0%
want to point out that if you look at
 
00:34:32.290 --> 00:34:32.300 align:start position:0%
the last line
 
00:34:34.849 --> 00:34:34.859 align:start position:0%
where it says
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
the the proposed change of full
 
00:34:39.950 --> 00:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
reassessment to re
 
00:34:42.169 --> 00:34:42.179 align:start position:0%
um oh wait a minute
 
00:34:44.089 --> 00:34:44.099 align:start position:0%
where it says municipal
 
00:34:46.730 --> 00:34:46.740 align:start position:0%
conducts a full reassessment at the end
 
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
there that the words full reassessment
 
00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:52.200 align:start position:0%
um there's a proposed change
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
um to revaluation there and um
 
00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
the ASB the assessing Standards Board
 
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:01.740 align:start position:0%
most recently met and decided that
 
00:35:03.370 --> 00:35:03.380 align:start position:0%
change was appropriate
 
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
I can submit an amendment or I can talk
 
00:35:09.849 --> 00:35:09.859 align:start position:0%
to one of you about that so simple
 
00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:12.660 align:start position:0%
two-word change to one word full
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
reassessment to revaluation
 
00:35:17.329 --> 00:35:17.339 align:start position:0%
that's all I have
 
00:35:17.339 --> 00:35:17.930 align:start position:0%
that's all I have
um

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:17.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
and I think the experts testifying after
 
00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
me can probably answer your questions
 
00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to take you at your word
 
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
on that are there any
 
00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:47.329 --> 00:35:47.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
I have a Jim wheeler
 
00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:54.540 align:start position:0%
representing ASB
 
00:40:04.609 --> 00:40:04.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative
 
00:40:06.720 --> 00:40:08.089 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh representative
Brown

00:40:08.089 --> 00:40:08.099 align:start position:0%
Brown
 
00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:40:12.109 --> 00:40:12.119 align:start position:0%
taking my question so
 
00:40:12.119 --> 00:40:13.010 align:start position:0%
taking my question so
um

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
the gist of it for you is that you want
 
00:40:19.010 --> 00:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
it to be simplified so that
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
so that uh at the time the tax bill is
 
00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
sent out that's the rate that's going to
 
00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:25.079 align:start position:0%
be set correct
 
00:40:25.079 --> 00:40:26.270 align:start position:0%
be set correct
okay

00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chairman follow up
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
so the issue between the initial tax
 
00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
bill and the next tax bill
 
00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
is the concern that the rate changes
 
00:40:40.849 --> 00:40:40.859 align:start position:0%
higher or lower or just that it simply
 
00:40:43.609 --> 00:40:43.619 align:start position:0%
changes during that process so there's a
 
00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
legal issue with that
 
00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:52.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:57.180 align:start position:0%
there we go so it the issue occurs it's
 
00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:58.370 align:start position:0%
there we go so it the issue occurs it's
a

00:40:58.370 --> 00:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
a one-way issue if you will when
 
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
when the property Market is rising
 
00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:08.700 align:start position:0%
the equalization rates typically will
 
00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:10.550 align:start position:0%
the equalization rates typically will
drop

00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
drop
 
00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
and in those instances uh
 
00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
you will see and we see as a firm
 
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
municipality see it there's a myriad of
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
abatement requests that occur that are
 
00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:25.980 align:start position:0%
people call them it's a Equalization
 
00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
rate abatement request for no other
 
00:41:30.589 --> 00:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
reason other than they're taking
 
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
advantage of the fact that the
 
00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:34.700 align:start position:0%
equalization rate is going down now
 
00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:39.900 align:start position:0%
conversely if you expand the frame
 
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
when the property Market is going down
 
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
and Equalization rates are going up and
 
00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:47.820 align:start position:0%
that does occur in fact it happened the
 
00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
year before this Burling case
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know if if everything were Equitable
 
00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
then the taxpayer would come forth and
 
00:41:59.210 --> 00:41:59.220 align:start position:0%
pay a higher Bill to their municipality
 
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
that never happens
 
00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:02.510 align:start position:0%
that never happens
um

00:42:02.510 --> 00:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
in the Berlin case I think it was you
 
00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
know would have been upwards of uh 200
 
00:42:06.599 --> 00:42:07.790 align:start position:0%
know would have been upwards of uh 200
000

00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:09.050 align:start position:0%
000
um

00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
that had the taxpayer had to make an
 
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
adjustment because the equalization rate
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
was going up you know they would pay but
 
00:42:19.609 --> 00:42:19.619 align:start position:0%
that doesn't happen so the the point of
 
00:42:21.890 --> 00:42:21.900 align:start position:0%
the bill is just to
 
00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
make the system more Equitable so the
 
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
rate that's in effect when the bills go
 
00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:29.820 align:start position:0%
out would be the rate that's applied
 
00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:31.980 align:start position:0%
when there's an appeal
 
00:42:34.609 --> 00:42:34.619 align:start position:0%
representative status
 
00:42:36.170 --> 00:42:36.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm so glad you're
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
here because this is so complicated
 
00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:43.740 align:start position:0%
um and I apologize in advance if this is
 
00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:45.900 align:start position:0%
a simple-minded question
 
00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:48.180 align:start position:0%
in the Supreme Court case that you
 
00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:49.430 align:start position:0%
in the Supreme Court case that you
mentioned

00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:42:53.569 --> 00:42:53.579 align:start position:0%
is it in fact true that this legislative
 
00:42:56.089 --> 00:42:56.099 align:start position:0%
language that you are proposing if
 
00:42:58.670 --> 00:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
passed would be contrary to what the
 
00:43:02.569 --> 00:43:02.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:05.990 --> 00:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't view it that way no
 
00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.550 align:start position:0%
um I don't view it that way no
no

00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:15.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question on line six could you
 
00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:18.890 align:start position:0%
taking my question on line six could you
define

00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:18.900 align:start position:0%
define
 
00:43:22.849 --> 00:43:22.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:25.380 align:start position:0%
um I don't actually have the
 
00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:27.060 align:start position:0%
bill in front of me but I mean the
 
00:43:29.329 --> 00:43:29.339 align:start position:0%
median ratio I can say and I'm not an
 
00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
assessor and not an appraiser but median
 
00:43:35.930 --> 00:43:35.940 align:start position:0%
ratio is one of the statistics that is
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
determined by the dra there are you know
 
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
other ratios but the median ratio is the
 
00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
ratio that is used for the equalization
 
00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:49.010 align:start position:0%
ratio that is used for the equalization
rate

00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:50.940 align:start position:0%
and there are assessors who are behind
 
00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
me that can just do a much better job at
 
00:43:56.569 --> 00:43:56.579 align:start position:0%
describing that oh okay you want to wait
 
00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh representative majority
 
00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
um just representative genegian referred
 
00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
to this and I just want to make sure I'm
 
00:44:08.990 --> 00:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
clear I did have uh concern about the
 
00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
term a full reassessment do I can do you
 
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
also agree that that could be changed to
 
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
reval or revaluation rather than
 
00:44:19.609 --> 00:44:19.619 align:start position:0%
reassessment for those towns that do not
 
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
do a full reval full measuring list we
 
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
do a statistical update yes I do okay
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you thank you representative
 
00:44:30.349 --> 00:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:33.950 align:start position:0%
my question
um

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
when you talk about the reassessment
 
00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
only when there is a challenge for
 
00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
abatement to look at the reassessment of
 
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
the property so this applies across
 
00:44:50.089 --> 00:44:50.099 align:start position:0%
single family to commercial to any
 
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
property in the municipality
 
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:57.050 --> 00:44:57.060 align:start position:0%
while you're up there just keep your the
 
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
microphone on so when you answer yeah
 
00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
oh I have to I just yeah there we go
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:45:16.190 --> 00:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
um how would this work with the let's
 
00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:17.089 align:start position:0%
um how would this work with the let's
see

00:45:17.089 --> 00:45:17.099 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:45:20.569 --> 00:45:20.579 align:start position:0%
the bill we passed last year I think or
 
00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:23.940 align:start position:0%
at least in the last session 76 15 a a
 
00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:26.940 align:start position:0%
the quarterly billing of taxes uh
 
00:45:28.849 --> 00:45:28.859 align:start position:0%
certain towns and cities has to do with
 
00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
if there's a big jump in revenues
 
00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:34.700 align:start position:0%
because of a case in Northwood I think
 
00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:37.500 align:start position:0%
would this
 
00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:40.140 align:start position:0%
is this very separate and I mean can we
 
00:45:41.870 --> 00:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
read it as very separate because it's a
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
different section
 
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
oh it's not really
 
00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:47.450 align:start position:0%
oh it's not really
I

00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:47.460 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
I would again probably defer to uh some
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
of the other folks that will speak but I
 
00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
believe that
 
00:45:55.609 --> 00:45:55.619 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not familiar with that bill
 
00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:57.060 align:start position:0%
but that
 
00:45:57.060 --> 00:45:58.010 align:start position:0%
but that
um

00:45:58.010 --> 00:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:00.300 align:start position:0%
the abatement process isn't Changed by
 
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
the bill last year so I think if that's
 
00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
the case then it wouldn't have any
 
00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:08.030 align:start position:0%
the case then it wouldn't have any
effect

00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
representative power you had another
 
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:46:14.089 --> 00:46:14.099 align:start position:0%
you for taking a second question
 
00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:16.140 align:start position:0%
I understand you don't have the bill
 
00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:18.900 align:start position:0%
language in front of you but
 
00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
this bill deals with market value
 
00:46:21.359 --> 00:46:22.970 align:start position:0%
this bill deals with market value
throughout

00:46:22.970 --> 00:46:22.980 align:start position:0%
throughout
 
00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
and on lines three and four
 
00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:30.440 align:start position:0%
um particular statutes are referenced
 
00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:31.990 align:start position:0%
um particular statutes are referenced
RSA

00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:37.700 align:start position:0%
7616 76 16a and 76.
 
00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:39.349 align:start position:0%
7616 76 16a and 76.
17.

00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
17.
 
00:46:42.530 --> 00:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
and when I reference those and looked
 
00:46:44.809 --> 00:46:44.819 align:start position:0%
back there was no reference to market
 
00:46:48.109 --> 00:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
value is that implied with regard to if
 
00:46:50.809 --> 00:46:50.819 align:start position:0%
an abatement is granted there just seem
 
00:46:53.809 --> 00:46:53.819 align:start position:0%
to be some type of a disconnect for me
 
00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
well I think the the term market value
 
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
was there simply because that is the
 
00:47:02.329 --> 00:47:02.339 align:start position:0%
goal of assessment
 
00:47:05.329 --> 00:47:05.339 align:start position:0%
um is to determine the market value of
 
00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
any property when you know for taxation
 
00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
purposes and
 
00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:11.150 align:start position:0%
purposes and
um

00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:13.849 --> 00:47:13.859 align:start position:0%
again without
 
00:47:15.589 --> 00:47:15.599 align:start position:0%
there are folks who can speak better to
 
00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:18.180 align:start position:0%
it but it's it's a it's a
 
00:47:20.890 --> 00:47:20.900 align:start position:0%
you know when you reval when a community
 
00:47:24.589 --> 00:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
conducts a revaluation uh typically once
 
00:47:26.450 --> 00:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
every five years the goal is to bring
 
00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
are there any more questions for Mr
 
00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:36.890 align:start position:0%
are there any more questions for Mr
Wheeler

00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:36.900 align:start position:0%
Wheeler
 
00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none I have a couple for you
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
really quickly uh you talked about the
 
00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:43.260 align:start position:0%
equalization abatement request how many
 
00:47:48.109 --> 00:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:49.849 --> 00:47:49.859 align:start position:0%
um I mean every municipality is
 
00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:51.839 align:start position:0%
different are you asking specifically
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
for uh what how many a municipality may
 
00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:56.390 align:start position:0%
for uh what how many a municipality may
see

00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:47:58.450 --> 00:47:58.460 align:start position:0%
whatever ones that you may be personally
 
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
familiar with well in my current work we
 
00:48:04.609 --> 00:48:04.619 align:start position:0%
see many because we're a firm that does
 
00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
appraisals for multiple municipalities
 
00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
let me give you this this would be a
 
00:48:13.069 --> 00:48:13.079 align:start position:0%
probably a good data point I'm currently
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
aware of two small towns that we serve
 
00:48:20.329 --> 00:48:20.339 align:start position:0%
two small North Country towns that both
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
both towns have on the order of
 
00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:25.140 align:start position:0%
ten to a dozen
 
00:48:27.770 --> 00:48:27.780 align:start position:0%
abatement requests that are solely based
 
00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
on this Equalization issue
 
00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:32.450 align:start position:0%
on this Equalization issue
okay

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:32.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:35.329 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:48:35.329 --> 00:48:35.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
I are the abatement Equalization
 
00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
abatement or quests are they primarily
 
00:48:42.829 --> 00:48:42.839 align:start position:0%
residential or commercial or is there a
 
00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
mix or what's the ratio you commercial
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
the ones that I just spoke about in
 
00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
these small towns are commercial
 
00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
um by large commercial but also you also
 
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
see them in the utility sector obviously
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
a lot of dollars at stake
 
00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
uh when it's a multi-million dollar
 
00:49:02.809 --> 00:49:02.819 align:start position:0%
utility you know whether it's a power
 
00:49:05.569 --> 00:49:05.579 align:start position:0%
plant or or otherwise so is it would it
 
00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
be fair to say it's very few residential
 
00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:11.220 align:start position:0%
I think so I think that's probably a
 
00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:12.780 align:start position:0%
fair statement
 
00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much representative
 
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.910 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much representative
yokella

00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
yokella
 
00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:18.540 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:19.790 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:20.930 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:20.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:23.940 align:start position:0%
is it your understanding that that
 
00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
um that any taxpayer would be able to
 
00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:29.700 align:start position:0%
take advantage of this uh abatement
 
00:49:32.329 --> 00:49:32.339 align:start position:0%
process and and
 
00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
um so it's not disproportionately
 
00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:35.990 align:start position:0%
um so it's not disproportionately
affecting

00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
affecting
 
00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
um uh commercial they're just the ones
 
00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
that are more likely to uh uh go through
 
00:49:48.109 --> 00:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
the process or is or is it special to
 
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
them that they have some special
 
00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:52.130 align:start position:0%
them that they have some special
category

00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:52.140 align:start position:0%
category
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
I I suppose any taxpayer could take
 
00:49:57.290 --> 00:49:57.300 align:start position:0%
advantage of it
 
00:49:57.300 --> 00:49:58.550 align:start position:0%
advantage of it
um

00:49:58.550 --> 00:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:00.290 align:start position:0%
um
again

00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
the taking advantages only when the
 
00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
market is decreasing and there's no
 
00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:07.140 align:start position:0%
adjustment when the I mean when the
 
00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:09.180 align:start position:0%
market is increasing but there's no
 
00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
adjustment when the property Market is
 
00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:15.770 align:start position:0%
adjustment when the property Market is
decreasing

00:50:15.770 --> 00:50:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay so you know more questions thank
 
00:50:18.770 --> 00:50:18.780 align:start position:0%
you very much for your testimony thank
 
00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
also remind everybody when you first
 
00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
speak not only your name but if you're
 
00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:40.849 align:start position:0%
 
microphone

00:50:40.849 --> 00:50:40.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:43.609 --> 00:50:43.619 align:start position:0%
thank you my name is uh Patrick Bigg I'm
 
00:50:45.250 --> 00:50:45.260 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill
 
00:50:48.049 --> 00:50:48.059 align:start position:0%
I represent a commercial product tax
 
00:50:51.049 --> 00:50:51.059 align:start position:0%
management I'm a tax consulting firm
 
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
uh in Manchester New Hampshire
 
00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:55.140 align:start position:0%
we represent
 
00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
many clients both residential and
 
00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:00.780 align:start position:0%
commercial in the tax abatement process
 
00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:05.460 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the tax abatement is to
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
have an Avenue in which the taxpayer can
 
00:51:12.049 --> 00:51:12.059 align:start position:0%
challenge that assessment
 
00:51:13.549 --> 00:51:13.559 align:start position:0%
right on
 
00:51:18.349 --> 00:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
the form 7616 it explains you take the
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
assessment to come up with market value
 
00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:22.980 align:start position:0%
and divide it by the ratio
 
00:51:25.309 --> 00:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
the ratio is a
 
00:51:28.849 --> 00:51:28.859 align:start position:0%
measure of portionality amongst
 
00:51:28.859 --> 00:51:30.250 align:start position:0%
measure of portionality amongst
properties

00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:30.260 align:start position:0%
properties
 
00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
if an abatement is granted
 
00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:36.900 align:start position:0%
I don't understand why
 
00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
the previous year's ratio would be used
 
00:51:44.089 --> 00:51:44.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:47.809 --> 00:51:47.819 align:start position:0%
it would in a down Market
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
um if the assessments are actually in an
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
upmarket if the assessments are dropping
 
00:51:57.170 --> 00:51:57.180 align:start position:0%
um the ratios are dropping
 
00:51:59.089 --> 00:51:59.099 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:51:59.099 --> 00:52:00.010 align:start position:0%
um the
um

00:52:00.010 --> 00:52:00.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
proportionality of that particular
 
00:52:05.089 --> 00:52:05.099 align:start position:0%
property each abatement is have the
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
burden of proof is on the taxpayer
 
00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:08.809 align:start position:0%
burden of proof is on the taxpayer
so

00:52:08.809 --> 00:52:08.819 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:08.819 --> 00:52:09.829 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:52:09.829 --> 00:52:09.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
in this bill as it's written it's
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
assuming that a hundred percent on a
 
00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
revaluation so you ignore
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
the dras methodology for proportionality
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
to come up
 
00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
with a an abatement based on a hundred
 
00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:28.309 align:start position:0%
with a an abatement based on a hundred
percent

00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:30.900 align:start position:0%
and it would ignore year five in the
 
00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:33.180 align:start position:0%
year five year rebound cycle because
 
00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
whatever ratio they came up with there
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
they would use the previous year's ratio
 
00:52:39.730 --> 00:52:39.740 align:start position:0%
to calculate an abatement
 
00:52:43.010 --> 00:52:43.020 align:start position:0%
some of these ratios are changing at a
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
dramatic rate in this market it's not a
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
de minimis amount of money we're talking
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
about if for example you have an
 
00:52:55.150 --> 00:52:55.160 align:start position:0%
assessment of 10 million dollars
 
00:52:59.150 --> 00:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
and in Sunapee this year's ratio dropped
 
00:53:00.770 --> 00:53:00.780 align:start position:0%
20 percent
 
00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:02.460 align:start position:0%
if you have a commercial property or a
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
residential property for that matter at
 
00:53:07.549 --> 00:53:07.559 align:start position:0%
a 10 million dollar market value that's
 
00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:10.020 align:start position:0%
two million dollars in assessment and a
 
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
two percent rate
 
00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
that's you know 10 to 20 percent can can
 
00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:17.809 align:start position:0%
that's you know 10 to 20 percent can can
mean

00:53:17.809 --> 00:53:17.819 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:53:19.609 --> 00:53:19.619 align:start position:0%
um you know ten to twenty thousand
 
00:53:21.290 --> 00:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
dollars or more
 
00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:22.549 align:start position:0%
dollars or more
in

00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
in over in under abating
 
00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:27.180 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that's owed to a
 
00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
taxpayer that has met the burden of
 
00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:30.109 align:start position:0%
taxpayer that has met the burden of
proof

00:53:30.109 --> 00:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
proof
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
with the assessor so
 
00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
the other thing I'd like to point out is
 
00:53:38.329 --> 00:53:38.339 align:start position:0%
when an abatement is filed as of March 1
 
00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:40.140 align:start position:0%
of each year
 
00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
the town has until July 1 to respond to
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
that appeal at that point the ratio is
 
00:53:47.589 --> 00:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
already determined they know what it is
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
Moses most assessors know what their
 
00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:52.260 align:start position:0%
ratio is going to be
 
00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
along the way
 
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
even at the time they issue the bill in
 
00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:57.230 align:start position:0%
even at the time they issue the bill in
December

00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
December
 
00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:58.970 align:start position:0%
December
so

00:53:58.970 --> 00:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:02.690 --> 00:54:02.700 align:start position:0%
they have a pretty good idea of what
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
their what they're assessing in in where
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
their uh information is uh leading them
 
00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
so I think that
 
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
um this would be harmful to the taxpayer
 
00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
um in disproportionate
 
00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:17.809 align:start position:0%
um in disproportionate
um

00:54:17.809 --> 00:54:17.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:20.460 align:start position:0%
if the market goes the other way and
 
00:54:22.849 --> 00:54:22.859 align:start position:0%
Market values start
 
00:54:25.609 --> 00:54:25.619 align:start position:0%
declining you could have in a situation
 
00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:27.180 align:start position:0%
where a ratio is a hundred and ten
 
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
hundred and twenty percent where you
 
00:54:30.589 --> 00:54:30.599 align:start position:0%
could be over abating
 
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
money so I think the question is not
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
using the previous year's ratio but
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
maybe figuring out a way to come up with
 
00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
the ratio prior to the bills going out
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:53.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:54:55.849 --> 00:54:55.859 align:start position:0%
my question yeah can you explain to me
 
00:54:57.950 --> 00:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
like I'm in grammar school okay
 
00:55:01.309 --> 00:55:01.319 align:start position:0%
everything you just said I'm sorry
 
00:55:05.809 --> 00:55:05.819 align:start position:0%
and and what the stakes are here I I get
 
00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
lost between Equalization and ratio and
 
00:55:14.089 --> 00:55:14.099 align:start position:0%
just pretend I'm 10 years old so
 
00:55:16.370 --> 00:55:16.380 align:start position:0%
so the the ratio is established by the
 
00:55:18.890 --> 00:55:18.900 align:start position:0%
dra based on the statistical information
 
00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:21.180 align:start position:0%
that's applied
 
00:55:25.069 --> 00:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
to from the town to the state
 
00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:27.500 align:start position:0%
they get a ratio for that year
 
00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:30.300 align:start position:0%
the problem is at the time of filing the
 
00:55:35.150 --> 00:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
um but by the time you go through the
 
00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
abatement process that ratio is
 
00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:42.109 align:start position:0%
abatement process that ratio is
established

00:55:42.109 --> 00:55:42.119 align:start position:0%
established
 
00:55:42.119 --> 00:55:44.569 align:start position:0%
established
and

00:55:44.569 --> 00:55:44.579 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:49.609 --> 00:55:49.619 align:start position:0%
right on the appeal form under RNC 7616
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
it states that to determine your your
 
00:55:56.329 --> 00:55:56.339 align:start position:0%
assessment you take them
 
00:55:59.030 --> 00:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
or market value take your
 
00:56:01.370 --> 00:56:01.380 align:start position:0%
your assessment and divide it by the
 
00:56:04.490 --> 00:56:04.500 align:start position:0%
ratio and that tells you what the town
 
00:56:08.569 --> 00:56:08.579 align:start position:0%
is saying your market value is
 
00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
and if you the burden of proof is on the
 
00:56:12.530 --> 00:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
taxpay if they feel that it's over
 
00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
assessed they file an appeal go through
 
00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
the process an abatement is granted
 
00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
they have to apply that ratio to the new
 
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
number and calculate the abatement why I
 
00:56:25.609 --> 00:56:25.619 align:start position:0%
don't understand why you would use the
 
00:56:28.609 --> 00:56:28.619 align:start position:0%
previous year's market value ratio that
 
00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
the state in the towns have the ability
 
00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
to appeal 30 days within 30 days of the
 
00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:42.410 --> 00:56:42.420 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry if it
 
00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:46.510 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry if it
yeah

00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
representative bro
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
okay so just a quick clarification I
 
00:56:54.589 --> 00:56:54.599 align:start position:0%
think the two people are testifying to
 
00:56:55.609 --> 00:56:55.619 align:start position:0%
testifying from two different
 
00:56:58.609 --> 00:56:58.619 align:start position:0%
perspectives so can you clarify at this
 
00:57:01.130 --> 00:57:01.140 align:start position:0%
point that my issue would be okay I'm
 
00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
taxed at a certain rate each year yep
 
00:57:06.589 --> 00:57:06.599 align:start position:0%
okay is the issue that okay
 
00:57:08.270 --> 00:57:08.280 align:start position:0%
representative Brown could you pull that
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
mic closer too sure sorry so is the
 
00:57:13.730 --> 00:57:13.740 align:start position:0%
issue that
 
00:57:16.130 --> 00:57:16.140 align:start position:0%
at the time the tax bills come out I'm
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
at one rate and then by the time you do
 
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
the abatement you've got a different
 
00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:23.040 align:start position:0%
rate is it a question of being
 
00:57:25.069 --> 00:57:25.079 align:start position:0%
this is the time that I'm doing it and
 
00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
later on the value might have gone down
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm paying more than I should have I
 
00:57:31.069 --> 00:57:31.079 align:start position:0%
mean that ratio could change right where
 
00:57:32.690 --> 00:57:32.700 align:start position:0%
you could say oh now I've got to pay
 
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
more is that not correct no
 
00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:39.300 align:start position:0%
um it's based on market value and there
 
00:57:42.530 --> 00:57:42.540 align:start position:0%
the assessors are uh determining Market
 
00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
values of April one of each year that's
 
00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
the snapshot in time that they're
 
00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:48.420 align:start position:0%
assessing all properties
 
00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
okay in this and they they do a
 
00:57:51.599 --> 00:57:52.910 align:start position:0%
okay in this and they they do a
statistical

00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
statistical
 
00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
update or or report the ms1 report to
 
00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:00.180 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue and the
 
00:58:02.089 --> 00:58:02.099 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue will say your
 
00:58:04.970 --> 00:58:04.980 align:start position:0%
ratio to Mark you know assessment to
 
00:58:08.329 --> 00:58:08.339 align:start position:0%
Market is this and it's applied to all
 
00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
properties equally for
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
for determining market value
 
00:58:15.890 --> 00:58:15.900 align:start position:0%
so I so what I'm saying is why would you
 
00:58:17.569 --> 00:58:17.579 align:start position:0%
use the previous year's market value
 
00:58:20.450 --> 00:58:20.460 align:start position:0%
ratio to determine an abatement that's
 
00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:23.640 align:start position:0%
granted based on the the numbers that
 
00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:58:28.010 --> 00:58:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up
 
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.790 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up
so

00:58:31.790 --> 00:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
you're just saying do you want to use
 
00:58:37.069 --> 00:58:37.079 align:start position:0%
the current Year's ratio as opposed to a
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
previous ratio correct so it's this
 
00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:40.980 align:start position:0%
correct ratio just more accurate the
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
correct ratio that the state
 
00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
uh sets with the municipality that seems
 
00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward thank you
 
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
so we do see more questions here's what
 
00:58:54.250 --> 00:58:54.260 align:start position:0%
I'm going to also suggest at the end
 
00:58:57.289 --> 00:58:57.299 align:start position:0%
only I'm going to suggest it now for
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
those of you who are for this bill
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
get together and those who are against
 
00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
this bill get together and draw us up
 
00:59:07.849 --> 00:59:07.859 align:start position:0%
some very simplistic scenarios an actual
 
00:59:10.549 --> 00:59:10.559 align:start position:0%
case scenario that you can present to us
 
00:59:12.829 --> 00:59:12.839 align:start position:0%
so we can understand a little better
 
00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
what what you're saying in other words
 
00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
don't don't use a figure like one
 
00:59:18.650 --> 00:59:18.660 align:start position:0%
million two hundred and eighty nine
 
00:59:20.809 --> 00:59:20.819 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars say one million you
 
00:59:23.089 --> 00:59:23.099 align:start position:0%
know just make it a very simple case
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
that you can give to us so we really
 
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
have a good understanding of what you're
 
00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
trying to do represent a man to Puti
 
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for for
 
00:59:33.829 --> 00:59:33.839 align:start position:0%
taking my questions
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
how would this impact different
 
00:59:39.289 --> 00:59:39.299 align:start position:0%
communities high density with more
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
commercial and residential mixed versus
 
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
rural very sparsely
 
00:59:50.109 --> 00:59:50.119 align:start position:0%
populated would it have a very different
 
00:59:56.030 --> 00:59:56.040 align:start position:0%
impact based on the density of
 
00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:57.470 align:start position:0%
impact based on the density of
properties

00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
properties
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
I I in my expert opinion I would say
 
01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:02.650 align:start position:0%
I I in my expert opinion I would say
that

01:00:02.650 --> 01:00:02.660 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:04.849 --> 01:00:04.859 align:start position:0%
municipalities with commercial
 
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
properties would be in a in in
 
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
increasing market value would have more
 
01:00:15.289 --> 01:00:15.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:15.299 --> 01:00:17.270 align:start position:0%
 
that's

01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:00:20.390 --> 01:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
ratios don't deter aren't stratified
 
01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
based on class of property in I would
 
01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:26.220 align:start position:0%
say over 90 percent of the sales that
 
01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:29.700 align:start position:0%
are analyzed by the dra to the for from
 
01:00:31.490 --> 01:00:31.500 align:start position:0%
the municipality are residential in
 
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
nature so if you have an increasing
 
01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
market value of Residential Properties
 
01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:39.900 align:start position:0%
the ratio is going to Free Fall
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
um and it's gonna over assess
 
01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:46.740 align:start position:0%
on market value when applying that ratio
 
01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:48.349 align:start position:0%
on market value when applying that ratio
commercially

01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
commercially
 
01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
because they're not increasing at the
 
01:00:52.370 --> 01:00:52.380 align:start position:0%
same rate that
 
01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
um residential are
 
01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:56.460 align:start position:0%
so I in it
 
01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:57.829 align:start position:0%
so I in it
in a

01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
in a
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
ink that's an increasing market value
 
01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
residentially if if it's declining then
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
it's going to benefit the commercial
 
01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:12.589 align:start position:0%
it's going to benefit the commercial
um

01:01:12.589 --> 01:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:12.599 --> 01:01:14.210 align:start position:0%
 
properties

01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:14.220 align:start position:0%
properties
 
01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
so you know further questions thank you
 
01:01:17.569 --> 01:01:17.579 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony we'll call
 
01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:31.970 --> 01:01:31.980 align:start position:0%
yes representative Guthrie yeah if I
 
01:01:34.309 --> 01:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
could Mr chairman just to get my head
 
01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:37.140 align:start position:0%
straight is it my understanding there is
 
01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:39.780 align:start position:0%
going to be a Amendment
 
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
the sponsor said that there would be an
 
01:01:43.809 --> 01:01:43.819 align:start position:0%
amendment coming forward
 
01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
it would there would be an amendment
 
01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:48.900 align:start position:0%
just changing two words
 
01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:51.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman sure
 
01:01:55.309 --> 01:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Robert gagne I'm here as the
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
vice chair of the assessing Standards
 
01:01:59.270 --> 01:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
Board the chair Betsy Patton couldn't be
 
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
here and she asked me to be here to
 
01:02:04.609 --> 01:02:04.619 align:start position:0%
report on the board's vote as Mr Willis
 
01:02:08.569 --> 01:02:08.579 align:start position:0%
stated at our meeting of January 6th I
 
01:02:12.049 --> 01:02:12.059 align:start position:0%
believe we went over this issue and we
 
01:02:14.569 --> 01:02:14.579 align:start position:0%
voted as the assessing Standards Board
 
01:02:18.289 --> 01:02:18.299 align:start position:0%
to be supportive of this bill with a
 
01:02:21.289 --> 01:02:21.299 align:start position:0%
change in that those two words full
 
01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:24.780 align:start position:0%
reassessment to revaluation so the board
 
01:02:26.450 --> 01:02:26.460 align:start position:0%
is in favor
 
01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:27.230 align:start position:0%
is in favor
um

01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:28.849 --> 01:02:28.859 align:start position:0%
but it might be helpful to have an
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
explanation as to why this was taken up
 
01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:32.180 align:start position:0%
in the first place
 
01:02:35.329 --> 01:02:35.339 align:start position:0%
I think Mr Biggs said that you know we
 
01:02:35.339 --> 01:02:36.250 align:start position:0%
I think Mr Biggs said that you know we
we

01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:36.260 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:39.000 align:start position:0%
use the same ratio to assess all
 
01:02:41.210 --> 01:02:41.220 align:start position:0%
properties and we don't
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
um there are certain properties that we
 
01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
have to assess
 
01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
by the time we submit our ms-1
 
01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
that we have to use the prior Year's
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
ratio for because we don't know the
 
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
current Year's ratio and those property
 
01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
values are based on on that adjustment
 
01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:00.180 align:start position:0%
they include utility properties that we
 
01:03:01.970 --> 01:03:01.980 align:start position:0%
that we have to reassess every year
 
01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
whether we're doing a general
 
01:03:06.109 --> 01:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
revaluation or not they include current
 
01:03:09.430 --> 01:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
use properties and they include any
 
01:03:11.809 --> 01:03:11.819 align:start position:0%
low-income housing tax credit properties
 
01:03:13.609 --> 01:03:13.619 align:start position:0%
that have signed up to be treated under
 
01:03:17.089 --> 01:03:17.099 align:start position:0%
RSA 751a where we have to calculate
 
01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:19.380 align:start position:0%
those values every year so we have to
 
01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
apply a ratio to get their market value
 
01:03:24.410 --> 01:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
to the same general level of assessment
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
as the rest of the city or town the
 
01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
ratio we know about is the prior Year's
 
01:03:32.990 --> 01:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
ratio what happens is we'll set that
 
01:03:36.049 --> 01:03:36.059 align:start position:0%
value send out a tax bill and then if
 
01:03:37.930 --> 01:03:37.940 align:start position:0%
the ratio drops
 
01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
for example a utility property even
 
01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
though we set the value per statute
 
01:03:45.349 --> 01:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
would benefit from a dropping ratio and
 
01:03:47.089 --> 01:03:47.099 align:start position:0%
would come in and seek an abatement with
 
01:03:49.010 --> 01:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
the ratio that was unknown when we set
 
01:03:50.329 --> 01:03:50.339 align:start position:0%
their value
 
01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
now I believe the commission examined
 
01:03:55.250 --> 01:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
more than one way to address this
 
01:03:58.250 --> 01:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
problem and this ended up being in my
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
opinion these least disruptive as far as
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
all the other processes that the state
 
01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
goes through
 
01:04:06.829 --> 01:04:06.839 align:start position:0%
the issue is that the Department of
 
01:04:06.839 --> 01:04:07.809 align:start position:0%
the issue is that the Department of
Revenue

01:04:07.809 --> 01:04:07.819 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
01:04:10.849 --> 01:04:10.859 align:start position:0%
establishes an equalization ratio to
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
determine the market value of every city
 
01:04:16.430 --> 01:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
and town in the state every year
 
01:04:19.309 --> 01:04:19.319 align:start position:0%
and it's based on an April 1st date
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
and they use a sales period of six
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
months before and after April 1st so
 
01:04:25.970 --> 01:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
it's October 1st of the prior year
 
01:04:28.370 --> 01:04:28.380 align:start position:0%
through September 30th of the current
 
01:04:31.309 --> 01:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
year is that study period
 
01:04:33.289 --> 01:04:33.299 align:start position:0%
because of that
 
01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:35.220 align:start position:0%
and and the ms-1 needs to be submitted
 
01:04:37.789 --> 01:04:37.799 align:start position:0%
by September 1st we don't know what the
 
01:04:39.829 --> 01:04:39.839 align:start position:0%
current Year's ratio is
 
01:04:42.710 --> 01:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
um the state so one of the solutions
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
would have been hey change that period
 
01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
of time so that you know the current
 
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
Year's ratio
 
01:04:49.849 --> 01:04:49.859 align:start position:0%
when you set the tax rate and send out
 
01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
the tax bills have that period be the 12
 
01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
months leading up to April 1st
 
01:04:58.089 --> 01:04:58.099 align:start position:0%
the problem with that is that it it
 
01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:01.140 align:start position:0%
disrupts the the primary task the
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue has to do and I
 
01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:04.740 align:start position:0%
believe they have a representative here
 
01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
and he can probably address this
 
01:05:07.380 --> 01:05:08.210 align:start position:0%
and he can probably address this
um

01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:08.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
right now because you're using six
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
months before and after April 1st you
 
01:05:14.089 --> 01:05:14.099 align:start position:0%
don't have to time Trend the sales to
 
01:05:15.890 --> 01:05:15.900 align:start position:0%
get to the right number if it's an
 
01:05:17.809 --> 01:05:17.819 align:start position:0%
increasing or decreasing Market you have
 
01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
you know some sales before and after and
 
01:05:23.809 --> 01:05:23.819 align:start position:0%
it it evens out for the most part
 
01:05:25.309 --> 01:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
um in an increasing Market if you set
 
01:05:27.770 --> 01:05:27.780 align:start position:0%
the ratio into 12 months before
 
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
it's going to fall short of that
 
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
Equalization number they're seeking
 
01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
the Department's Equalization process is
 
01:05:38.109 --> 01:05:38.119 align:start position:0%
primarily for that
 
01:05:40.549 --> 01:05:40.559 align:start position:0%
equalizing cities and towns for purposes
 
01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
of the county tax and school aid and so
 
01:05:45.049 --> 01:05:45.059 align:start position:0%
forth the median ratio and the other
 
01:05:46.849 --> 01:05:46.859 align:start position:0%
statistics they generate is are our
 
01:05:49.490 --> 01:05:49.500 align:start position:0%
byproduct it's not their primary goal to
 
01:05:50.589 --> 01:05:50.599 align:start position:0%
set those
 
01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:53.460 align:start position:0%
so they provide them as part part of the
 
01:05:56.569 --> 01:05:56.579 align:start position:0%
process but there's a mismatch between
 
01:05:59.569 --> 01:05:59.579 align:start position:0%
the equalization process and the
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
abatement process
 
01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
again there would have been other
 
01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:04.799 align:start position:0%
solutions to this like changing that
 
01:06:06.349 --> 01:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
time frame but that would have been very
 
01:06:09.289 --> 01:06:09.299 align:start position:0%
disruptive to what the dra does I can
 
01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:10.980 align:start position:0%
tell you that from an assessing
 
01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
standpoint from the assessor for the
 
01:06:14.930 --> 01:06:14.940 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester I was skeptical about
 
01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:16.799 align:start position:0%
this change for some of the same reasons
 
01:06:20.210 --> 01:06:20.220 align:start position:0%
that Mr Big indicated that you know by
 
01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
the time we process the abatements we
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
know what the ratio is
 
01:06:26.029 --> 01:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
but after listening to and talking with
 
01:06:27.890 --> 01:06:27.900 align:start position:0%
the members of the commission and and
 
01:06:29.450 --> 01:06:29.460 align:start position:0%
seeing what they had to deal with to get
 
01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:30.839 align:start position:0%
to this point
 
01:06:30.839 --> 01:06:31.370 align:start position:0%
to this point
um

01:06:31.370 --> 01:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:34.309 --> 01:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
I think this is a reasonable solution
 
01:06:36.410 --> 01:06:36.420 align:start position:0%
um you know this this way those
 
01:06:38.569 --> 01:06:38.579 align:start position:0%
properties for which we have to use the
 
01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
prior years ratio to send out the tax
 
01:06:42.289 --> 01:06:42.299 align:start position:0%
bill you know utilities current use
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
low-income housing tax credit properties
 
01:06:45.119 --> 01:06:45.950 align:start position:0%
low-income housing tax credit properties
um

01:06:45.950 --> 01:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
using with this statute we'd be applying
 
01:06:50.329 --> 01:06:50.339 align:start position:0%
the same ratio to all of the other
 
01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:53.220 align:start position:0%
properties in a municipality so and it
 
01:06:55.849 --> 01:06:55.859 align:start position:0%
and it and I also want to make clear
 
01:06:57.770 --> 01:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
something that was said that may not
 
01:06:59.029 --> 01:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
have been said
 
01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:00.660 align:start position:0%
loudly enough
 
01:07:03.710 --> 01:07:03.720 align:start position:0%
this can work both ways in a declining
 
01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:04.910 align:start position:0%
this can work both ways in a declining
Market

01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
Market
 
01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:07.799 align:start position:0%
the ratio is going to be over 1
 
01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
the city or town can't go back and Bill
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
those properties that underpaid for the
 
01:07:15.710 --> 01:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
last year because per Supreme Court
 
01:07:17.930 --> 01:07:17.940 align:start position:0%
decision in Pheasant Lane Mall once we
 
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
send out a tax bill we can't recoup if
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
if the value was wrong
 
01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
that's case law so in those cases as Mr
 
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
Wheeler indicated when the Market's
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
decreasing this works in favor of those
 
01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
properties utilities commercial
 
01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
properties it works against a
 
01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:38.270 align:start position:0%
properties it works against a
municipality

01:07:38.270 --> 01:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
01:07:40.970 --> 01:07:40.980 align:start position:0%
in in that decreasing Market where the
 
01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
ratio should get us more tax revenue
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
from those properties and it doesn't
 
01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
so I think this is the least disruptive
 
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
and and the cleanest
 
01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:58.970 --> 01:07:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:02.029 --> 01:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
representative yokella
 
01:08:03.770 --> 01:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:05.210 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:05.220 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:07.789 align:start position:0%
question
um

01:08:07.789 --> 01:08:07.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
are are you
 
01:08:10.079 --> 01:08:12.049 align:start position:0%
are are you
um

01:08:12.049 --> 01:08:12.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:17.950 --> 01:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
saying that when a tax bill goes out
 
01:08:23.209 --> 01:08:23.219 align:start position:0%
that the bill is not based on the
 
01:08:26.809 --> 01:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
current years for for at least some of
 
01:08:31.130 --> 01:08:31.140 align:start position:0%
them you you exam gave examples of of uh
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
some situations where you're doing the
 
01:08:37.789 --> 01:08:37.799 align:start position:0%
prior year assessment but is it
 
01:08:40.910 --> 01:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
isn't it the case that they that the
 
01:08:43.249 --> 01:08:43.259 align:start position:0%
final tax bill in usually in December
 
01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
for at least my town
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
is using the actual
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
um rate set by the dra for the Abate for
 
01:08:59.650 --> 01:08:59.660 align:start position:0%
the um the ratio for that current year
 
01:09:02.749 --> 01:09:02.759 align:start position:0%
correct so it's it's the tax rate based
 
01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
on the assessed value
 
01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:07.140 align:start position:0%
now if every property
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
changed in value at the same rate
 
01:09:12.289 --> 01:09:12.299 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be having this conversation
 
01:09:14.269 --> 01:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
the issue occurs so in the year of the
 
01:09:16.010 --> 01:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
reval we're all at market value or
 
01:09:17.169 --> 01:09:17.179 align:start position:0%
that's the target
 
01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:20.100 align:start position:0%
so so that tax rate is applied to that
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
as time goes on
 
01:09:24.289 --> 01:09:24.299 align:start position:0%
resident when the Market's increasing
 
01:09:26.510 --> 01:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
rapidly it's really as Mr Big said it's
 
01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
you know 90 percent of the of the
 
01:09:31.249 --> 01:09:31.259 align:start position:0%
activity is Residential Properties going
 
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
up commercial properties don't change at
 
01:09:35.150 --> 01:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
the same rate for a lot of reasons
 
01:09:35.160 --> 01:09:35.809 align:start position:0%
the same rate for a lot of reasons
um

01:09:35.809 --> 01:09:35.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
you know generally commercial property
 
01:09:39.229 --> 01:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
that's investment it's tied to a lease
 
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
that's more than a year you can't raise
 
01:09:43.789 --> 01:09:43.799 align:start position:0%
your rates on that like you can on a
 
01:09:45.169 --> 01:09:45.179 align:start position:0%
residential property whether it's an
 
01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
apartment or not so values diverge as
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
you go along
 
01:09:50.329 --> 01:09:50.339 align:start position:0%
um I'll give you an example
 
01:09:50.339 --> 01:09:50.930 align:start position:0%
um I'll give you an example
um

01:09:50.930 --> 01:09:50.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:52.739 align:start position:0%
in the year of the reval in Manchester
 
01:09:52.739 --> 01:09:53.830 align:start position:0%
in the year of the reval in Manchester
last

01:09:53.830 --> 01:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:09:58.189 --> 01:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
2021 our ratio is 96.1 percent
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
in a year of revalue is supposed to be
 
01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
between 90 and 110 so we will find I
 
01:10:05.209 --> 01:10:05.219 align:start position:0%
just yesterday got I probably shouldn't
 
01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
say this in front of Mr big but I will
 
01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:07.729 align:start position:0%
say this in front of Mr big but I will
anyways

01:10:07.729 --> 01:10:07.739 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
um we just got our ratio yesterday and
 
01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
again it's a 30-day period to challenge
 
01:10:15.290 --> 01:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
it but we're at 82.2 percent so we went
 
01:10:19.850 --> 01:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
from 96 to 82.2 in a year that's an
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
indication that the market increased
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
roughly 15 16 in a year
 
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
it's all driven by residential sales
 
01:10:29.570 --> 01:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
Commerce you know single-family condo
 
01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
small multis two to four family
 
01:10:34.490 --> 01:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
commercial properties
 
01:10:36.050 --> 01:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
with a few exceptions commercial
 
01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:38.340 align:start position:0%
properties didn't change at that rate so
 
01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:40.679 align:start position:0%
that tax rate that we're applying to the
 
01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
assessment may be unequal as you go away
 
01:10:46.729 --> 01:10:46.739 align:start position:0%
from the revalue year and the abatement
 
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
process is how we take care of that
 
01:10:51.610 --> 01:10:51.620 align:start position:0%
right you apply for local abatement
 
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
it's market value times the ratio this
 
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
is just determining which ratio it is
 
01:10:58.970 --> 01:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
and there was a question about
 
01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:01.189 align:start position:0%
and there was a question about
um

01:11:01.189 --> 01:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:03.610 --> 01:11:03.620 align:start position:0%
about 76 16
 
01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
in 16a and 17 not talking about market
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
value I'm looking at the language on
 
01:11:13.850 --> 01:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
line three and four of the proposal
 
01:11:16.010 --> 01:11:16.020 align:start position:0%
and what it says is if an abatement is
 
01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:17.689 align:start position:0%
and what it says is if an abatement is
granted

01:11:17.689 --> 01:11:17.699 align:start position:0%
granted
 
01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
with a determination of market value so
 
01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
I'm skipping the quote so it doesn't
 
01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
need market value doesn't need to be
 
01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
quoted in 76 16a or 17 it's addressed
 
01:11:30.649 --> 01:11:30.659 align:start position:0%
here if the abatement that's being
 
01:11:30.659 --> 01:11:32.030 align:start position:0%
here if the abatement that's being
granted

01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
granted
 
01:11:34.430 --> 01:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
is because of the market value you're
 
01:11:37.250 --> 01:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
going to apply that ratio so so we do
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
apply that ratio this is just a matter
 
01:11:40.930 --> 01:11:40.940 align:start position:0%
which ratio we're going to apply
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
again you know I was skeptical about
 
01:11:47.090 --> 01:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
this initially it's a tough problem uh
 
01:11:50.330 --> 01:11:50.340 align:start position:0%
and and you know as was stated we kind
 
01:11:51.890 --> 01:11:51.900 align:start position:0%
of know where our ratio is going to be
 
01:11:54.530 --> 01:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
if we are close to our sales and have
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
been working with those unfortunately we
 
01:12:00.050 --> 01:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
don't have that official ratio when the
 
01:12:01.729 --> 01:12:01.739 align:start position:0%
tax rate is set and when the bills go
 
01:12:01.739 --> 01:12:02.530 align:start position:0%
tax rate is set and when the bills go
out

01:12:02.530 --> 01:12:02.540 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:12:05.450 --> 01:12:05.460 align:start position:0%
so it's a problem
 
01:12:06.890 --> 01:12:06.900 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:08.030 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
majority

01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
majority
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Sharon thank you for taking
 
01:12:11.149 --> 01:12:11.159 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:12:12.890 --> 01:12:12.900 align:start position:0%
um I bet when I asked this question I
 
01:12:14.570 --> 01:12:14.580 align:start position:0%
realized how little I know even though
 
01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
I've been doing this for a little while
 
01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
um does this have any effect on the
 
01:12:20.630 --> 01:12:20.640 align:start position:0%
coefficient of dispersion or because I
 
01:12:22.850 --> 01:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
do look at that when when we get that
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
number I'm just curious if it affects
 
01:12:27.050 --> 01:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
that ratio in such a way that the town
 
01:12:31.330 --> 01:12:31.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:34.130 --> 01:12:34.140 align:start position:0%
the Cod doesn't the coefficient of
 
01:12:37.729 --> 01:12:37.739 align:start position:0%
dispersion doesn't come into play as far
 
01:12:39.649 --> 01:12:39.659 align:start position:0%
as the abatement process
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
it might be an indication when that gets
 
01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
too high that you need to do something
 
01:12:46.490 --> 01:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
that that you know your your
 
01:12:49.010 --> 01:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
um your data is not good or whatever so
 
01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
it's another indicator of the quality of
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
your values
 
01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:54.530 align:start position:0%
your values
um

01:12:54.530 --> 01:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
but I I don't think it would have an
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
impact on on what this legislation is
 
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
so like my question is is the issue
 
01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:08.209 align:start position:0%
so like my question is is the issue
um

01:13:08.209 --> 01:13:08.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
related to the fact that the commercial
 
01:13:13.370 --> 01:13:13.380 align:start position:0%
rate ratio is should possibly be
 
01:13:15.470 --> 01:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
different than the residential ratio to
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
address this as opposed to that way it's
 
01:13:22.130 --> 01:13:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:24.229 --> 01:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear you could hear a
 
01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
lot of opinions about that there's been
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
arguments about that
 
01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
um over time that you know it the
 
01:13:32.810 --> 01:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
commercial property shouldn't shouldn't
 
01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:33.709 align:start position:0%
commercial property shouldn't shouldn't
um

01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
take advantage of a dropping ratio
 
01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:38.570 align:start position:0%
take advantage of a dropping ratio
um

01:13:38.570 --> 01:13:38.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:41.570 --> 01:13:41.580 align:start position:0%
here's the thing State of New Hampshire
 
01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
we all pay
 
01:13:45.410 --> 01:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
property taxes based on
 
01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
a general level of assessment market
 
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
value doesn't matter if it's a single
 
01:13:51.649 --> 01:13:51.659 align:start position:0%
family The Mall of New Hampshire they're
 
01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
only required to pay their fair share
 
01:13:55.790 --> 01:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
and so long as we're all paying the same
 
01:13:57.649 --> 01:13:57.659 align:start position:0%
tax rate meaning we don't have a split
 
01:13:59.570 --> 01:13:59.580 align:start position:0%
rate where commercial properties pay a
 
01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
different rate like Massachusetts has
 
01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
that where you can have a different rate
 
01:14:05.810 --> 01:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
for residential versus commercial in
 
01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
that case I would say you ought to be
 
01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
using a ratio for each
 
01:14:13.430 --> 01:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
where it's one tax rate here uh I think
 
01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
to be fair in my definition of fair is
 
01:14:17.149 --> 01:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter who the taxpayer is
 
01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
we're only required to pay our share
 
01:14:23.450 --> 01:14:23.460 align:start position:0%
um then I I think we we need to use the
 
01:14:25.610 --> 01:14:25.620 align:start position:0%
single rate and we shouldn't have a rate
 
01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:28.140 align:start position:0%
different rate for for residential the
 
01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:29.580 align:start position:0%
solution would be to do a rebal every
 
01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
year it's just that's expensive that's
 
01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
my next question that's expensive it's
 
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
not required by law it's not required by
 
01:14:37.310 --> 01:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
uh by the Constitution it's it's every
 
01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:48.410 --> 01:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
representative yakella
 
01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you for taking the
 
01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:51.350 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you for taking the
question

01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:52.910 align:start position:0%
question
so

01:14:52.910 --> 01:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:55.450 --> 01:14:55.460 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to understand
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
why we would consider the previous year
 
01:15:00.890 --> 01:15:00.900 align:start position:0%
if if we're if
 
01:15:03.050 --> 01:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
you were assessed
 
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh you are reevaluated and occurring in
 
01:15:09.530 --> 01:15:09.540 align:start position:0%
in the year 2000 you
 
01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:10.669 align:start position:0%
in the year 2000 you
um

01:15:10.669 --> 01:15:10.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:13.010 --> 01:15:13.020 align:start position:0%
file for an abatement because you
 
01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
believe that is incorrect in the year
 
01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
2000 for the tax bill that's in 2000
 
01:15:24.169 --> 01:15:24.179 align:start position:0%
why would you be cons why is it proper
 
01:15:27.370 --> 01:15:27.380 align:start position:0%
to be considering year 1999
 
01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:15:34.149 --> 01:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
for that new assessment
 
01:15:37.310 --> 01:15:37.320 align:start position:0%
uh valuation
 
01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:38.450 align:start position:0%
uh valuation
um

01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:38.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:41.209 --> 01:15:41.219 align:start position:0%
because isn't the the
 
01:15:41.219 --> 01:15:42.110 align:start position:0%
because isn't the the
um

01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
the new assessed value based off of that
 
01:15:50.330 --> 01:15:50.340 align:start position:0%
new uh ratio
 
01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a good question because
 
01:15:55.250 --> 01:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
per this proposal
 
01:15:58.490 --> 01:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
in that year the revaluation 2000 if you
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
set new values we would be we would
 
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
assume you're at a hundred percent
 
01:16:05.689 --> 01:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
so the ratio would be a hundred it would
 
01:16:08.209 --> 01:16:08.219 align:start position:0%
be it would be the current ratio in the
 
01:16:10.430 --> 01:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
year of the revaluation
 
01:16:12.770 --> 01:16:12.780 align:start position:0%
it's what happens as you move away from
 
01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:14.760 align:start position:0%
that year
 
01:16:18.530 --> 01:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
that that's a concern that this seeks to
 
01:16:21.770 --> 01:16:21.780 align:start position:0%
address that in that second year
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
now you're not necessarily applying the
 
01:16:25.490 --> 01:16:25.500 align:start position:0%
tax rate to
 
01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
the same market value for everybody
 
01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
right so if residential is increasing
 
01:16:31.729 --> 01:16:31.739 align:start position:0%
faster than commercial
 
01:16:33.649 --> 01:16:33.659 align:start position:0%
you know that ratio is going to indicate
 
01:16:33.659 --> 01:16:34.910 align:start position:0%
you know that ratio is going to indicate
that

01:16:34.910 --> 01:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:35.530 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:16:35.530 --> 01:16:35.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
it's complicated it's complicated for
 
01:16:39.290 --> 01:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
somebody who's been in it for 20 years
 
01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:42.290 align:start position:0%
somebody who's been in it for 20 years
so

01:16:42.290 --> 01:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:46.189 --> 01:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
again you know your point about using
 
01:16:49.130 --> 01:16:49.140 align:start position:0%
if we could like split off those utility
 
01:16:51.530 --> 01:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
properties and current use properties on
 
01:16:53.570 --> 01:16:53.580 align:start position:0%
low-income housing tax credit properties
 
01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
from consideration meaning okay
 
01:16:58.610 --> 01:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
because we had to use last year's ratio
 
01:17:01.130 --> 01:17:01.140 align:start position:0%
to tack those that's the ratio that they
 
01:17:02.750 --> 01:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
have to use for the abatement process
 
01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
I would be fine with using the current
 
01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
ratio for the new abatements because
 
01:17:10.790 --> 01:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
that's the level of assessment
 
01:17:13.130 --> 01:17:13.140 align:start position:0%
the issue is follow-up
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
am I incorrect that says that that I was
 
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
saying that you would be using based on
 
01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
this language that you would be using
 
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
1999 because you seem to be saying that
 
01:17:29.810 --> 01:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
you would be using the hundred percent
 
01:17:33.290 --> 01:17:33.300 align:start position:0%
for this year but in the language it
 
01:17:35.810 --> 01:17:35.820 align:start position:0%
says you would be using
 
01:17:38.510 --> 01:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
the prior year so you don't am I
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
confused yeah so you don't use the prior
 
01:17:43.850 --> 01:17:43.860 align:start position:0%
year in a year of reevaluation that's
 
01:17:47.689 --> 01:17:47.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
um so the last sentence line seven and
 
01:17:51.649 --> 01:17:51.659 align:start position:0%
eight the market value of the property
 
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
shall be equalized at a hundred percent
 
01:17:55.250 --> 01:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
in any tax year for which the
 
01:17:58.610 --> 01:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
municipality conducts a revaluation if
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
you amend that in accordance with RSA 75
 
01:18:06.050 --> 01:18:06.060 align:start position:0%
1 and 75 8A so in that example if if
 
01:18:09.770 --> 01:18:09.780 align:start position:0%
2000 was the year of the reval
 
01:18:12.050 --> 01:18:12.060 align:start position:0%
you would use a hundred percent you
 
01:18:20.209 --> 01:18:20.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:20.219 --> 01:18:23.209 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:18:23.209 --> 01:18:23.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
seeing no more we do need to move on
 
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
we're getting extremely behind thank you
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:39.370 --> 01:18:39.380 align:start position:0%

Representatives
 
01:18:56.689 --> 01:18:56.699 align:start position:0%
been in business here in New Hampshire
 
01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:00.060 align:start position:0%
for just about 30 years now representing
 
01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:01.430 align:start position:0%
for just about 30 years now representing
taxpayers

01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
01:19:02.689 --> 01:19:02.699 align:start position:0%
so I understand there's a lot of
 
01:19:04.130 --> 01:19:04.140 align:start position:0%
confusion about
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
rates and ratios and
 
01:19:10.850 --> 01:19:10.860 align:start position:0%
that assessments and and taxes
 
01:19:13.689 --> 01:19:13.699 align:start position:0%
um one one easy way to explain I think
 
01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
the ratio is that when a municipality
 
01:19:19.610 --> 01:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
does a revaluation they typically here
 
01:19:21.310 --> 01:19:21.320 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire do it every five years
 
01:19:23.870 --> 01:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
although there are some municipalities
 
01:19:25.490 --> 01:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
that choose to do it more frequently
 
01:19:28.130 --> 01:19:28.140 align:start position:0%
some annually
 
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
but when they do the revaluation the
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
goal is to get all the assessed values
 
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
to Market
 
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
so they'll adjust each value depending
 
01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
on the actions of the market because
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
every property changes in value in
 
01:19:43.010 --> 01:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
different ways it's not simply
 
01:19:45.649 --> 01:19:45.659 align:start position:0%
residential versus commercial there's
 
01:19:47.630 --> 01:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
lots of segments in a market
 
01:19:50.450 --> 01:19:50.460 align:start position:0%
there's vacant land there's Condominiums
 
01:19:51.950 --> 01:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
there's mobile homes there's
 
01:19:54.350 --> 01:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
single-family homes and then on the
 
01:19:56.590 --> 01:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
commercial side there's a a whole
 
01:19:59.030 --> 01:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
variety of properties as well they all
 
01:20:01.010 --> 01:20:01.020 align:start position:0%
move it at different
 
01:20:02.870 --> 01:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
rates over the years and that's why they
 
01:20:04.610 --> 01:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
have a revaluation but when they do the
 
01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
revaluation it's at a hundred percent
 
01:20:09.709 --> 01:20:09.719 align:start position:0%
and what happens is is that in this
 
01:20:12.890 --> 01:20:12.900 align:start position:0%
current market as the as as the market
 
01:20:16.250 --> 01:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
values go up the ratio as a percentage
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
of market value goes down so if the
 
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
market value goes up by 10 in a year
 
01:20:25.490 --> 01:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
then the ratio will be approximately 90
 
01:20:27.050 --> 01:20:27.060 align:start position:0%
percent and then if it goes up another
 
01:20:29.390 --> 01:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
10 percent the next year then the ratio
 
01:20:31.490 --> 01:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
Falls to you know approximately a little
 
01:20:33.950 --> 01:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
over 80 percent so
 
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
um so that's the relationship between
 
01:20:38.209 --> 01:20:38.219 align:start position:0%
that assessed value and the market value
 
01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
and whenever you can test an assessment
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire the the ratio is
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
an integral part of any tax appeal it's
 
01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
it's how the
 
01:20:51.169 --> 01:20:51.179 align:start position:0%
State determines proportionality a lot
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
of people think proportionality is
 
01:20:55.490 --> 01:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
another term that people misunderstand a
 
01:20:57.110 --> 01:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
lot a lot of people think it has to do
 
01:20:59.330 --> 01:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
with similar properties in town and you
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
want to be assessed in a similar fashion
 
01:21:03.610 --> 01:21:03.620 align:start position:0%
but it really has to do with
 
01:21:06.290 --> 01:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
proportionality is the relationship of
 
01:21:09.770 --> 01:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
of you the market value to the assessed
 
01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
value considering the ratio so you need
 
01:21:14.330 --> 01:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
all three of those components and any
 
01:21:16.130 --> 01:21:16.140 align:start position:0%
successful tax appeal
 
01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
and it's not necessarily to one side's
 
01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
advantage or the other it just depends
 
01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
on the market and in this current market
 
01:21:27.290 --> 01:21:27.300 align:start position:0%
which is unprecedented in my in my
 
01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:28.430 align:start position:0%
which is unprecedented in my in my
experience

01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:21:30.649 --> 01:21:30.659 align:start position:0%
we've had values going up dramatically
 
01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
for Residential Properties and some
 
01:21:36.169 --> 01:21:36.179 align:start position:0%
commercial properties as well but
 
01:21:38.330 --> 01:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
largely Residential Properties are
 
01:21:40.330 --> 01:21:40.340 align:start position:0%
leading the charge
 
01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that this bill the
 
01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
way it's written would just introduce an
 
01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
inequity into the system and I think it
 
01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
would probably benefit the
 
01:21:55.910 --> 01:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities in an up Market but I
 
01:21:57.890 --> 01:21:57.900 align:start position:0%
think that should the market start to go
 
01:22:00.350 --> 01:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
down which it will when I first got into
 
01:22:02.330 --> 01:22:02.340 align:start position:0%
this business a lot of the ratios were
 
01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:08.100 align:start position:0%
over 100 percent 110 120 130 140 percent
 
01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
as showing that the assessed value as it
 
01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
related to the market value the assessed
 
01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
value was quite a bit higher than the
 
01:22:17.450 --> 01:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
market value so very different from
 
01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
today and I think in a market like that
 
01:22:21.709 --> 01:22:21.719 align:start position:0%
you know this type of legislation could
 
01:22:21.719 --> 01:22:22.970 align:start position:0%
you know this type of legislation could
benefit

01:22:22.970 --> 01:22:22.980 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:22:26.149 --> 01:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
the uh the taxpayer so I think I think
 
01:22:27.530 --> 01:22:27.540 align:start position:0%
there could be some unintended
 
01:22:30.530 --> 01:22:30.540 align:start position:0%
consequences here uh with this proposed
 
01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:31.930 align:start position:0%
consequences here uh with this proposed
legislation

01:22:31.930 --> 01:22:31.940 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:22:35.090 --> 01:22:35.100 align:start position:0%
but that the benefit of the abatement
 
01:22:37.850 --> 01:22:37.860 align:start position:0%
process is that it's retroactive the the
 
01:22:40.430 --> 01:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
municipality is looking back on the
 
01:22:42.410 --> 01:22:42.420 align:start position:0%
previous year so the municipality is
 
01:22:44.090 --> 01:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
able to kind of like the instant replay
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
in in a football game or something they
 
01:22:48.770 --> 01:22:48.780 align:start position:0%
can look it over again and and take a
 
01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
look at the whole market and they have
 
01:22:51.709 --> 01:22:51.719 align:start position:0%
all the information in front of them
 
01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:55.080 align:start position:0%
looking back including the ratio
 
01:22:56.689 --> 01:22:56.699 align:start position:0%
um I will say it is a challenge for
 
01:22:58.189 --> 01:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayers when they're filing for
 
01:23:00.350 --> 01:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
abatement because the Department of
 
01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration doesn't publish
 
01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
their ratio until after abatement
 
01:23:06.830 --> 01:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
applications are due and that is a
 
01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
problem for taxpayers because they're
 
01:23:10.729 --> 01:23:10.739 align:start position:0%
they're kind of in the dark as to what
 
01:23:12.590 --> 01:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
the ratio is
 
01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
but as uh
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
as the assessor for Manchester Mr gagne
 
01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
just testified they know the ratio right
 
01:23:21.649 --> 01:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
now you know down to a tenth of a
 
01:23:22.970 --> 01:23:22.980 align:start position:0%
percentage point I mean they know
 
01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
exactly what their ratio is and
 
01:23:27.169 --> 01:23:27.179 align:start position:0%
abatement applications aren't due until
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
March 1st so
 
01:23:30.890 --> 01:23:30.900 align:start position:0%
to me I think it's more of an issue of
 
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
transparency that the Department of
 
01:23:35.689 --> 01:23:35.699 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration if there's any
 
01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
way that they could get their ratio out
 
01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
a little sooner if the municipalities
 
01:23:43.250 --> 01:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
would would provide this information to
 
01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers there's a lot of taxpayers
 
01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that don't even know
 
01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:48.719 align:start position:0%
what the ratio is they don't even know
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
that there is a ratio they assume that
 
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
the assessed value that they have is the
 
01:23:54.950 --> 01:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities estimate of the fair
 
01:23:56.229 --> 01:23:56.239 align:start position:0%
market value
 
01:23:59.209 --> 01:23:59.219 align:start position:0%
so I think I don't think it's so much of
 
01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
a loophole that we're talking about here
 
01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
I think it's just a fairness issue and I
 
01:24:06.709 --> 01:24:06.719 align:start position:0%
hate the basis legislation on what I
 
01:24:07.970 --> 01:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
consider to be
 
01:24:11.330 --> 01:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
atypical properties like utilities and
 
01:24:14.390 --> 01:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
current use I mean those are two wildly
 
01:24:15.649 --> 01:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
at the other end of the spectrum
 
01:24:18.110 --> 01:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
properties one current use being
 
01:24:21.410 --> 01:24:21.420 align:start position:0%
assessed for so low uh based on uh
 
01:24:23.870 --> 01:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
legislation and utilities so high
 
01:24:26.030 --> 01:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
because they have that value so I don't
 
01:24:28.130 --> 01:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
think it would be fair to to have
 
01:24:30.350 --> 01:24:30.360 align:start position:0%
legislation based on these these type of
 
01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:32.149 align:start position:0%
legislation based on these these type of
extremes

01:24:32.149 --> 01:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
extremes
 
01:24:34.010 --> 01:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to testify
 
01:24:37.370 --> 01:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
thank you do we have any questions
 
01:24:39.050 --> 01:24:39.060 align:start position:0%
I have one
 
01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:41.510 align:start position:0%
I have one
um

01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:44.090 --> 01:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
your company property tax advisors uh
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
could you give me approximate
 
01:24:49.729 --> 01:24:49.739 align:start position:0%
ratio of the work that you do
 
01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:58.669 --> 01:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:00.890 --> 01:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
three quarters of our work is is
 
01:25:03.530 --> 01:25:03.540 align:start position:0%
commercial and one quarter is
 
01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:04.910 align:start position:0%
commercial and one quarter is
residential

01:25:04.910 --> 01:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
residential
 
01:25:08.689 --> 01:25:08.699 align:start position:0%
we really uh the abatement is set up to
 
01:25:10.910 --> 01:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of properties that are
 
01:25:13.130 --> 01:25:13.140 align:start position:0%
out of step with the market so when we
 
01:25:15.169 --> 01:25:15.179 align:start position:0%
file for an abatement it tends to be on
 
01:25:17.149 --> 01:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
properties that aren't in step with the
 
01:25:20.090 --> 01:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
ratio and that can be residential or
 
01:25:21.410 --> 01:25:21.420 align:start position:0%
commercial but to answer your question
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
totally understood okay any other
 
01:25:26.030 --> 01:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:29.510 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:30.590 align:start position:0%
question
um

01:25:30.590 --> 01:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:33.050 align:start position:0%
um
when

01:25:33.050 --> 01:25:33.060 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:25:37.130 --> 01:25:37.140 align:start position:0%
it so there is a requirement that every
 
01:25:40.450 --> 01:25:40.460 align:start position:0%
five years the entire
 
01:25:43.250 --> 01:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
municipality is is essentially
 
01:25:43.260 --> 01:25:45.290 align:start position:0%
municipality is is essentially
reassessed

01:25:45.290 --> 01:25:45.300 align:start position:0%
reassessed
 
01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:46.630 align:start position:0%
reassessed
um

01:25:46.630 --> 01:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
in my municipality they are doing a
 
01:25:58.149 --> 01:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:03.649 --> 01:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
does the um does the re-evaluation
 
01:26:03.659 --> 01:26:05.270 align:start position:0%
does the um does the re-evaluation
um

01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
language that is being proposed because
 
01:26:10.189 --> 01:26:10.199 align:start position:0%
it's not no longer full reassessment
 
01:26:13.370 --> 01:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
it's now considered re-evaluation how
 
01:26:15.169 --> 01:26:15.179 align:start position:0%
does that
 
01:26:19.850 --> 01:26:19.860 align:start position:0%
um in your opinion factor into
 
01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:22.090 align:start position:0%
um in your opinion factor into
uh

01:26:22.090 --> 01:26:22.100 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities that do this constant
 
01:26:29.090 --> 01:26:29.100 align:start position:0%
reevaluation versus a single uh
 
01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:30.290 align:start position:0%
reevaluation versus a single uh
five-year

01:26:30.290 --> 01:26:30.300 align:start position:0%
five-year
 
01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
reassessment I'm not an assessor but in
 
01:26:35.689 --> 01:26:35.699 align:start position:0%
observing the way municipalities behave
 
01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
certain municipalities will
 
01:26:40.729 --> 01:26:40.739 align:start position:0%
just do a complete revaluation every
 
01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
five years others have a kind of a
 
01:26:45.229 --> 01:26:45.239 align:start position:0%
rolling approach that you mentioned
 
01:26:47.390 --> 01:26:47.400 align:start position:0%
others have these statistical updates
 
01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:49.610 align:start position:0%
others have these statistical updates
which

01:26:49.610 --> 01:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
appears to be a revaluation but might
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
not involve a complete measure in list
 
01:26:55.610 --> 01:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
so I think there's a variety of
 
01:26:57.950 --> 01:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
approaches that the municipalities use
 
01:26:59.750 --> 01:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
so I don't know how I think that would
 
01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
just further confuse the language of the
 
01:27:04.729 --> 01:27:04.739 align:start position:0%
uh of the pro of the bill but uh
 
01:27:06.649 --> 01:27:06.659 align:start position:0%
um I don't know specifically how that
 
01:27:09.110 --> 01:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
would affect your town
 
01:27:10.490 --> 01:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
so you know more questions thank you for
 
01:27:12.410 --> 01:27:12.420 align:start position:0%
your testimony we have one last pink
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:25.669 --> 01:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to testify
 
01:27:27.410 --> 01:27:27.420 align:start position:0%
my name is Scott Barlett I am the
 
01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
assessor of the town of Goffstown I was
 
01:27:32.030 --> 01:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
on the equalization commission I was
 
01:27:33.770 --> 01:27:33.780 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor I do have
 
01:27:35.390 --> 01:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
written testimony
 
01:27:37.010 --> 01:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
um would you like me to just leave that
 
01:27:38.930 --> 01:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
up here just leave it on that other pile
 
01:27:40.850 --> 01:27:40.860 align:start position:0%
we'll distribute it afterwards thank you
 
01:27:43.550 --> 01:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
okay I won't go over everything I'll try
 
01:27:44.990 --> 01:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
to be brief
 
01:27:47.689 --> 01:27:47.699 align:start position:0%
a couple points I want to make as an
 
01:27:49.610 --> 01:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
assessors it is my job to assess
 
01:27:52.189 --> 01:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
property as of April 1st and what is
 
01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
known as of April 1st
 
01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
as of April 1st I know
 
01:28:02.209 --> 01:28:02.219 align:start position:0%
the previous year's Equalization study
 
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
the previous year's Equalization study
 
01:28:08.030 --> 01:28:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh so if I was talking last year 2022 so
 
01:28:11.450 --> 01:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
the 2021 Equalization study would have
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
used sales from
 
01:28:15.770 --> 01:28:15.780 align:start position:0%
October 1st
 
01:28:18.050 --> 01:28:18.060 align:start position:0%
to September 30th
 
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
and that is usually released sometime in
 
01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
January or February so at the time that
 
01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
I am assessing property which is April
 
01:28:28.610 --> 01:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
1st that is what is known
 
01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
okay now do I know that other sales have
 
01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
occurred yes I do
 
01:28:35.570 --> 01:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
but typically when I'm doing my analysis
 
01:28:38.350 --> 01:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
and I'm looking forward to set my values
 
01:28:40.910 --> 01:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not considering what happens after
 
01:28:43.669 --> 01:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
April 1st the ratio study that will come
 
01:28:43.679 --> 01:28:45.410 align:start position:0%
April 1st the ratio study that will come
out

01:28:45.410 --> 01:28:45.420 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:28:48.430 --> 01:28:48.440 align:start position:0%
prior after that subsequent to that for
 
01:28:52.189 --> 01:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
2022 use a six months of sales after
 
01:28:54.350 --> 01:28:54.360 align:start position:0%
April 1st those are not known as of
 
01:28:55.750 --> 01:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
April 1st
 
01:29:00.530 --> 01:29:00.540 align:start position:0%
I do not consider the dras ratio study
 
01:29:03.290 --> 01:29:03.300 align:start position:0%
to be the best way to determine what I
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
consider to be the level of assessment
 
01:29:06.669 --> 01:29:06.679 align:start position:0%
as available first
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
it is what we have now on the commission
 
01:29:11.870 --> 01:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
we did discuss a lot of different
 
01:29:13.790 --> 01:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
approaches and I'll be honest with you
 
01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
this is not the best approach it is the
 
01:29:18.169 --> 01:29:18.179 align:start position:0%
most practical approach
 
01:29:20.209 --> 01:29:20.219 align:start position:0%
the best approach would be to use what
 
01:29:23.149 --> 01:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
is considered a time-adjusted ratio
 
01:29:25.729 --> 01:29:25.739 align:start position:0%
study using six or using 12 months of
 
01:29:28.850 --> 01:29:28.860 align:start position:0%
sales prior to April 1st as an assessor
 
01:29:30.470 --> 01:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
I do that and just to give you an
 
01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
example of of how ratios change my ratio
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
in 2021 was 70 percent
 
01:29:40.850 --> 01:29:40.860 align:start position:0%
I did a trended Time trended approach to
 
01:29:42.410 --> 01:29:42.420 align:start position:0%
determine what I considered to be my
 
01:29:45.709 --> 01:29:45.719 align:start position:0%
ratio as of April 1st of 2022 I came out
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
at 68 percent
 
01:29:51.290 --> 01:29:51.300 align:start position:0%
I just received my dra
 
01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:52.610 align:start position:0%
I just received my dra
um

01:29:52.610 --> 01:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
Equalization survey by median ratio is
 
01:29:58.550 --> 01:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
63 so I have three different ratios
 
01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:00.070 align:start position:0%
63 so I have three different ratios
there

01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:30:02.750 --> 01:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
if we use the best approach we I would
 
01:30:05.870 --> 01:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
be using 68 but again is that practical
 
01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:07.370 align:start position:0%
be using 68 but again is that practical
no

01:30:07.370 --> 01:30:07.380 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:30:09.649 --> 01:30:09.659 align:start position:0%
you know I have the expertise to be able
 
01:30:11.570 --> 01:30:11.580 align:start position:0%
to do that I have the resources to be
 
01:30:13.610 --> 01:30:13.620 align:start position:0%
able to do that but I'll be honest with
 
01:30:16.850 --> 01:30:16.860 align:start position:0%
you most municipalities do not
 
01:30:19.310 --> 01:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
and that is the problem
 
01:30:19.320 --> 01:30:20.330 align:start position:0%
and that is the problem
um

01:30:20.330 --> 01:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:23.330 --> 01:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
so it really comes down to fairness
 
01:30:26.750 --> 01:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of properties are
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
being valued based on what we know as of
 
01:30:31.370 --> 01:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
April 1st
 
01:30:33.709 --> 01:30:33.719 align:start position:0%
when someone files an abatement they're
 
01:30:33.719 --> 01:30:34.729 align:start position:0%
when someone files an abatement they're
getting

01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:34.739 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:30:36.830 --> 01:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
the benefit of hindsight
 
01:30:38.990 --> 01:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
and that I do not believe that is the
 
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
intent I do not believe that is
 
01:30:43.729 --> 01:30:43.739 align:start position:0%
Equitable I just would like to refer to
 
01:30:45.890 --> 01:30:45.900 align:start position:0%
a couple comments or a couple of
 
01:30:48.649 --> 01:30:48.659 align:start position:0%
statements that were made in the Supreme
 
01:30:50.570 --> 01:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
Court decision
 
01:30:50.580 --> 01:30:52.209 align:start position:0%
Court decision
um

01:30:52.209 --> 01:30:52.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
disproportionality and not methodology
 
01:30:56.870 --> 01:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
is the linchpin and establishing
 
01:30:59.149 --> 01:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
entitlement to a petition for abatement
 
01:31:01.610 --> 01:31:01.620 align:start position:0%
end quote essentially what this saying
 
01:31:03.770 --> 01:31:03.780 align:start position:0%
is using a ratio for appeal properties
 
01:31:06.770 --> 01:31:06.780 align:start position:0%
is different than the known ratio
 
01:31:10.669 --> 01:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
is not is just disproportionate
 
01:31:13.070 --> 01:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh one more quote from the Supreme Court
 
01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:14.330 align:start position:0%
uh one more quote from the Supreme Court
decision

01:31:14.330 --> 01:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:31:16.910 --> 01:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
um begin quote we note that the dra's
 
01:31:19.010 --> 01:31:19.020 align:start position:0%
equalization studies do not precisely
 
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
coincide with any particular tax year
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
a tax year runs from April 1st to March
 
01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:25.669 align:start position:0%
a tax year runs from April 1st to March
31st

01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
31st
 
01:31:28.189 --> 01:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
however the dra's equalization studies
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
run from October 1st to December 30th
 
01:31:35.149 --> 01:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
therefore no dra Equalization ratio is
 
01:31:38.330 --> 01:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
based on every single sale sorry on
 
01:31:40.370 --> 01:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
every sale occurring during the 12
 
01:31:43.189 --> 01:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
months immediately proceeding April 1st
 
01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
so again
 
01:31:47.810 --> 01:31:47.820 align:start position:0%
emphasizing my point sales that occur
 
01:31:50.629 --> 01:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
Apple after April 1st are not known and
 
01:31:53.689 --> 01:31:53.699 align:start position:0%
should not be part of a
 
01:31:56.570 --> 01:31:56.580 align:start position:0%
ratio that is used for abatement
 
01:31:59.149 --> 01:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
purposes I do have more comments that
 
01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
are in my written testimony I will stop
 
01:32:03.530 --> 01:32:03.540 align:start position:0%
there and I would enter entertain any
 
01:32:03.540 --> 01:32:05.990 align:start position:0%
there and I would enter entertain any
questions

01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:32:08.810 --> 01:32:08.820 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
01:32:10.310 --> 01:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:32:13.250 --> 01:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
is this legislation an attempt to fix a
 
01:32:18.590 --> 01:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
deficit on the part of the dra
 
01:32:20.750 --> 01:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
is that what we're looking at here that
 
01:32:25.370 --> 01:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
they're the the ratios are not accurate
 
01:32:27.890 --> 01:32:27.900 align:start position:0%
or in some way adequate and this
 
01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
legislation is attempt to kind of
 
01:32:32.090 --> 01:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
shoehorn a solution around that problem
 
01:32:35.149 --> 01:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for the question
 
01:32:38.510 --> 01:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
um no it is not uh one of the points
 
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
that that Mr gagne was making is that
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
the primary purpose of the equalization
 
01:32:45.290 --> 01:32:45.300 align:start position:0%
study is not to equalize between
 
01:32:47.810 --> 01:32:47.820 align:start position:0%
individual properties its primary
 
01:32:49.689 --> 01:32:49.699 align:start position:0%
purpose is to equalize between
 
01:32:52.550 --> 01:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
communities between municipalities it
 
01:32:55.010 --> 01:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
works extremely well for that
 
01:32:57.950 --> 01:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work extremely well for
 
01:33:00.110 --> 01:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
equalizing between properties within a
 
01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:06.850 align:start position:0%
equalizing between properties within a
town

01:33:06.850 --> 01:33:06.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative manager Puti
 
01:33:12.290 --> 01:33:12.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:33:15.709 --> 01:33:15.719 align:start position:0%
my question so if I understand
 
01:33:18.890 --> 01:33:18.900 align:start position:0%
um do you believe that the equalization
 
01:33:23.450 --> 01:33:23.460 align:start position:0%
is a lagging dra's Equalization ratio is
 
01:33:26.990 --> 01:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
lagging behind uh
 
01:33:30.590 --> 01:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
the wave if you're setting as an
 
01:33:33.410 --> 01:33:33.420 align:start position:0%
assessor at April 1st so you're
 
01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
reflecting on the back
 
01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:41.159 align:start position:0%
rear view mirror to get that so and
 
01:33:45.350 --> 01:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
also this is like you just said a couple
 
01:33:48.110 --> 01:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
or apples to oranges
 
01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
01:33:50.159 --> 01:33:52.030 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
um

01:33:52.030 --> 01:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:54.290 --> 01:33:54.300 align:start position:0%
again when you look at the primary
 
01:33:56.450 --> 01:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
purpose of the equalization survey no it
 
01:33:58.010 --> 01:33:58.020 align:start position:0%
is not lagging
 
01:34:01.610 --> 01:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
but when you start looking at the
 
01:34:04.490 --> 01:34:04.500 align:start position:0%
Assessor's duties
 
01:34:07.010 --> 01:34:07.020 align:start position:0%
is it the perfect solution
 
01:34:08.629 --> 01:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
for using for equalizing between
 
01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
properties no it is not
 
01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
but it is what we have one of the
 
01:34:14.930 --> 01:34:14.940 align:start position:0%
problems we have
 
01:34:17.390 --> 01:34:17.400 align:start position:0%
with our current system is that we have
 
01:34:20.270 --> 01:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
a five-year cycle and we are required to
 
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
revalue properties every five years
 
01:34:25.250 --> 01:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
but the abatement process essentially
 
01:34:27.770 --> 01:34:27.780 align:start position:0%
creates a one-year cycle
 
01:34:31.250 --> 01:34:31.260 align:start position:0%
and it creates a a cycle of hindsight
 
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
which again to me as an assessor I
 
01:34:38.030 --> 01:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:40.669 --> 01:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
for other taxpayers those who don't file
 
01:34:43.370 --> 01:34:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:44.689 --> 01:34:44.699 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:34:47.030 --> 01:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe you said at the
 
01:34:48.110 --> 01:34:48.120 align:start position:0%
beginning but I'm assuming you're in
 
01:34:49.790 --> 01:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill oh I'm sorry I
 
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
apologize yes I am in favor of this one
 
01:34:53.390 --> 01:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
last question quickly representative
 
01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:57.229 align:start position:0%
last question quickly representative
yokella

01:34:57.229 --> 01:34:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:59.209 --> 01:34:59.219 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
01:34:59.219 --> 01:35:00.229 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:35:00.239 --> 01:35:03.350 align:start position:0%
question
um

01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:06.590 --> 01:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
am I correct uh
 
01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
when I'm looking at this this language
 
01:35:11.629 --> 01:35:11.639 align:start position:0%
based on my previous question of a of a
 
01:35:14.209 --> 01:35:14.219 align:start position:0%
previous uh speaker
 
01:35:14.219 --> 01:35:15.229 align:start position:0%
previous uh speaker
um

01:35:15.229 --> 01:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:18.890 --> 01:35:18.900 align:start position:0%
it seemed to be that that the first
 
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
sentence of how we're going to
 
01:35:24.410 --> 01:35:24.420 align:start position:0%
determinate determine someone's
 
01:35:24.420 --> 01:35:25.430 align:start position:0%
determinate determine someone's
um

01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:27.050 align:start position:0%
um
uh

01:35:27.050 --> 01:35:27.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:35:30.830 --> 01:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
ratio is is
 
01:35:33.050 --> 01:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
uh the previous year
 
01:35:36.890 --> 01:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
in situations where it's not a full
 
01:35:40.370 --> 01:35:40.380 align:start position:0%
reassessment year and then a hundred
 
01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
percent for years that it is a
 
01:35:46.490 --> 01:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
reassessment year is that your
 
01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
understanding of how this should be
 
01:35:48.719 --> 01:35:50.930 align:start position:0%
understanding of how this should be
interpreted

01:35:50.930 --> 01:35:50.940 align:start position:0%
interpreted
 
01:35:50.940 --> 01:35:51.649 align:start position:0%
interpreted
um

01:35:51.649 --> 01:35:51.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:53.570 --> 01:35:53.580 align:start position:0%
were you referring to your previous
 
01:35:55.250 --> 01:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you for the question
 
01:35:56.570 --> 01:35:56.580 align:start position:0%
but were you referring to your previous
 
01:35:58.370 --> 01:35:58.380 align:start position:0%
question about how your town does
 
01:36:00.709 --> 01:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
one-fifth a year
 
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
no no okay I mean so
 
01:36:06.530 --> 01:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
clarify yeah
 
01:36:06.540 --> 01:36:08.209 align:start position:0%
clarify yeah
um

01:36:08.209 --> 01:36:08.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:08.219 --> 01:36:09.290 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:36:09.290 --> 01:36:09.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:36:15.350 --> 01:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
the um the language here says that
 
01:36:17.510 --> 01:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
um market value of the property for a
 
01:36:19.010 --> 01:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
given year shall be equalized by
 
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
multiplying the market value of the
 
01:36:23.090 --> 01:36:23.100 align:start position:0%
property by the previous tax year
 
01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
so that's one situation of what you're
 
01:36:27.770 --> 01:36:27.780 align:start position:0%
supposed to do and then in the second
 
01:36:30.350 --> 01:36:30.360 align:start position:0%
sentence it says something else do
 
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
something else and so my
 
01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
01:36:38.090 --> 01:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
is it an if
 
01:36:40.129 --> 01:36:40.139 align:start position:0%
um if you're doing this then do this
 
01:36:41.990 --> 01:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
ratio if you're doing that do this other
 
01:36:45.169 --> 01:36:45.179 align:start position:0%
ratio or do this other math equation
 
01:36:47.149 --> 01:36:47.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yes now I understand the
 
01:36:47.159 --> 01:36:48.229 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yes now I understand the
question

01:36:48.229 --> 01:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
um yes it is an if
 
01:36:52.129 --> 01:36:52.139 align:start position:0%
um so essentially in my town in
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
Goffstown I am doing a revaluation this
 
01:36:58.490 --> 01:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
year I'm doing value Anew in 2023. so
 
01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
when I am dealing with 2023 abatements
 
01:37:05.149 --> 01:37:05.159 align:start position:0%
by this law I would use 100 percent
 
01:37:08.149 --> 01:37:08.159 align:start position:0%
in all other years when I am not doing a
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
revaluation I would be looking at the
 
01:37:11.870 --> 01:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
previous years
 
01:37:18.530 --> 01:37:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:18.540 --> 01:37:20.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:37:20.990 --> 01:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony I don't
 
01:37:26.530 --> 01:37:26.540 align:start position:0%
have any more pink cards for this bill
 
01:37:29.149 --> 01:37:29.159 align:start position:0%
on the blue sign-in sheet I have three
 
01:37:31.850 --> 01:37:31.860 align:start position:0%
four and two against and with that we'll
 
01:37:41.209 --> 01:37:41.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:43.030 --> 01:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
open up the hearing on
 
01:37:46.070 --> 01:37:46.080 align:start position:0%

01:40:00.110 --> 01:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
just request to minor changes could you
 
01:40:01.970 --> 01:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
please introduce us who you are and
 
01:40:04.490 --> 01:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
whether you're foreign well Charles
 
01:40:06.530 --> 01:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
Nickerson uh senior director of Finance
 
01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
for Arkham County I'm for this bill
 
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh this bill basically makes two basic
 
01:40:14.930 --> 01:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
changes basically Common Sense updates
 
01:40:18.050 --> 01:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
to the existing RSA
 
01:40:21.290 --> 01:40:21.300 align:start position:0%
um basically we are looking to kind of
 
01:40:23.149 --> 01:40:23.159 align:start position:0%
bring into the 21st century as far as
 
01:40:26.090 --> 01:40:26.100 align:start position:0%
instead of having copies of the
 
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
executive committee proposed budget to
 
01:40:30.530 --> 01:40:30.540 align:start position:0%
the overall County Convention to be made
 
01:40:32.450 --> 01:40:32.460 align:start position:0%
available at the county courthouse for
 
01:40:35.570 --> 01:40:35.580 align:start position:0%
and said that to be posted online on the
 
01:40:38.270 --> 01:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
respective County's websites I believe
 
01:40:40.070 --> 01:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
currently that's already kind of the
 
01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
process that's done by uh you know by
 
01:40:44.870 --> 01:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
whoever's in charge of of monitoring the
 
01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
county websites
 
01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
um also we'd be looking to provide and
 
01:40:52.129 --> 01:40:52.139 align:start position:0%
this will be coming forth in a in a
 
01:40:53.870 --> 01:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
future amendment that representative
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
Edwards will be proposing to the
 
01:40:56.990 --> 01:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
committee but
 
01:40:58.729 --> 01:40:58.739 align:start position:0%
um what should be the language in the
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
bill is that basically that the the
 
01:41:02.090 --> 01:41:02.100 align:start position:0%
budgets need to go out for the
 
01:41:05.930 --> 01:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
Commissioners proposed by May 3rd
 
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
but May 10th should remain as the date
 
01:41:12.830 --> 01:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
deadline date for the public hearing so
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
that will be a future proposed amendment
 
01:41:15.950 --> 01:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
that representative Edwards will bring
 
01:41:17.590 --> 01:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
forward to the committee
 
01:41:20.030 --> 01:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
basically this will give one week
 
01:41:22.970 --> 01:41:22.980 align:start position:0%
separation that the stakeholders are
 
01:41:24.890 --> 01:41:24.900 align:start position:0%
receiving these proposed Commissioners
 
01:41:27.410 --> 01:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
budgets have to look at it and to know
 
01:41:28.970 --> 01:41:28.980 align:start position:0%
whether or not they should be in
 
01:41:31.610 --> 01:41:31.620 align:start position:0%
attendance for that you know public
 
01:41:33.770 --> 01:41:33.780 align:start position:0%
hearing on the commissioner's proposed
 
01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:38.270 align:start position:0%
hearing on the commissioner's proposed
budget

01:41:38.270 --> 01:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:40.970 --> 01:41:40.980 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
01:41:42.890 --> 01:41:42.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:41:44.930 --> 01:41:44.940 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I'm looking at the
 
01:41:48.649 --> 01:41:48.659 align:start position:0%
text of the bill and on line 15
 
01:41:48.659 --> 01:41:49.370 align:start position:0%
text of the bill and on line 15
um

01:41:49.370 --> 01:41:49.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:52.990 --> 01:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:56.510 --> 01:41:56.520 align:start position:0%
inserts or amends to to include the
 
01:41:58.669 --> 01:41:58.679 align:start position:0%
words or delivered could you please
 
01:42:00.770 --> 01:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
define the word delivered and what is
 
01:42:02.870 --> 01:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
what's meant by that so it might mean
 
01:42:04.850 --> 01:42:04.860 align:start position:0%
something different between Hillsboro OR
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
Rockin counties at at you know Rockham
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
County basically the the delivery is
 
01:42:13.189 --> 01:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
actually two by mail to each and every
 
01:42:15.530 --> 01:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
individual representative
 
01:42:17.629 --> 01:42:17.639 align:start position:0%
so as far as Rockin County that's that's
 
01:42:19.850 --> 01:42:19.860 align:start position:0%
how we've interpreted that we have the
 
01:42:22.609 --> 01:42:22.619 align:start position:0%
budgets delivered by mail to each and
 
01:42:24.649 --> 01:42:24.659 align:start position:0%
every uh state representative from
 
01:42:33.169 --> 01:42:33.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:35.810 --> 01:42:35.820 align:start position:0%
representative Yokel
 
01:42:37.250 --> 01:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:39.410 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

01:42:39.410 --> 01:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:42:42.109 --> 01:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
um from your testimony it seemed that
 
01:42:46.129 --> 01:42:46.139 align:start position:0%
you would prefer that there be some time
 
01:42:50.570 --> 01:42:50.580 align:start position:0%
before between delivery of the
 
01:42:55.490 --> 01:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
um the uh budget and the hearing on the
 
01:42:57.770 --> 01:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
budget however
 
01:43:00.050 --> 01:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
um it says
 
01:43:00.060 --> 01:43:02.990 align:start position:0%
um it says
um

01:43:02.990 --> 01:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:07.669 --> 01:43:07.679 align:start position:0%
that the the dates all say prior to so
 
01:43:10.729 --> 01:43:10.739 align:start position:0%
couldn't that technically be they could
 
01:43:13.790 --> 01:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
have a public hearing date on May 1st
 
01:43:15.890 --> 01:43:15.900 align:start position:0%
and they could give you the budgets on
 
01:43:17.990 --> 01:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
May 2nd and still be in compliance with
 
01:43:21.950 --> 01:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:26.209 --> 01:43:26.219 align:start position:0%
they it could I again the intent was to
 
01:43:28.850 --> 01:43:28.860 align:start position:0%
technically provide some some difference
 
01:43:31.250 --> 01:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
so whether maybe instead the future
 
01:43:32.810 --> 01:43:32.820 align:start position:0%
Amendment says
 
01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
yeah well again it's hard to say May
 
01:43:36.649 --> 01:43:36.659 align:start position:0%
10th specify
 
01:43:38.330 --> 01:43:38.340 align:start position:0%
you know a specific date because I could
 
01:43:41.629 --> 01:43:41.639 align:start position:0%
fall on whatever day of the week so
 
01:43:43.790 --> 01:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
the the intent was
 
01:43:46.850 --> 01:43:46.860 align:start position:0%
again maybe the amendment will say no
 
01:43:50.030 --> 01:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
earlier than or or again we're trying to
 
01:43:53.090 --> 01:43:53.100 align:start position:0%
provide a a week's notice or a
 
01:43:56.689 --> 01:43:56.699 align:start position:0%
difference to give individuals a chance
 
01:43:58.490 --> 01:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
you know whether it's state reps or I
 
01:43:59.810 --> 01:43:59.820 align:start position:0%
think we're trying to talk about
 
01:44:01.609 --> 01:44:01.619 align:start position:0%
amendments that are not in front of us
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
which is very difficult and probably not
 
01:44:05.390 --> 01:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
the best
 
01:44:07.729 --> 01:44:07.739 align:start position:0%
use of the committee's time but yes the
 
01:44:09.770 --> 01:44:09.780 align:start position:0%
the intent was not for it to be on the
 
01:44:11.149 --> 01:44:11.159 align:start position:0%
on the same date that was an honest
 
01:44:11.159 --> 01:44:13.189 align:start position:0%
on the same date that was an honest
mistake

01:44:13.189 --> 01:44:13.199 align:start position:0%
mistake
 
01:44:14.510 --> 01:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
for the questions representative
 
01:44:17.090 --> 01:44:17.100 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh thank you Mr just a
 
01:44:20.270 --> 01:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
clarification for the chair I noticed
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
that I keep my hand up and then I put it
 
01:44:25.609 --> 01:44:25.619 align:start position:0%
down so uh do you want me to keep my
 
01:44:28.609 --> 01:44:28.619 align:start position:0%
hand up so sometimes it feels like I
 
01:44:30.530 --> 01:44:30.540 align:start position:0%
might have sh my question has been
 
01:44:33.109 --> 01:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
answered so you don't recognize unless I
 
01:44:35.390 --> 01:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
put my hand up again sure I tried to do
 
01:44:37.850 --> 01:44:37.860 align:start position:0%
my best I know I know I'm just trying to
 
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
clarify how uh what I need to do yeah go
 
01:44:43.250 --> 01:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
like that keep it like that okay thank
 
01:44:46.669 --> 01:44:46.679 align:start position:0%
you Mom Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
01:44:49.609 --> 01:44:49.619 align:start position:0%
question my question is why single out
 
01:44:51.470 --> 01:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County and Rockingham
 
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
County alone how would this impact other
 
01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:56.390 align:start position:0%
County alone how would this impact other
counties

01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
counties
 
01:44:59.590 --> 01:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
since this bill is it basically Hills
 
01:45:02.590 --> 01:45:02.600 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County share a budget bill
 
01:45:05.209 --> 01:45:05.219 align:start position:0%
that has specific rules that we have to
 
01:45:07.370 --> 01:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
follow for our budgeting process and so
 
01:45:09.410 --> 01:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
this would only affect Hillsborough and
 
01:45:11.570 --> 01:45:11.580 align:start position:0%
Rockin County
 
01:45:13.310 --> 01:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
um you know basically other sections of
 
01:45:16.629 --> 01:45:16.639 align:start position:0%
whether it's RSA I think 2413 2414
 
01:45:23.149 --> 01:45:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:25.310 --> 01:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
representative stavis
 
01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:45:28.669 --> 01:45:28.679 align:start position:0%
my question I'd like to drill down a
 
01:45:30.530 --> 01:45:30.540 align:start position:0%
little bit more on the word delivered if
 
01:45:31.609 --> 01:45:31.619 align:start position:0%
I may
 
01:45:31.619 --> 01:45:32.870 align:start position:0%
I may
uh

01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:45:36.770 --> 01:45:36.780 align:start position:0%
everybody understands what mailed means
 
01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
delivered is somewhat ambiguous
 
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
can you tell me what it means to deliver
 
01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
again we've taken a different way I
 
01:45:51.530 --> 01:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
guess you take delivery to to mean that
 
01:45:54.189 --> 01:45:54.199 align:start position:0%
in whichever former way that the
 
01:45:56.990 --> 01:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
recipient you know
 
01:46:01.129 --> 01:46:01.139 align:start position:0%
truly actually receives delivery of the
 
01:46:03.890 --> 01:46:03.900 align:start position:0%
the budget it would it be fair let me
 
01:46:03.900 --> 01:46:07.850 align:start position:0%
the budget it would it be fair let me
just

01:46:07.850 --> 01:46:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:09.229 --> 01:46:09.239 align:start position:0%
go a little deeper into what
 
01:46:11.570 --> 01:46:11.580 align:start position:0%
representative Davis is saying is it is
 
01:46:14.689 --> 01:46:14.699 align:start position:0%
it your intention to kind of match up
 
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
what it says in Hillsborough the
 
01:46:18.770 --> 01:46:18.780 align:start position:0%
paragraph above and the one below
 
01:46:20.450 --> 01:46:20.460 align:start position:0%
because the one above says mail door
 
01:46:22.189 --> 01:46:22.199 align:start position:0%
delivered is the reason you added the
 
01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
word delivered in that bottom one to
 
01:46:25.010 --> 01:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
make them
 
01:46:28.370 --> 01:46:28.380 align:start position:0%
in sync is that what's happening here or
 
01:46:30.530 --> 01:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
I think it's trying to get wording more
 
01:46:32.450 --> 01:46:32.460 align:start position:0%
consistent with
 
01:46:37.129 --> 01:46:37.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:39.890 --> 01:46:39.900 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
01:46:41.090 --> 01:46:41.100 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:46:46.189 --> 01:46:46.199 align:start position:0%
the part about the County website
 
01:46:48.350 --> 01:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I think posting
 
01:46:50.930 --> 01:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
it on the County website is a good idea
 
01:46:53.689 --> 01:46:53.699 align:start position:0%
but my question is why have that
 
01:46:56.570 --> 01:46:56.580 align:start position:0%
replacing the part where it says at the
 
01:46:56.580 --> 01:46:57.530 align:start position:0%
replacing the part where it says at the
county

01:46:57.530 --> 01:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
county
 
01:47:00.530 --> 01:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
Courthouse like why can't we say
 
01:47:03.050 --> 01:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
they have to do it at both or they have
 
01:47:08.570 --> 01:47:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:11.810 --> 01:47:11.820 align:start position:0%
I think it's it's basically because
 
01:47:15.189 --> 01:47:15.199 align:start position:0%
again there's Rock aims experience that
 
01:47:18.050 --> 01:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
because we do the delivery
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
the mailing of whatever stage of the
 
01:47:23.090 --> 01:47:23.100 align:start position:0%
budget that we're at as required to the
 
01:47:25.370 --> 01:47:25.380 align:start position:0%
state representatives in the county uh
 
01:47:28.189 --> 01:47:28.199 align:start position:0%
to their homes that
 
01:47:30.830 --> 01:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
that basically that's not a needed
 
01:47:33.950 --> 01:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
part of the RSA because they are
 
01:47:36.410 --> 01:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
actually receiving in different method
 
01:47:39.109 --> 01:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
individually to their homes uh the the
 
01:47:41.689 --> 01:47:41.699 align:start position:0%
budgets and
 
01:47:45.890 --> 01:47:45.900 align:start position:0%
by again up and operationally to my
 
01:47:48.050 --> 01:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
knowledge no state representative from
 
01:47:49.910 --> 01:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
rockhamp has gone to get their budget at
 
01:47:52.790 --> 01:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
so basically trying to update the the
 
01:47:59.209 --> 01:47:59.219 align:start position:0%
law to again bring us into the 21st
 
01:48:02.930 --> 01:48:02.940 align:start position:0%
century and add it to the County's
 
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
website as far as for being part of the
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
again proposed law
 
01:48:10.189 --> 01:48:10.199 align:start position:0%
represent power
 
01:48:11.990 --> 01:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:48:14.330 --> 01:48:14.340 align:start position:0%
taking my question so my understanding
 
01:48:17.090 --> 01:48:17.100 align:start position:0%
is that you're a representative from
 
01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:19.679 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County and this bill affects
 
01:48:22.490 --> 01:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
both Hillsboro and Rockingham County my
 
01:48:25.970 --> 01:48:25.980 align:start position:0%
question is do you have do you know if
 
01:48:28.250 --> 01:48:28.260 align:start position:0%
anybody from Hillsborough County was
 
01:48:30.229 --> 01:48:30.239 align:start position:0%
consulted with regards to the the
 
01:48:34.510 --> 01:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
changes proposed in this legislation
 
01:48:39.169 --> 01:48:39.179 align:start position:0%
in particular the um I'm referencing the
 
01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
the strikeout in lines 17 and 18 with
 
01:48:46.490 --> 01:48:46.500 align:start position:0%
regard to at the County Courthouse as
 
01:48:48.410 --> 01:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
well as the the whole conversation
 
01:48:50.990 --> 01:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
around the word delivered
 
01:48:52.850 --> 01:48:52.860 align:start position:0%
so was Hillsboro
 
01:48:54.830 --> 01:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
um consulted did they have any input
 
01:48:57.229 --> 01:48:57.239 align:start position:0%
into this legislation yes so so
 
01:48:59.470 --> 01:48:59.480 align:start position:0%
basically both counties and all 10
 
01:49:01.490 --> 01:49:01.500 align:start position:0%
counties are part of the New Hampshire
 
01:49:03.890 --> 01:49:03.900 align:start position:0%
Association of counties and so there's
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
representatives from uh from Hillsboro I
 
01:49:08.750 --> 01:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
should say State represents but there's
 
01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:10.189 align:start position:0%
should say State represents but there's
there's

01:49:10.189 --> 01:49:10.199 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
um members from Hillsborough County that
 
01:49:15.169 --> 01:49:15.179 align:start position:0%
are part of the representation of the
 
01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
executive committee of the of the nhac
 
01:49:22.129 --> 01:49:22.139 align:start position:0%
and the build language was sent to them
 
01:49:25.490 --> 01:49:25.500 align:start position:0%
to for them to reach back to their
 
01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
I cannot say as far as how far it went
 
01:49:37.129 --> 01:49:37.139 align:start position:0%
on on their side as far as bring back
 
01:49:39.169 --> 01:49:39.179 align:start position:0%
any comments
 
01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
okay so you know
 
01:49:43.250 --> 01:49:43.260 align:start position:0%
hands uh thank you for your testimony we
 
01:49:57.470 --> 01:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:59.450 --> 01:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:50:00.950 --> 01:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Kate Horgan I
 
01:50:02.510 --> 01:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire Association
 
01:50:06.169 --> 01:50:06.179 align:start position:0%
of counties uh we do support the bill
 
01:50:08.090 --> 01:50:08.100 align:start position:0%
um just to kind of cover quick little
 
01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
questions the chair is 100 correct or
 
01:50:13.910 --> 01:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
delivered on line 15 was put in to match
 
01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
the language in line three uh I don't
 
01:50:19.250 --> 01:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
know what the original definition of
 
01:50:21.709 --> 01:50:21.719 align:start position:0%
delivered was but that was just a
 
01:50:23.330 --> 01:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
technical cleanup that we thought it
 
01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
should match the language in line three
 
01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:28.750 align:start position:0%
should match the language in line three
um

01:50:28.750 --> 01:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:31.550 --> 01:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
on the uh
 
01:50:34.189 --> 01:50:34.199 align:start position:0%
the date we did ask representative
 
01:50:36.709 --> 01:50:36.719 align:start position:0%
Edwards about making that a little more
 
01:50:38.330 --> 01:50:38.340 align:start position:0%
time period that way people have time to
 
01:50:40.070 --> 01:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
review the budget especially the public
 
01:50:42.890 --> 01:50:42.900 align:start position:0%
before they go to a public hearing it
 
01:50:44.450 --> 01:50:44.460 align:start position:0%
just gives everyone some time to look
 
01:50:46.729 --> 01:50:46.739 align:start position:0%
over it so that way they know whether or
 
01:50:48.830 --> 01:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
not they feel it is important for them
 
01:50:50.990 --> 01:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
as a member of the public to go and
 
01:50:54.109 --> 01:50:54.119 align:start position:0%
testify to the um
 
01:50:56.090 --> 01:50:56.100 align:start position:0%
on the budget
 
01:50:58.910 --> 01:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
um I think that was all the questions
 
01:51:01.129 --> 01:51:01.139 align:start position:0%
but if I miss something I am happy to
 
01:51:03.470 --> 01:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
take a question
 
01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:07.370 align:start position:0%
take a question
foreign

01:51:07.370 --> 01:51:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:11.090 --> 01:51:11.100 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for your testimony
 
01:51:11.100 --> 01:51:12.050 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for your testimony
um

01:51:12.050 --> 01:51:12.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:13.490 align:start position:0%
um
would

01:51:13.490 --> 01:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:51:17.629 --> 01:51:17.639 align:start position:0%
elect uh the budget being
 
01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
delivered electronically would that
 
01:51:25.669 --> 01:51:25.679 align:start position:0%
suffice for the requirement
 
01:51:29.209 --> 01:51:29.219 align:start position:0%
I am not sure when this bill was or this
 
01:51:31.550 --> 01:51:31.560 align:start position:0%
language was put into statute I would
 
01:51:34.370 --> 01:51:34.380 align:start position:0%
assume but I am also not a lawyer so I
 
01:51:35.629 --> 01:51:35.639 align:start position:0%
don't know if you want to take my word
 
01:51:37.669 --> 01:51:37.679 align:start position:0%
for that representative
 
01:51:39.649 --> 01:51:39.659 align:start position:0%
but I'm happy to look into it and see if
 
01:51:41.629 --> 01:51:41.639 align:start position:0%
I can figure it out for you
 
01:51:44.390 --> 01:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:46.850 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

01:51:46.850 --> 01:51:46.860 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:51:49.729 --> 01:51:49.739 align:start position:0%
um Mr Speaker isn't um since
 
01:51:52.070 --> 01:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative lasalles uh introduced
 
01:51:54.830 --> 01:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
the bill is he not it wasn't that a
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
violation of the current law or the
 
01:52:00.290 --> 01:52:00.300 align:start position:0%
current rule you are correct okay you
 
01:52:02.810 --> 01:52:02.820 align:start position:0%
are correct but but also I have a
 
01:52:05.990 --> 01:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:09.530 --> 01:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:52:09.540 --> 01:52:10.790 align:start position:0%
um the
um

01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:14.090 --> 01:52:14.100 align:start position:0%
after my previous question about the the
 
01:52:16.010 --> 01:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
um the time frame
 
01:52:18.890 --> 01:52:18.900 align:start position:0%
um it looks like in the current law it
 
01:52:20.990 --> 01:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
says that there needs to be at least
 
01:52:23.330 --> 01:52:23.340 align:start position:0%
seven days prior to any vote
 
01:52:26.450 --> 01:52:26.460 align:start position:0%
uh to adopt the annual budget that it
 
01:52:28.490 --> 01:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
needs to be made available so is there
 
01:52:31.490 --> 01:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
really any neces need to change the
 
01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
dates because it already is required
 
01:52:36.590 --> 01:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
that they give seven day notice or
 
01:52:40.790 --> 01:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
um or they be made available uh the the
 
01:52:43.550 --> 01:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
budget before they vote on it so is the
 
01:52:45.649 --> 01:52:45.659 align:start position:0%
change of dates necessary thank you
 
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative yukela I believe it is
 
01:52:49.550 --> 01:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
because it's a public hearing that this
 
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
language is referring to not the vote so
 
01:52:55.490 --> 01:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
it would just be clarifying language and
 
01:52:57.950 --> 01:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
you can see that in line not end of line
 
01:53:03.470 --> 01:53:03.480 align:start position:0%

represent all the counties uh even
 
01:53:17.629 --> 01:53:17.639 align:start position:0%

01:53:20.209 --> 01:53:20.219 align:start position:0%
and Rockingham County can you speak to
 
01:53:22.070 --> 01:53:22.080 align:start position:0%

01:53:26.450 --> 01:53:26.460 align:start position:0%
impact other eight counties please yes
 
01:53:27.229 --> 01:53:27.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative it would not impact the
 
01:53:31.669 --> 01:53:31.679 align:start position:0%
other eight counties this part of the
 
01:53:33.950 --> 01:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
statute is specific to only Hillsboro

okay we have many many pink cards on
 
01:54:18.649 --> 01:54:18.659 align:start position:0%
this that means that we have a lot of
 
01:54:20.629 --> 01:54:20.639 align:start position:0%
people who are going to speak
 
01:54:22.609 --> 01:54:22.619 align:start position:0%
um once the bill is introduced we are
 
01:54:24.890 --> 01:54:24.900 align:start position:0%
going to hold everybody who has
 
01:54:27.290 --> 01:54:27.300 align:start position:0%
submitted a pink card to three minutes

01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%

good morning chair members of the

good morning chair members of the

01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening to this bill
 
01:55:14.639 --> 01:55:16.129 align:start position:0%
thank you for listening to this bill
today

01:55:16.129 --> 01:55:16.139 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:55:18.109 --> 01:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
this bill will regulate the point of
 
01:55:19.370 --> 01:55:19.380 align:start position:0%
sale distribution of single-use
 
01:55:21.470 --> 01:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
packaging and the disposal of single
 
01:55:24.410 --> 01:55:24.420 align:start position:0%
packaging waste Returns the authority to
 
01:55:25.970 --> 01:55:25.980 align:start position:0%
regulate these waste to the respective
 
01:55:27.890 --> 01:55:27.900 align:start position:0%
municipalities as they are best
 
01:55:29.930 --> 01:55:29.940 align:start position:0%
positioned to manage their landfills and
 
01:55:32.330 --> 01:55:32.340 align:start position:0%
transfer stations
 
01:55:34.189 --> 01:55:34.199 align:start position:0%
the Salient point
 
01:55:36.470 --> 01:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
is if we can keep allegedly recyclable
 
01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
bags out of our trash flow then we will
 
01:55:42.350 --> 01:55:42.360 align:start position:0%
reduce our transfer station costs
 
01:55:44.990 --> 01:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
the transfer station in my town is
 
01:55:47.030 --> 01:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
facing a steep increase in haulage fees
 
01:55:48.709 --> 01:55:48.719 align:start position:0%
that will increase the transfer
 
01:55:51.470 --> 01:55:51.480 align:start position:0%
station's budget by half again
 
01:55:53.209 --> 01:55:53.219 align:start position:0%
that is this expense that we need to be
 
01:55:54.709 --> 01:55:54.719 align:start position:0%
passed on to all the residents of my
 
01:55:54.719 --> 01:55:55.609 align:start position:0%
passed on to all the residents of my
community

01:55:55.609 --> 01:55:55.619 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:55:57.290 --> 01:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
and the same problem facing many
 
01:55:57.300 --> 01:55:59.450 align:start position:0%
and the same problem facing many
communities

01:55:59.450 --> 01:55:59.460 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:56:02.629 --> 01:56:02.639 align:start position:0%
I've been told that RSA 149m has
 
01:56:04.370 --> 01:56:04.380 align:start position:0%
Provisions for allowing municipalities
 
01:56:06.590 --> 01:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
to regulate waste flow
 
01:56:07.750 --> 01:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
but I believe that this bill
 
01:56:10.729 --> 01:56:10.739 align:start position:0%
indisputably States it in the chain of
 
01:56:10.739 --> 01:56:12.770 align:start position:0%
indisputably States it in the chain of
authority

01:56:12.770 --> 01:56:12.780 align:start position:0%
authority
 
01:56:14.930 --> 01:56:14.940 align:start position:0%
I've included a fact sheet
 
01:56:18.109 --> 01:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
on this on a single you use plastic bags
 
01:56:20.090 --> 01:56:20.100 align:start position:0%
though this bill does not single bags
 
01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:20.990 align:start position:0%
though this bill does not single bags
out

01:56:20.990 --> 01:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:56:22.729 --> 01:56:22.739 align:start position:0%
I would prefer to leave the definition
 
01:56:26.030 --> 01:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
of single-use broadly and the belief
 
01:56:28.510 --> 01:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
that's for the communities to decide
 
01:56:31.729 --> 01:56:31.739 align:start position:0%
what if any single-use plastic is
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
unreasonably contributing to their waste
 
01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:36.169 align:start position:0%
unreasonably contributing to their waste
flow

01:56:36.169 --> 01:56:36.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:38.030 --> 01:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
in anticipation of what arguments are
 
01:56:40.010 --> 01:56:40.020 align:start position:0%
made on behalf of retailers
 
01:56:41.810 --> 01:56:41.820 align:start position:0%
I must ask if you are serving as a
 
01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
chamber of commerce are we serving our
 
01:56:43.440 --> 01:56:44.990 align:start position:0%
chamber of commerce are we serving our
constituents

01:56:44.990 --> 01:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
01:56:46.669 --> 01:56:46.679 align:start position:0%
most of the American people have made up
 
01:56:48.649 --> 01:56:48.659 align:start position:0%
their minds and are and are close to a
 
01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
four to one margin in favor of
 
01:56:52.550 --> 01:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
eliminating these allegedly recyclable
 
01:56:54.950 --> 01:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
plastic bags from the streets and trees
 
01:56:58.310 --> 01:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
where they often end up
 
01:57:00.169 --> 01:57:00.179 align:start position:0%
we have alternatives
 
01:57:02.750 --> 01:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
I'm an avid use of canvas user of canvas
 
01:57:04.609 --> 01:57:04.619 align:start position:0%
bags well there are times that I'm
 
01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
making a purchase and find myself
 
01:57:07.790 --> 01:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
without a bag and I'm glad that just
 
01:57:09.770 --> 01:57:09.780 align:start position:0%
what all the stores I frequent have
 
01:57:13.010 --> 01:57:13.020 align:start position:0%
paper bags as an option
 
01:57:15.109 --> 01:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
Statewide bans exist in New York and
 
01:57:16.910 --> 01:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
most of New England

01:57:25.189 --> 01:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
interesting enough
 
01:57:26.689 --> 01:57:26.699 align:start position:0%
they changed their name from the

American Progressive bag of lines in
 
01:57:32.089 --> 01:57:32.099 align:start position:0%
2020 despite the widely known fact that
 
01:57:34.129 --> 01:57:34.139 align:start position:0%
about one percent of plastic bags are
 
01:57:36.169 --> 01:57:36.179 align:start position:0%
actually recycled
 
01:57:38.390 --> 01:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
we know the stories for how the contents
 
01:57:39.830 --> 01:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
these recycling containers that you see
 
01:57:40.729 --> 01:57:40.739 align:start position:0%
in stores
 
01:57:42.770 --> 01:57:42.780 align:start position:0%
are um typically tossed in the common
 
01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:43.970 align:start position:0%
are um typically tossed in the common

dumpster
 
01:57:46.790 --> 01:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
and true or not the pervasiveness of
 
01:57:48.589 --> 01:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
these stories must contribute to the
 
01:57:50.570 --> 01:57:50.580 align:start position:0%
fact that these collection centers are
 
01:57:53.330 --> 01:57:53.340 align:start position:0%
so frequently unused aside from the
 
01:57:55.010 --> 01:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
green washing propaganda of the Plastic
 
01:57:55.020 --> 01:57:56.930 align:start position:0%
green washing propaganda of the Plastic
industry

01:57:56.930 --> 01:57:56.940 align:start position:0%
industry
 
01:58:00.410 --> 01:58:00.420 align:start position:0%
nevertheless arpba were successful in
 
01:58:01.669 --> 01:58:01.679 align:start position:0%
defeating a Statewide ban in
 
01:58:04.250 --> 01:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and now what plastic bag
 
01:58:09.310 --> 01:58:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:58:13.790 --> 01:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
modestly does the same
 
01:58:16.609 --> 01:58:16.619 align:start position:0%
I'd prefer to make a Statewide argument
 
01:58:18.890 --> 01:58:18.900 align:start position:0%
agreement such as to exists in Vermont
 
01:58:21.169 --> 01:58:21.179 align:start position:0%
and Maine and I am grateful that those
 
01:58:24.050 --> 01:58:24.060 align:start position:0%
states in the uh to those States and
 
01:58:25.669 --> 01:58:25.679 align:start position:0%
that single-use plastic bags are not
 
01:58:27.649 --> 01:58:27.659 align:start position:0%
part of the waste that they sent in New
 
01:58:29.810 --> 01:58:29.820 align:start position:0%
Hampshire landfills
 
01:58:32.330 --> 01:58:32.340 align:start position:0%
this bill will let communities decide on
 
01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
how best to manage their trash flow
 
01:58:36.649 --> 01:58:36.659 align:start position:0%
rather impose half Solutions on the
 
01:58:37.729 --> 01:58:37.739 align:start position:0%
state level
 
01:58:40.189 --> 01:58:40.199 align:start position:0%
if we can get a sense of the will of the
 
01:58:42.350 --> 01:58:42.360 align:start position:0%
people then perhaps further action may
 
01:58:44.149 --> 01:58:44.159 align:start position:0%
be warranted
 
01:58:46.010 --> 01:58:46.020 align:start position:0%
in conclusion
 
01:58:48.410 --> 01:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
I ask you grant an OP
 
01:58:50.450 --> 01:58:50.460 align:start position:0%
OTP to this bill
 
01:58:52.070 --> 01:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
give the state get the state out of the
 
01:58:53.570 --> 01:58:53.580 align:start position:0%
way of regulating municipal waste
 
01:58:53.580 --> 01:58:54.470 align:start position:0%
way of regulating municipal waste
problems

01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
problems
 
01:58:56.089 --> 01:58:56.099 align:start position:0%
and I have faith the communities will
 
01:58:58.729 --> 01:58:58.739 align:start position:0%
act in their best interests
 
01:58:59.930 --> 01:58:59.940 align:start position:0%
I thank the committee for the
 
01:59:01.970 --> 01:59:01.980 align:start position:0%
consideration of Isabel and I'll take
 
01:59:03.350 --> 01:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:59:06.290 --> 01:59:06.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for the testimony do I see any
 
01:59:09.050 --> 01:59:09.060 align:start position:0%
questions representative Holland
 
01:59:10.669 --> 01:59:10.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so
 
01:59:12.410 --> 01:59:12.420 align:start position:0%
under the language of the spell then
 
01:59:14.990 --> 01:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
could a municipality ban single use like
 
01:59:17.270 --> 01:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
water bottles
 
01:59:19.910 --> 01:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question if the
 
01:59:21.470 --> 01:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
community so decided that wasn't their
 
01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:23.209 align:start position:0%
community so decided that wasn't their
interest

01:59:23.209 --> 01:59:23.219 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:59:25.669 --> 01:59:25.679 align:start position:0%
um I could see that happening I can see
 
01:59:26.810 --> 01:59:26.820 align:start position:0%
where that might be in their silver
 
01:59:28.970 --> 01:59:28.980 align:start position:0%
public health concerns Beyond what's
 
01:59:32.030 --> 01:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
going in the landfill as uh the leaching
 
01:59:34.609 --> 01:59:34.619 align:start position:0%
of plastic means that on average most
 
01:59:37.430 --> 01:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
yourself myself consume on average about
 
01:59:41.330 --> 01:59:41.340 align:start position:0%
One credit cards worth of plastic a week
 
01:59:43.490 --> 01:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
um and we have that really fully studied
 
01:59:45.830 --> 01:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
the effects of that type of internal
 
01:59:47.810 --> 01:59:47.820 align:start position:0%
consumption of microplastics
 
01:59:50.390 --> 01:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
so uh a community may decide to do that
 
01:59:53.689 --> 01:59:53.699 align:start position:0%
I can't say my particular focus is
 
01:59:55.790 --> 01:59:55.800 align:start position:0%
single-use plastic bags I know a number
 
01:59:57.470 --> 01:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
of communities including my neighboring
 
01:59:59.930 --> 01:59:59.940 align:start position:0%
town of Keene have
 
02:00:02.450 --> 02:00:02.460 align:start position:0%
tried unsuccessfully I've answered the
 
02:00:04.070 --> 02:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
question you've answered that question
 
02:00:06.470 --> 02:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
we asked about models thank you we have
 
02:00:08.209 --> 02:00:08.219 align:start position:0%
a lot of uh representative Manchester
 
02:00:10.490 --> 02:00:10.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for keeping be honest thank
 
02:00:12.649 --> 02:00:12.659 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you representative
 
02:00:15.050 --> 02:00:15.060 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
02:00:15.060 --> 02:00:15.950 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
um

02:00:15.950 --> 02:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:20.050 --> 02:00:20.060 align:start position:0%
would this enable the local
 
02:00:22.970 --> 02:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
municipalities to come up with their own
 
02:00:27.169 --> 02:00:27.179 align:start position:0%
creative solution to waste management
 
02:00:28.850 --> 02:00:28.860 align:start position:0%
depending on whether they have a
 
02:00:32.209 --> 02:00:32.219 align:start position:0%
landfill or not or recycled single
 
02:00:34.370 --> 02:00:34.380 align:start position:0%
stream multi-stream different
 
02:00:37.609 --> 02:00:37.619 align:start position:0%
communities have different so would this
 
02:00:40.370 --> 02:00:40.380 align:start position:0%
help enable more differences in
 
02:00:42.229 --> 02:00:42.239 align:start position:0%
Innovation or do you think this will
 
02:00:42.239 --> 02:00:43.370 align:start position:0%
Innovation or do you think this will
bring

02:00:43.370 --> 02:00:43.380 align:start position:0%
bring
 
02:00:46.129 --> 02:00:46.139 align:start position:0%
some kind of a uniform understanding
 
02:00:49.370 --> 02:00:49.380 align:start position:0%
I would hope that it would enable
 
02:00:52.310 --> 02:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
numerous solutions that work for the
 
02:00:54.649 --> 02:00:54.659 align:start position:0%
communities and their own individual
 
02:00:58.129 --> 02:00:58.139 align:start position:0%
needs and uh on their own basis where I
 
02:01:00.109 --> 02:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
live I have a transfer station in one of
 
02:01:03.709 --> 02:01:03.719 align:start position:0%
my towns three rely on the uh County
 
02:01:06.530 --> 02:01:06.540 align:start position:0%
Municipal and one uses Advanced Plastics
 
02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
as part of their solution I can see um
 
02:01:12.649 --> 02:01:12.659 align:start position:0%
representative again am I going on
 
02:01:14.810 --> 02:01:14.820 align:start position:0%
you answered the question about enabling
 
02:01:19.250 --> 02:01:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:21.950 --> 02:01:21.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
02:01:25.010 --> 02:01:25.020 align:start position:0%
question based on the um language being
 
02:01:26.870 --> 02:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
so broad
 
02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:27.530 align:start position:0%
so broad
um

02:01:27.530 --> 02:01:27.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:27.540 --> 02:01:29.570 align:start position:0%
um
does

02:01:29.570 --> 02:01:29.580 align:start position:0%
does
 
02:01:32.810 --> 02:01:32.820 align:start position:0%
it does the
 
02:01:35.990 --> 02:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
let's say the plastic wrapping around uh
 
02:01:38.689 --> 02:01:38.699 align:start position:0%
toilet paper when you buy it at Walmart
 
02:01:41.270 --> 02:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
they would be a you're saying that you
 
02:01:43.609 --> 02:01:43.619 align:start position:0%
would Grant the local municipality to
 
02:01:46.030 --> 02:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
ban the the the
 
02:01:49.070 --> 02:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
Walmarts in that in that municipality
 
02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
from being able to sell that toilet
 
02:01:55.910 --> 02:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
paper wrapped in plastic and also if you
 
02:01:59.930 --> 02:01:59.940 align:start position:0%
happen to buy uh uh at a neighboring
 
02:02:02.570 --> 02:02:02.580 align:start position:0%
towns Walmart that same toilet the
 
02:02:04.070 --> 02:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
toilet paper wrapped in plastic you
 
02:02:05.990 --> 02:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they would be able to regulate
 
02:02:08.930 --> 02:02:08.940 align:start position:0%
your disposal of that plastic bat the
 
02:02:10.850 --> 02:02:10.860 align:start position:0%
the plastic wrapping around the toilet
 
02:02:12.770 --> 02:02:12.780 align:start position:0%
paper and say that you can't put it in
 
02:02:15.290 --> 02:02:15.300 align:start position:0%
your trash and so you have to like keep
 
02:02:18.109 --> 02:02:18.119 align:start position:0%
it on at your house forever like I don't
 
02:02:20.169 --> 02:02:20.179 align:start position:0%
understand what your
 
02:02:22.850 --> 02:02:22.860 align:start position:0%
because of this being so broad is that
 
02:02:25.609 --> 02:02:25.619 align:start position:0%
question is that would that be allowed
 
02:02:28.790 --> 02:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
under this this uh broad language thank
 
02:02:28.800 --> 02:02:29.990 align:start position:0%
under this this uh broad language thank
you

02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:02:32.570 --> 02:02:32.580 align:start position:0%
um it's thank you for the question uh
 
02:02:35.629 --> 02:02:35.639 align:start position:0%
you pick up an interesting point I don't
 
02:02:37.550 --> 02:02:37.560 align:start position:0%
think any particular Community would
 
02:02:40.430 --> 02:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
actually go up to Target Walmart toilet
 
02:02:42.830 --> 02:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
paper but I can understand that if
 
02:02:45.350 --> 02:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
Community decided to do something of
 
02:02:46.490 --> 02:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
that effect
 
02:02:48.649 --> 02:02:48.659 align:start position:0%
they would probably rather than having
 
02:02:50.810 --> 02:02:50.820 align:start position:0%
all these plastic wrappers accumulate in
 
02:02:51.950 --> 02:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
somebody's house they would probably
 
02:02:53.750 --> 02:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
make Provisions within their local
 
02:02:56.330 --> 02:02:56.340 align:start position:0%
community ordinances which they would be
 
02:02:58.010 --> 02:02:58.020 align:start position:0%
free to do
 
02:03:00.290 --> 02:03:00.300 align:start position:0%
is that a good answer is that this
 
02:03:01.609 --> 02:03:01.619 align:start position:0%
answer awesome answer
 
02:03:04.010 --> 02:03:04.020 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
02:03:05.450 --> 02:03:05.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:03:07.850 --> 02:03:07.860 align:start position:0%
taking my question this committee
 
02:03:11.689 --> 02:03:11.699 align:start position:0%
struggled mightily with a similar bill I
 
02:03:14.330 --> 02:03:14.340 align:start position:0%
think three years ago
 
02:03:17.149 --> 02:03:17.159 align:start position:0%
um part of it was an outright Statewide
 
02:03:18.890 --> 02:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
ban and part of it was enabling
 
02:03:21.830 --> 02:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
legislation I see folks here today who
 
02:03:24.250 --> 02:03:24.260 align:start position:0%
worked on that bill
 
02:03:27.649 --> 02:03:27.659 align:start position:0%
one of the sticking points and this is
 
02:03:30.830 --> 02:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
my question to you has to do with a
 
02:03:34.689 --> 02:03:34.699 align:start position:0%
single-use plastic packaging of other
 
02:03:37.250 --> 02:03:37.260 align:start position:0%
items in stores similar to what
 
02:03:39.649 --> 02:03:39.659 align:start position:0%
representative yukela mentioned I work
 
02:03:43.129 --> 02:03:43.139 align:start position:0%
in a grocery store almost every single
 
02:03:47.030 --> 02:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
thing we sell is individually wrapped in
 
02:03:50.990 --> 02:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
plastic whether it's degradable or not
 
02:03:53.810 --> 02:03:53.820 align:start position:0%
um how would this affect a store's
 
02:03:55.970 --> 02:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
ordering of product
 
02:03:58.750 --> 02:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
if they're if this if the municipality
 
02:04:04.729 --> 02:04:04.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:07.070 --> 02:04:07.080 align:start position:0%
sell single-use Plastics single-use
 
02:04:10.870 --> 02:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
Plastics in a cover a bottle of Zyrtec
 
02:04:13.910 --> 02:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
they basically cover everything
 
02:04:17.570 --> 02:04:17.580 align:start position:0%
how how would this language address that
 
02:04:20.330 --> 02:04:20.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:04:20.340 --> 02:04:20.990 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
um

02:04:20.990 --> 02:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:23.149 --> 02:04:23.159 align:start position:0%
I don't think it would be anybody's
 
02:04:26.030 --> 02:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
interest to do a complete ban of all
 
02:04:28.370 --> 02:04:28.380 align:start position:0%
Plastics at this time
 
02:04:30.709 --> 02:04:30.719 align:start position:0%
the reason being is that we do recognize
 
02:04:32.450 --> 02:04:32.460 align:start position:0%
that many of our product products my
 
02:04:35.450 --> 02:04:35.460 align:start position:0%
hamburger comes wrapped in plastic
 
02:04:35.460 --> 02:04:36.830 align:start position:0%
hamburger comes wrapped in plastic
um

02:04:36.830 --> 02:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:39.410 --> 02:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
many of our products come wrapped in
 
02:04:40.669 --> 02:04:40.679 align:start position:0%
plastic and we don't get much of a
 
02:04:42.229 --> 02:04:42.239 align:start position:0%
choice on that I think that might be
 
02:04:43.430 --> 02:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
something that we might want to look at
 
02:04:46.250 --> 02:04:46.260 align:start position:0%
in another bill uh however to answer
 
02:04:47.990 --> 02:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
your specific question
 
02:04:49.370 --> 02:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
I don't think it would be in a
 
02:04:51.050 --> 02:04:51.060 align:start position:0%
community's interest to do a sweeping
 
02:04:53.990 --> 02:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
wide plastic band as you propose I don't
 
02:04:56.629 --> 02:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
think it would mean scarcity of product
 
02:04:58.930 --> 02:04:58.940 align:start position:0%
and nobody wants to face that
 
02:05:02.330 --> 02:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
uh could this mean we could perhaps find
 
02:05:04.250 --> 02:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
better solutions to the future if this
 
02:05:06.530 --> 02:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
is a first step I think possibly sell
 
02:05:09.050 --> 02:05:09.060 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
02:05:11.390 --> 02:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
02:05:13.070 --> 02:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:05:16.070 --> 02:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question could you confirm
 
02:05:21.669 --> 02:05:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
puts the power to make this decision
 
02:05:26.089 --> 02:05:26.099 align:start position:0%
because it comes under the section's
 
02:05:28.430 --> 02:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
power and duties of Town's power to make
 
02:05:32.149 --> 02:05:32.159 align:start position:0%
bylaws by the fact that it
 
02:05:36.830 --> 02:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
the power is with regard to bylaws that
 
02:05:38.629 --> 02:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
02:05:42.470 --> 02:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
solely up to the select board in a town
 
02:05:48.649 --> 02:05:48.659 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:51.530 --> 02:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
that is a good question and to be frank
 
02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
I don't have a good answer on that I
 
02:05:55.129 --> 02:05:55.139 align:start position:0%
would be glad to get back to look into
 
02:05:57.410 --> 02:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
it and get back to you if I may thank
 
02:06:00.530 --> 02:06:00.540 align:start position:0%
you representative Gallagher
 
02:06:03.250 --> 02:06:03.260 align:start position:0%
um so representative save this kind of
 
02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
touched on this a little bit when she
 
02:06:07.910 --> 02:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
was mentioning um
 
02:06:10.310 --> 02:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh some legislative history but I wanted
 
02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:11.209 align:start position:0%
uh some legislative history but I wanted
to

02:06:11.209 --> 02:06:11.219 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:06:11.219 --> 02:06:12.530 align:start position:0%
to
um

02:06:12.530 --> 02:06:12.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:15.350 --> 02:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
or I want to kind of focus more back on
 
02:06:17.990 --> 02:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
that part of it um so yeah it wasn't
 
02:06:20.390 --> 02:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
just three years ago but also last year
 
02:06:24.310 --> 02:06:24.320 align:start position:0%
too last year it was a house bill
 
02:06:26.810 --> 02:06:26.820 align:start position:0%
1119 I believe it was that came before
 
02:06:29.870 --> 02:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
this committee I was wondering if you
 
02:06:32.930 --> 02:06:32.940 align:start position:0%
could tell us a bit about
 
02:06:32.940 --> 02:06:34.030 align:start position:0%
could tell us a bit about
um

02:06:34.030 --> 02:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
how it it looks slightly different to me
 
02:06:39.229 --> 02:06:39.239 align:start position:0%
could you um
 
02:06:42.890 --> 02:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
tell us about how the language has
 
02:06:45.890 --> 02:06:45.900 align:start position:0%
changed since last year's um House Bill
 
02:06:49.550 --> 02:06:49.560 align:start position:0%
1119 if you yes this bill is based very
 
02:06:51.770 --> 02:06:51.780 align:start position:0%
deeply on House Bill 1119 that did
 
02:06:54.109 --> 02:06:54.119 align:start position:0%
appear last year the Salient difference
 
02:06:55.550 --> 02:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
that I see though was that we're not
 
02:06:58.490 --> 02:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:01.490 --> 02:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
have the state supersede
 
02:07:03.709 --> 02:07:03.719 align:start position:0%
the what perhaps which should be a
 
02:07:06.169 --> 02:07:06.179 align:start position:0%
municipal decision and managing their
 
02:07:06.179 --> 02:07:08.030 align:start position:0%
municipal decision and managing their
landfills

02:07:08.030 --> 02:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
02:07:08.040 --> 02:07:09.229 align:start position:0%
landfills
um

02:07:09.229 --> 02:07:09.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:12.169 --> 02:07:12.179 align:start position:0%
I think there are times when the state
 
02:07:13.609 --> 02:07:13.619 align:start position:0%
is in a better position to decide things
 
02:07:15.169 --> 02:07:15.179 align:start position:0%
I think sometimes in better position for
 
02:07:17.570 --> 02:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
the municipality and this bill because
 
02:07:19.609 --> 02:07:19.619 align:start position:0%
it focuses on that unlike last year's
 
02:07:22.010 --> 02:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
bill I think it reflects the fact that
 
02:07:25.129 --> 02:07:25.139 align:start position:0%
it puts me now in the state and the
 
02:07:26.689 --> 02:07:26.699 align:start position:0%
municipality back into their proper
 
02:07:29.689 --> 02:07:29.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:32.510 --> 02:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Edward
 
02:07:34.790 --> 02:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
02:07:37.669 --> 02:07:37.679 align:start position:0%
what type of expertise would a
 
02:07:41.089 --> 02:07:41.099 align:start position:0%
municipality need to have both technical
 
02:07:45.050 --> 02:07:45.060 align:start position:0%
legal Etc to implement this uh proposed
 
02:07:45.060 --> 02:07:47.089 align:start position:0%
legal Etc to implement this uh proposed
amendment

02:07:47.089 --> 02:07:47.099 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:07:50.030 --> 02:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
I can't say that they would thank you
 
02:07:51.350 --> 02:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
for the question
 
02:07:53.450 --> 02:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
I can't say specifically what that
 
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
expertise would be I do know that the
 
02:07:57.830 --> 02:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
city of Keene did initiate a plastic
 
02:08:01.669 --> 02:08:01.679 align:start position:0%
span uh that was superseded by the state
 
02:08:05.810 --> 02:08:05.820 align:start position:0%
uh because we are uh what's wrong
 
02:08:07.910 --> 02:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
because the state has a thought I'm
 
02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:09.470 align:start position:0%
because the state has a thought I'm
sorry

02:08:09.470 --> 02:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:08:11.330 --> 02:08:11.340 align:start position:0%
Dillons is one that would allow them to
 
02:08:15.109 --> 02:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
do that I believe thank you but uh home
 
02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
rule you know sorry thank you
 
02:08:21.470 --> 02:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
um yes because home rule um it was
 
02:08:23.629 --> 02:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
turned back I don't think it takes any
 
02:08:25.129 --> 02:08:25.139 align:start position:0%
particular expertise beyond what already
 
02:08:27.050 --> 02:08:27.060 align:start position:0%
exists within the uh County
 
02:08:27.060 --> 02:08:29.629 align:start position:0%
exists within the uh County
Administration

02:08:29.629 --> 02:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
02:08:32.050 --> 02:08:32.060 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chair follow-up go ahead
 
02:08:35.209 --> 02:08:35.219 align:start position:0%
and uh approximately what was the cost
 
02:08:38.750 --> 02:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
to implement that program in Keene uh
 
02:08:40.490 --> 02:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
the program was not implemented it was
 
02:08:42.470 --> 02:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh turned back before it was actually
 
02:08:46.129 --> 02:08:46.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:47.750 --> 02:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
see no more questions thank you very
 
02:08:49.189 --> 02:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony we're going to
 
02:08:51.589 --> 02:08:51.599 align:start position:0%
call The Honorable Judith Spang I'm
 
02:08:53.390 --> 02:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
going to remind everybody everybody now
 
02:08:55.430 --> 02:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
is on a three-minute Time
 
02:08:57.470 --> 02:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
when you see this wave that means your
 
02:09:00.050 --> 02:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
time is about to be up thank you go
 
02:09:00.060 --> 02:09:01.490 align:start position:0%
time is about to be up thank you go
ahead

02:09:01.490 --> 02:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
02:09:04.810 --> 02:09:04.820 align:start position:0%
okay good morning I'm representative
 
02:09:07.250 --> 02:09:07.260 align:start position:0%
ex-representative Judith Spang I was in
 
02:09:10.669 --> 02:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
the legislature for 24 years as chair of
 
02:09:12.830 --> 02:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
resources at one time and I've worked on
 
02:09:16.850 --> 02:09:16.860 align:start position:0%
this project of this this topic for for
 
02:09:20.209 --> 02:09:20.219 align:start position:0%
three hard years bringing in four uh
 
02:09:23.930 --> 02:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
different bills relating to Plastics in
 
02:09:28.490 --> 02:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
various uh iterations so I am well
 
02:09:31.209 --> 02:09:31.219 align:start position:0%
prepared to answer any questions
 
02:09:34.510 --> 02:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
I see this as a matter of responsibility
 
02:09:37.850 --> 02:09:37.860 align:start position:0%
we know that Plastics are a huge problem
 
02:09:41.750 --> 02:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
we know that plastic bags alone are a
 
02:09:43.910 --> 02:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
huge problem and the state of New
 
02:09:45.589 --> 02:09:45.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has failed to take any
 
02:09:49.010 --> 02:09:49.020 align:start position:0%
responsibility for this problem all the
 
02:09:51.950 --> 02:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
other states around us have bitten the
 
02:09:54.890 --> 02:09:54.900 align:start position:0%
bullet and done it and we have somehow
 
02:09:58.010 --> 02:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
been able to unable to do that and I
 
02:10:01.430 --> 02:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
think it's time for us to to take this
 
02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:03.530 align:start position:0%
think it's time for us to to take this
seriously

02:10:03.530 --> 02:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
seriously
 
02:10:06.589 --> 02:10:06.599 align:start position:0%
it's clear that the legislature is not
 
02:10:09.350 --> 02:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
keen on doing something Statewide so
 
02:10:11.750 --> 02:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
what does that leave us with that leaves
 
02:10:13.850 --> 02:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
us with Legend with individual
 
02:10:16.250 --> 02:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
municipalities where tremendous solid
 
02:10:18.050 --> 02:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
race problems
 
02:10:20.750 --> 02:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's fair for us to not
 
02:10:23.450 --> 02:10:23.460 align:start position:0%
allow them to take control of their own
 
02:10:26.570 --> 02:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste problems
 
02:10:29.450 --> 02:10:29.460 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:10:32.990 --> 02:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
I think that the the whole issue of it
 
02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:34.330 align:start position:0%
I think that the the whole issue of it
being

02:10:34.330 --> 02:10:34.340 align:start position:0%
being
 
02:10:37.310 --> 02:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
enabling should make people have a
 
02:10:40.010 --> 02:10:40.020 align:start position:0%
certain amount of comfort that the
 
02:10:42.649 --> 02:10:42.659 align:start position:0%
people who are making the decisions at
 
02:10:44.390 --> 02:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
the municipal level are taking into
 
02:10:46.430 --> 02:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
consideration the fact that a
 
02:10:48.770 --> 02:10:48.780 align:start position:0%
neighboring municipality may not have
 
02:10:50.709 --> 02:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
the same regulations
 
02:10:53.209 --> 02:10:53.219 align:start position:0%
and they may decide that they want
 
02:10:56.570 --> 02:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
bottles they only want bags Etc et
 
02:10:59.089 --> 02:10:59.099 align:start position:0%
cetera we should let them to make that
 
02:11:00.709 --> 02:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
decision according to what their
 
02:11:03.229 --> 02:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
individual problem is and what the
 
02:11:05.030 --> 02:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
individual inclinations of the
 
02:11:07.370 --> 02:11:07.380 align:start position:0%
businesses within that municipality
 
02:11:09.890 --> 02:11:09.900 align:start position:0%
might be
 
02:11:09.900 --> 02:11:11.149 align:start position:0%
might be
um

02:11:11.149 --> 02:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:14.810 --> 02:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
there are other states that have kind of
 
02:11:17.030 --> 02:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
tiptoed into this like in Massachusetts
 
02:11:20.270 --> 02:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
they let into that municipalities do it
 
02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:22.250 align:start position:0%
they let into that municipalities do it
individually

02:11:22.250 --> 02:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
individually
 
02:11:24.229 --> 02:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
um some of the large retailers didn't
 
02:11:26.810 --> 02:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
really like it very much they wanted to
 
02:11:29.570 --> 02:11:29.580 align:start position:0%
have it so that every all the states had
 
02:11:32.030 --> 02:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
the same rules relative to their their
 
02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
Outlets so that gradually began to
 
02:11:39.290 --> 02:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
evolve into a more General band the same
 
02:11:41.810 --> 02:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
thing happened in the state of Maine so
 
02:11:43.550 --> 02:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
they have been through the same process
 
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
that we will be going through to allow
 
02:11:49.910 --> 02:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
the municipalities to take the lead and
 
02:11:52.850 --> 02:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
then the when the state sees that it is
 
02:11:54.950 --> 02:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
something that is workable and is
 
02:11:58.970 --> 02:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
acceptable to both retailers and the the
 
02:12:01.430 --> 02:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
people who live in the communities then
 
02:12:03.830 --> 02:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
they can begin to craft some legislation
 
02:12:05.930 --> 02:12:05.940 align:start position:0%
that will take care of the problem
 
02:12:05.940 --> 02:12:07.669 align:start position:0%
that will take care of the problem
Statewide

02:12:07.669 --> 02:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
02:12:10.729 --> 02:12:10.739 align:start position:0%
as I began it's time for us to take
 
02:12:13.910 --> 02:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility of this we know that the
 
02:12:16.370 --> 02:12:16.380 align:start position:0%
plastic particularly plastic bags are a
 
02:12:20.810 --> 02:12:20.820 align:start position:0%
huge problem we must be responsible and
 
02:12:23.629 --> 02:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
do something about it if you just want
 
02:12:26.330 --> 02:12:26.340 align:start position:0%
to start with plastic bags that's fine
 
02:12:29.510 --> 02:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
with me but you know you would have to
 
02:12:31.870 --> 02:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
get an amendment and I'm sure your
 
02:12:34.430 --> 02:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
representative stavis knows this issue
 
02:12:36.589 --> 02:12:36.599 align:start position:0%
inside and out would be able to help you
 
02:12:38.870 --> 02:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
02:12:40.430 --> 02:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
do we have any questions representative
 
02:12:40.440 --> 02:12:42.830 align:start position:0%
do we have any questions representative
Brown

02:12:42.830 --> 02:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:45.169 --> 02:12:45.179 align:start position:0%
based on the questions from the other
 
02:12:47.089 --> 02:12:47.099 align:start position:0%
Representatives I guess my concern is
 
02:12:49.010 --> 02:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
you know how do you implement this on
 
02:12:51.709 --> 02:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
such a this seems like such a
 
02:12:53.149 --> 02:12:53.159 align:start position:0%
wide-reaching thing and you've just
 
02:12:55.910 --> 02:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
talked about the fact that plastic bags
 
02:12:58.129 --> 02:12:58.139 align:start position:0%
are the most significant issue as far as
 
02:12:59.930 --> 02:12:59.940 align:start position:0%
you're concerned something that you
 
02:13:02.629 --> 02:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
think you can deal with why don't you uh
 
02:13:06.169 --> 02:13:06.179 align:start position:0%
simplify the bill so that uh the
 
02:13:08.629 --> 02:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
implementation could be more realistic
 
02:13:11.030 --> 02:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:13:14.209 --> 02:13:14.219 align:start position:0%
I didn't mean to imply that bags are the
 
02:13:17.750 --> 02:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
most the most problematic I meant I
 
02:13:20.930 --> 02:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
think that it's the most easily dealt
 
02:13:23.030 --> 02:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
with you know people are used to already
 
02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
putting their plastic bags into
 
02:13:27.050 --> 02:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
recycling when they're at a grocery
 
02:13:29.030 --> 02:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
store they're getting used to bringing
 
02:13:31.310 --> 02:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
their own bags I think it's the most
 
02:13:33.589 --> 02:13:33.599 align:start position:0%
approachable so it's the best way to
 
02:13:36.350 --> 02:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
begin to work our way into it we have to
 
02:13:39.410 --> 02:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
get the the cooperation of particularly
 
02:13:42.649 --> 02:13:42.659 align:start position:0%
the retailers to begin to change the way
 
02:13:46.390 --> 02:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
they handle their uh their packaging
 
02:13:48.350 --> 02:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
I believe you already answered this
 
02:13:50.209 --> 02:13:50.219 align:start position:0%
question we've got a lot of people to go
 
02:13:51.589 --> 02:13:51.599 align:start position:0%
through so I'm gonna have to stop you
 
02:13:53.450 --> 02:13:53.460 align:start position:0%
right there that any further further
 
02:13:53.460 --> 02:13:54.830 align:start position:0%
right there that any further further
questions

02:13:54.830 --> 02:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:13:57.950 --> 02:13:57.960 align:start position:0%
see you none thank you very much uh next
 
02:14:03.229 --> 02:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:05.569 --> 02:14:05.579 align:start position:0%
well hello Henry how are you
 
02:14:07.069 --> 02:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
good to see you again
 
02:14:09.950 --> 02:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
thank you much uh Mr chairman and
 
02:14:11.410 --> 02:14:11.420 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
02:14:14.750 --> 02:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
my name is Henry vayu and I'm here
 
02:14:17.089 --> 02:14:17.099 align:start position:0%
behalf of the New Hampshire lodging and
 
02:14:19.729 --> 02:14:19.739 align:start position:0%
Restaurant Association which is
 
02:14:23.750 --> 02:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
comprised primarily of a lot of locally
 
02:14:27.609 --> 02:14:27.619 align:start position:0%
owned uh uh restaurant operators
 
02:14:31.850 --> 02:14:31.860 align:start position:0%
and we oppose this bill and primarily
 
02:14:34.729 --> 02:14:34.739 align:start position:0%
because uh the members really don't want
 
02:14:36.790 --> 02:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
to see a patchwork
 
02:14:41.229 --> 02:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
approach uh to regulating and
 
02:14:43.970 --> 02:14:43.980 align:start position:0%
determining what happens with single use
 
02:14:46.970 --> 02:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
products uh we come from the perspective
 
02:14:50.030 --> 02:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
of takeout packaging obviously there's
 
02:14:51.950 --> 02:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
take out patch a lot a lot of takeout
 
02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:53.870 align:start position:0%
take out patch a lot a lot of takeout
packaging

02:14:53.870 --> 02:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
packaging
 
02:14:57.470 --> 02:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
um with our members and if there was a
 
02:15:01.669 --> 02:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
community to adopt one sort of a rule
 
02:15:05.209 --> 02:15:05.219 align:start position:0%
with regards to tape out packaging an
 
02:15:07.669 --> 02:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
operator like the Common Man family of
 
02:15:09.589 --> 02:15:09.599 align:start position:0%
restaurants which has restaurants all
 
02:15:11.390 --> 02:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
over the state of New Hampshire or a
 
02:15:13.910 --> 02:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
great New Hampshire restaurants company
 
02:15:16.609 --> 02:15:16.619 align:start position:0%
which has a T-Bones Cactus Jacks Copper
 
02:15:18.129 --> 02:15:18.139 align:start position:0%
Door they have
 
02:15:21.109 --> 02:15:21.119 align:start position:0%
operations all over the state if a
 
02:15:24.169 --> 02:15:24.179 align:start position:0%
community adopted a certain set of rules
 
02:15:26.089 --> 02:15:26.099 align:start position:0%
regarding takeout that would basically
 
02:15:27.709 --> 02:15:27.719 align:start position:0%
dictate what would happen to all the
 
02:15:30.830 --> 02:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
others because they they buy in bulk for
 
02:15:33.290 --> 02:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
all their restaurants and to comply with
 
02:15:34.450 --> 02:15:34.460 align:start position:0%
one Community
 
02:15:37.850 --> 02:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't make sense to have have you
 
02:15:39.649 --> 02:15:39.659 align:start position:0%
know a bunch of
 
02:15:41.450 --> 02:15:41.460 align:start position:0%
different kinds of packaging that they
 
02:15:44.030 --> 02:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
would order so it would complicate it
 
02:15:46.910 --> 02:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
for a lot of those operators and for
 
02:15:49.609 --> 02:15:49.619 align:start position:0%
that reason we opposed the bill
 
02:15:50.990 --> 02:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
02:15:52.250 --> 02:15:52.260 align:start position:0%
do we have any questions representative
 
02:15:54.830 --> 02:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
management thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:15:56.990 --> 02:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
02:15:57.000 --> 02:15:57.709 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
um

02:15:57.709 --> 02:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:59.870 --> 02:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
the you know it's a large associations
 
02:16:03.649 --> 02:16:03.659 align:start position:0%
and large businesses that use this
 
02:16:05.450 --> 02:16:05.460 align:start position:0%
recycled stuff
 
02:16:09.410 --> 02:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
want the market dictate if the Mark if
 
02:16:13.069 --> 02:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
the plastic is not available for the
 
02:16:15.709 --> 02:16:15.719 align:start position:0%
restaurant and the only choice they have
 
02:16:18.709 --> 02:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
is the recyclable whatever
 
02:16:18.719 --> 02:16:19.910 align:start position:0%
is the recyclable whatever
um one

02:16:19.910 --> 02:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
um one
 
02:16:22.729 --> 02:16:22.739 align:start position:0%
would uh don't you think that would
 
02:16:25.209 --> 02:16:25.219 align:start position:0%
shift it so if there's a partnership
 
02:16:29.330 --> 02:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
with the big businesses so
 
02:16:31.669 --> 02:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
um and again there's a lot of locally
 
02:16:34.490 --> 02:16:34.500 align:start position:0%
owned uh restaurants uh not all of them
 
02:16:39.110 --> 02:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
are the big business as you uh describe
 
02:16:40.790 --> 02:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
um and there are you know limited
 
02:16:42.709 --> 02:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
options with regard to take out
 
02:16:42.719 --> 02:16:44.570 align:start position:0%
options with regard to take out
packaging

02:16:44.570 --> 02:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
packaging
 
02:16:47.389 --> 02:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
um some are more expensive than others
 
02:16:49.730 --> 02:16:49.740 align:start position:0%
um certainly uh restaurant operators
 
02:16:52.669 --> 02:16:52.679 align:start position:0%
listen to their customers I mean Common
 
02:16:55.370 --> 02:16:55.380 align:start position:0%
Man family of restaurants has gone to
 
02:16:57.469 --> 02:16:57.479 align:start position:0%
paper straws unless you request a
 
02:16:59.629 --> 02:16:59.639 align:start position:0%
plastic straw so that's something I
 
02:17:01.730 --> 02:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
think they've heard from their customers
 
02:17:04.009 --> 02:17:04.019 align:start position:0%
so to your point I mean they'll respond
 
02:17:06.889 --> 02:17:06.899 align:start position:0%
to the market and their Market are their
 
02:17:08.629 --> 02:17:08.639 align:start position:0%
customers so if their customers want
 
02:17:11.629 --> 02:17:11.639 align:start position:0%
something different and their uh you
 
02:17:14.150 --> 02:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
know environmentally conscious they'll
 
02:17:17.830 --> 02:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:20.209 --> 02:17:20.219 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you very
 
02:17:22.190 --> 02:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
much thank you uh before I call the next
 
02:17:25.070 --> 02:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
witness I have a Michael Nork uh from
 
02:17:26.990 --> 02:17:27.000 align:start position:0%

02:17:37.910 --> 02:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:39.770 --> 02:17:39.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I will be brief
 
02:17:41.209 --> 02:17:41.219 align:start position:0%
nature Grace for the municipal
 
02:17:43.790 --> 02:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
Association we are in support of uh the
 
02:17:45.889 --> 02:17:45.899 align:start position:0%
idea of expanding the authority of towns
 
02:17:45.899 --> 02:17:47.150 align:start position:0%
idea of expanding the authority of towns
uh

02:17:47.150 --> 02:17:47.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:17:49.730 --> 02:17:49.740 align:start position:0%
which generally and specifically to
 
02:17:49.740 --> 02:17:51.169 align:start position:0%
which generally and specifically to
regulating

02:17:51.169 --> 02:17:51.179 align:start position:0%
regulating
 
02:17:54.169 --> 02:17:54.179 align:start position:0%
um single-use packaging
 
02:17:55.610 --> 02:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
um I do want to address a couple
 
02:17:57.669 --> 02:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
questions that the committee had
 
02:18:00.589 --> 02:18:00.599 align:start position:0%
representative power asked about who
 
02:18:03.370 --> 02:18:03.380 align:start position:0%
under 3139 has the authority to create
 
02:18:06.410 --> 02:18:06.420 align:start position:0%
bylaws bylaws or just another word for
 
02:18:08.150 --> 02:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
Town ordinances and that would be the
 
02:18:10.009 --> 02:18:10.019 align:start position:0%
legislative body so typically that would
 
02:18:13.070 --> 02:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
be proposed by the governing body by the
 
02:18:14.389 --> 02:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
select board and then we would have to
 
02:18:16.370 --> 02:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
be voted on by town meeting
 
02:18:19.429 --> 02:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
representative yokella asked about the
 
02:18:22.669 --> 02:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
disposal side of things I would defer
 
02:18:25.870 --> 02:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
entirely to Michael Nork at DES to to
 
02:18:28.310 --> 02:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
talk about that because he's certainly
 
02:18:30.709 --> 02:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
the expert in that area that's lines 13
 
02:18:33.169 --> 02:18:33.179 align:start position:0%
to 14.
 
02:18:36.950 --> 02:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
um and uh I believe uh representative
 
02:18:39.049 --> 02:18:39.059 align:start position:0%
Howland um and manjapody both had
 
02:18:40.910 --> 02:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
questions about
 
02:18:43.190 --> 02:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
um basically trying to narrow down what
 
02:18:45.589 --> 02:18:45.599 align:start position:0%
the term single-use packaging meant um
 
02:18:47.209 --> 02:18:47.219 align:start position:0%
and I I would just recognize that that's
 
02:18:49.969 --> 02:18:49.979 align:start position:0%
a broad term that's not further defined
 
02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
in this in the statute so presumably
 
02:18:54.349 --> 02:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
it would be narrowed down at the local
 
02:18:56.030 --> 02:18:56.040 align:start position:0%
level if this Authority was granted to
 
02:18:57.889 --> 02:18:57.899 align:start position:0%
municipalities I'm happy to take any
 
02:19:00.469 --> 02:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
questions that anyone may have
 
02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
represent of your color thank you thank
 
02:19:05.810 --> 02:19:05.820 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question
 
02:19:07.969 --> 02:19:07.979 align:start position:0%
um did I understand your testimony
 
02:19:11.830 --> 02:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
correctly that you're that that
 
02:19:14.929 --> 02:19:14.939 align:start position:0%
municipalities need to
 
02:19:18.169 --> 02:19:18.179 align:start position:0%
um go get approval from the legislative
 
02:19:22.969 --> 02:19:22.979 align:start position:0%
uh body uh for their adoption of bylaws
 
02:19:25.370 --> 02:19:25.380 align:start position:0%
and that they're not able to
 
02:19:29.209 --> 02:19:29.219 align:start position:0%
um enact bylaws over the opposition of
 
02:19:32.330 --> 02:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
of the uh municipality the the
 
02:19:38.110 --> 02:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:42.290 --> 02:19:42.300 align:start position:0%
uh anything under RSA 3139 would have to
 
02:19:44.570 --> 02:19:44.580 align:start position:0%
be adopted at town meeting
 
02:19:46.250 --> 02:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
um or you know cities obviously city
 
02:19:49.730 --> 02:19:49.740 align:start position:0%
council the one wrinkle with this
 
02:19:53.090 --> 02:19:53.100 align:start position:0%
particular uh bill is that
 
02:19:56.150 --> 02:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
there's already a statute RSA 149 M
 
02:19:58.969 --> 02:19:58.979 align:start position:0%
which again Des can talk about
 
02:20:02.150 --> 02:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
regarding how transfer stations work and
 
02:20:04.810 --> 02:20:04.820 align:start position:0%
all that waste disposal side of things
 
02:20:07.610 --> 02:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
so there's already Authority that exists
 
02:20:10.750 --> 02:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
for disposal and there's more specific
 
02:20:12.950 --> 02:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
Authority there so if you have specific
 
02:20:15.230 --> 02:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
questions again I'd defer to Des on
 
02:20:18.550 --> 02:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:21.889 --> 02:20:21.899 align:start position:0%
representative man chaputi thank you Mr
 
02:20:25.490 --> 02:20:25.500 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Mr Grace for taking my
 
02:20:25.500 --> 02:20:26.929 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Mr Grace for taking my
question

02:20:26.929 --> 02:20:26.939 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:20:28.969 --> 02:20:28.979 align:start position:0%
um and answering my some of my previous
 
02:20:28.979 --> 02:20:30.650 align:start position:0%
um and answering my some of my previous
questions

02:20:30.650 --> 02:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:20:34.610 --> 02:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
so nhma is supporting this because it
 
02:20:36.710 --> 02:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
gives the local Authority
 
02:20:38.590 --> 02:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
correct it gives greater local Authority
 
02:20:42.950 --> 02:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
and follow Mr chair follow up thank you
 
02:20:50.870 --> 02:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
you just alluded to RSA 149 m m and how
 
02:20:55.610 --> 02:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
does this conflict or would it conflict
 
02:20:58.370 --> 02:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
and to what extent would it conflict
 
02:21:00.710 --> 02:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
again I would defer to Des for that
 
02:21:00.720 --> 02:21:03.590 align:start position:0%
again I would defer to Des for that
question

02:21:03.590 --> 02:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:06.110 --> 02:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Grace thank you
 
02:21:22.429 --> 02:21:22.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:24.290 --> 02:21:24.300 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
02:21:26.389 --> 02:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
the committee uh for the record my name
 
02:21:28.550 --> 02:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
is Kevin Daigle and I'm with the New
 
02:21:30.830 --> 02:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Grocers Association we
 
02:21:33.290 --> 02:21:33.300 align:start position:0%
represent both the chain and independent
 
02:21:35.750 --> 02:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
Grocery and convenience stores
 
02:21:37.849 --> 02:21:37.859 align:start position:0%
I passed out some testimony that you
 
02:21:39.230 --> 02:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
received shortly and I'll try and keep
 
02:21:40.969 --> 02:21:40.979 align:start position:0%
my comments brief in respect of your
 
02:21:43.670 --> 02:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
time we have a couple areas of concern
 
02:21:45.590 --> 02:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
with this bill and appear today in
 
02:21:49.010 --> 02:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
opposition to house bill 226. this isn't
 
02:21:51.349 --> 02:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
so much a Plastics issue as it is a
 
02:21:54.170 --> 02:21:54.180 align:start position:0%
local control issue as you're aware New
 
02:21:55.910 --> 02:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire currently is not a home rule
 
02:21:58.309 --> 02:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
state and our members greatly appreciate
 
02:22:00.349 --> 02:22:00.359 align:start position:0%
the ease of conducting business in New
 
02:22:02.450 --> 02:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire versus surrounding states that
 
02:22:04.490 --> 02:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
do allow that local control
 
02:22:06.770 --> 02:22:06.780 align:start position:0%
by allowing cows to impose their own
 
02:22:09.349 --> 02:22:09.359 align:start position:0%
regulations Grocers and businesses in
 
02:22:11.150 --> 02:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
general will be faced with the patchwork
 
02:22:13.670 --> 02:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
of local ordinances this increases
 
02:22:15.650 --> 02:22:15.660 align:start position:0%
confusion for both customers and
 
02:22:17.809 --> 02:22:17.819 align:start position:0%
businesses alike and through high cost
 
02:22:20.690 --> 02:22:20.700 align:start position:0%
of compliance unnecessarily increases
 
02:22:22.790 --> 02:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
the cost for all parties
 
02:22:24.530 --> 02:22:24.540 align:start position:0%
in addition to the confusion and
 
02:22:26.990 --> 02:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
complexities this bill creates it also
 
02:22:29.450 --> 02:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
sets a bad precedent it provides an
 
02:22:32.510 --> 02:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity if passed to open Pandora's
 
02:22:34.730 --> 02:22:34.740 align:start position:0%
Box and potentially allow for other
 
02:22:37.070 --> 02:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
issues to come forward seeking home rule
 
02:22:39.349 --> 02:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
this creates an even greater web on
 
02:22:41.389 --> 02:22:41.399 align:start position:0%
regulations that businesses and citizens
 
02:22:43.429 --> 02:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
would need to navigate
 
02:22:45.349 --> 02:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
we've heard from proponents that plastic
 
02:22:48.110 --> 02:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
bags are not recycled so they need to
 
02:22:49.910 --> 02:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
regulate and ban them
 
02:22:52.250 --> 02:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
just because a town bans bags doesn't
 
02:22:53.809 --> 02:22:53.819 align:start position:0%
stop residents from going to a
 
02:22:55.910 --> 02:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
neighboring Town shopping and bringing
 
02:22:57.710 --> 02:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
those bags back to their town to the
 
02:22:57.720 --> 02:22:58.550 align:start position:0%
those bags back to their town to the
house

02:22:58.550 --> 02:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
house
 
02:23:00.530 --> 02:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
members of the food industry take great
 
02:23:01.849 --> 02:23:01.859 align:start position:0%
pride in the recycling and
 
02:23:03.530 --> 02:23:03.540 align:start position:0%
sustainability efforts that they've made
 
02:23:04.790 --> 02:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
over the years
 
02:23:07.550 --> 02:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
for instance Grocers provide recycling
 
02:23:09.889 --> 02:23:09.899 align:start position:0%
bins at their stores to assist in
 
02:23:12.410 --> 02:23:12.420 align:start position:0%
recycling single-use bags which then in
 
02:23:13.809 --> 02:23:13.819 align:start position:0%
turn are recycled into clothing
 
02:23:16.790 --> 02:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
composite decking and other plastic bags
 
02:23:19.070 --> 02:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
for these reasons we ask you to find
 
02:23:22.070 --> 02:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
House Bill 226 in expedient to legislate
 
02:23:24.830 --> 02:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:27.410 --> 02:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
well done on the testimony one minute 40
 
02:23:29.510 --> 02:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
seconds very sweet
 
02:23:32.929 --> 02:23:32.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:34.670 --> 02:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
02:23:39.730 --> 02:23:39.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:55.130 --> 02:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:57.050 --> 02:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Zachary Taylor I'm
 
02:23:58.370 --> 02:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
the director of the American recyclable
 
02:23:59.870 --> 02:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
plastic bag lines that was formerly
 
02:24:01.250 --> 02:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
known as the American Progressive bag
 
02:24:03.710 --> 02:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
Alliance we changed our name as part of
 
02:24:04.969 --> 02:24:04.979 align:start position:0%
our sustainability commitment to
 
02:24:06.349 --> 02:24:06.359 align:start position:0%
recognize the important fact that
 
02:24:07.969 --> 02:24:07.979 align:start position:0%
plastic grocery bags are in fact
 
02:24:09.469 --> 02:24:09.479 align:start position:0%
recyclable through the store take back
 
02:24:10.730 --> 02:24:10.740 align:start position:0%
programs we have partnered with
 
02:24:12.950 --> 02:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
retailers to establish I visited
 
02:24:14.330 --> 02:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
recycling facilities of Our member
 
02:24:15.770 --> 02:24:15.780 align:start position:0%
companies and seen truckloads of these
 
02:24:17.750 --> 02:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
products cease
 
02:24:19.370 --> 02:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
um could you please tell us if you're
 
02:24:21.830 --> 02:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
for or against the Bill I'm here in
 
02:24:24.710 --> 02:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
opposition thank you the proposal my
 
02:24:24.720 --> 02:24:25.730 align:start position:0%
opposition thank you the proposal my
apologies

02:24:25.730 --> 02:24:25.740 align:start position:0%
apologies
 
02:24:27.530 --> 02:24:27.540 align:start position:0%
um a bit visited facilities where these
 
02:24:28.910 --> 02:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
bags are brought in by their truckloads
 
02:24:30.530 --> 02:24:30.540 align:start position:0%
processed into new bags and then sold
 
02:24:32.750 --> 02:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
back to back to customers who then can
 
02:24:34.550 --> 02:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
complete the cycle again and again they
 
02:24:36.050 --> 02:24:36.060 align:start position:0%
are also recycled into other products
 
02:24:38.210 --> 02:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
like composite Lumber decking playground
 
02:24:40.490 --> 02:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
equipment railroad ties and other
 
02:24:42.530 --> 02:24:42.540 align:start position:0%
materials uh we have significant
 
02:24:45.110 --> 02:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
concerns that opening the door uh with
 
02:24:48.349 --> 02:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
226 will create a patchwork of competing
 
02:24:50.150 --> 02:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
local ordinances that are expensive for
 
02:24:52.429 --> 02:24:52.439 align:start position:0%
businesses expensive for consumers and
 
02:24:54.250 --> 02:24:54.260 align:start position:0%
disruptive to economies of scale
 
02:24:56.690 --> 02:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts provides a great example
 
02:24:58.910 --> 02:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
of what can happen if this allows if
 
02:25:00.849 --> 02:25:00.859 align:start position:0%
this is allowed to go forward they have
 
02:25:03.590 --> 02:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
153 separate local ordinances dealing
 
02:25:05.750 --> 02:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
with carryout bags alone
 
02:25:07.790 --> 02:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
in the city of Boston there are four
 
02:25:09.349 --> 02:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
separate ordinances within the city
 
02:25:11.510 --> 02:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
within the greater City Limits Middlesex
 
02:25:13.429 --> 02:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
County their largest county the most
 
02:25:15.410 --> 02:25:15.420 align:start position:0%
populous county has 40 different local
 
02:25:15.420 --> 02:25:16.969 align:start position:0%
populous county has 40 different local
rules

02:25:16.969 --> 02:25:16.979 align:start position:0%
rules
 
02:25:18.950 --> 02:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
an environment where food prices are
 
02:25:20.929 --> 02:25:20.939 align:start position:0%
going up and up and up
 
02:25:22.790 --> 02:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
requiring stores to switch to more
 
02:25:24.170 --> 02:25:24.180 align:start position:0%
expensive alternative products will
 
02:25:25.809 --> 02:25:25.819 align:start position:0%
increase prices on struggling families
 
02:25:29.270 --> 02:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
one retailer in South Carolina facing a
 
02:25:31.190 --> 02:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
similar proposal to prohibit plastic
 
02:25:32.990 --> 02:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
bags noted that their costs would
 
02:25:36.230 --> 02:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
increase per store by 250 thousand
 
02:25:36.240 --> 02:25:37.910 align:start position:0%
increase per store by 250 thousand
dollars

02:25:37.910 --> 02:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:25:39.410 --> 02:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
those are expenses that will be passed
 
02:25:40.670 --> 02:25:40.680 align:start position:0%

struggling
 
02:25:45.050 --> 02:25:45.060 align:start position:0%
most importantly we've heard a lot about
 
02:25:46.610 --> 02:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
litter and waste
 
02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
let me be clear the industry does not
 
02:25:50.450 --> 02:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
want to see any of our products disposed
 
02:25:52.670 --> 02:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
of improperly but the data tells a
 
02:25:54.590 --> 02:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
different story keep America beautiful
 
02:25:56.690 --> 02:25:56.700 align:start position:0%
did a nationwide litter survey on
 
02:25:58.190 --> 02:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
roadways and waterways across the
 
02:26:00.110 --> 02:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
country what they found is that plastic
 
02:26:01.730 --> 02:26:01.740 align:start position:0%
carryout bags like the ones that will be
 
02:26:04.429 --> 02:26:04.439 align:start position:0%
targeted if localities are able to
 
02:26:06.650 --> 02:26:06.660 align:start position:0%
create receive this Authority account
 
02:26:08.990 --> 02:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
for 0.6 percent of items collected at
 
02:26:11.270 --> 02:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
litter cleanup when we talk about the
 
02:26:12.290 --> 02:26:12.300 align:start position:0%
waste stream
 
02:26:13.790 --> 02:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
data from the U.S Environmental
 
02:26:16.370 --> 02:26:16.380 align:start position:0%
Protection Agency shows that all plastic
 
02:26:18.050 --> 02:26:18.060 align:start position:0%
bags and sacks combine so everything
 
02:26:20.150 --> 02:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
from a plastic grocery bag to a chip bag
 
02:26:22.250 --> 02:26:22.260 align:start position:0%
that could be banned under this bill to
 
02:26:23.870 --> 02:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
a garbage bag that could be banned under
 
02:26:27.050 --> 02:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
this bill account for 0.3 percent of
 
02:26:29.210 --> 02:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
Municipal Solid Waste to suggest that
 
02:26:31.550 --> 02:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
plastic bags are a major driver of
 
02:26:33.889 --> 02:26:33.899 align:start position:0%
litter or waste flies in the face of the
 
02:26:36.170 --> 02:26:36.180 align:start position:0%
data and suggesting that bills like 226
 
02:26:38.210 --> 02:26:38.220 align:start position:0%
are necessary to help communities deal
 
02:26:40.370 --> 02:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
with these very real challenges
 
02:26:43.370 --> 02:26:43.380 align:start position:0%
flies in the face of the data
 
02:26:45.290 --> 02:26:45.300 align:start position:0%
I just want to close and say we
 
02:26:46.910 --> 02:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
encourage you to oppose this bill to
 
02:26:48.830 --> 02:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
preserve several important things in the
 
02:26:50.630 --> 02:26:50.640 align:start position:0%

consumers are facing incredible stresses
 
02:27:07.309 --> 02:27:07.319 align:start position:0%
right now with high prices this will add

to their grocery bills whether it's
 
02:27:10.490 --> 02:27:10.500 align:start position:0%

02:27:11.990 --> 02:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
being forced to purchase alternative
 
02:27:13.550 --> 02:27:13.560 align:start position:0%

still made from plastic regardless
 
02:27:18.349 --> 02:27:18.359 align:start position:0%
regulatory surgery and uniformity across
 
02:27:20.210 --> 02:27:20.220 align:start position:0%
the state as well these are all
 
02:27:21.950 --> 02:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
important considerations we look forward
 
02:27:25.730 --> 02:27:25.740 align:start position:0%
to answering any questions and
 
02:27:27.770 --> 02:27:27.780 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
02:27:28.910 --> 02:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
02:27:30.290 --> 02:27:30.300 align:start position:0%
representative Brown
 
02:27:32.389 --> 02:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
just one quick question out of all the
 
02:27:34.849 --> 02:27:34.859 align:start position:0%
bags that are produced these recyclable
 
02:27:37.010 --> 02:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
bags what percentage are actually
 
02:27:39.349 --> 02:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
recycled the U.S Environmental
 
02:27:41.210 --> 02:27:41.220 align:start position:0%
Protection Agency estimates that between
 
02:27:43.969 --> 02:27:43.979 align:start position:0%
10 to 12 percent of plastic bags get
 
02:27:46.910 --> 02:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
recycled research from recycled back the
 
02:27:48.889 --> 02:27:48.899 align:start position:0%
recycling authority of Quebec Canada
 
02:27:50.870 --> 02:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
found that one of the reasons why that
 
02:27:52.309 --> 02:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
number may not be as high as some people
 
02:27:53.630 --> 02:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
would like to see we'd certainly like to
 
02:27:55.610 --> 02:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
see it go up is that plastic bags are
 
02:27:58.250 --> 02:27:58.260 align:start position:0%
highly reused around the home up to 77
 
02:27:59.750 --> 02:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
percent of bags get reused for things
 
02:28:01.370 --> 02:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
around the house like picking up after
 
02:28:03.349 --> 02:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
pets or aligning Waste Paper bins at the
 
02:28:06.830 --> 02:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
home cleaning out food scraps I know I
 
02:28:08.270 --> 02:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
use mine when I travel to keep my shoes
 
02:28:10.070 --> 02:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
and clothes clean as I move from state
 
02:28:11.570 --> 02:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
to state
 
02:28:13.790 --> 02:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:28:16.790 --> 02:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
representative man chapudi thank you Mr
 
02:28:16.800 --> 02:28:17.990 align:start position:0%
representative man chapudi thank you Mr
chair

02:28:17.990 --> 02:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:28:19.849 --> 02:28:19.859 align:start position:0%
um you answered part of my question
 
02:28:23.469 --> 02:28:23.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for the 10 of the total bag
 
02:28:26.570 --> 02:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
recycled and reuse
 
02:28:30.530 --> 02:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
is not same as recycle where it
 
02:28:33.889 --> 02:28:33.899 align:start position:0%
continues to stay in the environment at
 
02:28:36.230 --> 02:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
some point it ends up in the lab
 
02:28:37.730 --> 02:28:37.740 align:start position:0%
representative do you have a question
 
02:28:40.929 --> 02:28:40.939 align:start position:0%
for these so thank you don't you
 
02:28:44.750 --> 02:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
don't you think that it is ending up in
 
02:28:48.349 --> 02:28:48.359 align:start position:0%
the landfill whether it's reused or not
 
02:28:53.090 --> 02:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
so Banning use of in the distribution at
 
02:28:57.610 --> 02:28:57.620 align:start position:0%
the beginning will reduce the
 
02:29:00.730 --> 02:29:00.740 align:start position:0%
plastic bags one way or the other
 
02:29:03.590 --> 02:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
recycled reused
 
02:29:07.730 --> 02:29:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:07.740 --> 02:29:09.050 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:29:09.050 --> 02:29:09.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:29:10.309 --> 02:29:10.319 align:start position:0%
think I understand the question
 
02:29:11.809 --> 02:29:11.819 align:start position:0%
representative what I would say to you
 
02:29:14.929 --> 02:29:14.939 align:start position:0%
is that we're using a plastic bag allows
 
02:29:16.490 --> 02:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
you to not use another plastic product
 
02:29:18.410 --> 02:29:18.420 align:start position:0%
that is often thicker more plastic
 
02:29:20.090 --> 02:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
intensive and contains less recycled
 
02:29:20.100 --> 02:29:21.230 align:start position:0%
intensive and contains less recycled
content

02:29:21.230 --> 02:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
content
 
02:29:23.210 --> 02:29:23.220 align:start position:0%
um so these household tasks are still
 
02:29:24.530 --> 02:29:24.540 align:start position:0%
going to be completed people will find
 
02:29:26.690 --> 02:29:26.700 align:start position:0%
products to do them with being able to
 
02:29:29.090 --> 02:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
reuse a plastic bag cuts out on that and
 
02:29:31.070 --> 02:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
to be clear we want to see bags recycled
 
02:29:32.270 --> 02:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
but if they're not going to be recycled
 
02:29:33.770 --> 02:29:33.780 align:start position:0%
they should be reused and then disposed
 
02:29:35.330 --> 02:29:35.340 align:start position:0%
of properly
 
02:29:35.340 --> 02:29:39.250 align:start position:0%
of properly
foreign

02:29:39.250 --> 02:29:39.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:41.090 --> 02:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
representative priests didn't see there
 
02:29:43.250 --> 02:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:29:44.750 --> 02:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:29:47.450 --> 02:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
it sounds like that you are again
 
02:29:51.349 --> 02:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
enabling municipalities to do this but
 
02:29:53.630 --> 02:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have any opposition for a
 
02:29:57.250 --> 02:29:57.260 align:start position:0%
Statewide prohibition of plastic bag
 
02:30:00.410 --> 02:30:00.420 align:start position:0%
single-use plastic bags as they do in
 
02:30:02.929 --> 02:30:02.939 align:start position:0%
Maine and it's been very successful
 
02:30:02.939 --> 02:30:04.670 align:start position:0%
Maine and it's been very successful
question

02:30:04.670 --> 02:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:30:06.830 --> 02:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh we would oppose that as well plastic
 
02:30:09.230 --> 02:30:09.240 align:start position:0%
bag Bans are ineffective in advancing
 
02:30:10.730 --> 02:30:10.740 align:start position:0%
their underlying sustainability goals
 
02:30:12.050 --> 02:30:12.060 align:start position:0%
because they're not a large contributor
 
02:30:14.330 --> 02:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
to the litter waste or Marine debris and
 
02:30:16.130 --> 02:30:16.140 align:start position:0%
they put unintended consequences on
 
02:30:17.809 --> 02:30:17.819 align:start position:0%
families and Shoppers that are highly
 
02:30:17.819 --> 02:30:19.010 align:start position:0%
families and Shoppers that are highly
expensive

02:30:19.010 --> 02:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
expensive
 
02:30:20.450 --> 02:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
um so yes we would oppose a Statewide
 
02:30:21.950 --> 02:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
ban as well because
 
02:30:23.630 --> 02:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
while states have implemented them they
 
02:30:25.790 --> 02:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
have not been shown to deliver on those
 
02:30:27.110 --> 02:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
concerns because the alternative
 
02:30:29.090 --> 02:30:29.100 align:start position:0%
products often have higher environmental
 
02:30:32.030 --> 02:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
Footprints higher emissions profiles and
 
02:30:33.230 --> 02:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
are often still made of plastic but
 
02:30:34.610 --> 02:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
can't be recycled whatsoever those
 
02:30:36.170 --> 02:30:36.180 align:start position:0%
Stitch bags of the grocery stores are a
 
02:30:38.570 --> 02:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
great example of that a follow-up Mr
 
02:30:42.469 --> 02:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
chairman follow up thank you so what
 
02:30:45.230 --> 02:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
you're telling me is these cloth bags
 
02:30:47.630 --> 02:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
that I use every time to the grocery
 
02:30:49.550 --> 02:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
store is more
 
02:30:52.429 --> 02:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
dangerous to the environment and and
 
02:30:55.190 --> 02:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
offer more impacts than a single-use
 
02:30:59.570 --> 02:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
plastic bag that doesn't degrade
 
02:31:01.610 --> 02:31:01.620 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh I'm not
 
02:31:03.410 --> 02:31:03.420 align:start position:0%
saying it life cycle assessment after
 
02:31:05.090 --> 02:31:05.100 align:start position:0%
life cycle assessment conducted by
 
02:31:07.070 --> 02:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
international government agencies and
 
02:31:08.389 --> 02:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
universities here in the US have
 
02:31:09.950 --> 02:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
compared the environmental impacts of
 
02:31:11.270 --> 02:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
these products looking at the whole life
 
02:31:13.370 --> 02:31:13.380 align:start position:0%
cycle what they find is that you need to
 
02:31:15.290 --> 02:31:15.300 align:start position:0%
reuse these products substantially more
 
02:31:17.690 --> 02:31:17.700 align:start position:0%
for example a cloth bag the New York
 
02:31:19.429 --> 02:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
Times reported on this if it's made of
 
02:31:21.530 --> 02:31:21.540 align:start position:0%
organic cotton you'd have to reuse it 20
 
02:31:23.150 --> 02:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
000 times to have the same environmental
 
02:31:24.889 --> 02:31:24.899 align:start position:0%
impact as a quote unquote single-use
 
02:31:26.870 --> 02:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
plastic bag that's every day for more
 
02:31:33.070 --> 02:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:35.450 --> 02:31:35.460 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
02:31:37.309 --> 02:31:37.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Sharon thank you for taking
 
02:31:41.630 --> 02:31:41.640 align:start position:0%
my question you just cited in response
 
02:31:44.450 --> 02:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
to a previous question studies that show
 
02:31:47.090 --> 02:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
that plastic bag bands are ineffective

can you cite those specific studies

can you cite those specific studies
please

research from the University of Sydney

evaluating California's plastic bag ban
 
02:31:58.309 --> 02:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
found that
 
02:32:00.290 --> 02:32:00.300 align:start position:0%
there's an increase in purchase of
 
02:32:02.389 --> 02:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
plastic trash bags on that ban that have
 
02:32:04.190 --> 02:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
a higher emissions profile and a higher
 
02:32:06.110 --> 02:32:06.120 align:start position:0%

02:32:09.710 --> 02:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
of reducing plastic consumption or
 
02:32:13.130 --> 02:32:13.140 align:start position:0%
reducing emissions follow up Mr chair
 
02:32:14.450 --> 02:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
02:32:17.090 --> 02:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
I believe that you um excuse me I
 
02:32:18.590 --> 02:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
believe you're referring to studies that
 
02:32:20.690 --> 02:32:20.700 align:start position:0%
were conducted in New England states you
 
02:32:21.950 --> 02:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
referred to those
 
02:32:24.170 --> 02:32:24.180 align:start position:0%
studies conducted in New England states
 
02:32:26.270 --> 02:32:26.280 align:start position:0%
that showed the program to be
 
02:32:29.030 --> 02:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
ineffective can you cite those studies
 
02:32:30.469 --> 02:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
representative there may have been a
 
02:32:32.450 --> 02:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
miscommunication I referenced a study
 
02:32:34.849 --> 02:32:34.859 align:start position:0%
completed by recite Quebec which is the
 
02:32:37.330 --> 02:32:37.340 align:start position:0%
recycling Authority for Quebec Canada
 
02:32:40.130 --> 02:32:40.140 align:start position:0%
that compared the environmental impacts
 
02:32:42.170 --> 02:32:42.180 align:start position:0%
of various carryout bags and also looked
 
02:32:44.330 --> 02:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
at how plastic
 
02:32:47.270 --> 02:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
bags are reused at the home I'm happy to
 
02:32:51.710 --> 02:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:54.050 --> 02:32:54.060 align:start position:0%
representative yokella
 
02:32:56.570 --> 02:32:56.580 align:start position:0%
thank you uh kind of following up on
 
02:32:58.309 --> 02:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
representative priest's question so
 
02:33:01.250 --> 02:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
years it seems from your testimony that
 
02:33:03.050 --> 02:33:03.060 align:start position:0%
you are
 
02:33:03.060 --> 02:33:03.710 align:start position:0%
you are
um

02:33:03.710 --> 02:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:06.110 --> 02:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
in opposition to Statewide ban but
 
02:33:08.809 --> 02:33:08.819 align:start position:0%
definitely like even more opposed to a
 
02:33:08.819 --> 02:33:11.110 align:start position:0%
definitely like even more opposed to a
patchwork

02:33:11.110 --> 02:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
patchwork
 
02:33:13.910 --> 02:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
solution uh
 
02:33:17.510 --> 02:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
is so you're more opposed to this than a
 
02:33:19.610 --> 02:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
Statewide ban is that what I'm
 
02:33:21.650 --> 02:33:21.660 align:start position:0%
understanding from your testimony to be
 
02:33:23.389 --> 02:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
clear we are equally opposed to bans on
 
02:33:25.370 --> 02:33:25.380 align:start position:0%
plastic bags at state level local level
 
02:33:35.170 --> 02:33:35.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:39.469 --> 02:33:39.479 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman we could also kind
 
02:33:41.630 --> 02:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
of get close to wrapping this up yeah
 
02:33:43.969 --> 02:33:43.979 align:start position:0%
just a short question in these Studies
 
02:33:43.979 --> 02:33:45.170 align:start position:0%
just a short question in these Studies
have

02:33:45.170 --> 02:33:45.180 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:33:45.180 --> 02:33:45.830 align:start position:0%
have
um

02:33:45.830 --> 02:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:48.650 --> 02:33:48.660 align:start position:0%
the fact of the petroleum use in
 
02:33:51.889 --> 02:33:51.899 align:start position:0%
creating a plastic bag compared to the
 
02:33:54.170 --> 02:33:54.180 align:start position:0%
petroleum use of maybe delivering cotton
 
02:33:56.450 --> 02:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
bags or canvas bags
 
02:33:58.309 --> 02:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative for the
 
02:34:00.469 --> 02:34:00.479 align:start position:0%
question so so first I would note that
 
02:34:02.450 --> 02:34:02.460 align:start position:0%
plastic carryout bags are traditional
 
02:34:04.190 --> 02:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
film plastic bag that we're discussing
 
02:34:05.990 --> 02:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
today that's made from natural gas to
 
02:34:08.510 --> 02:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
byproduct of the refining process uh the
 
02:34:10.070 --> 02:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
reusable stitched handle bags that
 
02:34:11.389 --> 02:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
you'll see the grocery store for a
 
02:34:12.710 --> 02:34:12.720 align:start position:0%
dollar or two that are still made from
 
02:34:15.469 --> 02:34:15.479 align:start position:0%
plastic those are made from oil I'll
 
02:34:16.550 --> 02:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
also note as it relates to that
 
02:34:20.389 --> 02:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
emissions question uh the same number of
 
02:34:23.929 --> 02:34:23.939 align:start position:0%
paper bags requires seven trucks uh for
 
02:34:25.429 --> 02:34:25.439 align:start position:0%
the same number of plastic bags it
 
02:34:28.429 --> 02:34:28.439 align:start position:0%
requires one truck stitched handle bags
 
02:34:30.469 --> 02:34:30.479 align:start position:0%
while they're made of cotton canvas or
 
02:34:32.809 --> 02:34:32.819 align:start position:0%
plastic are imported from overseas
 
02:34:34.550 --> 02:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
they're not made here in the U.S
 
02:34:37.070 --> 02:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly so you can also kind of
 
02:34:39.950 --> 02:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
Envision how much more the emissions
 
02:34:42.530 --> 02:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
impact of all that shipping all that
 
02:34:44.870 --> 02:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
Transportation all that weight combines
 
02:34:47.809 --> 02:34:47.819 align:start position:0%
to create that sort of uh deficit that
 
02:34:50.510 --> 02:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be overcome by reuse and a life
 
02:34:51.950 --> 02:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
cycle assessment done by Clemson
 
02:34:53.750 --> 02:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
University looked at actual consumer
 
02:34:55.670 --> 02:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
behavior and found that most consumers
 
02:34:57.889 --> 02:34:57.899 align:start position:0%
are not using these products enough for
 
02:35:00.889 --> 02:35:00.899 align:start position:0%
them to be a more sustainable option
 
02:35:02.389 --> 02:35:02.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:35:04.490 --> 02:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
02:35:04.500 --> 02:35:05.630 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
Mr

02:35:05.630 --> 02:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
02:35:08.690 --> 02:35:08.700 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman representative priests just
 
02:35:12.349 --> 02:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
for the clarification and of the
 
02:35:16.070 --> 02:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
committee members I would like to see
 
02:35:20.150 --> 02:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
um a list of these studies before we
 
02:35:22.849 --> 02:35:22.859 align:start position:0%
move on from Mr Kelly I'm just
 
02:35:25.670 --> 02:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
interested to see the source and where
 
02:35:27.830 --> 02:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
they're coming from I would say if Mr
 
02:35:31.490 --> 02:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
what was the last name Kelly Taylor if
 
02:35:31.500 --> 02:35:32.809 align:start position:0%
what was the last name Kelly Taylor if
you

02:35:32.809 --> 02:35:32.819 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:35:36.170 --> 02:35:36.180 align:start position:0%
it yeah Mr Taylor if you are more if you
 
02:35:37.550 --> 02:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
would like to provide those you're more
 
02:35:38.510 --> 02:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
than welcome to provide those
 
02:35:40.010 --> 02:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
representative I will follow up with you
 
02:35:41.570 --> 02:35:41.580 align:start position:0%
with those studies as will I with you
 
02:35:43.550 --> 02:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
representative Davis as well so happy to
 
02:35:46.130 --> 02:35:46.140 align:start position:0%
share them I think they're enlightening
 
02:35:47.389 --> 02:35:47.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for your
 
02:35:47.399 --> 02:35:48.410 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for your
testimony

02:35:48.410 --> 02:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:35:50.389 --> 02:35:50.399 align:start position:0%
thank you all right uh last one last
 
02:35:56.929 --> 02:35:56.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:59.630 --> 02:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
02:36:01.070 --> 02:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
the committee uh for the record my name
 
02:36:03.349 --> 02:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
is Michael Nork with the solid waste
 
02:36:05.290 --> 02:36:05.300 align:start position:0%
management Bureau at New Hampshire Des
 
02:36:07.849 --> 02:36:07.859 align:start position:0%
uh we are not taking a position on this
 
02:36:09.889 --> 02:36:09.899 align:start position:0%
bill uh I'm here just to provide
 
02:36:12.290 --> 02:36:12.300 align:start position:0%
information to the committee
 
02:36:14.929 --> 02:36:14.939 align:start position:0%
um the question that seems to be most
 
02:36:17.270 --> 02:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
relevant to our area would be about RSA
 
02:36:19.490 --> 02:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
149m the solid waste management act and
 
02:36:23.750 --> 02:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
how this how this bill would interplay
 
02:36:26.150 --> 02:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
with the existing statute
 
02:36:27.650 --> 02:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
um so one thing I just want to make
 
02:36:31.870 --> 02:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
clear is that RSA 149 m17 already makes
 
02:36:34.849 --> 02:36:34.859 align:start position:0%
it authorizes municipalities the
 
02:36:37.550 --> 02:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
authority to create bylaws relative to
 
02:36:40.070 --> 02:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
management of their facilities their
 
02:36:41.570 --> 02:36:41.580 align:start position:0%
transfer stations their landfills
 
02:36:43.610 --> 02:36:43.620 align:start position:0%
whatever the town Solid Waste Management
 
02:36:45.950 --> 02:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
Facility might be so they already have
 
02:36:47.990 --> 02:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
that authority to make bylaws about you
 
02:36:49.790 --> 02:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
know management of the facility as well
 
02:36:52.370 --> 02:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
as separation of certain waste types or
 
02:36:53.690 --> 02:36:53.700 align:start position:0%
collection of waste types within the
 
02:36:56.809 --> 02:36:56.819 align:start position:0%
municipality so while we're not taking a
 
02:36:58.070 --> 02:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
position on this bill I just wanted to
 
02:36:59.809 --> 02:36:59.819 align:start position:0%
clarify that that there is existing
 
02:37:02.030 --> 02:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
statute that makes it pretty clear that
 
02:37:03.950 --> 02:37:03.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities have the authority
 
02:37:06.349 --> 02:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
relative to disposal and management of
 
02:37:08.510 --> 02:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
waste I think what's novel with this
 
02:37:10.670 --> 02:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
bill is that it also authorizes
 
02:37:12.950 --> 02:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities to regulate the
 
02:37:15.830 --> 02:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
distribution of these single-use items
 
02:37:17.929 --> 02:37:17.939 align:start position:0%
uh with that I'll I'll take any
 
02:37:19.550 --> 02:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any
 
02:37:21.590 --> 02:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
represent of you Ocala
 
02:37:23.389 --> 02:37:23.399 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
02:37:23.399 --> 02:37:24.530 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

02:37:24.530 --> 02:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:37:24.540 --> 02:37:27.050 align:start position:0%
question
um

02:37:27.050 --> 02:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:31.070 --> 02:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
are you so in your your statement you
 
02:37:33.530 --> 02:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
said that they are able to
 
02:37:35.929 --> 02:37:35.939 align:start position:0%
um create bylaws
 
02:37:39.650 --> 02:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
regulating waste um are they allowed in
 
02:37:41.630 --> 02:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
the example that I gave before allowed
 
02:37:46.550 --> 02:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
to uh restrict you from throwing away uh
 
02:37:50.290 --> 02:37:50.300 align:start position:0%
like ban uh throwing away some plastic
 
02:37:55.190 --> 02:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh bag or or some some other waste that
 
02:37:56.929 --> 02:37:56.939 align:start position:0%
is that you're
 
02:38:00.290 --> 02:38:00.300 align:start position:0%
um your home that is you know normally
 
02:38:02.990 --> 02:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
able not not hazardous or whatever like
 
02:38:06.230 --> 02:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
are they able to do that right now thank
 
02:38:08.750 --> 02:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
you for the question uh representative I
 
02:38:11.929 --> 02:38:11.939 align:start position:0%
I think what the statute RSA 149m
 
02:38:14.870 --> 02:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
authorizes is the municipality to create
 
02:38:17.630 --> 02:38:17.640 align:start position:0%
bylaws relative to use of their transfer
 
02:38:19.010 --> 02:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
station facility
 
02:38:22.550 --> 02:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
so if the transfer station and the the
 
02:38:23.690 --> 02:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
management of that transfer station
 
02:38:25.250 --> 02:38:25.260 align:start position:0%
decided that they didn't want to accept
 
02:38:29.150 --> 02:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
plastic bags in the trash disposal
 
02:38:31.790 --> 02:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
stream but they wanted to recycle them
 
02:38:34.910 --> 02:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
they could create bylaws around that for
 
02:38:36.469 --> 02:38:36.479 align:start position:0%
use of that facility I don't know if
 
02:38:37.730 --> 02:38:37.740 align:start position:0%
that answers your question but I think
 
02:38:39.770 --> 02:38:39.780 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not
 
02:38:42.170 --> 02:38:42.180 align:start position:0%
it's not so much about generally across
 
02:38:44.389 --> 02:38:44.399 align:start position:0%
the the community it's more about use of
 
02:38:45.590 --> 02:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
the facility
 
02:38:49.610 --> 02:38:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:51.410 --> 02:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
short Fallout
 
02:38:56.270 --> 02:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
thank you so yeah I'm you specified
 
02:38:59.929 --> 02:38:59.939 align:start position:0%
um facilities run by the municipality
 
02:39:02.570 --> 02:39:02.580 align:start position:0%
what about private
 
02:39:04.190 --> 02:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
um if a private
 
02:39:07.730 --> 02:39:07.740 align:start position:0%
um company wanted to accept plastic bags
 
02:39:09.770 --> 02:39:09.780 align:start position:0%
would the municipality be able to put a
 
02:39:11.929 --> 02:39:11.939 align:start position:0%
bylaw in that says you cannot accept
 
02:39:15.650 --> 02:39:15.660 align:start position:0%
plastic bags or a plastic product under
 
02:39:18.469 --> 02:39:18.479 align:start position:0%
the current rules but they might be able
 
02:39:20.870 --> 02:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
to with this
 
02:39:23.809 --> 02:39:23.819 align:start position:0%
um language because it's not it's not
 
02:39:27.770 --> 02:39:27.780 align:start position:0%
it's uh not specific to municipality run
 
02:39:31.190 --> 02:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
landfills or okay disposal options thank
 
02:39:33.469 --> 02:39:33.479 align:start position:0%
you for the clarification um so under
 
02:39:35.510 --> 02:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
the current statute it would be for
 
02:39:37.130 --> 02:39:37.140 align:start position:0%
municipally run facility so the
 
02:39:38.809 --> 02:39:38.819 align:start position:0%
municipality has authority over their
 
02:39:40.270 --> 02:39:40.280 align:start position:0%
own facility
 
02:39:44.510 --> 02:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
with HB 226 as I read it it says within
 
02:39:46.429 --> 02:39:46.439 align:start position:0%
their Municipal landfills and transfer
 
02:39:47.929 --> 02:39:47.939 align:start position:0%
stations so it would enable
 
02:39:49.490 --> 02:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
municipalities to do basically the same
 
02:39:50.750 --> 02:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
thing that they already have authority
 
02:39:51.889 --> 02:39:51.899 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:39:53.990 --> 02:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
it would not and just to further clarify
 
02:39:56.630 --> 02:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
it would not extend to uh privately
 
02:39:58.250 --> 02:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
owned facilities within the municipality
 
02:40:00.950 --> 02:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
under my reading but I'm not a lawyer so
 
02:40:03.590 --> 02:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
I can't say definitively
 
02:40:06.230 --> 02:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
representative Manchester
 
02:40:09.050 --> 02:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:40:13.990 --> 02:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
my question so RSA 149
 
02:40:18.050 --> 02:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
m-17 as it exists right now
 
02:40:22.429 --> 02:40:22.439 align:start position:0%
gives the municipalities the ability to
 
02:40:25.070 --> 02:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
manage the waste already that's been
 
02:40:28.730 --> 02:40:28.740 align:start position:0%
created would this uh
 
02:40:33.230 --> 02:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
so this um legislation this bill will
 
02:40:33.240 --> 02:40:34.550 align:start position:0%
so this um legislation this bill will
enable

02:40:34.550 --> 02:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
enable
 
02:40:38.750 --> 02:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
the municipality to channel the um
 
02:40:42.710 --> 02:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
create origin of these waste correct so
 
02:40:45.950 --> 02:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
managing at the source correct so this
 
02:40:48.050 --> 02:40:48.060 align:start position:0%
will be an enabling
 
02:40:51.170 --> 02:40:51.180 align:start position:0%
the municipalities to do so so the
 
02:40:54.530 --> 02:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
management becomes more streamlined
 
02:40:56.809 --> 02:40:56.819 align:start position:0%
correct thank you representation I think
 
02:40:58.270 --> 02:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
that's an important distinction that
 
02:41:00.590 --> 02:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
waste only becomes a waste when it's
 
02:41:02.750 --> 02:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
something that's discarded or no longer
 
02:41:05.450 --> 02:41:05.460 align:start position:0%
wanted whereas distribution of a product
 
02:41:07.969 --> 02:41:07.979 align:start position:0%
is kind of at the very beginning of the
 
02:41:10.070 --> 02:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
the life cycle so to speak or the
 
02:41:12.770 --> 02:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
consumer life cycle so yes that is
 
02:41:14.270 --> 02:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
correct that this legislation the the
 
02:41:17.270 --> 02:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
the novel part of it would be the the
 
02:41:19.910 --> 02:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
enabling municipalities to regulate the
 
02:41:21.349 --> 02:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
distribution of those products at the
 
02:41:23.570 --> 02:41:23.580 align:start position:0%
very beginning
 
02:41:25.910 --> 02:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
and and that is a source of that that is
 
02:41:27.830 --> 02:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
a type of what we would call Source
 
02:41:30.349 --> 02:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
reduction which is eliminating waste
 
02:41:34.309 --> 02:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:36.349 --> 02:41:36.359 align:start position:0%
seeing no more hands race thank you but
 
02:41:39.170 --> 02:41:39.180 align:start position:0%
uh very much for your testimony I don't
 
02:41:42.110 --> 02:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
have any more pink cards on the sign up
 
02:41:44.570 --> 02:41:44.580 align:start position:0%

taking no positions
 
02:41:55.010 --> 02:41:55.020 align:start position:0%
with that we will close the hearing on
 
02:41:59.870 --> 02:41:59.880 align:start position:0%

bill uh House Bill 236
 
03:33:29.630 --> 03:33:29.640 align:start position:0%
concerning subdivision regulation and

03:33:36.490 --> 03:33:36.500 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about the overall
 
03:33:39.349 --> 03:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
statutory scheme here we
 
03:33:41.870 --> 03:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
allow we uh
 
03:33:43.729 --> 03:33:43.739 align:start position:0%
we allow municipalities to regulate
 
03:33:43.739 --> 03:33:45.530 align:start position:0%
we allow municipalities to regulate
subdivisions

03:33:45.530 --> 03:33:45.540 align:start position:0%
subdivisions
 
03:33:47.330 --> 03:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:33:49.429 --> 03:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
it's a I would like to call it the
 
03:33:51.650 --> 03:33:51.660 align:start position:0%
Howitzer of a subdivision of land use
 
03:33:51.660 --> 03:33:52.910 align:start position:0%

regulations
 
03:33:54.830 --> 03:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
it's a fairly extensive
 
03:33:57.050 --> 03:33:57.060 align:start position:0%
set of powers that the municipalities
 
03:33:58.729 --> 03:33:58.739 align:start position:0%
have through the planning boards
 
03:33:58.739 --> 03:34:00.170 align:start position:0%
have through the planning boards
to

03:34:00.170 --> 03:34:00.180 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:34:03.710 --> 03:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
control the shape and and uh
 
03:34:05.570 --> 03:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
and in fact whether or not subdivisions
 
03:34:07.550 --> 03:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
are allowed to happen at all it's a
 
03:34:07.560 --> 03:34:08.750 align:start position:0%
are allowed to happen at all it's a
uh

03:34:08.750 --> 03:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:34:10.969 --> 03:34:10.979 align:start position:0%
is provided

um
the

03:34:20.210 --> 03:34:20.220 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:34:24.110 --> 03:34:24.120 align:start position:0%
planning boards can we'll look at lots
 
03:34:25.309 --> 03:34:25.319 align:start position:0%
of land to determine whether they meet
 
03:34:25.319 --> 03:34:26.450 align:start position:0%

03:34:28.790 --> 03:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
and whether they meet such criteria as
 
03:34:30.590 --> 03:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
whether the development is too scattered
 
03:34:32.929 --> 03:34:32.939 align:start position:0%
or premature
 
03:34:32.939 --> 03:34:34.490 align:start position:0%
or premature
um

03:34:34.490 --> 03:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:34:37.790 --> 03:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
similarly we provide for the Department

03:35:05.389 --> 03:35:05.399 align:start position:0%
these are very powerful tools now
 
03:35:08.030 --> 03:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
we regulate con Condominiums through our

03:35:11.819 --> 03:35:13.370 align:start position:0%
um
we

03:35:13.370 --> 03:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:35:15.469 --> 03:35:15.479 align:start position:0%
have created for municipal Municipal
 
03:35:17.870 --> 03:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
regulations we have stated that
 
03:35:20.510 --> 03:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
the conversion of a development that's
 
03:35:22.429 --> 03:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
otherwise legal to
 
03:35:24.830 --> 03:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
condominium and form of ownership is a
 
03:35:26.389 --> 03:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
non-event for land use regulation
 
03:35:28.429 --> 03:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
purposes you can't treat
 
03:35:31.190 --> 03:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
a condominium any differently from any
 
03:35:33.290 --> 03:35:33.300 align:start position:0%
other development based upon the form of
 
03:35:33.300 --> 03:35:35.290 align:start position:0%
other development based upon the form of
ownership

03:35:35.290 --> 03:35:35.300 align:start position:0%
ownership
 
03:35:37.370 --> 03:35:37.380 align:start position:0%
essentially if there's no change in land
 
03:35:39.950 --> 03:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
use a condominium conversion
 
03:35:42.889 --> 03:35:42.899 align:start position:0%
can't be denied it's not subject to any
 
03:35:45.290 --> 03:35:45.300 align:start position:0%
to the subdivision
 
03:35:47.690 --> 03:35:47.700 align:start position:0%
control but normally the sub the
 
03:35:50.750 --> 03:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
municipality has
 
03:35:54.769 --> 03:35:54.779 align:start position:0%
now the definition of subdivision in RSA
 
03:36:00.290 --> 03:36:00.300 align:start position:0%
674 for municipalities and RSA 482
 
03:36:00.300 --> 03:36:01.250 align:start position:0%
674 for municipalities and RSA 482
um

03:36:01.250 --> 03:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:04.729 --> 03:36:04.739 align:start position:0%
pay for for Wastewater well some septic
 
03:36:04.739 --> 03:36:05.570 align:start position:0%
pay for for Wastewater well some septic
control

03:36:05.570 --> 03:36:05.580 align:start position:0%
control
 
03:36:07.849 --> 03:36:07.859 align:start position:0%
is essentially the same a subdivision is
 
03:36:11.330 --> 03:36:11.340 align:start position:0%
is taking a existing parcel of land
 
03:36:14.750 --> 03:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
and dividing it into individual Lots or
 
03:36:17.030 --> 03:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
Parcels for the purpose of
 
03:36:19.670 --> 03:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
development lots are defined as building
 
03:36:19.680 --> 03:36:20.990 align:start position:0%
development lots are defined as building
parcels

03:36:20.990 --> 03:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
parcels
 
03:36:23.510 --> 03:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
if it's not a division of land it's not
 
03:36:25.870 --> 03:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
a subdivision
 
03:36:29.090 --> 03:36:29.100 align:start position:0%
the issue that this bill tries to
 
03:36:30.889 --> 03:36:30.899 align:start position:0%
represent is that
 
03:36:34.729 --> 03:36:34.739 align:start position:0%
Des has interpreted the definition of
 
03:36:37.370 --> 03:36:37.380 align:start position:0%
subdivision to include a condominium
 
03:36:39.349 --> 03:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
conversion when there is no change in
 
03:36:42.650 --> 03:36:42.660 align:start position:0%
land use there is no division of land
 
03:36:46.550 --> 03:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh it's just a change of ownership
 
03:36:46.560 --> 03:36:47.690 align:start position:0%
uh it's just a change of ownership
um

03:36:47.690 --> 03:36:47.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:49.190 --> 03:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
essentially says that a change of
 
03:36:51.590 --> 03:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
ownership doesn't change the septic
 
03:36:54.170 --> 03:36:54.180 align:start position:0%
disposal needs it doesn't change the use
 
03:36:55.250 --> 03:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
at all
 
03:36:55.260 --> 03:36:56.630 align:start position:0%
at all
and

03:36:56.630 --> 03:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:36:59.690 --> 03:36:59.700 align:start position:0%
should not be subject to denial based
 
03:36:59.700 --> 03:37:01.790 align:start position:0%
should not be subject to denial based
upon

03:37:01.790 --> 03:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
upon
 
03:37:05.150 --> 03:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
um the current standards
 
03:37:07.670 --> 03:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
that might be applied to a lot in
 
03:37:07.680 --> 03:37:08.570 align:start position:0%
that might be applied to a lot in
question

03:37:08.570 --> 03:37:08.580 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:37:12.190 --> 03:37:12.200 align:start position:0%
again the the standards of the the
 
03:37:14.870 --> 03:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
subsurface disposal standards are based
 
03:37:16.610 --> 03:37:16.620 align:start position:0%
upon Lots
 
03:37:19.670 --> 03:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
the capability of the land
 
03:37:22.610 --> 03:37:22.620 align:start position:0%
the condominium conversion you don't
 
03:37:25.130 --> 03:37:25.140 align:start position:0%
have any new Lots there is nothing
 
03:37:26.870 --> 03:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
there to analyze
 
03:37:28.849 --> 03:37:28.859 align:start position:0%
so it's it's
 
03:37:31.510 --> 03:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
the the denial of
 
03:37:33.530 --> 03:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
condominium conversions just because
 
03:37:35.870 --> 03:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
they're changing ownership is really
 
03:37:38.389 --> 03:37:38.399 align:start position:0%
outside of the statutory
 
03:37:41.510 --> 03:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
scheme that the legislature has
 
03:37:43.670 --> 03:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
established for regulation of
 
03:37:46.790 --> 03:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
Condominiums and subdivisions language
 
03:37:48.830 --> 03:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
here just tries to clarify that saying
 
03:37:50.929 --> 03:37:50.939 align:start position:0%
that if it's only a subdivision if it's
 
03:37:53.330 --> 03:37:53.340 align:start position:0%
only a conversion
 
03:37:55.130 --> 03:37:55.140 align:start position:0%
only a change of ownership and it
 
03:37:58.070 --> 03:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't involve creation of any new Lots
 
03:38:01.670 --> 03:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
then it's outside the
 
03:38:04.729 --> 03:38:04.739 align:start position:0%
subdivision control portion of the Des
 
03:38:04.739 --> 03:38:08.570 align:start position:0%
subdivision control portion of the Des
regulation

03:38:08.570 --> 03:38:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:10.729 --> 03:38:10.739 align:start position:0%
now what this bill does not do it does
 
03:38:12.309 --> 03:38:12.319 align:start position:0%
not change
 
03:38:14.990 --> 03:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities the municipalities
 
03:38:17.450 --> 03:38:17.460 align:start position:0%
ability to regulate subdivisions that
 
03:38:19.130 --> 03:38:19.140 align:start position:0%
actually create new lots that is
 
03:38:19.140 --> 03:38:20.330 align:start position:0%
actually create new lots that is
unchanged

03:38:20.330 --> 03:38:20.340 align:start position:0%
unchanged
 
03:38:22.790 --> 03:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh that's actually well controlled by
 
03:38:24.710 --> 03:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
existing law and by
 
03:38:27.349 --> 03:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
numerous court cases
 
03:38:30.410 --> 03:38:30.420 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't change Des ability to
 
03:38:33.110 --> 03:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
deal with actual subdivisions where New
 
03:38:35.030 --> 03:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
Lots are being created
 
03:38:37.309 --> 03:38:37.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't change their ability to deal
 
03:38:42.110 --> 03:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
with new septic system installations
 
03:38:44.389 --> 03:38:44.399 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change their ability to deal
 
03:38:44.399 --> 03:38:45.830 align:start position:0%
it doesn't change their ability to deal
with

03:38:45.830 --> 03:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:38:48.349 --> 03:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
increases in load such as by adding
 
03:38:51.110 --> 03:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
units or adding bedrooms Etc
 
03:38:53.450 --> 03:38:53.460 align:start position:0%
it doesn't uh
 
03:38:55.190 --> 03:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
change their ability to deal with
 
03:38:59.030 --> 03:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
replacement systems or with problems
 
03:39:01.910 --> 03:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
when a septic system fails and pollutes
 
03:39:04.670 --> 03:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
groundwater or nearby properties none of
 
03:39:08.450 --> 03:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
that changes it's only this
 
03:39:11.450 --> 03:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
ability to stop a condominium conversion
 
03:39:14.929 --> 03:39:14.939 align:start position:0%
that has no other impacts
 
03:39:14.939 --> 03:39:16.070 align:start position:0%
that has no other impacts
the

03:39:16.070 --> 03:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:39:16.080 --> 03:39:19.389 align:start position:0%
the
um

03:39:19.389 --> 03:39:19.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:22.070 --> 03:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
the statutory well
 
03:39:27.290 --> 03:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
Des interpretation of 482 B2
 
03:39:29.389 --> 03:39:29.399 align:start position:0%
really calls into question the this
 
03:39:31.910 --> 03:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
overall statutory scheme
 
03:39:34.130 --> 03:39:34.140 align:start position:0%
I think it's clear that we as a
 
03:39:35.450 --> 03:39:35.460 align:start position:0%
legislature are the ones who determine
 
03:39:37.849 --> 03:39:37.859 align:start position:0%
what the statutory scheme is we alone
 
03:39:40.250 --> 03:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
determine what the legislative intent is
 
03:39:40.260 --> 03:39:41.570 align:start position:0%
determine what the legislative intent is
if

03:39:41.570 --> 03:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:39:43.790 --> 03:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
if the administrative agencies are
 
03:39:45.530 --> 03:39:45.540 align:start position:0%
unclear on that then I think we need to
 
03:39:48.050 --> 03:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
change the statute to make it clear what
 
03:39:49.610 --> 03:39:49.620 align:start position:0%
the overall scheme is and that's what
 
03:39:52.130 --> 03:39:52.140 align:start position:0%
this bill does
 
03:39:54.950 --> 03:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
we've got to take questions
 
03:39:57.650 --> 03:39:57.660 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very testimony do I see
 
03:40:00.889 --> 03:40:00.899 align:start position:0%
any anybody have any questions of the
 
03:40:02.630 --> 03:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
state for the rep
 
03:40:05.269 --> 03:40:05.279 align:start position:0%
resentative stavis thank you Mr chair
 
03:40:07.849 --> 03:40:07.859 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question can
 
03:40:10.070 --> 03:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
you say a little bit about the the
 
03:40:13.670 --> 03:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
reasoning behind the last sentence in
 
03:40:16.370 --> 03:40:16.380 align:start position:0%
your change here which reads changes in
 
03:40:18.590 --> 03:40:18.600 align:start position:0%
the hours days or seasons of operation
 
03:40:21.410 --> 03:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
shall not be considered a change in land
 
03:40:23.690 --> 03:40:23.700 align:start position:0%
use I mean what what if the condominium
 
03:40:23.700 --> 03:40:24.830 align:start position:0%
use I mean what what if the condominium
is

03:40:24.830 --> 03:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:40:27.650 --> 03:40:27.660 align:start position:0%
converted for the purpose of multiple
 
03:40:30.110 --> 03:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals wouldn't that have an
 
03:40:32.269 --> 03:40:32.279 align:start position:0%
impact on load
 
03:40:35.809 --> 03:40:35.819 align:start position:0%
well if it does then Des can regulate so
 
03:40:37.910 --> 03:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
they can regulate any increase in load
 
03:40:39.050 --> 03:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
but it would just need to show that
 
03:40:41.150 --> 03:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
there's an increase in load that creates
 
03:40:44.870 --> 03:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
a need for a new or upgraded septic
 
03:40:46.370 --> 03:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
Disposal system
 
03:40:48.469 --> 03:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
so all it does is it takes that out of
 
03:40:50.570 --> 03:40:50.580 align:start position:0%
the subdivision
 
03:40:53.210 --> 03:40:53.220 align:start position:0%
portion of the regulation that leaves it
 
03:40:55.849 --> 03:40:55.859 align:start position:0%
in the you know the increased load so if
 
03:40:58.309 --> 03:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
you go from
 
03:41:01.250 --> 03:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
uh seasonal rentals to a longer period
 
03:41:07.250 --> 03:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:10.490 --> 03:41:10.500 align:start position:0%
uh in the septic load that would require
 
03:41:12.830 --> 03:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
a change in the septic system that
 
03:41:14.990 --> 03:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
treats it then that's still and So
 
03:41:18.410 --> 03:41:18.420 align:start position:0%
within DS's ability to regulate
 
03:41:20.090 --> 03:41:20.100 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chair
 
03:41:21.530 --> 03:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
all about
 
03:41:25.010 --> 03:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:27.530 --> 03:41:27.540 align:start position:0%
give me the means of regulations that
 
03:41:30.469 --> 03:41:30.479 align:start position:0%
regulation that Des has
 
03:41:33.590 --> 03:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
because once the conversion is made and
 
03:41:36.290 --> 03:41:36.300 align:start position:0%
once the property is now being used for
 
03:41:38.929 --> 03:41:38.939 align:start position:0%
a different use other than housing one
 
03:41:40.849 --> 03:41:40.859 align:start position:0%
family or two families
 
03:41:43.429 --> 03:41:43.439 align:start position:0%
the horses out of the barn so what is
 
03:41:46.790 --> 03:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
the power that Des has in that situation
 
03:41:50.389 --> 03:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
so if if it's a if it's simply a
 
03:41:52.250 --> 03:41:52.260 align:start position:0%
condominium conversion it's not a change
 
03:41:55.429 --> 03:41:55.439 align:start position:0%
in Loose Change in use by our own
 
03:41:58.070 --> 03:41:58.080 align:start position:0%

that's in RSA 674 I mean I'm sorry RC
 
03:42:06.660 --> 03:42:08.210 align:start position:0%
that's in RSA 674 I mean I'm sorry RC

03:42:24.410 --> 03:42:24.420 align:start position:0%
and again the the increase in load if
 
03:42:26.690 --> 03:42:26.700 align:start position:0%
you go from two units to six dwelling
 
03:42:26.700 --> 03:42:28.429 align:start position:0%
you go from two units to six dwelling
units

03:42:28.429 --> 03:42:28.439 align:start position:0%
units
 
03:42:30.950 --> 03:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
that's going to require a a permit
 
03:42:33.410 --> 03:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
through the uh through Des right now
 
03:42:35.690 --> 03:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
whether it's a condominium conversion or
 
03:42:35.700 --> 03:42:41.950 align:start position:0%
whether it's a condominium conversion or
not

03:42:41.950 --> 03:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:47.150 --> 03:42:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:48.889 --> 03:42:48.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:42:50.809 --> 03:42:50.819 align:start position:0%
taking my question so my question
 
03:42:53.870 --> 03:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
pertains to section two and you may have
 
03:42:57.410 --> 03:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
answered this in your bill introduction
 
03:43:02.050 --> 03:43:02.060 align:start position:0%
um line seven on page two my question is
 
03:43:06.889 --> 03:43:06.899 align:start position:0%
why is land use and site plan struck
 
03:43:09.830 --> 03:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
in light of the
 
03:43:33.229 --> 03:43:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:33.239 --> 03:43:35.030 align:start position:0%
 
well

03:43:35.030 --> 03:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:43:37.729 --> 03:43:37.739 align:start position:0%
the land use plans are
 
03:43:40.670 --> 03:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
the site plan regulations are subject
 
03:43:42.830 --> 03:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
the same subset of zoning regulations on
 
03:43:44.750 --> 03:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
the ridge you have to have zoning in
 
03:43:46.550 --> 03:43:46.560 align:start position:0%
place before you can
 
03:43:49.070 --> 03:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
have site plan regulations so
 
03:43:54.469 --> 03:43:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:54.479 --> 03:44:02.570 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:44:02.570 --> 03:44:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:05.630 --> 03:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
and you know if there's
 
03:44:07.490 --> 03:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
if there's a change in use in other
 
03:44:10.070 --> 03:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
words if you um
 
03:44:13.130 --> 03:44:13.140 align:start position:0%
or an increase in use of a property
 
03:44:17.750 --> 03:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:19.790 --> 03:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
site plan reviews in other words if you
 
03:44:22.070 --> 03:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
have a 10 unit apartment building and
 
03:44:23.450 --> 03:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
you're going to
 
03:44:25.250 --> 03:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
20 units
 
03:44:28.190 --> 03:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
that is going to require
 
03:44:30.590 --> 03:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
a site plan review irrespective of the
 
03:44:32.870 --> 03:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
of the subdivision regulations or
 
03:44:34.670 --> 03:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
subdivision laws or subdivision
 
03:44:34.680 --> 03:44:36.710 align:start position:0%
subdivision laws or subdivision
ordinances

03:44:36.710 --> 03:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
ordinances
 
03:44:36.720 --> 03:44:38.389 align:start position:0%
ordinances
um

03:44:38.389 --> 03:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:42.229 --> 03:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:46.130 --> 03:44:46.140 align:start position:0%
the requirement for a site plan is not
 
03:44:46.140 --> 03:44:47.510 align:start position:0%
the requirement for a site plan is not
um

03:44:47.510 --> 03:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:50.150 --> 03:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't trigger subdivision review I
 
03:44:51.769 --> 03:44:51.779 align:start position:0%
guess is the way to say it that there
 
03:44:52.969 --> 03:44:52.979 align:start position:0%
may be
 
03:44:55.610 --> 03:44:55.620 align:start position:0%
site plan review that is not a
 
03:45:00.769 --> 03:45:00.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:02.469 --> 03:45:02.479 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
03:45:04.910 --> 03:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
representative Brown
 
03:45:07.910 --> 03:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I guess along that
 
03:45:11.210 --> 03:45:11.220 align:start position:0%
same line of questioning that
 
03:45:12.650 --> 03:45:12.660 align:start position:0%
representative power and representatives
 
03:45:14.809 --> 03:45:14.819 align:start position:0%
Davis had
 
03:45:17.150 --> 03:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
I'm a little bit confused as far as what
 
03:45:19.969 --> 03:45:19.979 align:start position:0%
type of reviews are required
 
03:45:23.929 --> 03:45:23.939 align:start position:0%
to get this conversion permit or process
 
03:45:23.939 --> 03:45:25.010 align:start position:0%
to get this conversion permit or process
going

03:45:25.010 --> 03:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
going
 
03:45:30.170 --> 03:45:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:33.309 --> 03:45:33.319 align:start position:0%
so right now if if it's a large enough
 
03:45:36.229 --> 03:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
unit the Attorney General's Community
 
03:45:38.870 --> 03:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
Consumer Protection Bureau
 
03:45:42.670 --> 03:45:42.680 align:start position:0%
is involved in the
 
03:45:45.290 --> 03:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
interregulating registering larger
 
03:45:48.469 --> 03:45:48.479 align:start position:0%
Condominiums over over 10 units
 
03:45:50.990 --> 03:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh that is more of sort of consumer
 
03:45:52.190 --> 03:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
protection of people have the
 
03:45:54.830 --> 03:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
information they need to
 
03:45:54.840 --> 03:45:55.849 align:start position:0%
information they need to
to

03:45:55.849 --> 03:45:55.859 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:45:59.090 --> 03:45:59.100 align:start position:0%
um to make an informed purchase
 
03:46:01.790 --> 03:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh our existing tenants in an apartment
 
03:46:03.830 --> 03:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
building for example being being
 
03:46:03.840 --> 03:46:05.990 align:start position:0%
building for example being being
protected

03:46:05.990 --> 03:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
protected
 
03:46:10.190 --> 03:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
so if it's if it's an existing non
 
03:46:13.490 --> 03:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
either legal or non-conforming
 
03:46:13.500 --> 03:46:15.229 align:start position:0%
either legal or non-conforming
use

03:46:15.229 --> 03:46:15.239 align:start position:0%
use
 
03:46:15.239 --> 03:46:16.610 align:start position:0%
use
then

03:46:16.610 --> 03:46:16.620 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:46:16.620 --> 03:46:18.170 align:start position:0%
then
um

03:46:18.170 --> 03:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:20.450 --> 03:46:20.460 align:start position:0%
and that's only a condominium conversion
 
03:46:24.170 --> 03:46:24.180 align:start position:0%
we permit municipalities to
 
03:46:26.990 --> 03:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
require or to have a procedure for a
 
03:46:27.000 --> 03:46:27.769 align:start position:0%
require or to have a procedure for a
special

03:46:27.769 --> 03:46:27.779 align:start position:0%
special
 
03:46:27.779 --> 03:46:31.370 align:start position:0%
special
exception

03:46:31.370 --> 03:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:33.830 --> 03:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
basically to determine if that if those
 
03:46:35.570 --> 03:46:35.580 align:start position:0%
circumstances apply
 
03:46:38.389 --> 03:46:38.399 align:start position:0%
if there is no other change if there is
 
03:46:39.710 --> 03:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
no change in land use if there's nothing
 
03:46:41.290 --> 03:46:41.300 align:start position:0%
other than just the conversion to
 
03:46:44.510 --> 03:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
condominium ownership then it can't be
 
03:46:47.150 --> 03:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
denied but there there is a process for
 
03:46:49.490 --> 03:46:49.500 align:start position:0%
review under the special exception
 
03:46:49.500 --> 03:46:54.590 align:start position:0%
review under the special exception
process

03:46:54.590 --> 03:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:58.849 --> 03:46:58.859 align:start position:0%
so you mentioned that uh that the it's
 
03:47:02.330 --> 03:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
not size restricted basically now by the
 
03:47:03.950 --> 03:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
fact that you said you were referring to
 
03:47:06.410 --> 03:47:06.420 align:start position:0%
over 10 units and then you were also
 
03:47:08.510 --> 03:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
saying that there's a special use permit
 
03:47:10.729 --> 03:47:10.739 align:start position:0%
based on this now that allows the
 
03:47:10.739 --> 03:47:11.889 align:start position:0%
based on this now that allows the
conversion

03:47:11.889 --> 03:47:11.899 align:start position:0%
conversion
 
03:47:16.070 --> 03:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
if the municipality so provides in their
 
03:47:16.080 --> 03:47:17.570 align:start position:0%
if the municipality so provides in their
ordinances

03:47:17.570 --> 03:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
ordinances
 
03:47:19.969 --> 03:47:19.979 align:start position:0%
they can require a condominium
 
03:47:19.979 --> 03:47:21.650 align:start position:0%
they can require a condominium
conversion

03:47:21.650 --> 03:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
conversion
 
03:47:24.710 --> 03:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
to undergo a special exception review
 
03:47:24.720 --> 03:47:26.690 align:start position:0%
to undergo a special exception review
process

03:47:26.690 --> 03:47:26.700 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:47:29.389 --> 03:47:29.399 align:start position:0%
so but because of the other
 
03:47:34.070 --> 03:47:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh because 356 B
 
03:47:37.429 --> 03:47:37.439 align:start position:0%
uh we they cannot
 
03:47:39.469 --> 03:47:39.479 align:start position:0%
treat that Pro that project any
 
03:47:41.210 --> 03:47:41.220 align:start position:0%
differently because it's a condominium
 
03:47:43.070 --> 03:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
conversion so he
 
03:47:44.750 --> 03:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
in other words they can't deny it just
 
03:47:46.130 --> 03:47:46.140 align:start position:0%
because it's
 
03:47:48.229 --> 03:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
you're selling it to you know on a
 
03:47:49.969 --> 03:47:49.979 align:start position:0%
condominium basis
 
03:47:49.979 --> 03:47:51.530 align:start position:0%
condominium basis
uh

03:47:51.530 --> 03:47:51.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:47:53.870 --> 03:47:53.880 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't comply with the other
 
03:47:55.429 --> 03:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
you know if it does something if it does
 
03:47:57.830 --> 03:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
add units for example or if it does add
 
03:47:57.840 --> 03:47:59.090 align:start position:0%
add units for example or if it does add
um

03:47:59.090 --> 03:47:59.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:02.389 --> 03:48:02.399 align:start position:0%
creates a you know subdivision by
 
03:48:04.849 --> 03:48:04.859 align:start position:0%
dividing off a portion of the property
 
03:48:06.950 --> 03:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
then of course it would still be subject
 
03:48:09.290 --> 03:48:09.300 align:start position:0%
to the existing subdivision or
 
03:48:13.550 --> 03:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:13.560 --> 03:48:16.250 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:48:16.250 --> 03:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:48:18.170 --> 03:48:18.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair sorry we've got a
 
03:48:20.269 --> 03:48:20.279 align:start position:0%
planning board member here
 
03:48:23.150 --> 03:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
geeking out on this I I was on planning
 
03:48:25.610 --> 03:48:25.620 align:start position:0%
board for 20 years and I've represented
 
03:48:28.190 --> 03:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
planning boards and and
 
03:48:38.809 --> 03:48:38.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:48.290 --> 03:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:51.309 --> 03:48:51.319 align:start position:0%
well no they can well
 
03:48:54.110 --> 03:48:54.120 align:start position:0%
subdivisions as the legislature has
 
03:48:55.729 --> 03:48:55.739 align:start position:0%
envisioned them
 
03:48:57.530 --> 03:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
in other words subdivisions of land into
 
03:48:59.389 --> 03:48:59.399 align:start position:0%
different parcels
 
03:49:01.550 --> 03:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
would still be regulated
 
03:49:04.790 --> 03:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
under local subdivision ordinances the
 
03:49:06.050 --> 03:49:06.060 align:start position:0%
same as they are now this doesn't affect
 
03:49:07.790 --> 03:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
that at all
 
03:49:10.490 --> 03:49:10.500 align:start position:0%
and actually I think right now if the
 
03:49:15.410 --> 03:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:17.450 --> 03:49:17.460 align:start position:0%
as a subdivision something that's simply
 
03:49:19.849 --> 03:49:19.859 align:start position:0%
a condominium conversion that would not
 
03:49:21.710 --> 03:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
would not pass muscles to the courts
 
03:49:23.330 --> 03:49:23.340 align:start position:0%
because that's been
 
03:49:25.550 --> 03:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
prohibited by the legislature through
 
03:49:29.630 --> 03:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:31.490 --> 03:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
03:49:31.500 --> 03:49:32.389 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
um

03:49:32.389 --> 03:49:32.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:34.849 --> 03:49:34.859 align:start position:0%
what is the
 
03:49:37.490 --> 03:49:37.500 align:start position:0%
change to the legislation seeks to solve
 
03:49:40.370 --> 03:49:40.380 align:start position:0%
so the problem is that Des can in fact
 
03:49:42.530 --> 03:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
in some circumstances must
 
03:49:42.540 --> 03:49:44.210 align:start position:0%
in some circumstances must
deny

03:49:44.210 --> 03:49:44.220 align:start position:0%
deny
 
03:49:46.429 --> 03:49:46.439 align:start position:0%
under the under their
 
03:49:48.469 --> 03:49:48.479 align:start position:0%
regulations and their interpretation of
 
03:49:51.769 --> 03:49:51.779 align:start position:0%
this law they they can and must deny a
 
03:49:53.510 --> 03:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
condominium conversion when there is no
 
03:49:56.150 --> 03:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
change in the land use it's only a a
 
03:49:58.370 --> 03:49:58.380 align:start position:0%
economy of encouragement they considered
 
03:50:00.590 --> 03:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
any condominium conversion
 
03:50:02.990 --> 03:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
to be a subdivision
 
03:50:05.990 --> 03:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
if it's a subdivision they do not permit
 
03:50:09.370 --> 03:50:09.380 align:start position:0%
it if it's if it does not conform to
 
03:50:12.530 --> 03:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
current standards for lot loading for
 
03:50:16.010 --> 03:50:16.020 align:start position:0%
septic again this only applies
 
03:50:17.809 --> 03:50:17.819 align:start position:0%
for lots that aren't on in the municipal
 
03:50:19.849 --> 03:50:19.859 align:start position:0%
sewer system
 
03:50:19.859 --> 03:50:21.250 align:start position:0%
sewer system
so

03:50:21.250 --> 03:50:21.260 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:50:23.630 --> 03:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
you know there are standards saying that
 
03:50:25.370 --> 03:50:25.380 align:start position:0%
if you have this many units you have to
 
03:50:27.769 --> 03:50:27.779 align:start position:0%
have this amount of land depending on
 
03:50:29.630 --> 03:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
what the percolation tests are the
 
03:50:32.690 --> 03:50:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:32.700 --> 03:50:33.229 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:50:33.229 --> 03:50:33.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:37.309 --> 03:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
in in similar factors and if it doesn't
 
03:50:40.370 --> 03:50:40.380 align:start position:0%
meet those standards they denied and
 
03:50:42.290 --> 03:50:42.300 align:start position:0%
then the purpose of that is to prevent
 
03:50:44.870 --> 03:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
New Lots from being created that can't
 
03:50:47.090 --> 03:50:47.100 align:start position:0%
meet the new standards so they get to
 
03:50:49.849 --> 03:50:49.859 align:start position:0%
stop this in advance during the planning
 
03:50:51.650 --> 03:50:51.660 align:start position:0%
stage before these things before these
 
03:50:54.710 --> 03:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
lots are created
 
03:50:58.190 --> 03:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
and I'm not you know that doesn't change
 
03:50:59.929 --> 03:50:59.939 align:start position:0%
that's a good thing you don't want to
 
03:51:02.750 --> 03:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
have people not be able to develop their
 
03:51:02.760 --> 03:51:04.130 align:start position:0%
have people not be able to develop their
Lots

03:51:04.130 --> 03:51:04.140 align:start position:0%
Lots
 
03:51:05.750 --> 03:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
you only want to stop it before it
 
03:51:05.760 --> 03:51:06.830 align:start position:0%
you only want to stop it before it
happens

03:51:06.830 --> 03:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
happens
 
03:51:09.590 --> 03:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
same on the municipal side
 
03:51:11.750 --> 03:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
this doesn't change that if there is an
 
03:51:13.790 --> 03:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
actual division of land into New Lots
 
03:51:15.950 --> 03:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
then it's still covered by Des
 
03:51:19.370 --> 03:51:19.380 align:start position:0%
subdivision regulations it's this only
 
03:51:21.830 --> 03:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
says that in this circumstance where the
 
03:51:23.330 --> 03:51:23.340 align:start position:0%
only change is change in the ownership
 
03:51:26.450 --> 03:51:26.460 align:start position:0%
then it's not a land use event that is
 
03:51:28.729 --> 03:51:28.739 align:start position:0%
subject to the Des subdivision
 
03:51:28.739 --> 03:51:32.030 align:start position:0%
subject to the Des subdivision
regulations

03:51:32.030 --> 03:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:35.990 --> 03:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
if they deny if they deny the um the
 
03:51:36.000 --> 03:51:37.610 align:start position:0%
if they deny if they deny the um the
conversion

03:51:37.610 --> 03:51:37.620 align:start position:0%
conversion
 
03:51:40.010 --> 03:51:40.020 align:start position:0%
nothing good happens for the public you
 
03:51:42.110 --> 03:51:42.120 align:start position:0%
know the existing building continues on
 
03:51:44.929 --> 03:51:44.939 align:start position:0%
it continues on in a different ownership
 
03:51:46.550 --> 03:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
so whatever the septic system is
 
03:51:48.650 --> 03:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
whatever the septic load is can continue
 
03:51:51.349 --> 03:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
on until it fails or needs replacement
 
03:51:51.359 --> 03:51:52.849 align:start position:0%
on until it fails or needs replacement
so

03:51:52.849 --> 03:51:52.859 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:51:56.929 --> 03:51:56.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:59.929 --> 03:51:59.939 align:start position:0%
doesn't improve doesn't
 
03:52:01.969 --> 03:52:01.979 align:start position:0%
preserve Environmental Quality or health
 
03:52:03.469 --> 03:52:03.479 align:start position:0%
it just
 
03:52:05.870 --> 03:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
penalizes the owner who now can't sell
 
03:52:10.969 --> 03:52:10.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:13.250 --> 03:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you
 
03:52:16.729 --> 03:52:16.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:18.650 --> 03:52:18.660 align:start position:0%
I think we're going to call Philip
 
03:52:44.990 --> 03:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:50.590 --> 03:52:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:53.809 --> 03:52:53.819 align:start position:0%
so chairman turcott and members of the
 
03:52:55.309 --> 03:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
03:52:58.010 --> 03:52:58.020 align:start position:0%
Philip Trowbridge I'm the manager of the
 
03:52:59.630 --> 03:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
land resource programs at New Hampshire
 
03:52:59.640 --> 03:53:00.550 align:start position:0%
land resource programs at New Hampshire
Des

03:53:00.550 --> 03:53:00.560 align:start position:0%
Des
 
03:53:04.070 --> 03:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
those programs include the sub
 
03:53:06.229 --> 03:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
subsurface systems Bureau which is
 
03:53:08.330 --> 03:53:08.340 align:start position:0%
regulates septic systems and subdivision
 
03:53:11.030 --> 03:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:13.570 --> 03:53:13.580 align:start position:0%
um so the department opposes this bill
 
03:53:16.190 --> 03:53:16.200 align:start position:0%
because it would remove protections for
 
03:53:18.590 --> 03:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
buyers of Condominiums and will lead
 
03:53:20.630 --> 03:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
which could lead to some of these owners
 
03:53:22.910 --> 03:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
losing value of their property
 
03:53:25.070 --> 03:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
and it also perpetuates pollution of
 
03:53:27.110 --> 03:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
lakes and rivers from very old septic
 
03:53:28.910 --> 03:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
systems that would otherwise be
 
03:53:30.469 --> 03:53:30.479 align:start position:0%
modernized as part of the subdivision
 
03:53:30.479 --> 03:53:32.030 align:start position:0%
modernized as part of the subdivision
process

03:53:32.030 --> 03:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:53:34.429 --> 03:53:34.439 align:start position:0%
I think what I want to do is start by
 
03:53:37.250 --> 03:53:37.260 align:start position:0%
addressing some of the introduction that
 
03:53:39.610 --> 03:53:39.620 align:start position:0%
representative Faulkner gave regarding
 
03:53:41.809 --> 03:53:41.819 align:start position:0%
the Department's authorities regarding
 
03:53:44.750 --> 03:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
subdivision and also how we handle that
 
03:53:44.760 --> 03:53:46.429 align:start position:0%
subdivision and also how we handle that
situation

03:53:46.429 --> 03:53:46.439 align:start position:0%
situation
 
03:53:48.830 --> 03:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
um the statute as it's currently written
 
03:53:50.090 --> 03:53:50.100 align:start position:0%
specifically gives the department
 
03:53:53.030 --> 03:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
authority to regulate condominium
 
03:53:55.729 --> 03:53:55.739 align:start position:0%
conveyances of property and this is one
 
03:53:57.769 --> 03:53:57.779 align:start position:0%
of the concerns we had of this bill is
 
03:53:59.929 --> 03:53:59.939 align:start position:0%
it sets up a separate issue which is
 
03:54:02.450 --> 03:54:02.460 align:start position:0%
condominium conversion which in our
 
03:54:02.460 --> 03:54:03.590 align:start position:0%
condominium conversion which in our
opinion

03:54:03.590 --> 03:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
03:54:06.729 --> 03:54:06.739 align:start position:0%
is the same thing and so you would have
 
03:54:09.410 --> 03:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
two two different definitions of the
 
03:54:11.990 --> 03:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
same thing one of which requires
 
03:54:13.729 --> 03:54:13.739 align:start position:0%
subdivision regulation and one of which
 
03:54:13.739 --> 03:54:15.170 align:start position:0%
subdivision regulation and one of which
doesn't

03:54:15.170 --> 03:54:15.180 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
03:54:17.690 --> 03:54:17.700 align:start position:0%
so I think that the question of does the
 
03:54:19.010 --> 03:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
department it's not really an
 
03:54:20.690 --> 03:54:20.700 align:start position:0%
interpretation that the department is
 
03:54:20.700 --> 03:54:21.469 align:start position:0%
interpretation that the department is
making

03:54:21.469 --> 03:54:21.479 align:start position:0%
making
 
03:54:23.870 --> 03:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
to regulate condominium conversions it's
 
03:54:26.389 --> 03:54:26.399 align:start position:0%
what we see is clearly written in the
 
03:54:27.950 --> 03:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
statute is our authority to regulate
 
03:54:31.090 --> 03:54:31.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:33.590 --> 03:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
the background on the whole reason why
 
03:54:35.150 --> 03:54:35.160 align:start position:0%
the Department's involved with this I
 
03:54:36.530 --> 03:54:36.540 align:start position:0%
think representative Faulkner did a good
 
03:54:39.670 --> 03:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
an excellent job of introducing that
 
03:54:42.110 --> 03:54:42.120 align:start position:0%
these regulations require an assessment
 
03:54:43.790 --> 03:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
of the properties to be created to
 
03:54:45.769 --> 03:54:45.779 align:start position:0%
ensure that each new property
 
03:54:47.630 --> 03:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
can have a septic system that can
 
03:54:49.130 --> 03:54:49.140 align:start position:0%
adequately treat the waste that is
 
03:54:49.140 --> 03:54:50.330 align:start position:0%
adequately treat the waste that is
generated

03:54:50.330 --> 03:54:50.340 align:start position:0%
generated
 
03:54:52.610 --> 03:54:52.620 align:start position:0%
the reason for this is to protect the
 
03:54:54.349 --> 03:54:54.359 align:start position:0%
buyers so they know what they're buying
 
03:54:56.510 --> 03:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
and also to maintain water quality in
 
03:54:58.490 --> 03:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
our lakes and rivers
 
03:55:00.849 --> 03:55:00.859 align:start position:0%
I think the best way to explain why
 
03:55:02.870 --> 03:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
condominium conveyances is something
 
03:55:05.450 --> 03:55:05.460 align:start position:0%
that we need to look at is an example
 
03:55:07.849 --> 03:55:07.859 align:start position:0%
so what's something we often deal with
 
03:55:10.790 --> 03:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
is a lakefront property that was an Old
 
03:55:10.800 --> 03:55:12.110 align:start position:0%
is a lakefront property that was an Old
Camp

03:55:12.110 --> 03:55:12.120 align:start position:0%
Camp
 
03:55:14.809 --> 03:55:14.819 align:start position:0%
like a campground might have multiple
 
03:55:17.889 --> 03:55:17.899 align:start position:0%
houses on it multiple cabins
 
03:55:21.410 --> 03:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
on the shores of a lake
 
03:55:23.389 --> 03:55:23.399 align:start position:0%
um it's got a single owner's owner now
 
03:55:25.790 --> 03:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
it was developed a hundred years ago
 
03:55:27.290 --> 03:55:27.300 align:start position:0%
before there were septic system
 
03:55:30.170 --> 03:55:30.180 align:start position:0%
regulations or or subdivision
 
03:55:30.180 --> 03:55:32.210 align:start position:0%
regulations or or subdivision
regulations

03:55:32.210 --> 03:55:32.220 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
03:55:36.290 --> 03:55:36.300 align:start position:0%
um the the question is what to do in the
 
03:55:38.389 --> 03:55:38.399 align:start position:0%
septic systems in that property need to
 
03:55:39.710 --> 03:55:39.720 align:start position:0%
be upgraded
 
03:55:41.870 --> 03:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
these are normally substandard Lots
 
03:55:43.250 --> 03:55:43.260 align:start position:0%
meaning they're too small for the number
 
03:55:45.710 --> 03:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
of properties that are on them and the
 
03:55:46.969 --> 03:55:46.979 align:start position:0%
subject systems that are in the ground
 
03:55:48.889 --> 03:55:48.899 align:start position:0%
were put in before regulations existed
 
03:55:50.769 --> 03:55:50.779 align:start position:0%
so they're normally quite a bit smaller
 
03:55:54.650 --> 03:55:54.660 align:start position:0%
and most likely not very effective
 
03:55:57.650 --> 03:55:57.660 align:start position:0%
so when one of those subject systems
 
03:55:59.210 --> 03:55:59.220 align:start position:0%
goes into failure it needs to be
 
03:56:01.250 --> 03:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
replaced by a new modern system at
 
03:56:02.929 --> 03:56:02.939 align:start position:0%
meeting modern standards which is quite
 
03:56:04.150 --> 03:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
a bit bigger
 
03:56:08.210 --> 03:56:08.220 align:start position:0%
if these you know cabins or structures
 
03:56:09.769 --> 03:56:09.779 align:start position:0%
are close together
 
03:56:13.189 --> 03:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
there may not be the space to do that
 
03:56:15.410 --> 03:56:15.420 align:start position:0%
without interfering with one of the
 
03:56:16.910 --> 03:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
other cabins
 
03:56:19.030 --> 03:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
so if it if there's a single ownership
 
03:56:22.790 --> 03:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
of the property that owner could make
 
03:56:25.130 --> 03:56:25.140 align:start position:0%
decisions about moving a cabin or
 
03:56:28.309 --> 03:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
replacing a cabin or removing a cabin
 
03:56:30.349 --> 03:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
if those con if those cabins are all
 
03:56:32.030 --> 03:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
commit condom minimized and owned by
 
03:56:34.070 --> 03:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
separate people
 
03:56:35.990 --> 03:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
then you could end up with a situation
 
03:56:38.809 --> 03:56:38.819 align:start position:0%
where the septic system for cabin a goes
 
03:56:41.210 --> 03:56:41.220 align:start position:0%
into failure they need the space that's
 
03:56:43.670 --> 03:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
occupied by cabin B to put in a septic
 
03:56:46.130 --> 03:56:46.140 align:start position:0%
system cabin B is owned by somebody else
 
03:56:48.050 --> 03:56:48.060 align:start position:0%
who may or may not be willing to give
 
03:56:49.370 --> 03:56:49.380 align:start position:0%
them that space
 
03:56:52.370 --> 03:56:52.380 align:start position:0%
and so cabinet the owner of cabin a
 
03:56:53.809 --> 03:56:53.819 align:start position:0%
essentially has a property that they
 
03:56:56.150 --> 03:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
can't occupy because you can't occupy a
 
03:56:58.790 --> 03:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
house that doesn't have adequate means
 
03:57:01.309 --> 03:57:01.319 align:start position:0%
to treat the sewage and waste
 
03:57:03.050 --> 03:57:03.060 align:start position:0%
so that's why we think it's important
 
03:57:04.370 --> 03:57:04.380 align:start position:0%
for protecting the buyers of these
 
03:57:05.570 --> 03:57:05.580 align:start position:0%
condominiums that know what they're
 
03:57:07.490 --> 03:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
getting when they buy it that they're
 
03:57:09.429 --> 03:57:09.439 align:start position:0%
getting a property that
 
03:57:12.349 --> 03:57:12.359 align:start position:0%
has the capability to treat the sewage
 
03:57:16.309 --> 03:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
and waste if it has to be replaced
 
03:57:18.650 --> 03:57:18.660 align:start position:0%
uh some people have asked me well is
 
03:57:20.269 --> 03:57:20.279 align:start position:0%
this really just an old property thing
 
03:57:22.630 --> 03:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
you know should what about a modern
 
03:57:24.830 --> 03:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
multi-family house that that's purchased
 
03:57:27.290 --> 03:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
or built now and it's got a septic
 
03:57:29.570 --> 03:57:29.580 align:start position:0%
system that was installed according to
 
03:57:31.849 --> 03:57:31.859 align:start position:0%
state regulations and
 
03:57:33.710 --> 03:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
um it meets meets lot loading
 
03:57:33.720 --> 03:57:35.210 align:start position:0%
um it meets meets lot loading
requirements

03:57:35.210 --> 03:57:35.220 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
03:57:38.809 --> 03:57:38.819 align:start position:0%
uh in those cases we still think
 
03:57:40.670 --> 03:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
um it's a good idea for us to have the
 
03:57:43.910 --> 03:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
subdivision regulations the lot loading
 
03:57:45.769 --> 03:57:45.779 align:start position:0%
calculations are pro forma it's very
 
03:57:47.689 --> 03:57:47.699 align:start position:0%
easy because obviously it's met the
 
03:57:50.150 --> 03:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
current standards but one aspect of our
 
03:57:53.330 --> 03:57:53.340 align:start position:0%
regulations is that it requires
 
03:57:54.889 --> 03:57:54.899 align:start position:0%
that the responsibility for the
 
03:57:56.809 --> 03:57:56.819 align:start position:0%
maintenance operation and replacement of
 
03:57:59.210 --> 03:57:59.220 align:start position:0%
the septic system be clearly established
 
03:58:02.870 --> 03:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
in the condominium agreement
 
03:58:06.290 --> 03:58:06.300 align:start position:0%
it's very much common sense and we would
 
03:58:07.849 --> 03:58:07.859 align:start position:0%
like to think that it's you know that
 
03:58:09.889 --> 03:58:09.899 align:start position:0%
would happen anyway but sometimes it
 
03:58:11.210 --> 03:58:11.220 align:start position:0%
doesn't and it's important that we have
 
03:58:13.370 --> 03:58:13.380 align:start position:0%
this regulation because the cost to
 
03:58:15.349 --> 03:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
replace the system for a large
 
03:58:18.410 --> 03:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
multi-family house is fifty thousand
 
03:58:18.420 --> 03:58:19.309 align:start position:0%
multi-family house is fifty thousand
dollars

03:58:19.309 --> 03:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:58:21.889 --> 03:58:21.899 align:start position:0%
and I think without it with that large
 
03:58:24.170 --> 03:58:24.180 align:start position:0%
cost it can lead to conflicts among
 
03:58:26.150 --> 03:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
owners if it's not clearly spelled out
 
03:58:27.650 --> 03:58:27.660 align:start position:0%
in the agreement so that's another
 
03:58:32.030 --> 03:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:33.950 --> 03:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
and finally you know I'm from the
 
03:58:35.689 --> 03:58:35.699 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services you
 
03:58:36.889 --> 03:58:36.899 align:start position:0%
know I've talked a lot about real estate
 
03:58:38.809 --> 03:58:38.819 align:start position:0%
but really you know one of the other
 
03:58:40.790 --> 03:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
issues here is water quality
 
03:58:43.490 --> 03:58:43.500 align:start position:0%
uh we feel like this bill would be a
 
03:58:45.050 --> 03:58:45.060 align:start position:0%
step backwards for protection of the
 
03:58:47.389 --> 03:58:47.399 align:start position:0%
water quality of our lakes and rivers
 
03:58:49.490 --> 03:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
considering that the high percentage of
 
03:58:50.929 --> 03:58:50.939 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire
 
03:58:52.910 --> 03:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
population that receives their drinking
 
03:58:54.290 --> 03:58:54.300 align:start position:0%
water from Wells
 
03:58:56.929 --> 03:58:56.939 align:start position:0%
protection of the groundwater quality is
 
03:58:58.010 --> 03:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
very important
 
03:59:00.469 --> 03:59:00.479 align:start position:0%
for protecting Public Health
 
03:59:02.990 --> 03:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
old cabins on the shores of lakes likely
 
03:59:05.210 --> 03:59:05.220 align:start position:0%
to have poorly functioning systems that
 
03:59:07.729 --> 03:59:07.739 align:start position:0%
do not actually treat the waste
 
03:59:09.710 --> 03:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
exempting these properties from this
 
03:59:11.630 --> 03:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
epic System review when there's a sub
 
03:59:13.809 --> 03:59:13.819 align:start position:0%
when there's a condominium conveyance
 
03:59:16.250 --> 03:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
would be a missed opportunity to protect
 
03:59:18.290 --> 03:59:18.300 align:start position:0%
the natural resources that drive tourism
 
03:59:20.689 --> 03:59:20.699 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
03:59:23.210 --> 03:59:23.220 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion the department opposes
 
03:59:26.030 --> 03:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
the bill we think the statute is worded
 
03:59:29.630 --> 03:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
correctly as it is in its intending it's
 
03:59:31.910 --> 03:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
serving its intended purpose
 
03:59:34.309 --> 03:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
and we think that
 
03:59:34.319 --> 03:59:35.030 align:start position:0%
and we think that
um

03:59:35.030 --> 03:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:37.429 --> 03:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
the the fixes you know that while this
 
03:59:40.370 --> 03:59:40.380 align:start position:0%
may uh be helpful to certain properties
 
03:59:42.950 --> 03:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
for certain sales we think that it's not
 
03:59:45.050 --> 03:59:45.060 align:start position:0%
good policy for the whole state and
 
03:59:46.729 --> 03:59:46.739 align:start position:0%
would have unintended consequences if
 
03:59:46.739 --> 03:59:47.870 align:start position:0%
would have unintended consequences if
passed

03:59:47.870 --> 03:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
passed
 
03:59:48.950 --> 03:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:59:50.570 --> 03:59:50.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:59:52.729 --> 03:59:52.739 align:start position:0%
do we have any questions representative
 
03:59:52.739 --> 03:59:54.290 align:start position:0%
do we have any questions representative
Davis

03:59:54.290 --> 03:59:54.300 align:start position:0%
Davis
 
03:59:55.729 --> 03:59:55.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:59:58.550 --> 03:59:58.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question so
 
04:00:00.530 --> 04:00:00.540 align:start position:0%
to get back to a previous question the
 
04:00:03.710 --> 04:00:03.720 align:start position:0%
problem this seeks to solve is a problem
 
04:00:06.349 --> 04:00:06.359 align:start position:0%
for folks who want to sell these
 
04:00:08.689 --> 04:00:08.699 align:start position:0%
properties and may not be able to sell
 
04:00:09.889 --> 04:00:09.899 align:start position:0%
them because they would have to go
 
04:00:14.150 --> 04:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
through this extra step of planning
 
04:00:15.650 --> 04:00:15.660 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Davis for the
 
04:00:15.660 --> 04:00:16.610 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Davis for the
question

04:00:16.610 --> 04:00:16.620 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:00:18.710 --> 04:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
um uh that is one problem we've
 
04:00:20.990 --> 04:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
encountered uh some situations like that
 
04:00:24.050 --> 04:00:24.060 align:start position:0%
where there's a property where uh
 
04:00:25.790 --> 04:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
selling the whole property would be a
 
04:00:27.650 --> 04:00:27.660 align:start position:0%
challenge but selling off individual
 
04:00:27.660 --> 04:00:29.050 align:start position:0%
challenge but selling off individual
pieces

04:00:29.050 --> 04:00:29.060 align:start position:0%
pieces
 
04:00:31.250 --> 04:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
would would be easier
 
04:00:34.250 --> 04:00:34.260 align:start position:0%
and one of the things I didn't touch on
 
04:00:36.349 --> 04:00:36.359 align:start position:0%
in my testimony is this issue of a term
 
04:00:38.269 --> 04:00:38.279 align:start position:0%
called lot loading that you may be
 
04:00:41.090 --> 04:00:41.100 align:start position:0%
familiar with it it's not aside from
 
04:00:44.150 --> 04:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
just the size of the septic system a a
 
04:00:46.969 --> 04:00:46.979 align:start position:0%
parcel of land depending on the type of
 
04:00:49.130 --> 04:00:49.140 align:start position:0%
soil can only treat a certain amount of
 
04:00:52.250 --> 04:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
waste and so if you have let's say a 10
 
04:00:54.710 --> 04:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
acre parcel and you can only you can
 
04:00:58.490 --> 04:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
treat 2 000 gallons per parcel per acre
 
04:01:00.889 --> 04:01:00.899 align:start position:0%
you can you can do I'm not going to do
 
04:01:02.330 --> 04:01:02.340 align:start position:0%
the math but you guys can do the math
 
04:01:04.429 --> 04:01:04.439 align:start position:0%
there's a limited amount of flow that
 
04:01:06.050 --> 04:01:06.060 align:start position:0%
can be treated on that property and
 
04:01:07.910 --> 04:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's lot loading
 
04:01:10.250 --> 04:01:10.260 align:start position:0%
RSA 45a
 
04:01:12.830 --> 04:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
in statute says the department cannot
 
04:01:14.870 --> 04:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
waive the lot loading requirements for
 
04:01:14.880 --> 04:01:15.889 align:start position:0%
waive the lot loading requirements for
properties

04:01:15.889 --> 04:01:15.899 align:start position:0%
properties
 
04:01:18.590 --> 04:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
and so if someone is now wanting to sell
 
04:01:21.189 --> 04:01:21.199 align:start position:0%
one of these properties and they've got
 
04:01:23.929 --> 04:01:23.939 align:start position:0%
twice the lot loading
 
04:01:26.269 --> 04:01:26.279 align:start position:0%
of what is capable the law is capable of
 
04:01:26.279 --> 04:01:27.410 align:start position:0%
of what is capable the law is capable of
handling

04:01:27.410 --> 04:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
handling
 
04:01:29.210 --> 04:01:29.220 align:start position:0%
going through the subdivision review is
 
04:01:31.610 --> 04:01:31.620 align:start position:0%
saying I'm sorry you can we can
 
04:01:33.769 --> 04:01:33.779 align:start position:0%
subdivide this for you but half of the
 
04:01:35.269 --> 04:01:35.279 align:start position:0%
dwellings are going to have to be
 
04:01:38.030 --> 04:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
removed and that certainly diminishes
 
04:01:39.290 --> 04:01:39.300 align:start position:0%
the sale price
 
04:01:42.950 --> 04:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
of the property
 
04:01:45.590 --> 04:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
representative Brown
 
04:01:47.150 --> 04:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:01:49.969 --> 04:01:49.979 align:start position:0%
taking my question so your whole
 
04:01:51.710 --> 04:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
objection to not the whole but your
 
04:01:54.889 --> 04:01:54.899 align:start position:0%
primary objection to this bill is that
 
04:01:54.899 --> 04:01:55.670 align:start position:0%
primary objection to this bill is that
um

04:01:55.670 --> 04:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:58.670 --> 04:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
Des does not have then the proper
 
04:02:01.849 --> 04:02:01.859 align:start position:0%
oversight to make sure that current uh
 
04:02:04.610 --> 04:02:04.620 align:start position:0%
septic design is met for the condominium
 
04:02:06.889 --> 04:02:06.899 align:start position:0%
use is that correct thank you
 
04:02:08.510 --> 04:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative Brown for the question uh
 
04:02:09.830 --> 04:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
I think that
 
04:02:12.590 --> 04:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
would I think that is correct I you know
 
04:02:15.830 --> 04:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's a simplification uh you know
 
04:02:18.050 --> 04:02:18.060 align:start position:0%
the I'd like to go back to the reasons
 
04:02:19.610 --> 04:02:19.620 align:start position:0%
why we feel that the subdivision
 
04:02:21.950 --> 04:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
regulations are important for us to do
 
04:02:24.349 --> 04:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
which is to make sure whoever's buying
 
04:02:26.809 --> 04:02:26.819 align:start position:0%
the properties has assurance that that
 
04:02:29.450 --> 04:02:29.460 align:start position:0%
property uh can meet the septic system
 
04:02:32.330 --> 04:02:32.340 align:start position:0%
requirements for treating their waste
 
04:02:35.630 --> 04:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
and also is protecting groundwater and
 
04:02:39.290 --> 04:02:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:41.750 --> 04:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh is it a true follow-up
 
04:02:44.389 --> 04:02:44.399 align:start position:0%
go follow up
 
04:02:47.450 --> 04:02:47.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so basically the
 
04:02:49.250 --> 04:02:49.260 align:start position:0%
only thing that you're concerned about
 
04:02:50.510 --> 04:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
the real thing that you're concerned
 
04:02:52.130 --> 04:02:52.140 align:start position:0%
about here is making sure that the Des
 
04:02:54.530 --> 04:02:54.540 align:start position:0%
has the opportunity to review
 
04:02:57.110 --> 04:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
the site to make sure it's adequate for
 
04:02:59.570 --> 04:02:59.580 align:start position:0%
the for the use is that correct that is
 
04:03:01.070 --> 04:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
correct thank you thank you probably
 
04:03:02.750 --> 04:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
restating it helped me
 
04:03:02.760 --> 04:03:05.630 align:start position:0%
restating it helped me
understand

04:03:05.630 --> 04:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:08.030 --> 04:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
representative manager Puti thank you Mr
 
04:03:11.450 --> 04:03:11.460 align:start position:0%
Twitter uh thank you Mr Scott for taking
 
04:03:14.630 --> 04:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
my question uh how would would it be
 
04:03:17.450 --> 04:03:17.460 align:start position:0%
different if it was uh Municipal sewer
 
04:03:22.969 --> 04:03:22.979 align:start position:0%
and water versus uh septic because it's
 
04:03:25.010 --> 04:03:25.020 align:start position:0%
more regulated yeah thank you
 
04:03:27.290 --> 04:03:27.300 align:start position:0%
representative mangaputi uh yes you're
 
04:03:29.870 --> 04:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
100 correct I I failed to mention that
 
04:03:32.510 --> 04:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
for a subdivision with Municipal Water
 
04:03:36.710 --> 04:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:39.950 --> 04:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:41.630 --> 04:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:03:43.550 --> 04:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:03:45.950 --> 04:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at the first page of the
 
04:03:50.030 --> 04:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
bill lines 23 and 24 where it says
 
04:03:52.429 --> 04:03:52.439 align:start position:0%
changes in the hours days or seasons of
 
04:03:52.439 --> 04:03:55.130 align:start position:0%
changes in the hours days or seasons of
operation

04:03:55.130 --> 04:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:58.490 --> 04:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
dot dot dot so with this type of a
 
04:04:01.130 --> 04:04:01.140 align:start position:0%
change does would this not I think that
 
04:04:04.130 --> 04:04:04.140 align:start position:0%
you touched it touched upon it in your
 
04:04:06.830 --> 04:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
testimony it would in fact indeed have
 
04:04:09.769 --> 04:04:09.779 align:start position:0%
an impact on lot load with regards to
 
04:04:11.349 --> 04:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
the the the
 
04:04:14.389 --> 04:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
Wastewater the the septic
 
04:04:17.510 --> 04:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
additionally would this not also affect
 
04:04:19.969 --> 04:04:19.979 align:start position:0%
the you know the wells in the water
 
04:04:22.969 --> 04:04:22.979 align:start position:0%
table and that Supply with those types
 
04:04:24.590 --> 04:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
of changes
 
04:04:26.689 --> 04:04:26.699 align:start position:0%
thank you representative power and I
 
04:04:27.889 --> 04:04:27.899 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing this up because I
 
04:04:29.450 --> 04:04:29.460 align:start position:0%
was making a note when you had the
 
04:04:31.790 --> 04:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
discussion earlier to to touch on this
 
04:04:34.130 --> 04:04:34.140 align:start position:0%
issue and I think this gets to the
 
04:04:38.210 --> 04:04:38.220 align:start position:0%
question of uh changes in um you know to
 
04:04:41.570 --> 04:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals and
 
04:04:44.510 --> 04:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
I have a two-part answer and the first
 
04:04:48.530 --> 04:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
part is in in in fact and in reality you
 
04:04:51.229 --> 04:04:51.239 align:start position:0%
know a change in the amount about the
 
04:04:52.849 --> 04:04:52.859 align:start position:0%
frequency of occupation of a residence
 
04:04:55.010 --> 04:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
would increase the water use
 
04:04:55.020 --> 04:04:56.689 align:start position:0%
would increase the water use
physically

04:04:56.689 --> 04:04:56.699 align:start position:0%
physically
 
04:04:58.250 --> 04:04:58.260 align:start position:0%
I need to say the second part
 
04:05:00.469 --> 04:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
importantly is that
 
04:05:03.349 --> 04:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
the way that we determine the flow that
 
04:05:07.250 --> 04:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
we regulate for our structure is is not
 
04:05:09.290 --> 04:05:09.300 align:start position:0%
based on the frequency of operation it's
 
04:05:11.809 --> 04:05:11.819 align:start position:0%
based on the number of bedrooms or if
 
04:05:14.150 --> 04:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
it's a restaurant the number of seats I
 
04:05:16.610 --> 04:05:16.620 align:start position:0%
mean there's quite a long table of how
 
04:05:18.849 --> 04:05:18.859 align:start position:0%
you calculate the flow
 
04:05:22.370 --> 04:05:22.380 align:start position:0%
and so in effect for us we you know this
 
04:05:23.689 --> 04:05:23.699 align:start position:0%
wouldn't affect the way that we look at
 
04:05:25.150 --> 04:05:25.160 align:start position:0%
lot loading
 
04:05:27.950 --> 04:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
but it is an issue and we do get a lot
 
04:05:29.929 --> 04:05:29.939 align:start position:0%
of calls from people who are calling us
 
04:05:32.870 --> 04:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
now and saying the property across from
 
04:05:34.969 --> 04:05:34.979 align:start position:0%
me is now a short-term rental and it's
 
04:05:37.130 --> 04:05:37.140 align:start position:0%
full every weekend with you know 25
 
04:05:39.590 --> 04:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
people and isn't this over you know
 
04:05:40.790 --> 04:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
violating your septic system
 
04:05:43.969 --> 04:05:43.979 align:start position:0%
requirements and our answer is
 
04:05:45.349 --> 04:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
they haven't changed the number of
 
04:05:48.229 --> 04:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
bedrooms that's you know in terms for
 
04:05:50.689 --> 04:05:50.699 align:start position:0%
our regulations it's still the same what
 
04:05:52.670 --> 04:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
will happen is that if they are over
 
04:05:56.090 --> 04:05:56.100 align:start position:0%
using the system the system will fail
 
04:05:58.189 --> 04:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
and then the responsibility will be an
 
04:06:01.309 --> 04:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:04.130 --> 04:06:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:05.750 --> 04:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none I have a couple of quick
 
04:06:10.490 --> 04:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
ones for you yes um on line 20 and 21 it
 
04:06:12.590 --> 04:06:12.600 align:start position:0%
talks about the condominium conversion
 
04:06:16.010 --> 04:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
and on 21 it's talks about a condominium
 
04:06:19.010 --> 04:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
conversion means and it goes on to I
 
04:06:23.210 --> 04:06:23.220 align:start position:0%
assume Give a definition is there a
 
04:06:25.790 --> 04:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
definition of condominium conversion
 
04:06:28.130 --> 04:06:28.140 align:start position:0%
anywhere else in the rsas
 
04:06:31.309 --> 04:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative turkott I
 
04:06:35.570 --> 04:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
um I do we our attorneys looked for that
 
04:06:37.910 --> 04:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
and did not find one
 
04:06:40.849 --> 04:06:40.859 align:start position:0%
and that was part of our concern is that
 
04:06:42.530 --> 04:06:42.540 align:start position:0%
we did not think that there was a
 
04:06:44.870 --> 04:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
difference between a conveyance and a
 
04:06:47.210 --> 04:06:47.220 align:start position:0%
conversion in fact
 
04:06:49.010 --> 04:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
second question
 
04:06:49.020 --> 04:06:49.849 align:start position:0%
second question
um

04:06:49.849 --> 04:06:49.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:51.290 --> 04:06:51.300 align:start position:0%
I know we're talking a lot about
 
04:06:54.170 --> 04:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
lakefronts and water uh
 
04:06:56.990 --> 04:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
water quality for you know
 
04:06:58.969 --> 04:06:58.979 align:start position:0%
condimenting conversions around the
 
04:06:58.979 --> 04:07:00.189 align:start position:0%
condimenting conversions around the
Lakes

04:07:00.189 --> 04:07:00.199 align:start position:0%
Lakes
 
04:07:04.309 --> 04:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
would a let's just say a large
 
04:07:07.490 --> 04:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
large house sitting on a small lot
 
04:07:09.710 --> 04:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
somewhere that is not served by water
 
04:07:11.630 --> 04:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
and sewer
 
04:07:16.070 --> 04:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
if that was turned subdivided into
 
04:07:19.070 --> 04:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
instead of going from let's just say
 
04:07:19.080 --> 04:07:23.210 align:start position:0%
instead of going from let's just say
um

04:07:23.210 --> 04:07:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:26.450 --> 04:07:26.460 align:start position:0%
one single house to five condominium
 
04:07:30.349 --> 04:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
condominium units with now actually more
 
04:07:32.410 --> 04:07:32.420 align:start position:0%
bedrooms more
 
04:07:35.630 --> 04:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
water usage and discharge for sewer
 
04:07:38.809 --> 04:07:38.819 align:start position:0%
would that is that something you would
 
04:07:41.330 --> 04:07:41.340 align:start position:0%
also consider a condo conversion and I'm
 
04:07:43.070 --> 04:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
talking away from the Waterfront now I'm
 
04:07:45.410 --> 04:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
just trying to get an idea of what this
 
04:07:47.929 --> 04:07:47.939 align:start position:0%
condom minion conversion
 
04:07:50.330 --> 04:07:50.340 align:start position:0%
or conveyance includes would you how
 
04:07:53.450 --> 04:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
would you handle that situation nice all
 
04:07:54.830 --> 04:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
right thank you for the question and I
 
04:07:56.929 --> 04:07:56.939 align:start position:0%
think about getting it correct it's a
 
04:07:59.450 --> 04:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
small lot with a large house
 
04:08:01.429 --> 04:08:01.439 align:start position:0%
you know and then
 
04:08:03.530 --> 04:08:03.540 align:start position:0%
um but then that house being divided up
 
04:08:06.469 --> 04:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
in into maybe apartments and being
 
04:08:08.809 --> 04:08:08.819 align:start position:0%
condom minimized and not on Municipal
 
04:08:11.330 --> 04:08:11.340 align:start position:0%
sewer not on Municipal Water on a
 
04:08:13.969 --> 04:08:13.979 align:start position:0%
private well in a septic system
 
04:08:17.510 --> 04:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
um we we would be involved with that and
 
04:08:20.389 --> 04:08:20.399 align:start position:0%
you know what they would be assured in
 
04:08:22.670 --> 04:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
terms of flow is the current flow that
 
04:08:23.689 --> 04:08:23.699 align:start position:0%
they have
 
04:08:26.870 --> 04:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh so so meaning like
 
04:08:29.090 --> 04:08:29.100 align:start position:0%
I guess if the concern would be that
 
04:08:31.010 --> 04:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
someone's got a house that you know it's
 
04:08:32.809 --> 04:08:32.819 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
04:08:34.189 --> 04:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
you know let's just say it's being con
 
04:08:36.110 --> 04:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
you know existing house with six
 
04:08:38.870 --> 04:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
bedrooms it's becoming three two bedroom
 
04:08:38.880 --> 04:08:40.610 align:start position:0%
bedrooms it's becoming three two bedroom
apartments

04:08:40.610 --> 04:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
apartments
 
04:08:43.550 --> 04:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
you know uh just for example
 
04:08:47.389 --> 04:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
um then the we they could maintain the
 
04:08:49.010 --> 04:08:49.020 align:start position:0%
flow that they have even though they've
 
04:08:50.750 --> 04:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
changed it's cheap form of ownership
 
04:08:52.370 --> 04:08:52.380 align:start position:0%
they'd have to go through the convert
 
04:08:54.830 --> 04:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
the subdivision process but even if they
 
04:08:56.570 --> 04:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
didn't meet lot loading they would still
 
04:08:58.729 --> 04:08:58.739 align:start position:0%
be guaranteed the existing flow that
 
04:08:59.929 --> 04:08:59.939 align:start position:0%
they have
 
04:09:02.570 --> 04:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
if they were to want to increase their
 
04:09:05.150 --> 04:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
use like add a seventh bedroom
 
04:09:09.050 --> 04:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
then if that met the lot loading that
 
04:09:11.090 --> 04:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
would be fine if it didn't they would be
 
04:09:12.590 --> 04:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
at least allowed to maintain their
 
04:09:14.510 --> 04:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
existing flow totally understand that I
 
04:09:18.110 --> 04:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
guess to be a little clearer would this
 
04:09:21.050 --> 04:09:21.060 align:start position:0%
bill have any effect or change what you
 
04:09:24.110 --> 04:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
do in that situation uh yes it would
 
04:09:26.809 --> 04:09:26.819 align:start position:0%
it's the same situation as the if there
 
04:09:30.769 --> 04:09:30.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:32.630 --> 04:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
see no further questions thank you very
 
04:09:34.070 --> 04:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony all right thank
 
04:09:35.570 --> 04:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
04:09:37.969 --> 04:09:37.979 align:start position:0%
next we have
 
04:09:40.729 --> 04:09:40.739 align:start position:0%
Andrea lamaro
 
04:10:02.170 --> 04:10:02.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:05.269 --> 04:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
good afternoon thank you for this
 
04:10:08.450 --> 04:10:08.460 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh to speak to the committee
 
04:10:11.990 --> 04:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
I'm Andrea lamaro uh president and
 
04:10:14.870 --> 04:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
policy advocate for New Hampshire Lakes
 
04:10:17.450 --> 04:10:17.460 align:start position:0%
and I'm here today to testify in
 
04:10:21.349 --> 04:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill 236
 
04:10:23.570 --> 04:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire Lakes I think first of
 
04:10:25.969 --> 04:10:25.979 align:start position:0%
all I think Phil did a great job of Mr
 
04:10:28.910 --> 04:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
Tober did a great job of presenting our
 
04:10:31.610 --> 04:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
concerns specific concerns relative to
 
04:10:31.620 --> 04:10:32.570 align:start position:0%
concerns specific concerns relative to
Lakes

04:10:32.570 --> 04:10:32.580 align:start position:0%
Lakes
 
04:10:32.580 --> 04:10:33.769 align:start position:0%
Lakes
so

04:10:33.769 --> 04:10:33.779 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:10:33.779 --> 04:10:34.729 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:10:34.729 --> 04:10:34.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:36.710 --> 04:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Lakes were a Statewide
 
04:10:40.610 --> 04:10:40.620 align:start position:0%
non-profit organization our mission is
 
04:10:42.830 --> 04:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
to restore and preserve the health of
 
04:10:44.030 --> 04:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
our Lakes
 
04:10:46.490 --> 04:10:46.500 align:start position:0%
we represent about 2 000 individuals
 
04:10:48.769 --> 04:10:48.779 align:start position:0%
about a hundred Lake Associations
 
04:10:50.929 --> 04:10:50.939 align:start position:0%
Community groups and each of those
 
04:10:52.670 --> 04:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
associations has
 
04:10:55.570 --> 04:10:55.580 align:start position:0%
hundreds of of members as well
 
04:10:58.250 --> 04:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
so I said our mission is to restore and
 
04:11:00.830 --> 04:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
preserve the health of our Lakes our
 
04:11:02.929 --> 04:11:02.939 align:start position:0%
mission up until last year was actually
 
04:11:04.969 --> 04:11:04.979 align:start position:0%
to keep New Hampshire's Lakes clean and
 
04:11:07.309 --> 04:11:07.319 align:start position:0%
healthy so we've changed that mission we
 
04:11:08.990 --> 04:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
need to restore and preserve the health
 
04:11:10.370 --> 04:11:10.380 align:start position:0%
of our Lakes
 
04:11:12.530 --> 04:11:12.540 align:start position:0%
and I what I wanted to talk to you today
 
04:11:16.309 --> 04:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
about is just the state of the health of
 
04:11:17.630 --> 04:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
our Lakes
 
04:11:17.640 --> 04:11:18.229 align:start position:0%
our Lakes
um

04:11:18.229 --> 04:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:20.090 --> 04:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
we can no longer pretend here in New
 
04:11:21.469 --> 04:11:21.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that our Lakes are clean and
 
04:11:23.450 --> 04:11:23.460 align:start position:0%
healthy there are some serious issues
 
04:11:25.429 --> 04:11:25.439 align:start position:0%
they are facing some of you may have
 
04:11:28.670 --> 04:11:28.680 align:start position:0%
heard about toxic cyanobacteria blooms
 
04:11:30.410 --> 04:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
that's an issue of the legislature took
 
04:11:33.590 --> 04:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
up last year and now has a has
 
04:11:36.050 --> 04:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
commissioned Des to do a plan
 
04:11:39.110 --> 04:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
to address those toxic blooms those
 
04:11:42.530 --> 04:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
toxics blooms in our Lakes are caused by
 
04:11:42.540 --> 04:11:43.250 align:start position:0%
toxics blooms in our Lakes are caused by
um

04:11:43.250 --> 04:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:45.590 --> 04:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
a number of things but one of them is
 
04:11:47.630 --> 04:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
nutrient pollution
 
04:11:51.410 --> 04:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
so we're concerned that exempting you
 
04:11:53.330 --> 04:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
know taking away the opportunity for Des
 
04:11:56.689 --> 04:11:56.699 align:start position:0%
to weigh in on you know the septic
 
04:11:59.330 --> 04:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
systems for these condominium
 
04:12:01.610 --> 04:12:01.620 align:start position:0%
conveyances is really a missed
 
04:12:04.130 --> 04:12:04.140 align:start position:0%
opportunity to find systems that are
 
04:12:07.250 --> 04:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
fouling to work with property owners to
 
04:12:10.010 --> 04:12:10.020 align:start position:0%
you know fix these failing systems and
 
04:12:11.830 --> 04:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
to make sure that you know future
 
04:12:14.389 --> 04:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
Replacements with associated with these
 
04:12:17.389 --> 04:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
these properties and have adequate space
 
04:12:20.090 --> 04:12:20.100 align:start position:0%
for adequate septic systems so failing
 
04:12:23.990 --> 04:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
septic systems Leach nutrients into the
 
04:12:25.849 --> 04:12:25.859 align:start position:0%
water into the groundwater and
 
04:12:28.010 --> 04:12:28.020 align:start position:0%
eventually into our lakes and there in
 
04:12:30.710 --> 04:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
the lake these nutrients spur on these
 
04:12:30.720 --> 04:12:31.689 align:start position:0%
the lake these nutrients spur on these
toxic

04:12:31.689 --> 04:12:31.699 align:start position:0%
toxic
 
04:12:34.309 --> 04:12:34.319 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms
 
04:12:36.410 --> 04:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
so I'll save you the big science lesson
 
04:12:39.110 --> 04:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
but a failing septic systems in outdated
 
04:12:40.849 --> 04:12:40.859 align:start position:0%
septic systems are not good for Lake
 
04:12:42.590 --> 04:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
quality and I just wanted to bring in a
 
04:12:44.210 --> 04:12:44.220 align:start position:0%
little bit of data to let you know how
 
04:12:46.389 --> 04:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
serious this problem is of toxic
 
04:12:49.010 --> 04:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms we're seeing an
 
04:12:51.590 --> 04:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
increased frequency and duration of
 
04:12:54.950 --> 04:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
these toxic blooms in our Lakes last
 
04:12:57.889 --> 04:12:57.899 align:start position:0%
summer this Department of Environmental
 
04:13:01.370 --> 04:13:01.380 align:start position:0%
Services issued 46 Public Health
 
04:13:05.929 --> 04:13:05.939 align:start position:0%
advisories for toxic blooms on 37 of our
 
04:13:07.849 --> 04:13:07.859 align:start position:0%
water bodies and lakes
 
04:13:10.610 --> 04:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
people were basically told to stay out
 
04:13:12.769 --> 04:13:12.779 align:start position:0%
of the water to keep their kids and
 
04:13:14.809 --> 04:13:14.819 align:start position:0%
their pets out of the water because they
 
04:13:17.450 --> 04:13:17.460 align:start position:0%
could get really sick short-term
 
04:13:19.849 --> 04:13:19.859 align:start position:0%
illnesses and also chronic long-term
 
04:13:19.859 --> 04:13:22.790 align:start position:0%
illnesses and also chronic long-term
illnesses

04:13:22.790 --> 04:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
illnesses
 
04:13:25.250 --> 04:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
um a little bit more data here so our
 
04:13:26.570 --> 04:13:26.580 align:start position:0%
state parks
 
04:13:26.580 --> 04:13:27.170 align:start position:0%
state parks
um

04:13:27.170 --> 04:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:30.050 --> 04:13:30.060 align:start position:0%
that have beaches in total experienced
 
04:13:34.070 --> 04:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
77 advisory days so people visiting
 
04:13:36.769 --> 04:13:36.779 align:start position:0%
those state parks our residents and out
 
04:13:40.010 --> 04:13:40.020 align:start position:0%
of state visitors you know 77 days total
 
04:13:42.170 --> 04:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
last summer you know couldn't swim in
 
04:13:44.809 --> 04:13:44.819 align:start position:0%
the lake that they wanted to go swimming
 
04:13:48.110 --> 04:13:48.120 align:start position:0%
the average length of a toxic Bloom on
 
04:13:51.729 --> 04:13:51.739 align:start position:0%
our water bodies last year was 25 days
 
04:13:54.889 --> 04:13:54.899 align:start position:0%
one the longest Bloom the longest
 
04:13:58.490 --> 04:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
advisory was 103 days
 
04:14:00.349 --> 04:14:00.359 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:14:02.450 --> 04:14:02.460 align:start position:0%
these toxic blooms are not only
 
04:14:04.729 --> 04:14:04.739 align:start position:0%
endangering the health of our lakes and
 
04:14:04.739 --> 04:14:06.189 align:start position:0%
endangering the health of our lakes and
endangering

04:14:06.189 --> 04:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
endangering
 
04:14:09.050 --> 04:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
People's Health and people's enjoyment
 
04:14:11.450 --> 04:14:11.460 align:start position:0%
of the our Lakes they're also
 
04:14:15.710 --> 04:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
endangering endangering property values
 
04:14:15.720 --> 04:14:16.250 align:start position:0%
endangering endangering property values
um

04:14:16.250 --> 04:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:18.410 --> 04:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
in the past couple of years some Studies
 
04:14:20.510 --> 04:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
have been coming out about the impact of
 
04:14:23.330 --> 04:14:23.340 align:start position:0%
recurring toxic cyanobacteria blooms on
 
04:14:24.950 --> 04:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
lakes and this data is showing that
 
04:14:28.189 --> 04:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
property values can decrease by anywhere
 
04:14:31.250 --> 04:14:31.260 align:start position:0%
from 5 to 25 percent
 
04:14:34.729 --> 04:14:34.739 align:start position:0%
that seems like a lot but if you've ever
 
04:14:36.830 --> 04:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
experienced a recurring cyanobacteria
 
04:14:38.510 --> 04:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
Bloom you would get it and you probably
 
04:14:40.729 --> 04:14:40.739 align:start position:0%
wouldn't would be concerned about you
 
04:14:43.490 --> 04:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
living along a lake like that
 
04:14:47.150 --> 04:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to point out that our
 
04:14:49.849 --> 04:14:49.859 align:start position:0%
Lakes clean and healthy Lakes bring a
 
04:14:52.510 --> 04:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
lot to our our state you know for
 
04:14:55.189 --> 04:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
recreation for our residents our
 
04:14:57.290 --> 04:14:57.300 align:start position:0%
visitors they bring a lot to our economy
 
04:14:59.210 --> 04:14:59.220 align:start position:0%
there have been two recent economic
 
04:14:59.220 --> 04:15:00.290 align:start position:0%
there have been two recent economic
studies

04:15:00.290 --> 04:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
studies
 
04:15:03.290 --> 04:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
showing one show that Lake Winnipesaukee
 
04:15:05.870 --> 04:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
our biggest lake is valued and hold on
 
04:15:08.929 --> 04:15:08.939 align:start position:0%
one sec yeah could could we attempt to
 
04:15:12.130 --> 04:15:12.140 align:start position:0%
keep the we're talking a lot about
 
04:15:14.870 --> 04:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
volumes could we talk specifically about
 
04:15:17.570 --> 04:15:17.580 align:start position:0%
this I know yes I appreciate that right
 
04:15:20.210 --> 04:15:20.220 align:start position:0%
we need to wrap it up again yeah so
 
04:15:22.849 --> 04:15:22.859 align:start position:0%
basically my point is just going off of
 
04:15:25.670 --> 04:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
what Mr trollbridge said that we think
 
04:15:27.830 --> 04:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
that you know this is a missed
 
04:15:30.650 --> 04:15:30.660 align:start position:0%
opportunity what this bill is presenting
 
04:15:34.070 --> 04:15:34.080 align:start position:0%
to fine septic systems make sure that
 
04:15:36.170 --> 04:15:36.180 align:start position:0%
when they're failing and they are able
 
04:15:39.170 --> 04:15:39.180 align:start position:0%
to be adequately replaced to help
 
04:15:41.450 --> 04:15:41.460 align:start position:0%
protect and hopefully restore the health
 
04:15:42.650 --> 04:15:42.660 align:start position:0%
of our Lakes
 
04:15:44.809 --> 04:15:44.819 align:start position:0%
which is good for our citizens our
 
04:15:47.269 --> 04:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
residents our economy property taxes all
 
04:15:49.550 --> 04:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
of that so thank you thank you any
 
04:15:53.570 --> 04:15:53.580 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative treeleven
 
04:15:55.309 --> 04:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thanks for taking
 
04:15:56.929 --> 04:15:56.939 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:16:00.050 --> 04:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
um how does this change in this bill
 
04:16:03.110 --> 04:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
relate to the fact that we have a site
 
04:16:06.650 --> 04:16:06.660 align:start position:0%
assessment study law in place whenever
 
04:16:09.530 --> 04:16:09.540 align:start position:0%
property is transferred from one owner
 
04:16:11.090 --> 04:16:11.100 align:start position:0%
to another
 
04:16:11.100 --> 04:16:12.290 align:start position:0%
to another
um

04:16:12.290 --> 04:16:12.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:16.070 --> 04:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
within 200 feet of the body of water now
 
04:16:18.349 --> 04:16:18.359 align:start position:0%
that is a good question and my
 
04:16:19.969 --> 04:16:19.979 align:start position:0%
understanding that this is is is
 
04:16:21.650 --> 04:16:21.660 align:start position:0%
different in that it's you know
 
04:16:24.170 --> 04:16:24.180 align:start position:0%
subdivision and condimentimized so yes
 
04:16:26.510 --> 04:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
when an individual you know sells their
 
04:16:29.150 --> 04:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
property there is a site assess you site
 
04:16:31.490 --> 04:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
assessment nothing has to happen to the
 
04:16:33.290 --> 04:16:33.300 align:start position:0%
system but I understand my understanding
 
04:16:35.809 --> 04:16:35.819 align:start position:0%
is that this is a different situation
 
04:16:38.150 --> 04:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
thanks sure
 
04:16:41.269 --> 04:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
further questions I see none thank you
 
04:16:44.450 --> 04:16:44.460 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony
 
04:16:51.290 --> 04:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:53.630 --> 04:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Nate Grace for the
 
04:16:55.849 --> 04:16:55.859 align:start position:0%
municipal Association we oppose this
 
04:16:55.859 --> 04:16:57.590 align:start position:0%
municipal Association we oppose this
legislation

04:16:57.590 --> 04:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:16:59.689 --> 04:16:59.699 align:start position:0%
um mainly in a cost basis but there are
 
04:17:01.250 --> 04:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
a couple technical issues I wanted to
 
04:17:02.769 --> 04:17:02.779 align:start position:0%
point out to the committee
 
04:17:05.030 --> 04:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
the chair asked a question about whether
 
04:17:07.130 --> 04:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
it's a definition of condominium
 
04:17:09.370 --> 04:17:09.380 align:start position:0%
conversion anywhere in the statutes
 
04:17:14.150 --> 04:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
under the Condominium Act RSA 356 hyphen
 
04:17:17.210 --> 04:17:17.220 align:start position:0%
B colon 3 Roman nine there's a
 
04:17:19.969 --> 04:17:19.979 align:start position:0%
definition for conversion condominium
 
04:17:22.729 --> 04:17:22.739 align:start position:0%
which is the order of words reversed
 
04:17:24.469 --> 04:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
it's a different definition than is
 
04:17:26.349 --> 04:17:26.359 align:start position:0%
provided here
 
04:17:28.849 --> 04:17:28.859 align:start position:0%
representative power asked about page
 
04:17:31.490 --> 04:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
two line seven uh Crossing out site plan
 
04:17:31.500 --> 04:17:33.410 align:start position:0%
two line seven uh Crossing out site plan
regulations

04:17:33.410 --> 04:17:33.420 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
04:17:34.969 --> 04:17:34.979 align:start position:0%
um I would note that that was something
 
04:17:37.250 --> 04:17:37.260 align:start position:0%
we noted as a technical issue as well
 
04:17:38.630 --> 04:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
because obviously slight plan
 
04:17:41.870 --> 04:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
regulations are adopted under 674 colon
 
04:17:44.450 --> 04:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
44. they're adopted by the planning
 
04:17:46.309 --> 04:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
board they're separate from a zoning
 
04:17:48.290 --> 04:17:48.300 align:start position:0%
ordinance which was adopted by the
 
04:17:49.670 --> 04:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
legislative body of my town meeting
 
04:17:55.729 --> 04:17:55.739 align:start position:0%
under 67416 so this would change exactly
 
04:17:59.689 --> 04:17:59.699 align:start position:0%
what type of regulations would apply in
 
04:18:03.530 --> 04:18:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:07.010 --> 04:18:07.020 align:start position:0%
um and then finally under page two um
 
04:18:10.130 --> 04:18:10.140 align:start position:0%
lines two through five
 
04:18:12.050 --> 04:18:12.060 align:start position:0%
um currently the conversion of existing
 
04:18:14.389 --> 04:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
properties tick Hondos can be regulated
 
04:18:17.269 --> 04:18:17.279 align:start position:0%
by local rules if and only if um that's
 
04:18:19.429 --> 04:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
provided for in the zoning ordinance um
 
04:18:23.330 --> 04:18:23.340 align:start position:0%
which again is adopted under 674 16
 
04:18:26.229 --> 04:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
and that Authority is found in
 
04:18:26.239 --> 04:18:27.790 align:start position:0%
and that Authority is found in
67214

04:18:27.790 --> 04:18:27.800 align:start position:0%
67214
 
04:18:31.010 --> 04:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
and that provides a definition of
 
04:18:33.830 --> 04:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
subdivision which is different than the
 
04:18:37.250 --> 04:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
definition provided in this bill so that
 
04:18:39.530 --> 04:18:39.540 align:start position:0%
could be problematic depending exactly
 
04:18:41.689 --> 04:18:41.699 align:start position:0%
uh how that
 
04:18:43.370 --> 04:18:43.380 align:start position:0%
plays out because there's no
 
04:18:45.830 --> 04:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
harmonization there and this bill
 
04:18:49.330 --> 04:18:49.340 align:start position:0%
doesn't contemplate changing that
 
04:18:53.689 --> 04:18:53.699 align:start position:0%
regulation as far as the main point I
 
04:18:56.870 --> 04:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
want to bring up is uh just to build off
 
04:18:59.210 --> 04:18:59.220 align:start position:0%
the example given by Des which is that
 
04:19:02.269 --> 04:19:02.279 align:start position:0%
if you have a situation where there is a
 
04:19:06.349 --> 04:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
conversion and the septic system fails
 
04:19:08.389 --> 04:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
and there's no room for a new septic
 
04:19:08.399 --> 04:19:09.769 align:start position:0%
and there's no room for a new septic
system

04:19:09.769 --> 04:19:09.779 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:19:09.779 --> 04:19:10.969 align:start position:0%
system
um

04:19:10.969 --> 04:19:10.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:13.370 --> 04:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
what happens with that property and you
 
04:19:14.929 --> 04:19:14.939 align:start position:0%
either end up with a situation where
 
04:19:17.389 --> 04:19:17.399 align:start position:0%
it's not usable because there's no way
 
04:19:19.969 --> 04:19:19.979 align:start position:0%
to get rid of human waste
 
04:19:22.429 --> 04:19:22.439 align:start position:0%
or you end up in the situations we've
 
04:19:24.950 --> 04:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
seen in some towns where they've more or
 
04:19:27.410 --> 04:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
less been required to run a new public
 
04:19:30.590 --> 04:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
sewer line down to that property and
 
04:19:32.809 --> 04:19:32.819 align:start position:0%
that is a very costly Endeavor costing
 
04:19:34.729 --> 04:19:34.739 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars requiring bonding at
 
04:19:36.469 --> 04:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
the local level and it ends up costing
 
04:19:38.450 --> 04:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
taxpayers quite a significant amount of
 
04:19:42.469 --> 04:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
money and we are concerned that passage
 
04:19:44.870 --> 04:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
of this bill could set up municipalities
 
04:19:47.990 --> 04:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
especially along Lakes regions for a
 
04:19:49.670 --> 04:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
situation where they would be required
 
04:19:52.849 --> 04:19:52.859 align:start position:0%
to run public sewer lines to properties
 
04:19:55.010 --> 04:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
along the lake which again would cost a
 
04:19:56.990 --> 04:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
significant amount of money happy to
 
04:20:01.130 --> 04:20:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:03.110 --> 04:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative Manchester
 
04:20:06.650 --> 04:20:06.660 align:start position:0%
never fails thank you Mr chair
 
04:20:07.729 --> 04:20:07.739 align:start position:0%
um question
 
04:20:12.889 --> 04:20:12.899 align:start position:0%
um this is in really from
 
04:20:16.550 --> 04:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
how does this address the critical need
 
04:20:19.849 --> 04:20:19.859 align:start position:0%
of housing in our state in different
 
04:20:22.790 --> 04:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
communities not every Community has
 
04:20:24.349 --> 04:20:24.359 align:start position:0%
public sewer and
 
04:20:27.170 --> 04:20:27.180 align:start position:0%
water representative I don't believe
 
04:20:30.830 --> 04:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
that has anything to do with this bill
 
04:20:33.889 --> 04:20:33.899 align:start position:0%
do you have a question on Mr Grace's
 
04:20:37.790 --> 04:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
testimony yes in terms of subdivision
 
04:20:41.750 --> 04:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be creating more housing
 
04:20:44.030 --> 04:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
if not subdivide it
 
04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
no because it's just a change of
 
04:20:50.389 --> 04:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
ownership so you're not creating any new
 
04:20:52.790 --> 04:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
buildings or anything
 
04:20:54.650 --> 04:20:54.660 align:start position:0%
um and because there isn't that review
 
04:20:57.050 --> 04:20:57.060 align:start position:0%
by Des you have a situation where you
 
04:20:58.610 --> 04:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
might have
 
04:21:01.429 --> 04:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
buildings that currently are able to be
 
04:21:03.410 --> 04:21:03.420 align:start position:0%
occupied by residents which would no
 
04:21:04.790 --> 04:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
longer be able to be occupied by
 
04:21:09.110 --> 04:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:11.990 --> 04:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
any further questions uh nature could
 
04:21:15.830 --> 04:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
you just uh you said RSA 356 D colon
 
04:21:19.969 --> 04:21:19.979 align:start position:0%
what was it b as in boy colon 3 Roman
 
04:21:19.979 --> 04:21:20.929 align:start position:0%

04:21:24.229 --> 04:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
and it's conversion condominium so the
 
04:21:26.269 --> 04:21:26.279 align:start position:0%
the words are reversed gotcha thank you
 
04:21:28.130 --> 04:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
very much thank you questions seeing
 
04:21:29.330 --> 04:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much for your
 
04:21:31.309 --> 04:21:31.319 align:start position:0%
testimony I don't have any more pink
 
04:21:34.309 --> 04:21:34.319 align:start position:0%

04:21:37.010 --> 04:21:37.020 align:start position:0%

and with that we'll close the hearing on
 
04:21:43.969 --> 04:21:43.979 align:start position:0%
HB 236
 
04:21:43.979 --> 04:21:47.929 align:start position:0%

We Now open up HP

04:22:02.929 --> 04:22:02.939 align:start position:0%
and representative Burroughs I believe
 
04:22:07.729 --> 04:22:07.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:09.290 --> 04:22:09.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:22:12.650 --> 04:22:12.660 align:start position:0%
committee for hearing HB 265 which is
 
04:22:15.290 --> 04:22:15.300 align:start position:0%
relative to um enabling Municipal
 
04:22:17.389 --> 04:22:17.399 align:start position:0%
property really for the installation of
 
04:22:19.610 --> 04:22:19.620 align:start position:0%
fire suppression systems
 
04:22:21.769 --> 04:22:21.779 align:start position:0%
um this was a bill that was drafted in
 
04:22:24.410 --> 04:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
direct result of a major fire that
 
04:22:26.450 --> 04:22:26.460 align:start position:0%
happened in North Conway at the red
 
04:22:28.550 --> 04:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
jacket in um you might have seen it on
 
04:22:30.790 --> 04:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
television or in the paper in April of
 
04:22:33.469 --> 04:22:33.479 align:start position:0%
2022 I was coming
 
04:22:36.110 --> 04:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
back home from the south I saw smoke
 
04:22:37.790 --> 04:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
everywhere and I saw heard on the radio
 
04:22:40.010 --> 04:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
about it and I thought to myself this
 
04:22:41.330 --> 04:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
there's going to be deaths here
 
04:22:41.340 --> 04:22:43.729 align:start position:0%
there's going to be deaths here
miraculously

04:22:43.729 --> 04:22:43.739 align:start position:0%
miraculously
 
04:22:45.830 --> 04:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
um there were two firefighters and two
 
04:22:49.130 --> 04:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
civilians injured nuts and not seriously
 
04:22:51.110 --> 04:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
um but the fire destroyed a huge section
 
04:22:52.929 --> 04:22:52.939 align:start position:0%
of the hotel was which is a major
 
04:22:56.030 --> 04:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
institution in our community we also
 
04:22:57.950 --> 04:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
have a water park there so it draws a
 
04:22:59.630 --> 04:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
lot of tourists
 
04:22:59.640 --> 04:23:01.490 align:start position:0%
lot of tourists
um

04:23:01.490 --> 04:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:03.710 --> 04:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
again as I said luckily there were not
 
04:23:05.750 --> 04:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
fatalities but the reality was the
 
04:23:07.729 --> 04:23:07.739 align:start position:0%
guests had to jump from balconies uh
 
04:23:09.349 --> 04:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
from one balcony to another to escape
 
04:23:12.349 --> 04:23:12.359 align:start position:0%
the impact of the fire in January of
 
04:23:14.929 --> 04:23:14.939 align:start position:0%
this year Hunters shop and Stave shop
 
04:23:17.630 --> 04:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
and Stave in in Wolfeboro was reduced to
 
04:23:19.550 --> 04:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
Rubble due to a fire
 
04:23:21.590 --> 04:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
um and again luckily for this one it
 
04:23:24.469 --> 04:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
began 9 15 p.m and I believe no one was
 
04:23:26.450 --> 04:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
injured but if you've been to Wolfeboro
 
04:23:28.969 --> 04:23:28.979 align:start position:0%
the stores in the middle of town it was
 
04:23:30.769 --> 04:23:30.779 align:start position:0%
fortunate that no other businesses or
 
04:23:32.929 --> 04:23:32.939 align:start position:0%
homes were impacted and this is a major
 
04:23:35.210 --> 04:23:35.220 align:start position:0%
institution in a small town that depends
 
04:23:37.670 --> 04:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
on it many people depended on to buy
 
04:23:41.210 --> 04:23:41.220 align:start position:0%
their their groceries so this bill
 
04:23:43.610 --> 04:23:43.620 align:start position:0%
excuse me was drafted with the hope of
 
04:23:45.469 --> 04:23:45.479 align:start position:0%
preventing such fires in the future
 
04:23:47.809 --> 04:23:47.819 align:start position:0%
those of us who were involved in
 
04:23:50.750 --> 04:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
drafting this bill quickly learned that
 
04:23:52.729 --> 04:23:52.739 align:start position:0%
the Mandate of putting in fire
 
04:23:54.590 --> 04:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
suppression systems for older buildings
 
04:23:57.469 --> 04:23:57.479 align:start position:0%
was not an option because in talking to
 
04:24:00.290 --> 04:24:00.300 align:start position:0%
small innkeepers in small hotels they
 
04:24:02.150 --> 04:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
said this bill such a mandate would put
 
04:24:03.769 --> 04:24:03.779 align:start position:0%
us out of business which was not
 
04:24:06.650 --> 04:24:06.660 align:start position:0%
something that that we wanted to do so
 
04:24:06.660 --> 04:24:07.010 align:start position:0%
something that that we wanted to do so
[Music]

04:24:07.010 --> 04:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:24:07.020 --> 04:24:07.910 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

04:24:07.910 --> 04:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:09.950 --> 04:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
and again be and again because of the
 
04:24:11.750 --> 04:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
high costs of these systems they're
 
04:24:13.729 --> 04:24:13.739 align:start position:0%
astronomically high and again we did not
 
04:24:16.490 --> 04:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
want to we did not want to put people
 
04:24:18.110 --> 04:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
out so
 
04:24:20.630 --> 04:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
um today automatic fire sprinklers are a
 
04:24:22.969 --> 04:24:22.979 align:start position:0%
fire code requirement as of 1991 for
 
04:24:24.950 --> 04:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
buildings that are not high rises but
 
04:24:27.229 --> 04:24:27.239 align:start position:0%
older structures are grandfathered and
 
04:24:29.870 --> 04:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
are not subject to this requirement so
 
04:24:31.370 --> 04:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
this bill was drafted with the
 
04:24:33.349 --> 04:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
assistance of Sean Toomey who is here
 
04:24:35.809 --> 04:24:35.819 align:start position:0%
the State Fire Marshal who suggested
 
04:24:39.229 --> 04:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
that RSA 79e the community fight
 
04:24:41.570 --> 04:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
revitalization tax relief incentive
 
04:24:43.790 --> 04:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
could be an option to help with a
 
04:24:46.429 --> 04:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
Sprinkle retrofit as such it would allow
 
04:24:48.530 --> 04:24:48.540 align:start position:0%
municipalities to provide local tax
 
04:24:50.570 --> 04:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
relief for the installation of automatic
 
04:24:52.670 --> 04:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
fire suppression or sprinkler systems
 
04:24:54.889 --> 04:24:54.899 align:start position:0%
for qualifying instructors under the
 
04:24:57.469 --> 04:24:57.479 align:start position:0%
community revitalization tax relief
 
04:25:00.590 --> 04:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
incentive this program allows a
 
04:25:02.630 --> 04:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
municipality to provide a temporary
 
04:25:04.729 --> 04:25:04.739 align:start position:0%
period of limited tax relief for
 
04:25:07.189 --> 04:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
property owners who wish to undertake a
 
04:25:08.929 --> 04:25:08.939 align:start position:0%
substantial rehabil habilitation of a
 
04:25:11.090 --> 04:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
qualifying structure which will provide
 
04:25:13.370 --> 04:25:13.380 align:start position:0%
at least one public benefit the I think
 
04:25:14.570 --> 04:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
the initial
 
04:25:14.580 --> 04:25:15.309 align:start position:0%
the initial
um

04:25:15.309 --> 04:25:15.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:18.710 --> 04:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
intent of the of the of this this
 
04:25:20.750 --> 04:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
section was to
 
04:25:23.990 --> 04:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
um was for uh historic structures but
 
04:25:25.429 --> 04:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
there are also buildings in our
 
04:25:27.050 --> 04:25:27.060 align:start position:0%
communities that play an important role
 
04:25:29.570 --> 04:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
like I said the supermarket and um The
 
04:25:31.250 --> 04:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
Red Jackets certainly are important
 
04:25:33.590 --> 04:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
structures in our community
 
04:25:35.630 --> 04:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
um so as such we inserted an amendment
 
04:25:39.290 --> 04:25:39.300 align:start position:0%
to RSA 79e2 by adding a qualifying
 
04:25:41.030 --> 04:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
structure for the installation of
 
04:25:42.769 --> 04:25:42.779 align:start position:0%
automatic fire suppression or sprinkler
 
04:25:44.870 --> 04:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
systems and this would not include
 
04:25:47.450 --> 04:25:47.460 align:start position:0%
dwelling units used only for residential
 
04:25:47.460 --> 04:25:49.429 align:start position:0%
dwelling units used only for residential
purposes

04:25:49.429 --> 04:25:49.439 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
04:25:51.710 --> 04:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
um the owner of a qualifying structure
 
04:25:53.450 --> 04:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
who wishes to install such a fire
 
04:25:55.790 --> 04:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
suppression system May apply to the
 
04:25:57.469 --> 04:25:57.479 align:start position:0%
municipality where the property is
 
04:25:59.990 --> 04:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
located for tax release relief the
 
04:26:02.450 --> 04:26:02.460 align:start position:0%
municipality May Grant again is enabling
 
04:26:06.290 --> 04:26:06.300 align:start position:0%
make and Grant tax assessment relief for
 
04:26:08.149 --> 04:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
a period of up to five years following
 
04:26:10.790 --> 04:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
the installation of a fire system the
 
04:26:12.710 --> 04:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
municipality May determine that the
 
04:26:14.389 --> 04:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
installation of such a system would be a
 
04:26:16.309 --> 04:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
benefit to the community under this tax
 
04:26:18.290 --> 04:26:18.300 align:start position:0%
relief incentive the qualifying
 
04:26:19.849 --> 04:26:19.859 align:start position:0%
structure would for a period of time
 
04:26:22.429 --> 04:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
determined by a local governing body
 
04:26:24.769 --> 04:26:24.779 align:start position:0%
body get the property tax on a
 
04:26:26.510 --> 04:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
qualifying structure which will not
 
04:26:28.070 --> 04:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
increase as a result of the
 
04:26:30.229 --> 04:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation or as in this case the
 
04:26:32.030 --> 04:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
addition of the fire suppression system
 
04:26:34.149 --> 04:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
so I'm asking you to support this bill
 
04:26:37.969 --> 04:26:37.979 align:start position:0%
to help more more businesses hotels and
 
04:26:39.889 --> 04:26:39.899 align:start position:0%
other businesses install modern fire
 
04:26:42.710 --> 04:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
protections technology and will enable
 
04:26:44.750 --> 04:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
it to keep its occupants in our
 
04:26:46.370 --> 04:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
communities safe from fires in the
 
04:26:46.380 --> 04:26:48.469 align:start position:0%
communities safe from fires in the
future

04:26:48.469 --> 04:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
future
 
04:26:50.330 --> 04:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:26:52.849 --> 04:26:52.859 align:start position:0%
representative stavis
 
04:26:54.410 --> 04:26:54.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:26:56.030 --> 04:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs for taking my
 
04:26:58.610 --> 04:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
question my question has to do with the
 
04:27:02.330 --> 04:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
use of the word or in lines eight and
 
04:27:07.849 --> 04:27:07.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:10.010 --> 04:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
I think you may have just answered in
 
04:27:12.349 --> 04:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
your in your testimony about historic
 
04:27:14.570 --> 04:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
structures if that was what you had in
 
04:27:18.349 --> 04:27:18.359 align:start position:0%
mind that's my first question and my
 
04:27:20.389 --> 04:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
second question has to do with the fact
 
04:27:22.849 --> 04:27:22.859 align:start position:0%
that do you have any concern that using
 
04:27:25.490 --> 04:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
or as opposed to and
 
04:27:28.790 --> 04:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
might result in people
 
04:27:31.849 --> 04:27:31.859 align:start position:0%
converting buildings into warehouses and
 
04:27:34.250 --> 04:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
putting sprinkler systems in them that
 
04:27:35.809 --> 04:27:35.819 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily do anything for
 
04:27:37.790 --> 04:27:37.800 align:start position:0%
Community revitalization but give them
 
04:27:40.130 --> 04:27:40.140 align:start position:0%
tax breaks okay and just in regard to
 
04:27:42.410 --> 04:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
your second question for I have a copy
 
04:27:44.389 --> 04:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
of the bill that doesn't have for some
 
04:27:45.950 --> 04:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
reason doesn't have the same numbering
 
04:27:48.469 --> 04:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
as yours so I can't refer to that but I
 
04:27:50.809 --> 04:27:50.819 align:start position:0%
happy to go back to that in terms of the
 
04:27:52.309 --> 04:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
historic struckers that was the original
 
04:27:55.550 --> 04:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
intent of the um of this incentive and
 
04:27:57.769 --> 04:27:57.779 align:start position:0%
and um oh there we go
 
04:28:00.170 --> 04:28:00.180 align:start position:0%
oh there we go okay do you want to ask
 
04:28:02.929 --> 04:28:02.939 align:start position:0%
me that one again sure it's I line lines
 
04:28:02.939 --> 04:28:03.889 align:start position:0%
me that one again sure it's I line lines
eight

04:28:03.889 --> 04:28:03.899 align:start position:0%
eight
 
04:28:08.990 --> 04:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:11.149 --> 04:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
it's just the use of the word or instead
 
04:28:13.550 --> 04:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
of the use of the word and
 
04:28:16.429 --> 04:28:16.439 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that that's a good point
 
04:28:19.189 --> 04:28:19.199 align:start position:0%
I mean I'd be up I'd be amenable to
 
04:28:21.950 --> 04:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
amending that to Anne and again in terms
 
04:28:24.590 --> 04:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
of the um in terms of the historic
 
04:28:26.570 --> 04:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
structures that was the original intent
 
04:28:28.969 --> 04:28:28.979 align:start position:0%
of um of this the community
 
04:28:32.210 --> 04:28:32.220 align:start position:0%
revitalization tax relief as I said but
 
04:28:34.189 --> 04:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
I think that we have structures in our
 
04:28:35.570 --> 04:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
community are not necessarily enough
 
04:28:37.670 --> 04:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
historic value that that provide a great
 
04:28:39.530 --> 04:28:39.540 align:start position:0%
benefit for example a supermarket
 
04:28:45.290 --> 04:28:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:48.170 --> 04:28:48.180 align:start position:0%
representative treeleven
 
04:28:50.630 --> 04:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair excuse me and thanks
 
04:28:53.269 --> 04:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
for coming to testify I'm wondering
 
04:28:56.389 --> 04:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
who's going to decide
 
04:28:59.030 --> 04:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
um what a fire suppression system is
 
04:29:03.229 --> 04:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
worth in a building and what portion of
 
04:29:07.010 --> 04:29:07.020 align:start position:0%
that worth would go to the taxes
 
04:29:09.290 --> 04:29:09.300 align:start position:0%
either to the tax relief or to the taxes
 
04:29:10.910 --> 04:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
that would be charged after the relief
 
04:29:13.010 --> 04:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
was done the
 
04:29:14.990 --> 04:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
um that's a good question
 
04:29:16.910 --> 04:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
um I would I would make the assumption
 
04:29:19.450 --> 04:29:19.460 align:start position:0%
that the that the cost of the system
 
04:29:22.189 --> 04:29:22.199 align:start position:0%
would be would be what we'd be looking
 
04:29:24.710 --> 04:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
at in terms of the relief
 
04:29:26.870 --> 04:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
um that let's let's just hypothetically
 
04:29:29.149 --> 04:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
say that it was a million dollars on
 
04:29:31.130 --> 04:29:31.140 align:start position:0%
what this would do is the municipality
 
04:29:33.590 --> 04:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
could Grant relief in terms of you're
 
04:29:36.530 --> 04:29:36.540 align:start position:0%
not raising the the um assessed value of
 
04:29:38.269 --> 04:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
the property for another million dollars
 
04:29:40.189 --> 04:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
for up to five years got it and the
 
04:29:41.990 --> 04:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
municipality gets to decide that thank
 
04:29:45.170 --> 04:29:45.180 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
04:29:48.290 --> 04:29:48.300 align:start position:0%
representative yukela
 
04:29:49.969 --> 04:29:49.979 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
 
04:29:49.979 --> 04:29:51.469 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking the
question

04:29:51.469 --> 04:29:51.479 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:29:51.479 --> 04:29:55.429 align:start position:0%
question
um

04:29:55.429 --> 04:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:58.630 --> 04:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
is there anything in this that we're
 
04:30:04.010 --> 04:30:04.020 align:start position:0%
that would limit them to the cost of the
 
04:30:04.020 --> 04:30:05.269 align:start position:0%
that would limit them to the cost of the
um

04:30:05.269 --> 04:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:09.110 --> 04:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
the enhancement or and
 
04:30:11.929 --> 04:30:11.939 align:start position:0%
um is there anything that limits them to
 
04:30:11.939 --> 04:30:13.490 align:start position:0%
um is there anything that limits them to
say

04:30:13.490 --> 04:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:30:15.830 --> 04:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
um determine that
 
04:30:18.229 --> 04:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
having us more buildings with the
 
04:30:20.630 --> 04:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
sprinkler system is there is in the
 
04:30:23.870 --> 04:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
public interest and therefore any
 
04:30:26.870 --> 04:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
business would be able to
 
04:30:31.070 --> 04:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
to have this relief I know shouldered by
 
04:30:33.290 --> 04:30:33.300 align:start position:0%
the the local
 
04:30:35.929 --> 04:30:35.939 align:start position:0%
I I think you put in an application to
 
04:30:37.729 --> 04:30:37.739 align:start position:0%
your municipality and they would make
 
04:30:39.710 --> 04:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
that determination as to whether this is
 
04:30:48.769 --> 04:30:48.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:48.779 --> 04:30:53.170 align:start position:0%
 
no

04:30:53.170 --> 04:30:53.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:55.729 --> 04:30:55.739 align:start position:0%
representative bro
 
04:30:57.950 --> 04:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh
 
04:31:00.530 --> 04:31:00.540 align:start position:0%
thank you representative hello
 
04:31:02.630 --> 04:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
um on line 14 just like uh
 
04:31:05.450 --> 04:31:05.460 align:start position:0%
representative yakala had said the the
 
04:31:07.729 --> 04:31:07.739 align:start position:0%
process for his uh what type of review
 
04:31:10.490 --> 04:31:10.500 align:start position:0%
would be done to uh Grant relief with
 
04:31:13.429 --> 04:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
disco before the select man the fire
 
04:31:15.349 --> 04:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
chief you know what what process would
 
04:31:17.030 --> 04:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
be actually done do you have an idea on
 
04:31:18.530 --> 04:31:18.540 align:start position:0%
that I'm not saying you do but I'm just
 
04:31:20.809 --> 04:31:20.819 align:start position:0%
curious I don't I think that process
 
04:31:22.010 --> 04:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
would depend on the meters probably
 
04:31:23.870 --> 04:31:23.880 align:start position:0%
again there is an application they put
 
04:31:25.490 --> 04:31:25.500 align:start position:0%
it forth and then they would they would
 
04:31:27.590 --> 04:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
make that determination so this is just
 
04:31:29.450 --> 04:31:29.460 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation to go along exactly
 
04:31:31.370 --> 04:31:31.380 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
04:31:35.630 --> 04:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
for the questions I have one quick one
 
04:31:35.640 --> 04:31:36.710 align:start position:0%
for the questions I have one quick one
um

04:31:36.710 --> 04:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:38.809 --> 04:31:38.819 align:start position:0%
it's kind of along the same lines
 
04:31:41.149 --> 04:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
is it my understanding then that the
 
04:31:44.689 --> 04:31:44.699 align:start position:0%
granting of tax relief I see it as maybe
 
04:31:47.689 --> 04:31:47.699 align:start position:0%
being a little subjective is that the
 
04:31:50.030 --> 04:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
case I mean is it
 
04:31:51.769 --> 04:31:51.779 align:start position:0%
the individuals who are going to decide
 
04:31:55.010 --> 04:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
how much and how long to give the tax
 
04:31:57.170 --> 04:31:57.180 align:start position:0%
relief well their bill says is up to
 
04:32:00.410 --> 04:32:00.420 align:start position:0%
five years and uh to my mind I mean like
 
04:32:02.269 --> 04:32:02.279 align:start position:0%
I I use in the other example if you're
 
04:32:04.189 --> 04:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
paying a million dollars for a system
 
04:32:06.830 --> 04:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
you know that's a good basis to decide
 
04:32:09.229 --> 04:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
you know is that enhance the value of
 
04:32:11.210 --> 04:32:11.220 align:start position:0%
the property by a million dollars in
 
04:32:13.210 --> 04:32:13.220 align:start position:0%
terms of tax relief
 
04:32:15.889 --> 04:32:15.899 align:start position:0%
yes I understand that okay
 
04:32:18.530 --> 04:32:18.540 align:start position:0%
as written they're really it's pretty
 
04:32:21.290 --> 04:32:21.300 align:start position:0%
much open to interpretation I would
 
04:32:22.729 --> 04:32:22.739 align:start position:0%
agree with that okay I would agree with
 
04:32:22.739 --> 04:32:23.630 align:start position:0%
agree with that okay I would agree with
this

04:32:23.630 --> 04:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:32:26.210 --> 04:32:26.220 align:start position:0%
represent uh you Keller
 
04:32:29.750 --> 04:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the for taking
 
04:32:34.070 --> 04:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
another question is the
 
04:32:34.080 --> 04:32:34.809 align:start position:0%
another question is the
the

04:32:34.809 --> 04:32:34.819 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:32:37.870 --> 04:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
decision on who gets and how much
 
04:32:42.229 --> 04:32:42.239 align:start position:0%
completely uh dependent on the governing
 
04:32:45.050 --> 04:32:45.060 align:start position:0%
body and the actual taxpayers that are
 
04:32:47.210 --> 04:32:47.220 align:start position:0%
going to have to subsidize this relief
 
04:32:49.729 --> 04:32:49.739 align:start position:0%
are do they have no say in this under
 
04:32:51.590 --> 04:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
under this law
 
04:32:54.590 --> 04:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
well the municipality decides and they
 
04:32:57.410 --> 04:32:57.420 align:start position:0%
are representing their constituents so
 
04:32:59.510 --> 04:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
you know just like any other body makes
 
04:33:01.670 --> 04:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
decisions on behalf of the taxpayers
 
04:33:08.051 --> 04:33:08.061 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:10.551 --> 04:33:10.561 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman Gilman gimme gimme
 
04:33:13.310 --> 04:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
Gilman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:33:15.289 --> 04:33:15.299 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
04:33:18.051 --> 04:33:18.061 align:start position:0%
um I'm very familiar with the 79e and
 
04:33:19.910 --> 04:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
the governing body and making the choice
 
04:33:22.670 --> 04:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
of how many years you get with this um
 
04:33:26.390 --> 04:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
do you think this new change will
 
04:33:29.269 --> 04:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
require re-adoption of 79a because
 
04:33:31.310 --> 04:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
you're adding a significantly different
 
04:33:33.349 --> 04:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
thing to it
 
04:33:35.570 --> 04:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure this is an amendment to
 
04:33:38.449 --> 04:33:38.459 align:start position:0%
that so I'm not sure I answering that
 
04:33:41.570 --> 04:33:41.580 align:start position:0%
question a municipality has to adopt 79e
 
04:33:44.390 --> 04:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
in the process to go through and the
 
04:33:47.631 --> 04:33:47.641 align:start position:0%
number of years and public purpose Etc
 
04:33:50.330 --> 04:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
um but this this change to me is
 
04:33:50.340 --> 04:33:51.109 align:start position:0%
um but this this change to me is
um

04:33:51.109 --> 04:33:51.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:53.029 --> 04:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
kind of substantial because it goes off
 
04:33:55.250 --> 04:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
historic structures and historic
 
04:33:57.289 --> 04:33:57.299 align:start position:0%
districts and you know kind of the aim
 
04:34:00.051 --> 04:34:00.061 align:start position:0%
of reuse of buildings so my question is
 
04:34:02.029 --> 04:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
in your opinion
 
04:34:04.369 --> 04:34:04.379 align:start position:0%
um would this require municipality to
 
04:34:08.090 --> 04:34:08.100 align:start position:0%
re-adopt 79e
 
04:34:10.551 --> 04:34:10.561 align:start position:0%
I'd answered by saying again this is not
 
04:34:13.010 --> 04:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
a mandate it's enabling so if they if
 
04:34:14.869 --> 04:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
they choose to do this there's no
 
04:34:17.150 --> 04:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
mandate for them to do so when we when
 
04:34:19.429 --> 04:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
we insert this amendment okay thank you
 
04:34:19.439 --> 04:34:21.709 align:start position:0%
we insert this amendment okay thank you
okay

04:34:21.709 --> 04:34:21.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:34:23.570 --> 04:34:23.580 align:start position:0%
seeing no other questions thank you very
 
04:34:25.609 --> 04:34:25.619 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony we have one
 
04:34:39.170 --> 04:34:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:42.769 --> 04:34:42.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair my name is Tom zotti
 
04:34:45.109 --> 04:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
I currently serve as the fire chief and
 
04:34:47.150 --> 04:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
Emergency Management director in
 
04:34:47.160 --> 04:34:48.369 align:start position:0%
Emergency Management director in
Wolfeboro

04:34:48.369 --> 04:34:48.379 align:start position:0%
Wolfeboro
 
04:34:51.051 --> 04:34:51.061 align:start position:0%
I've been in the fire service for a few
 
04:34:53.929 --> 04:34:53.939 align:start position:0%
months shy of 33 years all of which is
 
04:34:56.689 --> 04:34:56.699 align:start position:0%
with the town of Wolfeboro
 
04:34:59.029 --> 04:34:59.039 align:start position:0%
um I'm not here today to talk about the
 
04:35:01.250 --> 04:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
technical details of this I'd just like
 
04:35:03.709 --> 04:35:03.719 align:start position:0%
to relate my experience with
 
04:35:05.570 --> 04:35:05.580 align:start position:0%
sprinkler buildings and unsprinkled
 
04:35:08.750 --> 04:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
buildings and so forth if I might
 
04:35:10.970 --> 04:35:10.980 align:start position:0%
um I would like to start
 
04:35:14.929 --> 04:35:14.939 align:start position:0%
by reading a few lines of a report from
 
04:35:16.789 --> 04:35:16.799 align:start position:0%
the National Fire Protection Association
 
04:35:19.730 --> 04:35:19.740 align:start position:0%
called U.S experience with sprinklers it
 
04:35:22.310 --> 04:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
was published in 2021
 
04:35:24.769 --> 04:35:24.779 align:start position:0%
sprinklers reduced the impact of fires
 
04:35:26.869 --> 04:35:26.879 align:start position:0%
compared to reported fires and
 
04:35:28.131 --> 04:35:28.141 align:start position:0%
properties with no automatic
 
04:35:30.051 --> 04:35:30.061 align:start position:0%
extinguishing systems when sprinklers
 
04:35:32.150 --> 04:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
were present the civilian fired death
 
04:35:34.490 --> 04:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
and injury rates per fire were 89
 
04:35:36.470 --> 04:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
percent and 27 percent lower
 
04:35:38.810 --> 04:35:38.820 align:start position:0%
respectively the rate of firefighter
 
04:35:41.990 --> 04:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
injuries per fire was 60 percent lower
 
04:35:44.150 --> 04:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
fire spread was confined to the object
 
04:35:46.490 --> 04:35:46.500 align:start position:0%
or room of origin and 95 percent of
 
04:35:48.289 --> 04:35:48.299 align:start position:0%
reported structure fires in which
 
04:35:50.570 --> 04:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
sprinkler systems were present compared
 
04:35:53.510 --> 04:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
to 71 percent in properties without
 
04:35:55.369 --> 04:35:55.379 align:start position:0%
sprinklers have proven to be reliable in
 
04:35:57.051 --> 04:35:57.061 align:start position:0%
reported structure fires considered
 
04:35:59.631 --> 04:35:59.641 align:start position:0%
large enough to activate them from 2015
 
04:36:02.689 --> 04:36:02.699 align:start position:0%
to 2019 sprinklers operated in 92
 
04:36:04.609 --> 04:36:04.619 align:start position:0%
percent of such fires and were effective
 
04:36:06.650 --> 04:36:06.660 align:start position:0%
at controlling the fire and 96 percent
 
04:36:08.449 --> 04:36:08.459 align:start position:0%
of the incidents in which they operate
 
04:36:11.209 --> 04:36:11.219 align:start position:0%
it overall sprinkler systems operated
 
04:36:13.250 --> 04:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
and were effective in 88 percent of the
 
04:36:14.750 --> 04:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
fires considered large enough to
 
04:36:15.949 --> 04:36:15.959 align:start position:0%
activate them
 
04:36:18.230 --> 04:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
one sprinkler is usually enough to
 
04:36:21.051 --> 04:36:21.061 align:start position:0%
control a fire and 77 percent of the
 
04:36:22.490 --> 04:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
structure fires where sprinklers
 
04:36:25.849 --> 04:36:25.859 align:start position:0%
operated only one operated and 97
 
04:36:29.150 --> 04:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
percent five or fewer operated and 99 10
 
04:36:31.369 --> 04:36:31.379 align:start position:0%
or fewer operated
 
04:36:36.410 --> 04:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
that said I I think I hope at this point
 
04:36:40.010 --> 04:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
we are not arguing whether sprinklers
 
04:36:41.990 --> 04:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
are effective or not I think there's a
 
04:36:44.570 --> 04:36:44.580 align:start position:0%
general consensus that they work
 
04:36:48.109 --> 04:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
my experience in Wolfeboro as many of
 
04:36:50.510 --> 04:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
you I'm sure aware we have a fairly
 
04:36:54.650 --> 04:36:54.660 align:start position:0%
compact older downtown area and also a
 
04:36:56.390 --> 04:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
relatively rural
 
04:37:00.230 --> 04:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
um outside of town if you will
 
04:37:00.240 --> 04:37:01.010 align:start position:0%
um outside of town if you will
um

04:37:01.010 --> 04:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:04.250 --> 04:37:04.260 align:start position:0%
but based on our size we're roughly 6
 
04:37:07.670 --> 04:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
400 under the the latest census with an
 
04:37:10.310 --> 04:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
estimate of 18 to 20 000 folks
 
04:37:10.320 --> 04:37:12.170 align:start position:0%
estimate of 18 to 20 000 folks
seasonally

04:37:12.170 --> 04:37:12.180 align:start position:0%
seasonally
 
04:37:15.109 --> 04:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
um we don't see that many buildings
 
04:37:16.990 --> 04:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
proposed or even
 
04:37:19.670 --> 04:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
renovated or rehabilitated
 
04:37:22.429 --> 04:37:22.439 align:start position:0%
that are large enough or of a type of
 
04:37:24.949 --> 04:37:24.959 align:start position:0%
use that would trigger Fire and Building
 
04:37:27.830 --> 04:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
Code requirements to be sprinklered we
 
04:37:30.830 --> 04:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
do have them and we do see them but not
 
04:37:32.990 --> 04:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
nearly as much as a Concord or a
 
04:37:36.289 --> 04:37:36.299 align:start position:0%
Manchester or a Portsmouth perhaps
 
04:37:38.810 --> 04:37:38.820 align:start position:0%
that said in looking back at the
 
04:37:42.289 --> 04:37:42.299 align:start position:0%
statistics we mentioned earlier
 
04:37:42.299 --> 04:37:43.849 align:start position:0%
statistics we mentioned earlier
um

04:37:43.849 --> 04:37:43.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:46.131 --> 04:37:46.141 align:start position:0%
in our smaller tend to be smaller
 
04:37:50.810 --> 04:37:50.820 align:start position:0%
buildings as time has gone by and
 
04:37:52.670 --> 04:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
maybe there had been a minor renovation
 
04:37:55.369 --> 04:37:55.379 align:start position:0%
or a change of use or a new tenant or
 
04:37:56.990 --> 04:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
something like that I've always kind of
 
04:37:58.551 --> 04:37:58.561 align:start position:0%
made it my
 
04:38:01.970 --> 04:38:01.980 align:start position:0%
mission to hopefully nudge the owner or
 
04:38:03.830 --> 04:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
operator or at least have them think
 
04:38:05.929 --> 04:38:05.939 align:start position:0%
about you know would it be worth
 
04:38:08.150 --> 04:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
sprinkling this building nobody ever
 
04:38:10.250 --> 04:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
argues sprinklers don't work they argue
 
04:38:11.810 --> 04:38:11.820 align:start position:0%
they cost too much
 
04:38:14.470 --> 04:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
it's always frankly an economic
 
04:38:17.869 --> 04:38:17.879 align:start position:0%
consideration they're looking for as as
 
04:38:20.449 --> 04:38:20.459 align:start position:0%
you well know return on investment or
 
04:38:22.429 --> 04:38:22.439 align:start position:0%
over how many years will I see a return
 
04:38:25.010 --> 04:38:25.020 align:start position:0%
on my investment what other
 
04:38:27.470 --> 04:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
dollars and cents benefits will we see
 
04:38:29.029 --> 04:38:29.039 align:start position:0%
from that
 
04:38:31.910 --> 04:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
legislation like this I think in my
 
04:38:31.920 --> 04:38:32.869 align:start position:0%
legislation like this I think in my
opinion

04:38:32.869 --> 04:38:32.879 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
04:38:35.869 --> 04:38:35.879 align:start position:0%
gives us one more tool in the toolbox to
 
04:38:35.879 --> 04:38:37.189 align:start position:0%
gives us one more tool in the toolbox to
make

04:38:37.189 --> 04:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
make
 
04:38:39.529 --> 04:38:39.539 align:start position:0%
to allow business owners and operators
 
04:38:41.750 --> 04:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
to see the benefit
 
04:38:41.760 --> 04:38:43.490 align:start position:0%
to see the benefit
of

04:38:43.490 --> 04:38:43.500 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:38:43.500 --> 04:38:44.090 align:start position:0%
of
um

04:38:44.090 --> 04:38:44.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:46.250 --> 04:38:46.260 align:start position:0%
sprinkler installation particularly in
 
04:38:46.260 --> 04:38:47.750 align:start position:0%
sprinkler installation particularly in
existing

04:38:47.750 --> 04:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
existing
 
04:38:47.760 --> 04:38:49.029 align:start position:0%
existing
structures

04:38:49.029 --> 04:38:49.039 align:start position:0%
structures
 
04:38:53.330 --> 04:38:53.340 align:start position:0%
to be able to run the numbers and and
 
04:38:57.830 --> 04:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
feel that it's a cost-effective
 
04:38:57.840 --> 04:38:58.490 align:start position:0%
feel that it's a cost-effective
um

04:38:58.490 --> 04:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:01.250 --> 04:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
system to install I would point out too
 
04:39:02.650 --> 04:39:02.660 align:start position:0%
that as I understand
 
04:39:06.890 --> 04:39:06.900 align:start position:0%
on the federal level the cares act has
 
04:39:06.900 --> 04:39:07.789 align:start position:0%
on the federal level the cares act has
um

04:39:07.789 --> 04:39:07.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:11.051 --> 04:39:11.061 align:start position:0%
enabled business owners to use an
 
04:39:14.150 --> 04:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
accelerated depreciation schedule
 
04:39:17.990 --> 04:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
so my to my way of thinking the enabling
 
04:39:21.349 --> 04:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
legislation at the local level plus what
 
04:39:22.970 --> 04:39:22.980 align:start position:0%
might be available at the federal level
 
04:39:26.390 --> 04:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
may be enough to put some of those
 
04:39:28.010 --> 04:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
business owners who might be on the
 
04:39:28.020 --> 04:39:28.810 align:start position:0%
business owners who might be on the
fence

04:39:28.810 --> 04:39:28.820 align:start position:0%
fence
 
04:39:32.510 --> 04:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
show them enough benefit to make it them
 
04:39:35.269 --> 04:39:35.279 align:start position:0%
feel it's worth their while to
 
04:39:35.279 --> 04:39:36.349 align:start position:0%
feel it's worth their while to
um

04:39:36.349 --> 04:39:36.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:38.810 --> 04:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
to install sprinklers I know Fire
 
04:39:40.490 --> 04:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
Marshall Toomey is here and he can
 
04:39:43.910 --> 04:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
probably go way far out further into the
 
04:39:46.130 --> 04:39:46.140 align:start position:0%
weeds than I can on on some of these
 
04:39:49.010 --> 04:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
things but to sum up
 
04:39:51.890 --> 04:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
um I think this is just again another
 
04:39:53.868 --> 04:39:53.878 align:start position:0%
tool in the toolbox to incentivize
 
04:39:57.288 --> 04:39:57.298 align:start position:0%
business owners and operators to
 
04:39:59.510 --> 04:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
do something that I think again we all
 
04:40:01.788 --> 04:40:01.798 align:start position:0%
agree works it's just if we can bring
 
04:40:05.030 --> 04:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
the cost to a manageable level it stands
 
04:40:08.330 --> 04:40:08.340 align:start position:0%
to reason we'll see see more of them
 
04:40:10.430 --> 04:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
um and at the same time as I as I read
 
04:40:13.070 --> 04:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
it this would allow the the municipality
 
04:40:14.330 --> 04:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
to decide
 
04:40:17.090 --> 04:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
how much and and to some degree for how
 
04:40:20.990 --> 04:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
long and what sort of form that may take
 
04:40:23.330 --> 04:40:23.340 align:start position:0%
um and I think that is an appropriate
 
04:40:25.010 --> 04:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
approach and I'd be happy to try to
 
04:40:26.990 --> 04:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
answer any questions I might
 
04:40:28.310 --> 04:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
04:40:31.490 --> 04:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
representative true 11. thank you thank
 
04:40:33.110 --> 04:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thanks for taking my
 
04:40:36.890 --> 04:40:36.900 align:start position:0%
question do you have um any idea as to
 
04:40:38.990 --> 04:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
the insurance costs
 
04:40:40.970 --> 04:40:40.980 align:start position:0%
for a building that is sprinkled versus
 
04:40:42.948 --> 04:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
a building the same building that's not
 
04:40:42.958 --> 04:40:44.390 align:start position:0%
a building the same building that's not
sprinkled

04:40:44.390 --> 04:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
sprinkled
 
04:40:45.770 --> 04:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
I'm not in a position to give you
 
04:40:47.448 --> 04:40:47.458 align:start position:0%
dollars and cents but I know as I've
 
04:40:51.410 --> 04:40:51.420 align:start position:0%
discussed it with people over the years
 
04:40:53.630 --> 04:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
um and I say that with the understanding
 
04:40:55.550 --> 04:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
that the last few years may have thrown
 
04:40:56.990 --> 04:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
off some of these numbers both on the
 
04:40:58.368 --> 04:40:58.378 align:start position:0%
insurance side and on the construction
 
04:41:00.288 --> 04:41:00.298 align:start position:0%
side right
 
04:41:03.230 --> 04:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
um the numbers I would be here would be
 
04:41:05.150 --> 04:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
and again I believe this was more in new
 
04:41:07.368 --> 04:41:07.378 align:start position:0%
construction but it was a six to eight
 
04:41:12.050 --> 04:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
ish year payback in terms of reduction
 
04:41:14.448 --> 04:41:14.458 align:start position:0%
on an insurance premium versus un
 
04:41:16.250 --> 04:41:16.260 align:start position:0%
sprinklered and and that sort of thing
 
04:41:19.310 --> 04:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
again with current conditions and stuff
 
04:41:21.530 --> 04:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that has changed one way or the
 
04:41:23.270 --> 04:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
other perfectly fine that's all I need
 
04:41:26.150 --> 04:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
at ballpark thanks representative Cahill
 
04:41:27.590 --> 04:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:41:29.030 --> 04:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
my question
 
04:41:30.288 --> 04:41:30.298 align:start position:0%
um so I'm a member of the engineers
 
04:41:32.270 --> 04:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
Union I've been working down in Boston
 
04:41:35.510 --> 04:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
for decades have you given any thought
 
04:41:37.670 --> 04:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
to the load on your department with
 
04:41:39.530 --> 04:41:39.540 align:start position:0%
testing these systems like monthly and
 
04:41:41.750 --> 04:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
yearly if all of these systems were
 
04:41:43.190 --> 04:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
installed as your department ready to
 
04:41:45.170 --> 04:41:45.180 align:start position:0%
handle that kind of load
 
04:41:47.330 --> 04:41:47.340 align:start position:0%
as a general statement
 
04:41:50.270 --> 04:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
um we wouldn't be doing the testing the
 
04:41:52.250 --> 04:41:52.260 align:start position:0%
business owner operator would contract
 
04:41:53.868 --> 04:41:53.878 align:start position:0%
with with a company that would do the
 
04:41:56.570 --> 04:41:56.580 align:start position:0%
actual testing we do in many cases
 
04:41:58.970 --> 04:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
witness that testing and that sort of
 
04:41:58.980 --> 04:42:00.350 align:start position:0%
witness that testing and that sort of
thing

04:42:00.350 --> 04:42:00.360 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:42:02.830 --> 04:42:02.840 align:start position:0%
um it would take some
 
04:42:05.750 --> 04:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
reorganization perhaps I don't I don't
 
04:42:08.570 --> 04:42:08.580 align:start position:0%
see it resulting in necessarily having
 
04:42:11.090 --> 04:42:11.100 align:start position:0%
to hire new positions or anything again
 
04:42:12.890 --> 04:42:12.900 align:start position:0%
I'm going from my experience in the town
 
04:42:14.570 --> 04:42:14.580 align:start position:0%
the size of Wolfeboro I obviously can't
 
04:42:17.930 --> 04:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
speak for another municipality
 
04:42:22.070 --> 04:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
um we do also currently for uh
 
04:42:23.930 --> 04:42:23.940 align:start position:0%
routine maintenance and testing and that
 
04:42:25.730 --> 04:42:25.740 align:start position:0%
sort of thing except the signed
 
04:42:27.470 --> 04:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
documentation from the sprinkler company
 
04:42:29.510 --> 04:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
as to what testing they did what the
 
04:42:33.128 --> 04:42:33.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:35.510 --> 04:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative man chaputi
 
04:42:35.520 --> 04:42:39.190 align:start position:0%
representative man chaputi
foreign

04:42:39.190 --> 04:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:42.470 --> 04:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
looking the other way thank you thank
 
04:42:44.868 --> 04:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair uh thank you for taking my
 
04:42:48.288 --> 04:42:48.298 align:start position:0%
question you um spoke extensively about
 
04:42:51.350 --> 04:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
the sprinkler system what about the
 
04:42:54.230 --> 04:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
other fire suppression system how does
 
04:42:56.270 --> 04:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
that benefit or
 
04:42:59.750 --> 04:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
you know the bill alludes to that are
 
04:43:03.410 --> 04:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
there other more efficient less costly
 
04:43:06.770 --> 04:43:06.780 align:start position:0%
or more costly but more efficient system
 
04:43:06.780 --> 04:43:08.628 align:start position:0%
or more costly but more efficient system
uh

04:43:08.628 --> 04:43:08.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:43:11.868 --> 04:43:11.878 align:start position:0%
I think in general when we speak to fire
 
04:43:13.430 --> 04:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
suppression systems I think the
 
04:43:14.690 --> 04:43:14.700 align:start position:0%
assumption is we're talking about
 
04:43:16.970 --> 04:43:16.980 align:start position:0%
building sprinkler systems obviously
 
04:43:19.690 --> 04:43:19.700 align:start position:0%
there are more limited area
 
04:43:22.190 --> 04:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
extinguishing systems if you will for
 
04:43:25.128 --> 04:43:25.138 align:start position:0%
example in the ventilation Hood in a
 
04:43:27.288 --> 04:43:27.298 align:start position:0%
commercial cooking operation and that
 
04:43:30.170 --> 04:43:30.180 align:start position:0%
sort of thing I I as I read this again
 
04:43:32.330 --> 04:43:32.340 align:start position:0%
as a
 
04:43:34.610 --> 04:43:34.620 align:start position:0%
more a lay person when it comes to
 
04:43:34.620 --> 04:43:36.708 align:start position:0%
more a lay person when it comes to
legislation

04:43:36.708 --> 04:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:43:40.730 --> 04:43:40.740 align:start position:0%
um I mean I read that to the it it kind
 
04:43:43.788 --> 04:43:43.798 align:start position:0%
of refers to sprinklers
 
04:43:46.910 --> 04:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
um if uh this is written in a broad
 
04:43:51.050 --> 04:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
enough fashion that it would include
 
04:43:53.570 --> 04:43:53.580 align:start position:0%
um for example the the suppression in a
 
04:43:55.430 --> 04:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
ventilation Hood
 
04:43:57.470 --> 04:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
um it's something for a municipality to
 
04:43:59.810 --> 04:43:59.820 align:start position:0%
consider but typically that is driven by
 
04:44:01.190 --> 04:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
a code requirement either you have to
 
04:44:03.948 --> 04:44:03.958 align:start position:0%
have it or you don't have to have it
 
04:44:05.930 --> 04:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
um if it meets certain requirements you
 
04:44:07.910 --> 04:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
would have to install the suppression
 
04:44:07.920 --> 04:44:09.128 align:start position:0%
would have to install the suppression
system

04:44:09.128 --> 04:44:09.138 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:44:13.330 --> 04:44:13.340 align:start position:0%
by the letter of the code I see this
 
04:44:15.948 --> 04:44:15.958 align:start position:0%
legislation as benefiting a town like
 
04:44:18.230 --> 04:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
Wolfeboro where we have those sir I
 
04:44:21.590 --> 04:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
think you've answered his her question
 
04:44:23.628 --> 04:44:23.638 align:start position:0%
uh representative Hicks thank you Mr
 
04:44:25.250 --> 04:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
chair thank you chief for taking the
 
04:44:25.260 --> 04:44:26.330 align:start position:0%
chair thank you chief for taking the
question

04:44:26.330 --> 04:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:44:28.430 --> 04:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
um simple question knowing the compact
 
04:44:29.750 --> 04:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
nature of your downtown and
 
04:44:33.230 --> 04:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
interconnected buildings do you see Town
 
04:44:37.128 --> 04:44:37.138 align:start position:0%
leaders advocating for this as a benefit
 
04:44:41.330 --> 04:44:41.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:44.090 --> 04:44:44.100 align:start position:0%
uh I I think it would be a good subject
 
04:44:46.550 --> 04:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
for discussion um as you heard
 
04:44:49.250 --> 04:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
one of the sponsors earlier we did two
 
04:44:51.288 --> 04:44:51.298 align:start position:0%
weeks ago have a significant fire in
 
04:44:54.050 --> 04:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
town which has as you might imagine
 
04:44:58.070 --> 04:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
resulted in some discussion
 
04:44:59.868 --> 04:44:59.878 align:start position:0%
um I I don't want to put myself in a
 
04:45:01.490 --> 04:45:01.500 align:start position:0%
position of speaking for the board of
 
04:45:04.128 --> 04:45:04.138 align:start position:0%
selectment or anybody like that but this
 
04:45:06.530 --> 04:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
has been obviously a topic of a lot of
 
04:45:08.690 --> 04:45:08.700 align:start position:0%
conversation in the last few weeks
 
04:45:08.700 --> 04:45:10.610 align:start position:0%
conversation in the last few weeks
especially

04:45:10.610 --> 04:45:10.620 align:start position:0%
especially
 
04:45:13.550 --> 04:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
um so my my
 
04:45:16.250 --> 04:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
instinct is that if this sort of
 
04:45:19.128 --> 04:45:19.138 align:start position:0%
legislation were enacted and that could
 
04:45:19.138 --> 04:45:20.868 align:start position:0%
legislation were enacted and that could
become

04:45:20.868 --> 04:45:20.878 align:start position:0%
become
 
04:45:24.230 --> 04:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
um a possibility it would certainly
 
04:45:27.050 --> 04:45:27.060 align:start position:0%
um generate discussion as to whether or
 
04:45:28.670 --> 04:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
not it was appropriate for wolfborough
 
04:45:31.910 --> 04:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
to adopt a set of guidelines to to do
 
04:45:34.190 --> 04:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
that I I would
 
04:45:37.550 --> 04:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
um if this were successful I would ask
 
04:45:39.470 --> 04:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
them to at least consider it again I
 
04:45:40.430 --> 04:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to put words in somebody
 
04:45:42.650 --> 04:45:42.660 align:start position:0%
else's mouth but we'd certainly want to
 
04:45:45.830 --> 04:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:45.840 --> 04:45:47.690 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:45:47.690 --> 04:45:47.700 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:45:49.910 --> 04:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:45:52.490 --> 04:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
taking my question so in regard to these
 
04:45:53.930 --> 04:45:53.940 align:start position:0%
types of fires that you're talking about
 
04:45:56.208 --> 04:45:56.218 align:start position:0%
you your department responds Lakes
 
04:45:58.490 --> 04:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
Region Mutual Aid response how much does
 
04:46:01.550 --> 04:46:01.560 align:start position:0%
that typically cost to respond to
 
04:46:02.930 --> 04:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
something like that as opposed to you
 
04:46:05.150 --> 04:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
know like the offset and taxes that you
 
04:46:08.030 --> 04:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
would end up I I guess I'm not in a
 
04:46:09.708 --> 04:46:09.718 align:start position:0%
position to give you actual dollars and
 
04:46:12.590 --> 04:46:12.600 align:start position:0%
cents but as you can imagine
 
04:46:12.600 --> 04:46:13.430 align:start position:0%
cents but as you can imagine
um

04:46:13.430 --> 04:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:16.190 --> 04:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh again I'll use the recent fire in
 
04:46:19.310 --> 04:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
Wolfeboro as an example we I estimate we
 
04:46:23.030 --> 04:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
had approximately a a hundred responders
 
04:46:25.070 --> 04:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
to the scene and when I say responders
 
04:46:27.288 --> 04:46:27.298 align:start position:0%
I'm not just talking about firefighters
 
04:46:29.570 --> 04:46:29.580 align:start position:0%
who are most of our town Highway
 
04:46:32.030 --> 04:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
Department was there to help us our
 
04:46:33.770 --> 04:46:33.780 align:start position:0%
Municipal electric Department was there
 
04:46:36.288 --> 04:46:36.298 align:start position:0%
our water treatment plant operator was
 
04:46:38.448 --> 04:46:38.458 align:start position:0%
there when and you could have knocked me
 
04:46:40.128 --> 04:46:40.138 align:start position:0%
over with a feather when he said we
 
04:46:41.628 --> 04:46:41.638 align:start position:0%
can't sustain this we got to do
 
04:46:43.788 --> 04:46:43.798 align:start position:0%
something different
 
04:46:45.788 --> 04:46:45.798 align:start position:0%
um so if you take
 
04:46:48.470 --> 04:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
that number of people
 
04:46:50.570 --> 04:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
um many of the Departments around us are
 
04:46:52.250 --> 04:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
set up similar to the way we are as
 
04:46:53.930 --> 04:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
combination departments some full-time
 
04:46:58.070 --> 04:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
people some part-time call or volunteers
 
04:46:59.690 --> 04:46:59.700 align:start position:0%
and you start adding up those numbers
 
04:47:02.690 --> 04:47:02.700 align:start position:0%
it's a significant number I really don't
 
04:47:10.850 --> 04:47:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:12.830 --> 04:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no more questions thank you
 
04:47:14.868 --> 04:47:14.878 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony I have no
 
04:47:17.628 --> 04:47:17.638 align:start position:0%
more pink cards on the blue sheet I have
 
04:47:19.550 --> 04:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
three who have signed in two of them
 
04:47:19.560 --> 04:47:20.750 align:start position:0%
three who have signed in two of them
were

04:47:20.750 --> 04:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:47:25.250 --> 04:47:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:30.708 --> 04:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
and Herring on 273 uh 265 is closed
 
04:47:34.570 --> 04:47:34.580 align:start position:0%
opened up at hearing on HB 273 requiring
 
04:47:37.490 --> 04:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
composting and waste recycling to be
 
04:48:03.230 --> 04:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:03.240 --> 04:48:07.030 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:48:07.030 --> 04:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:09.708 --> 04:48:09.718 align:start position:0%
second we have the wrong
 
04:48:14.810 --> 04:48:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:36.050 --> 04:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:39.890 --> 04:48:39.900 align:start position:0%
okay representative Gallagher you're up
 
04:48:41.868 --> 04:48:41.878 align:start position:0%
hi so I'm
 
04:48:44.930 --> 04:48:44.940 align:start position:0%
uh representative Eric Gallagher from
 
04:48:48.288 --> 04:48:48.298 align:start position:0%
Concord Ward 6 which is Meramec County
 
04:48:52.190 --> 04:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
District 20. I'm here to introduce
 
04:48:55.610 --> 04:48:55.620 align:start position:0%
House Bill 273 and that requiring
 
04:48:57.410 --> 04:48:57.420 align:start position:0%
composting and waste recycling to be
 
04:48:58.970 --> 04:48:58.980 align:start position:0%
made available
 
04:49:01.430 --> 04:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
to residents of public housing
 
04:49:01.440 --> 04:49:03.050 align:start position:0%
to residents of public housing
um

04:49:03.050 --> 04:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:05.810 --> 04:49:05.820 align:start position:0%
so this is a bill
 
04:49:05.820 --> 04:49:08.570 align:start position:0%
so this is a bill
I

04:49:08.570 --> 04:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:49:08.580 --> 04:49:09.470 align:start position:0%
I
um

04:49:09.470 --> 04:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:09.480 --> 04:49:10.670 align:start position:0%
um
a

04:49:10.670 --> 04:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:49:14.750 --> 04:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
brought before this committee last term
 
04:49:14.760 --> 04:49:16.490 align:start position:0%
brought before this committee last term
um

04:49:16.490 --> 04:49:16.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:19.070 --> 04:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
and we
 
04:49:23.208 --> 04:49:23.218 align:start position:0%
were we ended up referring it to interim
 
04:49:23.218 --> 04:49:24.310 align:start position:0%
were we ended up referring it to interim
study

04:49:24.310 --> 04:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
study
 
04:49:26.930 --> 04:49:26.940 align:start position:0%
because there are some more
 
04:49:31.010 --> 04:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
work that need to be do done on it um
 
04:49:34.368 --> 04:49:34.378 align:start position:0%
so yeah I had um but then we'd never
 
04:49:38.090 --> 04:49:38.100 align:start position:0%
actually did the studying so my
 
04:49:42.288 --> 04:49:42.298 align:start position:0%
intention was to um turn this bill into
 
04:49:46.850 --> 04:49:46.860 align:start position:0%
a study committee for this this time
 
04:49:50.868 --> 04:49:50.878 align:start position:0%
around but it looks like OLS didn't
 
04:49:53.628 --> 04:49:53.638 align:start position:0%
actually do that for me
 
04:49:53.638 --> 04:49:54.770 align:start position:0%
actually do that for me
um

04:49:54.770 --> 04:49:54.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:54.780 --> 04:49:58.190 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:49:58.190 --> 04:49:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:58.200 --> 04:49:59.690 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:49:59.690 --> 04:49:59.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:03.650 --> 04:50:03.660 align:start position:0%
yeah I I did message them saying
 
04:50:05.690 --> 04:50:05.700 align:start position:0%
um I want this to be a study committee
 
04:50:07.788 --> 04:50:07.798 align:start position:0%
and they said yep we've got your request
 
04:50:10.070 --> 04:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to do that but then it looks
 
04:50:11.448 --> 04:50:11.458 align:start position:0%
like they never actually followed
 
04:50:14.208 --> 04:50:14.218 align:start position:0%
through so um
 
04:50:16.070 --> 04:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
04:50:18.230 --> 04:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
since this bill
 
04:50:22.850 --> 04:50:22.860 align:start position:0%
isn't really what I asked for
 
04:50:25.550 --> 04:50:25.560 align:start position:0%
um and I um I I would be perfectly fine
 
04:50:28.970 --> 04:50:28.980 align:start position:0%
if you just found it Ito if you want
 
04:50:31.670 --> 04:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not really going to spend
 
04:50:35.448 --> 04:50:35.458 align:start position:0%
uh too much time uh defending it since
 
04:50:38.510 --> 04:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
it's not what I asked for if the sponsor
 
04:50:45.910 --> 04:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:49.190 --> 04:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
I don't think we can do that today but
 
04:50:52.430 --> 04:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
uh if that's the end of your testimony
 
04:50:56.570 --> 04:50:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:59.270 --> 04:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
and thanks representative Gallagher
 
04:51:01.910 --> 04:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
um would another option be to say send
 
04:51:03.708 --> 04:51:03.718 align:start position:0%
it to a study committee this time and
 
04:51:05.990 --> 04:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
really have a committee or well yes
 
04:51:07.550 --> 04:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
another option could be to vote to
 
04:51:09.708 --> 04:51:09.718 align:start position:0%
retain it I think interim studies for
 
04:51:11.868 --> 04:51:11.878 align:start position:0%
the second year of the term yes thank
 
04:51:13.610 --> 04:51:13.620 align:start position:0%
you yeah
 
04:51:13.620 --> 04:51:16.190 align:start position:0%
you yeah
um

04:51:16.190 --> 04:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:19.128 --> 04:51:19.138 align:start position:0%
any further questions any nuns thank you
 
04:51:23.288 --> 04:51:23.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:29.208 --> 04:51:29.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:30.948 --> 04:51:30.958 align:start position:0%

Environmental Services uh
 
04:52:19.368 --> 04:52:19.378 align:start position:0%
I guess the testimony that I was going
 
04:52:20.990 --> 04:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
to provide is pretty much moot at this
 
04:52:23.690 --> 04:52:23.700 align:start position:0%
point if the sponsor has decided to not
 
04:52:23.700 --> 04:52:25.128 align:start position:0%
point if the sponsor has decided to not
uh

04:52:25.128 --> 04:52:25.138 align:start position:0%

04:52:35.628 --> 04:52:35.638 align:start position:0%
question uh the I know it's not in this
 
04:52:40.368 --> 04:52:40.378 align:start position:0%
committee HB 300 would that bring in
 
04:52:40.378 --> 04:52:42.410 align:start position:0%
committee HB 300 would that bring in
uh

04:52:42.410 --> 04:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:52:45.470 --> 04:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
Waste Management to Across the state if
 
04:52:47.030 --> 04:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
that goes through
 
04:52:48.110 --> 04:52:48.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:52:50.150 --> 04:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
representative the there is another bill
 
04:52:51.890 --> 04:52:51.900 align:start position:0%
that the committee may be interested in
 
04:52:53.590 --> 04:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
it's HB 300
 
04:52:57.948 --> 04:52:57.958 align:start position:0%
which seeks to establish a food waste
 
04:52:59.868 --> 04:52:59.878 align:start position:0%
disposal ban for the State of New
 
04:53:01.448 --> 04:53:01.458 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that would affect
 
04:53:04.970 --> 04:53:04.980 align:start position:0%
primarily the largest commercial food
 
04:53:07.010 --> 04:53:07.020 align:start position:0%
waste generators in the state with the
 
04:53:09.770 --> 04:53:09.780 align:start position:0%
intention that that would create more
 
04:53:09.780 --> 04:53:11.050 align:start position:0%
intention that that would create more
um

04:53:11.050 --> 04:53:11.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:53:14.030 --> 04:53:14.040 align:start position:0%

to handle food waste for composting or
 
04:53:18.590 --> 04:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
anaerobic digestion so that the
 
04:53:20.650 --> 04:53:20.660 align:start position:0%
intention there is that that bill would
 
04:53:23.990 --> 04:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
you know create more of an atmosphere
 
04:53:25.368 --> 04:53:25.378 align:start position:0%
where composting would be more
 
04:53:25.378 --> 04:53:26.390 align:start position:0%
where composting would be more
accessible

04:53:26.390 --> 04:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
accessible
 
04:53:26.400 --> 04:53:27.770 align:start position:0%
accessible
correct

04:53:27.770 --> 04:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:53:29.090 --> 04:53:29.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:53:30.890 --> 04:53:30.900 align:start position:0%

04:53:34.250 --> 04:53:34.260 align:start position:0%
the testimony I have no more pink cards
 
04:53:40.070 --> 04:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:42.590 --> 04:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
and we will open uh on that one there
 
04:53:45.288 --> 04:53:45.298 align:start position:0%
were no sign-ins on the blue sheet
 
04:53:47.690 --> 04:53:47.700 align:start position:0%
we'll open up the our last hearing of
 
04:53:51.530 --> 04:53:51.540 align:start position:0%
the day HB 237 relative to the date of
 
04:53:56.570 --> 04:53:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:59.510 --> 04:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
and we recognize

thank you Mr chairman an honorable
 
04:54:18.350 --> 04:54:18.360 align:start position:0%
committee members as the prime sponsor I

appreciate the opportunity to introduce
 
04:54:24.110 --> 04:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
to you today House Bill 237 for the
 
04:54:26.930 --> 04:54:26.940 align:start position:0%
record I am representative Diane power I
 
04:54:29.090 --> 04:54:29.100 align:start position:0%
represent the towns of Brookline Mason
 
04:54:31.550 --> 04:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
and Greenville in Hillsborough County
 
04:54:35.208 --> 04:54:35.218 align:start position:0%
District 36. there are three main points
 
04:54:37.730 --> 04:54:37.740 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to make today first what
 
04:54:40.190 --> 04:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
does the bill do second why is this bill
 
04:54:42.470 --> 04:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
needed and third how does the bill
 
04:54:44.570 --> 04:54:44.580 align:start position:0%
address the issue
 
04:54:47.750 --> 04:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
first what does this bill do this is a
 
04:54:49.550 --> 04:54:49.560 align:start position:0%
straightforward bill that clearly
 
04:54:51.830 --> 04:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
establishes a date of assessed
 
04:54:54.170 --> 04:54:54.180 align:start position:0%
evaluation for the purpose of
 
04:54:56.750 --> 04:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
determining eligibility for certain
 
04:55:00.530 --> 04:55:00.540 align:start position:0%
property tax exemptions namely exemption
 
04:55:04.030 --> 04:55:04.040 align:start position:0%
for the disabled RSA 72 colon
 
04:55:07.610 --> 04:55:07.620 align:start position:0%
37-b exemption for deaf or severely
 
04:55:11.530 --> 04:55:11.540 align:start position:0%
hearing impaired person RSA 72 colon
 
04:55:18.708 --> 04:55:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:21.830 --> 04:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
second why is this bill needed under
 
04:55:24.530 --> 04:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
current statute a property owner may be
 
04:55:26.270 --> 04:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
eligible for these property tax
 
04:55:29.090 --> 04:55:29.100 align:start position:0%
exemptions based on their income and
 
04:55:32.390 --> 04:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
assets the application window begins on
 
04:55:35.750 --> 04:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
January 1st and extends to the statutory
 
04:55:39.050 --> 04:55:39.060 align:start position:0%
filing deadline of April 15th of the
 
04:55:40.250 --> 04:55:40.260 align:start position:0%
same year
 
04:55:42.230 --> 04:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of evaluating the
 
04:55:45.110 --> 04:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
applicant's income statute clearly
 
04:55:48.230 --> 04:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
defines the time frame as the prior
 
04:55:51.890 --> 04:55:51.900 align:start position:0%
calendar year however for the purpose of
 
04:55:54.110 --> 04:55:54.120 align:start position:0%
evaluating the applicant's level of
 
04:55:57.590 --> 04:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
assets the time frame is at the time of
 
04:55:57.600 --> 04:55:58.970 align:start position:0%
assets the time frame is at the time of
application

04:55:58.970 --> 04:55:58.980 align:start position:0%
application
 
04:56:02.448 --> 04:56:02.458 align:start position:0%
this results in a total of 105 days from
 
04:56:06.230 --> 04:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
January 1st through April 15th for a
 
04:56:09.650 --> 04:56:09.660 align:start position:0%
municipality to measure one's assets
 
04:56:12.770 --> 04:56:12.780 align:start position:0%
clearly this creates an inconsistent in
 
04:56:15.890 --> 04:56:15.900 align:start position:0%
inconsistency as well as unequal
 
04:56:18.770 --> 04:56:18.780 align:start position:0%
treatment both within a municipality as
 
04:56:20.930 --> 04:56:20.940 align:start position:0%
well as across the state
 
04:56:23.750 --> 04:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
and third how does this bill address the
 
04:56:23.760 --> 04:56:24.708 align:start position:0%
and third how does this bill address the
issue

04:56:24.708 --> 04:56:24.718 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:56:27.708 --> 04:56:27.718 align:start position:0%
this bill clearly establishes the date
 
04:56:30.350 --> 04:56:30.360 align:start position:0%
of December 31st in the calendar year
 
04:56:33.350 --> 04:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
preceding said April 1st for the
 
04:56:36.708 --> 04:56:36.718 align:start position:0%
evaluation of assets this simple change
 
04:56:38.690 --> 04:56:38.700 align:start position:0%
in the law will ensure that every
 
04:56:41.810 --> 04:56:41.820 align:start position:0%
applicant within each community and
 
04:56:44.570 --> 04:56:44.580 align:start position:0%
across the state is treated by the same
 
04:56:47.330 --> 04:56:47.340 align:start position:0%
asset measurement date bringing both
 
04:56:49.250 --> 04:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
consistency and fairness in
 
04:56:49.260 --> 04:56:50.750 align:start position:0%
consistency and fairness in
administration

04:56:50.750 --> 04:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
administration
 
04:56:53.570 --> 04:56:53.580 align:start position:0%
lastly I will note that language has
 
04:56:56.208 --> 04:56:56.218 align:start position:0%
been added to the affected statutes so
 
04:56:58.430 --> 04:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
that if this bill were to become law
 
04:57:01.610 --> 04:57:01.620 align:start position:0%
local re-adoption of these exemptions by
 
04:57:05.390 --> 04:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities shall not be required
 
04:57:07.670 --> 04:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
that concludes my bill introduction Mr
 
04:57:10.010 --> 04:57:10.020 align:start position:0%
chairman and in the interest of time I
 
04:57:12.770 --> 04:57:12.780 align:start position:0%
will defer any questions to a subject
 
04:57:14.810 --> 04:57:14.820 align:start position:0%
matter expert that is signed in to
 
04:57:18.350 --> 04:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
testify behind me thank you okay thank
 
04:57:20.330 --> 04:57:20.340 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony uh next we'll
 
04:57:24.650 --> 04:57:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:24.660 --> 04:57:30.170 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:57:30.170 --> 04:57:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:32.330 --> 04:57:32.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair nature Grace for the
 
04:57:34.550 --> 04:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
municipal Association uh I'm not the
 
04:57:36.530 --> 04:57:36.540 align:start position:0%
subject matter expert that's Mr Meese
 
04:57:38.750 --> 04:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
show he's still in the audience
 
04:57:40.788 --> 04:57:40.798 align:start position:0%
um we do support this bill this is a
 
04:57:42.110 --> 04:57:42.120 align:start position:0%
technical fix bill I want to thank
 
04:57:43.910 --> 04:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative power for bringing this
 
04:57:45.230 --> 04:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
bill and a number of committee members
 
04:57:47.208 --> 04:57:47.218 align:start position:0%
for signing on to it
 
04:57:47.218 --> 04:57:48.350 align:start position:0%
for signing on to it
um

04:57:48.350 --> 04:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:50.390 --> 04:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
we support the concept of a consistent
 
04:57:52.430 --> 04:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
date so all taxpayers are treated
 
04:57:55.250 --> 04:57:55.260 align:start position:0%
equally no matter what municipality they
 
04:57:57.830 --> 04:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
live in logically end of year makes
 
04:57:59.390 --> 04:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
sense that's already in in the other
 
04:58:02.150 --> 04:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
statute referenced so we think this is
 
04:58:04.670 --> 04:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
this is a a good technical fix just to
 
04:58:07.550 --> 04:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
clarify the law as it should be I'm
 
04:58:09.410 --> 04:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions but if you
 
04:58:11.030 --> 04:58:11.040 align:start position:0%

question

04:58:24.650 --> 04:58:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:28.670 --> 04:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
the the date of filing versus the the
 
04:58:30.890 --> 04:58:30.900 align:start position:0%
end of year
 
04:58:35.150 --> 04:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
um that what do you think
 
04:58:40.910 --> 04:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
um there is a benefit for uh or maybe a
 
04:58:44.690 --> 04:58:44.700 align:start position:0%
detraction of setting a set date
 
04:58:44.700 --> 04:58:46.070 align:start position:0%
detraction of setting a set date
um

04:58:46.070 --> 04:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:46.080 --> 04:58:46.670 align:start position:0%
um
um

04:58:46.670 --> 04:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:51.410 --> 04:58:51.420 align:start position:0%
as far as let's say you inherit a
 
04:58:55.490 --> 04:58:55.500 align:start position:0%
million dollars on January 1st does
 
04:58:57.530 --> 04:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:59:01.070 --> 04:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
um is are there situations that this
 
04:59:01.080 --> 04:59:01.850 align:start position:0%
um is are there situations that this
um

04:59:01.850 --> 04:59:01.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:07.190 --> 04:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh could be problematic or is is it just
 
04:59:09.650 --> 04:59:09.660 align:start position:0%
beneficial uh
 
04:59:12.830 --> 04:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
you know enough that that it overweighs
 
04:59:15.470 --> 04:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
the the possible negative ramifications
 
04:59:18.948 --> 04:59:18.958 align:start position:0%
of of it being filed as of the date or
 
04:59:22.010 --> 04:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
you know the assets of the date filed
 
04:59:25.490 --> 04:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
if someone's really interested in in
 
04:59:27.590 --> 04:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
defrauding the government I'm sure they
 
04:59:29.990 --> 04:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
can figure out how to do so
 
04:59:32.690 --> 04:59:32.700 align:start position:0%
um but realistically we do need a date
 
04:59:32.700 --> 04:59:34.368 align:start position:0%
um but realistically we do need a date
to

04:59:34.368 --> 04:59:34.378 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:59:36.530 --> 04:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
uh at which point we can actually
 
04:59:38.448 --> 04:59:38.458 align:start position:0%
calculate what the government needs to
 
04:59:41.628 --> 04:59:41.638 align:start position:0%
do on its side of things so
 
04:59:44.810 --> 04:59:44.820 align:start position:0%
um realistically the the best option is
 
04:59:46.490 --> 04:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
probably the end of the year because
 
04:59:48.350 --> 04:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
that's when everyone's finances wrap up
 
04:59:50.868 --> 04:59:50.878 align:start position:0%
that's when all of the the banks all the
 
04:59:53.150 --> 04:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
investment companies they all do you
 
04:59:54.770 --> 04:59:54.780 align:start position:0%
know the accounting of assets and that's
 
04:59:57.530 --> 04:59:57.540 align:start position:0%
what municipalities generally look at
 
04:59:59.930 --> 04:59:59.940 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about assets for the
 
05:00:03.708 --> 05:00:03.718 align:start position:0%
purposes of tax exemptions and credits
 
05:00:03.718 --> 05:00:06.190 align:start position:0%
purposes of tax exemptions and credits
foreign

05:00:06.190 --> 05:00:06.200 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
05:00:08.330 --> 05:00:08.340 align:start position:0%
no other questions thank you very much
 
05:00:11.150 --> 05:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
thank you final pink card of the day Jim
 
05:00:11.160 --> 05:00:20.150 align:start position:0%
thank you final pink card of the day Jim
Mitchell

05:00:20.150 --> 05:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:22.010 --> 05:00:22.020 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chair and committee
 
05:00:23.690 --> 05:00:23.700 align:start position:0%
members I do have some written testimony
 
05:00:25.430 --> 05:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh would you like me to just pass it
 
05:00:26.690 --> 05:00:26.700 align:start position:0%
through leave it right just leave it
 
05:00:27.890 --> 05:00:27.900 align:start position:0%
right there on the desk with the rest
 
05:00:30.110 --> 05:00:30.120 align:start position:0%
we'll go um so my name is Jimmy schum
 
05:00:31.550 --> 05:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
Chief assessor for the town of Hudson
 
05:00:33.590 --> 05:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh I am in favor of this
 
05:00:36.410 --> 05:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
bill uh currently the statute does not
 
05:00:39.350 --> 05:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
lay out what date to use for net asset
 
05:00:41.810 --> 05:00:41.820 align:start position:0%
uh calculation of net assets
 
05:00:44.270 --> 05:00:44.280 align:start position:0%
um the practice has been a time of
 
05:00:44.280 --> 05:00:45.470 align:start position:0%
um the practice has been a time of
application

05:00:45.470 --> 05:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
application
 
05:00:47.448 --> 05:00:47.458 align:start position:0%
uh nobody could tell an assessor they
 
05:00:49.670 --> 05:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
were wrong to follow that way into him
 
05:00:51.708 --> 05:00:51.718 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire in Hudson we use we've
 
05:00:53.628 --> 05:00:53.638 align:start position:0%
been using end of calendar year asset
 
05:00:55.430 --> 05:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
measurement since I've been there nobody
 
05:00:56.990 --> 05:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
can say that I'm incorrect in using that
 
05:00:59.390 --> 05:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
either because the law is silent
 
05:01:01.730 --> 05:01:01.740 align:start position:0%
um so this proposal is to set in law a
 
05:01:03.890 --> 05:01:03.900 align:start position:0%
standard date as the prime sponsor said
 
05:01:05.930 --> 05:01:05.940 align:start position:0%
and so people will be treated the same
 
05:01:09.410 --> 05:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
regardless of when they apply and
 
05:01:12.350 --> 05:01:12.360 align:start position:0%
long-state apply timely and also they'll
 
05:01:14.090 --> 05:01:14.100 align:start position:0%
be treated the same from Community to
 
05:01:14.100 --> 05:01:15.470 align:start position:0%
be treated the same from Community to
community

05:01:15.470 --> 05:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
community
 
05:01:15.480 --> 05:01:16.730 align:start position:0%
community
um

05:01:16.730 --> 05:01:16.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:01:19.190 --> 05:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
I really think that this is a technical
 
05:01:23.270 --> 05:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
fix and will allow taxpayers to know in
 
05:01:25.128 --> 05:01:25.138 align:start position:0%
advance how they're going to be measured
 
05:01:27.770 --> 05:01:27.780 align:start position:0%
so if you're going through the year of
 
05:01:30.470 --> 05:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
23 and you're looking at your assets and
 
05:01:31.670 --> 05:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
you're wondering am I going to come in
 
05:01:35.628 --> 05:01:35.638 align:start position:0%
below the amount or above the amount if
 
05:01:37.550 --> 05:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
I know the date that I have to have my
 
05:01:38.990 --> 05:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
assets out by
 
05:01:41.270 --> 05:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
then I can plan accordingly I literally
 
05:01:43.610 --> 05:01:43.620 align:start position:0%
have taxpayers tell me that gee I wish I
 
05:01:46.610 --> 05:01:46.620 align:start position:0%
knew beforehand what what it was and I
 
05:01:47.810 --> 05:01:47.820 align:start position:0%
said well if you called us we would have
 
05:01:49.310 --> 05:01:49.320 align:start position:0%
told you our uniform way of doing this
 
05:01:51.010 --> 05:01:51.020 align:start position:0%
is the end of calendar year
 
05:01:54.410 --> 05:01:54.420 align:start position:0%
the statute uses net income measurement
 
05:01:57.288 --> 05:01:57.298 align:start position:0%
for end of calendar year I thought that
 
05:01:59.510 --> 05:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
using the same calendar or measurement
 
05:02:02.628 --> 05:02:02.638 align:start position:0%
for assets makes logical sense
 
05:02:05.570 --> 05:02:05.580 align:start position:0%
um and uh Nate Graves was was correct in
 
05:02:07.910 --> 05:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
terms of ease for the taxpayer of
 
05:02:09.770 --> 05:02:09.780 align:start position:0%
getting these documents
 
05:02:12.230 --> 05:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
um Financial companies Banks Etc they do
 
05:02:13.788 --> 05:02:13.798 align:start position:0%
things by the end of the month the end
 
05:02:16.430 --> 05:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
of the quarter the end of the year so I
 
05:02:18.590 --> 05:02:18.600 align:start position:0%
think it is ease of the taxpayer that's
 
05:02:20.270 --> 05:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
applying that we use end of the calendar
 
05:02:22.070 --> 05:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
year as well
 
05:02:24.110 --> 05:02:24.120 align:start position:0%
that's the extent of my testimony
 
05:02:26.208 --> 05:02:26.218 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
05:02:26.218 --> 05:02:29.708 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
questions

05:02:29.708 --> 05:02:29.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:34.128 --> 05:02:34.138 align:start position:0%
representative yokella so thank you
 
05:02:35.810 --> 05:02:35.820 align:start position:0%
um your last statement
 
05:02:39.170 --> 05:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
um as far as like um
 
05:02:42.530 --> 05:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
um assets being uh attributed at the end
 
05:02:43.730 --> 05:02:43.740 align:start position:0%
of the month
 
05:02:43.740 --> 05:02:45.350 align:start position:0%
of the month
um

05:02:45.350 --> 05:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:02:48.590 --> 05:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
it was very interesting and and
 
05:02:51.948 --> 05:02:51.958 align:start position:0%
especially like maybe 401ks or something
 
05:02:54.230 --> 05:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
along those lines as far as like if you
 
05:02:55.490 --> 05:02:55.500 align:start position:0%
were trying to get it in the middle of
 
05:02:57.530 --> 05:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
the month what is the actual value of
 
05:03:00.350 --> 05:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
you know um may not be
 
05:03:03.830 --> 05:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
is um as obvious
 
05:03:07.010 --> 05:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
um or harder to get than a statement
 
05:03:07.020 --> 05:03:07.788 align:start position:0%
um or harder to get than a statement
um

05:03:07.788 --> 05:03:07.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:10.550 --> 05:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
is that is that kind of the stuff that
 
05:03:12.050 --> 05:03:12.060 align:start position:0%
you're talking about as far as being
 
05:03:14.868 --> 05:03:14.878 align:start position:0%
clear about which date you want to
 
05:03:17.930 --> 05:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
um accumulate the ass you know the
 
05:03:19.610 --> 05:03:19.620 align:start position:0%
numbers for the assets
 
05:03:22.190 --> 05:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
and and that it's easier to do it this
 
05:03:23.810 --> 05:03:23.820 align:start position:0%
way and so that's one of the main
 
05:03:26.270 --> 05:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
benefits of of picking a day
 
05:03:27.890 --> 05:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:03:30.230 --> 05:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
um that is one of the benefits of having
 
05:03:33.650 --> 05:03:33.660 align:start position:0%
a standard measurement date that kind of
 
05:03:35.930 --> 05:03:35.940 align:start position:0%
aligns with how the financial services
 
05:03:39.050 --> 05:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
industry is putting out the statements
 
05:03:40.910 --> 05:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
right so Social Security to shoot Social
 
05:03:42.470 --> 05:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
Security Administration they give you an
 
05:03:44.390 --> 05:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
annual social security statement they
 
05:03:46.070 --> 05:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
don't give you one that I'm sorry that
 
05:03:48.470 --> 05:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
does dealing with income but as far as
 
05:03:51.050 --> 05:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
assets uh like you say it is easier to
 
05:03:53.208 --> 05:03:53.218 align:start position:0%
have a defined date that aligns with
 
05:03:56.448 --> 05:03:56.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:59.330 --> 05:03:59.340 align:start position:0%
foreign no further questions thank you
 
05:04:01.010 --> 05:04:01.020 align:start position:0%
very much for your testimony on the blue
 
05:04:04.490 --> 05:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
sheet we had nobody sign in on this
 
05:04:07.368 --> 05:04:07.378 align:start position:0%
seeing no more pink cards we'll close
 
05:04:12.590 --> 05:04:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:15.470 --> 05:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
uh next week I don't know if I'm not
 
05:04:17.150 --> 05:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
sure if you got yeah you all should have
 
05:04:20.030 --> 05:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
got it next week we have two days again
 
05:04:24.530 --> 05:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
um Wednesday will be our final bills we
 
05:04:25.970 --> 05:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
will actually wrap up our public
 
05:04:28.310 --> 05:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
hearings next week probably ahead of
 
05:04:31.010 --> 05:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
every other committee Thursday we have a
 
05:04:36.410 --> 05:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:36.420 --> 05:04:37.628 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:04:37.628 --> 05:04:37.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:40.910 --> 05:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
besides that
 
05:04:43.850 --> 05:04:43.860 align:start position:0%
as soon as I turn off the mic Christy
 
05:04:46.730 --> 05:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
could you ensure that video and audio
 
05:04:50.150 --> 05:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
are off here in a few minutes thank you
 
05:04:52.190 --> 05:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
and that'll wrap up today I'd like to
 
05:04:55.490 --> 05:04:55.500 align:start position:0%
ask the Democrats to stay for a quick
 
05:04:59.208 --> 05:04:59.218 align:start position:0%
five-minute caucus briefing by another
 
05:05:01.430 --> 05:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
member so we'd ask everybody else to
 
05:05:06.890 --> 05:05:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:13.730 --> 05:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:58.010 --> 05:07:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:58.020 --> 05:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
