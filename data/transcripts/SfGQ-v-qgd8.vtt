and then this afternoon we will be
 
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
having a work session
 
00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
to begin to look at the agency
 
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
presentations and what if anything we
 
00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
are going to do with them
 
00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:27.759 align:start position:0%
i intend to take some straw votes at
 
00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:28.550 align:start position:0%
i intend to take some straw votes at
that

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
understanding the straw votes or just
 
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
that they can change after the public
 
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
hearing and before the executive session
 
00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 align:start position:0%
but we need to get working on
 
00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
at least the non-controversial
 
00:07:40.639 --> 00:07:42.230 align:start position:0%
at least the non-controversial
um

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
items at least i think are
 
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
non-controversial at the moment we shall
 
00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:46.950 align:start position:0%
non-controversial at the moment we shall
see

on the
 
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
health sciences simulation center that's
 
00:09:13.829 --> 00:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
a project that was funded with state
 
00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
operating appropriations in the last
 
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
biennium not in the capital budget it is
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
a capital project and we provide that
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
for your information
 
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
i if it's okay i'm going to share my
 
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.590 align:start position:0%
i if it's okay i'm going to share my
screen

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
screen
 
00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:34.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
so for um for those that were
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
here in 2019 you'll recall that
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
a three biennium appropriation was made
 
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
in house bill 25 in 2019 for the
 
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
university system
 
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
and that over those three biennium that
 
00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
funded three capital projects partially
 
00:09:59.430 --> 00:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
funded three capital projects
 
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
one on each of our residential campuses
 
00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
and in house bill 25
 
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
in the current legislative session
 
00:10:10.389 --> 00:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
that continues the 2020 22 23
 
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
appropriation of 15 million dollars
 
00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
was uh is included and we would ask that
 
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
no change be made to that continuing
 
00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:22.959 align:start position:0%
appropriation that's in house bill 25
 
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
there is a lapse extension in section
 
00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.870 align:start position:0%
there is a lapse extension in section
187

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
187
 
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
of house bill 25 and i have already made
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
the lba office aware that
 
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
that lap extension can be removed the
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
university system has already expended
 
00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
the 10 million dollars that was
 
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
appropriated in the current biennium
 
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
so this is our uh capital budget request
 
00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
that was submitted as part of the agency
 
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
and governor's phase
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
for fiscal 22 and 23 again
 
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
this aligns with what was presented and
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
adopted back in 2019 and is what is
 
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
included in house bill 25 this session
 
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
15 million dollars
 
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
for the biological sciences initiative
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
which you're going to hear a lot more
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
about shortly uh bill janelle will that
 
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
will provide
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of detail on that project
 
00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
it's the largest project ever undertaken
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
by the university system
 
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
there's also two and a half million
 
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.509 align:start position:0%
there's also two and a half million
dollars

00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:30.959 align:start position:0%
each um
 
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
allocated to plymouth state university
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
and keene state university for excuse me
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
keene state college
 
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
for academic buildings um
 
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
in in real need of upgrade and um
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
deferred maintenance
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
and again that will partially be funded
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
through state appropriations hopefully
 
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
and um as well as university system
 
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.110 align:start position:0%
and um as well as university system
dollars

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
as is required by state law we provide a
 
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.350 align:start position:0%
as is required by state law we provide a
six-year

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
six-year
 
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
capital plan if you will and so for
 
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal 26 and 27
 
00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
these amounts obviously are not in-house
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
bill 25 but we have added this
 
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
smith nesmith health sciences
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
out in 26 and 27 our college of health
 
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
and human services at unh
 
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:20.949 align:start position:0%
and human services at unh
is

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:20.959 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:23.839 align:start position:0%
over capacity we have been successful in
 
00:12:23.839 --> 00:12:25.990 align:start position:0%
over capacity we have been successful in
recruiting

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
recruiting
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
many additional students so that that's
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
a number of years out but that's on the
 
00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.350 align:start position:0%
a number of years out but that's on the
horizon

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:12:38.389 --> 00:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
covered 19 has significantly impacted
 
00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
higher ed just as it has impacted just
 
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
about every industry in the state and
 
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.629 align:start position:0%
about every industry in the state and
people

00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
we do know that higher ed education
 
00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:50.079 align:start position:0%
is going to be significantly transformed
 
00:12:53.190 --> 00:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
in the coming years because of covet 19
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding that transformation
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
these projects that are included in
 
00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
house bill 25
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
remain critically important
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
to the university system and
 
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
i wanted to give you an overview of our
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
entire capital program at the university
 
00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.710 align:start position:0%
entire capital program at the university
system

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
we provide a six-year look again in
 
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
alignment with with the six-year
 
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
requirement in state law
 
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
but our capital funding sources
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
primarily i mean the vast majority come
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
from university system funds
 
00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
a portion comes from new debt the
 
00:13:40.069 --> 00:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
university system does not have
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
authority to issue debt
 
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
related to academic structures
 
00:13:47.509 --> 00:13:47.519 align:start position:0%
which is why we
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
often seek state support for for
 
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
academic structures
 
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
we have not issued new debt since 2016
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
and have no plans
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
to do so in the near future and again
 
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
any bonds the university system issues
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
are for what we call self-supporting
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
structures those would include
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
residence halls dining halls and the
 
00:14:08.399 --> 00:14:10.069 align:start position:0%
residence halls dining halls and the
like

00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
i also wanted to mention that you know
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
in a normal year not coveted in a normal
 
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
year our total capital program from
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
university system funds
 
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
is about 60 to 65 million dollars
 
00:14:25.829 --> 00:14:25.839 align:start position:0%
and that is based on
 
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
our one-year depreciation we try to
 
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
invest at the level of depreciation to
 
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
keep up with our deferred maintenance
 
00:14:36.629 --> 00:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
and we've been successful in doing that
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
for the current fiscal year and probably
 
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
out to 2023
 
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
we've had to pull back on that
 
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
normal capital program just for cash
 
00:14:49.829 --> 00:14:49.839 align:start position:0%
preservation efforts
 
00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
because of covid19
 
00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:53.839 align:start position:0%
i will say though that the projects that
 
00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
are included in the in house bill 25
 
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
are moving forward those were not pulled
 
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
back because of the importance of that
 
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
those those projects across the
 
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
university system
 
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.310 align:start position:0%
university system
so

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
on this one
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
this 555 is from all sources to include
 
00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
your own
 
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
that's right that's right so
 
00:15:21.389 --> 00:15:21.399 align:start position:0%
um you'll see in the pie chart
 
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
393 million of the 550
 
00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
55 came from
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
university system sources and then
 
00:15:29.839 --> 00:15:30.710 align:start position:0%
university system sources and then
20

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
20
 
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
came from bonds over these six years
 
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
five percent from gifts and grants and
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
20 million from state appropriations
 
00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
i'm going to turn it over to
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
bill janelle we really want to spend
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
some time on this biological sciences
 
00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
initiative it's a
 
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
really a transformative project for
 
00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.030 align:start position:0%
really a transformative project for
um

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:55.269 --> 00:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
not just unh but the state as a whole we
 
00:15:55.279 --> 00:15:56.629 align:start position:0%
not just unh but the state as a whole we
believe

00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:15:56.639 --> 00:15:57.509 align:start position:0%
believe
so

00:15:57.509 --> 00:15:57.519 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
bill i'm going to turn that over turn it
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
over to you and just let me know when
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
you need me to
 
00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.509 align:start position:0%
you need me to
uh

00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:03.519 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
move slides forward
 
00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.150 align:start position:0%
move slides forward
okay

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
thank you kathy uh good morning
 
00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
representative graham members of the
 
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
committee uh nice to see uh many of you
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
again and nice to meet although be
 
00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
virtually those members that i haven't
 
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
met in the past so i just want to give
 
00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:19.839 align:start position:0%
you a high level overview of the
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
biological sciences initiative so kathy
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
just high-level funding summary over the
 
00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:33.560 align:start position:0%
three bienniums that we're looking at so
 
00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.110 align:start position:0%
three bienniums that we're looking at so
22-23

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
22-23
 
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
state appropriation of 10 million is uh
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
going to support the ongoing
 
00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
construction of the biological sciences
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
project as kathy stated previously
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
the committee's committed 35 million
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
over three biennia for the 95.5 million
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
project and that budget has increased
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
since the last time we've met and i'll
 
00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
get into detail about that further in
 
00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
the slides but just wanted to reiterate
 
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
that increase
 
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
we see that as a responsibility of usnh
 
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
and we're not requesting anything
 
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
additional over what's been previously
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh approved
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
next slide please
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
so just a high overview so the project
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
budget 95.5 million our architect our
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
architect is ellis wag associates and
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
our construction manager is skanska
 
00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
and the construction delivery method is
 
00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
cm at risk
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
next slide kathy
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
um so just a high-level view of the
 
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
project so it's a two-phase project and
 
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
on the site plan view below here
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
uh you can see we've the first phase is
 
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
in addition which is shown in blue here
 
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
and the second phase is a gut renovation
 
00:17:45.549 --> 00:17:45.559 align:start position:0%
of existing spalding hall which is a
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
1960s vintage science building
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
this top view that you see here is the
 
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
ground uh level floor plan
 
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
and just
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
that red dash line that goes through the
 
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
middle delineation delineates the
 
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
difference between phase one the
 
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
addition in phase two uh the existing
 
00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:04.950 align:start position:0%
addition in phase two uh the existing
building

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
so just quickly running through the
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
schedule we completed our utility work
 
00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
in the summer of 2019
 
00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
finalized our construction documents for
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
both phases in fall of 19 and we signed
 
00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
our guaranteed maximum price for phase
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
one in december of that same year
 
00:18:22.789 --> 00:18:22.799 align:start position:0%
uh phase one construction
 
00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
is currently underway
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
and that's on schedule and we see
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
completion of that in about a year in
 
00:18:30.549 --> 00:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
april of 22.
 
00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
we recently signed our guaranteed
 
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
maximum price for phase two in january
 
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
of this year
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
and phase two construction will start
 
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
january of 22 there is some overlap
 
00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:42.640 align:start position:0%
there between the phases but the
 
00:18:44.870 --> 00:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
majority in january of 22 with
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
completion of the project in april of
 
00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.750 align:start position:0%
completion of the project in april of
24.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
24.
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
next slide please kathy
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh so again it's a 95.5 million dollar
 
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
project it includes a 50 000 square foot
 
00:18:58.710 --> 00:18:58.720 align:start position:0%
addition that's phase one along with a
 
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
gut renovation of uh existing spalding
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
hall which is about 82 000 square feet
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
um and it'll do a lot of things for us
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
and these are you know four of the the
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
important things it'll do number one
 
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
it'll address significant deferred
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
maintenance in spaulding hall like i
 
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
said it's an it's a
 
00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
1960s vintage science building
 
00:19:23.669 --> 00:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
it looks like one and uh we've certainly
 
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
done all we can to hold it together over
 
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
recent years to keep things going but
 
00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
this is uh much needed much welcomed
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
work to that building to upgrade those
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
mechanical systems and keep the building
 
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
operational and improve the building
 
00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.630 align:start position:0%
operational and improve the building
significantly

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh so it will also increase capacity for
 
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
enrollments in in these high-end science
 
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
fields or high-demand science fields
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
it'll upgrade our laboratory and
 
00:19:51.029 --> 00:19:51.039 align:start position:0%
teaching spaces
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh that again look like 1960 spaces in
 
00:19:55.669 --> 00:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
in many of
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
those labs in spaulding hall and the
 
00:19:59.830 --> 00:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
ultimate goal is we're going to increase
 
00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
graduates which then will increase our
 
00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
workforce supply for the many businesses
 
00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
that are looking for these folks and to
 
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
put them to work and hopefully improve
 
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
the state's economy along the way
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
uh next slide please kathy
 
00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:14.720 align:start position:0%
so the completed project it'll have 11
 
00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
biological science teaching labs nine
 
00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
research lab suites and we'll be able to
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
accommodate an additional 50 principal
 
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.549 align:start position:0%
accommodate an additional 50 principal
researchers

00:20:22.549 --> 00:20:22.559 align:start position:0%
researchers
 
00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:24.559 align:start position:0%
um one of the
 
00:20:24.559 --> 00:20:25.350 align:start position:0%
um one of the
the

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:26.960 align:start position:0%
components of the project is to
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
construct a new vivarium our current
 
00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:31.840 align:start position:0%
vibram is in coney hall which is one of
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
our oldest
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
buildings on campus and again it's um
 
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
it's the significant deferred
 
00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
maintenance there it's outlived its
 
00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:42.799 align:start position:0%
useful life but this uh the vivarium
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a place where research
 
00:20:47.669 --> 00:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
animals are housed and
 
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
isolated and a place where they can be
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
studied and it's necessary for all the
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
research work that occurs in this
 
00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
building so it's a critical component uh
 
00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
that's that will be added as part of
 
00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:00.799 align:start position:0%
this project
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
again the addition will be completed in
 
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
april of 22
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
and by the end of may the the existing
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
building would be vacated and those
 
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
folks would move into the additional the
 
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
addition the addition space uh not all
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
will fit in that space we're also
 
00:21:18.789 --> 00:21:18.799 align:start position:0%
relocating folks throughout campus
 
00:21:18.799 --> 00:21:19.750 align:start position:0%
relocating folks throughout campus
um

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
but then we would move forward go into
 
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
existing spaulding hall do that
 
00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:24.549 align:start position:0%
existing spaulding hall do that
renovation

00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:24.559 align:start position:0%
renovation
 
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
with a goal of completing by december of
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
23 and then the last phase of the
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
project is to fit out that vibrarium
 
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
which would be completed by april of 24.
 
00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
next slide please kathy
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
okay so the budget um so the last time
 
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
we came and met
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
we had a budget of 86 million dollars
 
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
that has since increased to 95.5 so
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
we're seeing a 9.5 million dollar budget
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
increase again that's the res that
 
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
additional increase is the
 
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility of usnh but these are
 
00:21:57.669 --> 00:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
some of the reasons for the increase
 
00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:00.240 align:start position:0%
one being project complexity this is a
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
very complex project as you can imagine
 
00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.310 align:start position:0%
very complex project as you can imagine
um

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
many science labs we're renovating an
 
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
existing building we've got freshwater
 
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
lab marine labs um
 
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
mechanical systems are very complex as
 
00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
well and at the time in june in 2018
 
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
when we had put together that original
 
00:22:21.029 --> 00:22:21.039 align:start position:0%
budget we didn't have our construction
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
manager on board
 
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
so all of those details of how
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
everything would fit together weren't
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
completely nailed down
 
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
the scope of the project really hasn't
 
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
changed but the complexity we have a
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
better handle on what that complexity is
 
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
so that was one uh driver of that
 
00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
increased cost
 
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
we've also seen uh increased costs from
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
our subcontractors this construction
 
00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:46.640 align:start position:0%
market that we're working in is um the
 
00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.430 align:start position:0%
market that we're working in is um the
most

00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
most
 
00:22:48.789 --> 00:22:48.799 align:start position:0%
the hottest or the most active that
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
we've seen i've seen certainly in my
 
00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.990 align:start position:0%
we've seen i've seen certainly in my
career

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
career
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
in in these areas we've not seen a dip
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
as a result of cobid uh still high
 
00:22:59.350 --> 00:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
demand for subcontractors that are out
 
00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:00.149 align:start position:0%
demand for subcontractors that are out
there

00:23:00.149 --> 00:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
and as a result we've seen it
 
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
we've seen
 
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
additional prices over what we had
 
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
anticipated for things like
 
00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:09.919 align:start position:0%
building automation controls lab case
 
00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
work electrical work
 
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
those areas
 
00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
saw some increase as well
 
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.110 align:start position:0%
saw some increase as well
delays

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
delays
 
00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:19.919 align:start position:0%
when covet hit last year
 
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
we needed to slow things down a little
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
bit from a cash flow standpoint to get
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
our arms around this project
 
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
and also other expenses throughout the
 
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
university so that contributed when when
 
00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
things take longer things cost more
 
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that contributed somewhat
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
to this cost increase and also cobit did
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
as well so additional protocols
 
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
for testing some uh
 
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
results and delays and material
 
00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.830 align:start position:0%
results and delays and material
availability

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
availability
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
um and and scheduling so that
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
contributed to that cost as well
 
00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:54.159 align:start position:0%
next next slide please kathy so the good
 
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
news is it's been a great winter to work
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
we've made some great progress on the
 
00:23:59.039 --> 00:24:00.070 align:start position:0%
we've made some great progress on the
project

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
the exterior of the building is complete
 
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
and we're now working inside on our
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
mechanical systems and coordinating all
 
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
of that work to pull the building
 
00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.830 align:start position:0%
of that work to pull the building
together

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
so next slide please kathy
 
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
this is a slide a picture on the inside
 
00:24:17.669 --> 00:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
just showing some of the work that's
 
00:24:17.679 --> 00:24:18.950 align:start position:0%
just showing some of the work that's
ongoing

00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
ongoing
 
00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.630 align:start position:0%
ongoing
um

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
part of the challenge like i mentioned
 
00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:25.039 align:start position:0%
before is once we complete the addition
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to then need to relocate
 
00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
folks into that so there's a significant
 
00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.110 align:start position:0%
folks into that so there's a significant
um

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
movement of people or moving of people
 
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
that needs to happen that'll happen
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
within the addition but it'll also
 
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
happen across campus so there's many
 
00:24:40.070 --> 00:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
other spaces that we're looking to fit
 
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
out in order to keep operations going i
 
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
know you folks deal a lot with highways
 
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
and bridges building a building is in
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
many ways is not that much different in
 
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
that we need to keep the operation going
 
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
and keep and sometimes need to build a
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
new space in order to move all the folks
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
into it in order to complete uh renovate
 
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
the old space so that's part of what's
 
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
going on now but we're making great
 
00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
progress and uh on schedule to finish
 
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
this project up
 
00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
so next slide please get so
 
00:25:09.679 --> 00:25:10.789 align:start position:0%
so next slide please get so
that's

00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
that's what i've got
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
thanks bill and
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
the the keane and plymouth projects we
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
provided you information in the advanced
 
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.669 align:start position:0%
provided you information in the advanced
materials

00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
materials
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh honestly they they haven't changed
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
since two years ago they are needed
 
00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799 align:start position:0%
projects they are um
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
hyde halls in the planning stage right
 
00:25:36.149 --> 00:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
now at plymouth
 
00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559 align:start position:0%
and uh we continue to believe that those
 
00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
are critically important projects for
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
for keene and plymouth and we're happy
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
representative jack
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh it's lovely to
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
see all of our old friends from the unh
 
00:25:59.909 --> 00:25:59.919 align:start position:0%
i was going to ask you about your laps
 
00:25:59.919 --> 00:26:01.350 align:start position:0%
i was going to ask you about your laps
extension

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
extension
 
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
but you answered that already your laps
 
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
of 187 is noted
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh and this might be
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
a moot point it might just be my lack of
 
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:20.799 align:start position:0%
complete paperwork here
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
but um i noticed on the capital budget
 
00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.269 align:start position:0%
but um i noticed on the capital budget
repair

00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
repair
 
00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%
compare report that we've got from the
 
00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
lba that there's only one line item
 
00:26:32.789 --> 00:26:32.799 align:start position:0%
listed which is the biological sciences
 
00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
initiative and it's for the entire 15
 
00:26:35.679 --> 00:26:36.789 align:start position:0%
initiative and it's for the entire 15
million

00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:36.799 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to be make sure that i
 
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
understand that only 10 million of this
 
00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:44.240 align:start position:0%
is going to the biological uh services
 
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
initiative and the other five is split
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
between these other two renovations
 
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
that's right i believe and lba might be
 
00:26:54.630 --> 00:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
able to help me on this i believe the
 
00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.070 align:start position:0%
able to help me on this i believe the
language

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
in back excuse me back in 2019
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
and currently has one line item for 15
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars but lists the three
 
00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:07.510 align:start position:0%
million dollars but lists the three
projects

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
and so the university system has
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
um allocated those projects ten ten two
 
00:27:16.149 --> 00:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
and a half and two and a half
 
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
chris do i have that right
 
00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
you do kathy and that's my um shorthand
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
in that worksheet i just put the
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
biological center because it was the
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
biggest piece and left it at that
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
you're welcome

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
representing mcconkey you have your hand
 
00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:54.230 align:start position:0%
representing mcconkey you have your hand
up

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:57.990 --> 00:27:58.000 align:start position:0%

things are a little hectic here in
 
00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
freedom uh chancellor uh nice to see you
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
and um i was a few minutes late checking
 
00:28:13.039 --> 00:28:14.149 align:start position:0%
and um i was a few minutes late checking
on

00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh speaking on the biological uh
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
uh center that uh
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
you're promoting here of great interest
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
a couple things caught my ai
 
00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
talked about uh how important this was
 
00:28:28.389 --> 00:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
to the new hampshire workforce
 
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
um and um so
 
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
i two-part question so
 
00:28:36.789 --> 00:28:36.799 align:start position:0%
are um
 
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
are you working collaboratively with any
 
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:41.110 align:start position:0%
are you working collaboratively with any
industries

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
industries
 
00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
um here that are specifically looking
 
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
for activities and are also going to
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
help with some of your labs if it's if
 
00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240 align:start position:0%
it's specialty
 
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
bill you want to take that
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh well we've certainly had much
 
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
interest from companies throughout the
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
state i mean the one that uh and i
 
00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.230 align:start position:0%
state i mean the one that uh and i
believe

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:04.240 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:29:05.669 --> 00:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
we had a previous presentation that
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
listed all those companies the one that
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
comes to mind is lonza that's right down
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
the road that has been very interested
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
in this project and um actually came to
 
00:29:15.919 --> 00:29:17.669 align:start position:0%
in this project and um actually came to
um

00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
public works some a number of years ago
 
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
with us to help support the project when
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
it was initially being presented um so a
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
lot of interest in in
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
local companies and they're they're
 
00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:32.480 align:start position:0%
looking to get our graduates to put them
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
to work for sure as far as direct
 
00:29:34.559 --> 00:29:37.430 align:start position:0%
to work for sure as far as direct
financial

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:39.029 align:start position:0%
 
contributions

00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:39.039 align:start position:0%
contributions
 
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
i don't see that yet as part of this
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
project but typically there are um that
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
does occur as the project moves forward
 
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
so i'm sorry i don't have exact
 
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
information on that but i i anticipate
 
00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
there would be some of that coming
 
00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:56.710 align:start position:0%
there would be some of that coming
okay

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:29:58.389 --> 00:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
and for the chancellor thank you for
 
00:29:58.399 --> 00:29:59.190 align:start position:0%
and for the chancellor thank you for
that

00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
um life is life is going to be different
 
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
if if i could
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
um mr chairman uh life life is different
 
00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
with covid
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
and i i see
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
at my age a lot of this is going to
 
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
carry forward is your business model
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
adapting to that
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
um are you
 
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
or do you still see that you need
 
00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
large facilities large labs large
 
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.669 align:start position:0%
large facilities large labs large
classrooms

00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
classrooms
 
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
so so the business model is absolutely
 
00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.669 align:start position:0%
so so the business model is absolutely
changing

00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
changing
 
00:30:31.679 --> 00:30:33.269 align:start position:0%
changing
and

00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
we are adapting i would say in the area
 
00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:38.559 align:start position:0%
of labs
 
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
we're still going to need labs that's
 
00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:41.430 align:start position:0%
we're still going to need labs that's
the

00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
one that is one of the types of
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
education that we're going to have to
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
have hands-on instruction
 
00:30:49.269 --> 00:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
we do have
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
plans underway across the university
 
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
system on rethinking
 
00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.710 align:start position:0%
system on rethinking
space

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
space
 
00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.510 align:start position:0%
space
um

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:58.710 --> 00:30:58.720 align:start position:0%
on uh and sharing class classes if you
 
00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.470 align:start position:0%
on uh and sharing class classes if you
will

00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
there's a pilot program going on for the
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
fall where we could have
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
plymouth students taking a course
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
with technology at unh for example
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
but but in the area of of labs i don't
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%

aside from the whittemore center and
 
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
other places like that
 
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
thanks for helping us out with those
 
00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:37.200 align:start position:0%
things um
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
so actually it's a little bit it's it
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
sort of follows on to what uh
 
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
representative mcconkey said um you read
 
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
a lot about demographics and decreasing
 
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh student populations and things of
 
00:31:51.029 --> 00:31:51.039 align:start position:0%
that nature and
 
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
when you're looking forward at your
 
00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:55.519 align:start position:0%
business model capital projects things
 
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
like that how do you see the future
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
working out thank you thank you for the
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
question and likewise good to see you
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative evil the um
 
00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
yes we are
 
00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
laser focused on what's what's coming uh
 
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
demographics by 2025
 
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
tell us that um
 
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
the the number of high school students
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
will drop more than 15 percent from
 
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
where it is now
 
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
there are lots of other pressures on
 
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
the business model of higher education
 
00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.110 align:start position:0%
the business model of higher education
so

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:31.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
um you know as a rule
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
we're not building more square feet
 
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact we have plans at
 
00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.669 align:start position:0%
as a matter of fact we have plans at
keene

00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
keene
 
00:32:39.679 --> 00:32:40.549 align:start position:0%
keene
to

00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
demolish some res halls that are
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
need needing a lot of deferred
 
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
maintenance and we don't see the
 
00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.590 align:start position:0%
maintenance and we don't see the
population

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
of students going back to what it was 10
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:32:57.430 --> 00:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
so we are adapting that that um
 
00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
you know we're pivoting wherever
 
00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
possible and not just on the capital
 
00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
program on
 
00:33:07.029 --> 00:33:07.039 align:start position:0%
on all kinds of fronts on administrative
 
00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
financial academic programs because
 
00:33:12.789 --> 00:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
we have been focused on what not just
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
the demographics but our students
 
00:33:18.389 --> 00:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
have a lot more need putting more
 
00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
pressure on our finances
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm actually up to my eyeballs on
 
00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
please send me yeah turn on my mic good
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
morning chancellor um
 
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
correct me if i'm wrong but in the
 
00:33:47.029 --> 00:33:47.039 align:start position:0%
beginning we had uh
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
mr janelle telling us that
 
00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
it took you some time to get the
 
00:33:54.149 --> 00:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
construction manager on board
 
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
and there uh if i
 
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
heard him correctly and this is not the
 
00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:00.559 align:start position:0%
term he used but
 
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
their contract is not to exceed contract
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
is that not to exceed contract on the
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
entire cost of the project or on their
 
00:34:09.599 --> 00:34:13.829 align:start position:0%
entire cost of the project or on their
services

00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:13.839 --> 00:34:15.109 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:34:15.119 --> 00:34:16.470 align:start position:0%
yes
um

00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
the guaranteed maximum price that i
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
talked about is on the entire contract
 
00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
so that's we had we signed a guaranteed
 
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
maximum price for
 
00:34:28.069 --> 00:34:28.079 align:start position:0%
phase one and phase two which includes
 
00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
the construction manager cost and all
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
the subcontractor costs as well that we
 
00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
were bid independently
 
00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:37.829 align:start position:0%
were bid independently
follow

00:34:37.829 --> 00:34:37.839 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:34:37.839 --> 00:34:40.790 align:start position:0%
follow
please

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
let me get unmuted yes
 
00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:45.510 align:start position:0%
let me get unmuted yes
um

00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
mr janelle uh
 
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
so we should anticipate no additional
 
00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:51.270 align:start position:0%
so we should anticipate no additional
requests

00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
requests
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
between now and the completion of this
 
00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:54.950 align:start position:0%
between now and the completion of this
project

00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
and that's our yes that is our plan this
 
00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
is the budget for the project and we do
 
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
not see any increases beyond what's
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
proposed right now this is a guaranteed
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
maximum price and we plan to live within
 
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
that budget
 
00:35:11.589 --> 00:35:11.599 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
00:35:11.599 --> 00:35:12.630 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
and

00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
for the new members
 
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
this has been
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
an ongoing project in the way we've
 
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
helped fund some capital projects at the
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
university system
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
and that we provide certain amount of
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
money for the project and if it comes in
 
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
over what the estimate is
 
00:35:35.589 --> 00:35:35.599 align:start position:0%
the university system picks up that
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
additional cost
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
rather than coming back to the state for
 
00:35:39.359 --> 00:35:40.470 align:start position:0%
rather than coming back to the state for
additional

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh monies so it's been a good uh
 
00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
relationship for the last 20 years that
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
we've been doing this
 
00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
um i'm glad to see that they are
 
00:35:54.630 --> 00:35:54.640 align:start position:0%
continuing with picking up that
 
00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
i see no other hands uh vice chancellor
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
i do have a question we haven't gone to
 
00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
it about the simulation center
 
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
but for many of us we were taken by
 
00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:13.750 align:start position:0%
but for many of us we were taken by
surprise

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
surprise
 
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
two years ago in the operating budget
 
00:36:18.069 --> 00:36:18.079 align:start position:0%
where a capital project
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
was introduced to be funded with
 
00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
operating funds
 
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079 align:start position:0%
are there any of those types of
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
surprises in this current budget
 
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
no absolutely not the operating
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
appropriation for the university system
 
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
has been reduced five percent over our
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
current block grant so no there are no
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
one-time dollars in the operating budget
 
00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
in in house bill 1.
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you i
 
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to say i'm building a
 
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
house and i really feel your pain on
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
increasing construction costs um
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
sorry to ask this question but i um
 
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
i'd love to hear any comments you care
 
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
to make on the prospective merger that's
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
being proposed between your system and
 
00:37:11.589 --> 00:37:11.599 align:start position:0%
the community college system
 
00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
our board is fully supportive of a um
 
00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
a proposal to to
 
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
create a new board to oversee
 
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
what what are currently two systems and
 
00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
and part of that
 
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
i would say most of that representative
 
00:37:32.069 --> 00:37:32.079 align:start position:0%
evil goes back to your
 
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
your uh earlier question
 
00:37:37.589 --> 00:37:37.599 align:start position:0%
that we have been
 
00:37:37.599 --> 00:37:38.710 align:start position:0%
that we have been
studying

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
studying
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
and um hearing from experts
 
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
on on what's coming
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
for higher ed and covid
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
has exacerbated it
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
that there is going to be a real
 
00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:54.079 align:start position:0%
transformation of higher education
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
that that we can
 
00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
you know have a a
 
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
a new kind of public higher education
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
system for the granite state
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
by the time that that uh cliff that
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
demographic cliff hits us that uh it's
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
important to make a bold move
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of unanswered questions
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
we we certainly recognize that
 
00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:21.200 align:start position:0%
but but we are supportive of the
 
00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:27.510 align:start position:0%
but but we are supportive of the
proposal

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
um on this portion of the presentation
 
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
it's nice that they are not asking for
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
additional funds because there aren't
 
00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:39.750 align:start position:0%
additional funds because there aren't
many

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
many
 
00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:40.950 align:start position:0%
many
um

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
as the former treasurer could
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
attest it's always a challenge
 
00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
to stay within what the treasurer
 
00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:50.470 align:start position:0%
to stay within what the treasurer
recommends

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
recommends
 
00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:52.640 align:start position:0%
but since we do have a little bit of
 
00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.630 align:start position:0%
but since we do have a little bit of
time

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
vice chancellor if you could just
 
00:39:00.069 --> 00:39:00.079 align:start position:0%
briefly hit the simulation center so
 
00:39:01.349 --> 00:39:01.359 align:start position:0%
that we know
 
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
what is being built out there even
 
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
though it's not not
 
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
capital appropriations it is a capital
 
00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:12.310 align:start position:0%
capital appropriations it is a capital
project

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:14.720 align:start position:0%
sure and and um actually
 
00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
knee-deep in this so he can probably
 
00:39:24.069 --> 00:39:24.079 align:start position:0%
provide you with a
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
better overview of the project i can
 
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
tell you that
 
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this was to be able to
 
00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.710 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this was to be able to
support

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
nursing and other
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
health sciences programs we just did not
 
00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
have the capacity
 
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
to accept additional nurses nursing
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
students and it's been successful we we
 
00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:45.349 align:start position:0%
students and it's been successful we we
uh

00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
we have really grown the program so bill
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
do you want to
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
provide them with uh provide the
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
committee with overview sure
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
sure glad to
 
00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh so yes our health science simulation
 
00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.270 align:start position:0%
uh so yes our health science simulation
center

00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
center
 
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
um so project budget of nine million
 
00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:06.079 align:start position:0%
uh again operating funds through fy 2021
 
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
our architect lavalier brensinger
 
00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh construction manager is right ryan
 
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
and this is a design build project
 
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
that's the delivery method that we have
 
00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:16.470 align:start position:0%
that's the delivery method that we have
forward

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
next slide please
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
uh so it'll create 21 000 square feet of
 
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
instructional space in core campus it's
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
just it's just west of the railroad
 
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
track so i'll show a slide of that going
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
forward but it's just an interior uh
 
00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
rendering of uh some gathering space in
 
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:34.960 align:start position:0%
the project itself
 
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
next slide please
 
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
so here's uh aerial view kind of giving
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
you a sense of where it is uh the
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
railroad tracks are kind of at the top
 
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
right corner
 
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
of the slide uh greg hall is kind of
 
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh at the bottom of the slide
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's a low-cost light
 
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
commercial building very fast track
 
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
um we're looking to have this project
 
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
done by august so that it can be
 
00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
occupied in the fall of this year
 
00:41:07.030 --> 00:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
and as kathy said it supports our health
 
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
our college of health and human services
 
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
particularly nursing other health
 
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
education programs and one of the
 
00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
big one one of the things we're trying
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
to achieve here is to create this
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
simulation space
 
00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:19.750 align:start position:0%
simulation space
where

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
nursing students one of the big
 
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
challenges with putting a nursing
 
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
student through our program
 
00:41:27.589 --> 00:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
is finding them placement in hospitals
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
and other care centers where they can
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
have their practical experience
 
00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
by creating a simulation center some of
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
that experience can be done
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
here in the simulation center itself so
 
00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
that allows us to increase that capacity
 
00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:42.079 align:start position:0%
of graduates that we can get through
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
this is a really high demand uh
 
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
major within unh or majors within within
 
00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.190 align:start position:0%
major within unh or majors within within
chhs

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
chhs
 
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
next slide please kathy and this is just
 
00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
an interior rendering of some of that
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
simulation space so they have mannequins
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
very lifelike that they can do uh some
 
00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:00.079 align:start position:0%
of their
 
00:42:01.589 --> 00:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
practical work
 
00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
here instead of going out uh
 
00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:05.839 align:start position:0%
to to hospitals they'd still have to do
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
that but part of it can be accomplished
 
00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:08.870 align:start position:0%
that but part of it can be accomplished
here

00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
um so again looking to get this
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
completed by fall um it's
 
00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
i actually i can look out the window and
 
00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:18.079 align:start position:0%
see the building right now it's taking
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
shape very well and they're on on the
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
inside uh starting some of the uh
 
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
mechanical work and finishes to move
 
00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:27.190 align:start position:0%
mechanical work and finishes to move
forward

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
next slide please
 
00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
oh and that's it
 
00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that um vice chancellor
 
00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
um this looks like a great addition to
 
00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
your health sciences project are there
 
00:42:43.109 --> 00:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
any ongoing discussions with the
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
community college system
 
00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
about utilizing this space for some of
 
00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
their nursing programs or affiliated
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of any
 
00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
we do have
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
that's not to say that
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
that that won't happen
 
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
we have a um
 
00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
actually we've been meeting since the
 
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
fall maybe late summer we have a a
 
00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
synergies group if you will it's a task
 
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
force made up of
 
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
some um college presidents from the
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
university system college presidents
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
from community college i'm on that we
 
00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
have a couple of trustees
 
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
we meet bi-weekly we've identified a
 
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
number of synergies we've already
 
00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
started working on with with contracts
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
and academic programs
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
so i believe that you know that that's
 
00:43:33.839 --> 00:43:35.270 align:start position:0%
so i believe that you know that that's
um

00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:37.109 --> 00:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
something that that we could be looking
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
at in the future
 
00:43:40.870 --> 00:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
i i would appreciate that because it
 
00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
goes to the the core of what
 
00:43:44.950 --> 00:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative ebal and others have been
 
00:43:47.670 --> 00:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
asking about going forward and how we're
 
00:43:48.950 --> 00:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
work the two systems together
 
00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
even if we do not merge them in the
 
00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
fashion the governor may be envisioning
 
00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
but it's still going to be critical
 
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
i wanted to ask a question about the
 
00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
fyes 26 and 27. do you mind if we get
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
into that if we have a little time would
 
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
you rather talk about something else
 
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
we've got a little bit of time but
 
00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
you know we can talk about it but we
 
00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
can't find any future legislature
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
about funding
 
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
or or even
 
00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.309 align:start position:0%
or or even
um

00:44:30.309 --> 00:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
yeah you can ask
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
thank you um i see in the uh the
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
schedule you have you're showing
 
00:44:40.309 --> 00:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
for the new hampshire of the nesmith
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
health services uh out in that 26 27
 
00:44:45.990 --> 00:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
area about 12 million
 
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
uh that you might want to try to get out
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
of the state and 18 for yourselves
 
00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:51.270 align:start position:0%
of the state and 18 for yourselves
um

00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
bill you want to take that
 
00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
sure um i mean we're still in the
 
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
preliminary stages but again chhs is
 
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
probably our fastest growing college on
 
00:45:07.589 --> 00:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
campus and it related to health sciences
 
00:45:09.829 --> 00:45:09.839 align:start position:0%
and all the need that's out there
 
00:45:09.839 --> 00:45:10.550 align:start position:0%
and all the need that's out there
so

00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
they have identified additional space
 
00:45:15.270 --> 00:45:15.280 align:start position:0%
beyond the simulation center that we're
 
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
building right now this is to address
 
00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
immediate needs in growth that we're
 
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
seeing in the nursing program for those
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
similar for that simulation uh
 
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
experience but uh this project looks at
 
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
nezmuth hall which again is one of our
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
oldest halls on campus
 
00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
um is in need of uh
 
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of attention there's a lot of
 
00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
deferred maintenance there so we're
 
00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
doing a study right now to look at how
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
we could
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
provide that additional space to chhhs
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
and within nezmuth while at the same
 
00:45:48.309 --> 00:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
time addressing a lot of our uh deferred
 
00:45:49.829 --> 00:45:49.839 align:start position:0%
maintenance needs in that building as
 
00:45:52.069 --> 00:45:52.079 align:start position:0%
well so don't have a lot of the details
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
as to how it would all actually come
 
00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
together right now but where i i should
 
00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
have that study hopefully within a month
 
00:45:59.349 --> 00:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
or so to
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
better outline that and we'll have more
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
coming forward for sure but it's it's
 
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
basically um chhs is expanding very
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
quickly we're trying to do all we can to
 
00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
accommodate that growth within existing
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
spaces on campus that need attention
 
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
anyway repurposing those um older
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
buildings that are you know
 
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
core to unh campus and and better
 
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
and to follow up on that in relation to
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
representative ebel's
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
earlier question
 
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
we are not about um
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
expanding our footprint rather take a
 
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
building in core campus that is in need
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
of rehab and repurpose that space
 
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
if i could follow up chairman quick
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um so i guess you'll with this
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
consideration of the combining some of
 
00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:56.230 align:start position:0%
consideration of the combining some of
the

00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
community college uh programs that that
 
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
would be to take into consideration as
 
00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
far as instead of expanding something
 
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
else but i guess you didn't say
 
00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
expanding but i assume that you'll be
 
00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:07.829 align:start position:0%
expanding but i assume that you'll be
considering

00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:07.839 align:start position:0%
considering
 
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
the needs of the community colleges
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
along those lines which seems to be
 
00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.510 align:start position:0%
along those lines which seems to be
great

00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely if this if
 
00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
if this proposal moves forward that will
 
00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
be part of a comp i would
 
00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
believe part of a comprehensive view of
 
00:47:26.390 --> 00:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
the needs across
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
all of the the institutions
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:35.109 --> 00:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
i see
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
no other hands just for the committee's
 
00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:39.589 align:start position:0%
no other hands just for the committee's
edification

00:47:39.589 --> 00:47:39.599 align:start position:0%
edification
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
even though this 15 million dollars was
 
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
promised in the last biennium it does
 
00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079 align:start position:0%
count against the general funded portion
 
00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
of the capital budget this biannual so
 
00:47:55.190 --> 00:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
we don't have 15 million dollars to play
 
00:47:58.069 --> 00:47:58.079 align:start position:0%
with it it is there and the treasurer
 
00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
does count it as part of the
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
her recommendation ceiling
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
um so if you look at the
 
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet sent out by the lba
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
um it is included in the general fund
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
portion of the budget so
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
don't think just because we had promised
 
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
it before it had already been accounted
 
00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:22.069 align:start position:0%
it before it had already been accounted
for

00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
isn't that right uh vice chancellor
 
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
yes that's right representative you're
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
i owe that explanation to the lba
 
00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:36.710 align:start position:0%
i owe that explanation to the lba
actually

00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
we very much appreciate um your time
 
00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
this morning and as always if there are
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
any follow-up questions or additional
 
00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:46.160 align:start position:0%
information that would be helpful to you
 
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
in in your decision making uh by all
 
00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
means um you know chris and i are in
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
contact and we're happy to get you any
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up information if that would be
 
00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:56.150 align:start position:0%
follow-up information if that would be
helpful

00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%

i'm trying to see if he's saying
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
something but i don't think
 
00:57:32.069 --> 00:57:32.079 align:start position:0%

of the more
 
00:58:14.839 --> 00:58:16.710 align:start position:0%
of the more
non-controversial

00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
non-controversial
 
00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:18.470 align:start position:0%
non-controversial
agencies

00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
essentially the ones who did not ask for
 
00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:24.640 align:start position:0%
additional funding
 
00:58:26.549 --> 00:58:26.559 align:start position:0%
well you know we need to get our work
 
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
done there aren't many of those yeah

so i think marie would you mind sharing
 
01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
your screen
 
01:00:30.549 --> 01:00:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
please do so okay
 
01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
um so in preparation for today uh we did
 
01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
produce one of our standard uh budget
 
01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
books um for those of you that are
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
returning to the committee and you'll
 
01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
recall that we
 
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
typically put together
 
01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
a capital budget book for the governor's
 
01:00:50.309 --> 01:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
phase of uh the process and so we did
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
send you
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
a lengthy document i think it was 74
 
01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
pages which includes a lot of
 
01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
photographs and um
 
01:00:59.589 --> 01:00:59.599 align:start position:0%
you know long descriptions of each of
 
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
our projects for the purposes of today
 
01:01:04.549 --> 01:01:04.559 align:start position:0%
as we would when we meet in person
 
01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
we won't be going through every page of
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
that document instead we will highlight
 
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
certain pages
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
but we thought it was helpful to give
 
01:01:14.390 --> 01:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
the committee all of that background on
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
the various projects
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to start with our general
 
01:01:19.589 --> 01:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
fund requests and we have three projects
 
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
that would be supported with general
 
01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:22.309 align:start position:0%
that would be supported with general
funds

01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:01:23.990 --> 01:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
then we have five projects that were
 
01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
supported uh by the governor um as part
 
01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
of our highway fund request
 
01:01:31.109 --> 01:01:31.119 align:start position:0%
and then um marie mullen has been
 
01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
working closely with chris shea from lba
 
01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
and so we're actually going to talk
 
01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
about some of our additional additional
 
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
needs for prior capital budget items i
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
know we're coming back later in the week
 
01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
to talk about lapse extensions um but
 
01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
chris thought it was important for us to
 
01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:47.839 align:start position:0%
touch on
 
01:01:50.309 --> 01:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
um some of the cost increases associated
 
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
with past hb 25 projects
 
01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
and then lastly we'll run through some
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
of the additional needs that were not
 
01:01:58.870 --> 01:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
supported and i'm just seeing that
 
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
patrick harlechi our director of
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
aeronautics rail and transit is also
 
01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
joining us should you have any questions
 
01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
on the general fund items that we're
 
01:02:07.670 --> 01:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
going to touch on first
 
01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
um so that's the format for today um
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
like i said most of the presentation
 
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
materials are in the longer booklet that
 
01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:16.240 align:start position:0%
we sent you and marie did send a copy of
 
01:02:18.230 --> 01:02:18.240 align:start position:0%
this more abbreviated presentation to
 
01:02:20.549 --> 01:02:20.559 align:start position:0%
chris for distribution this morning
 
01:02:22.710 --> 01:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
um so with that i'm going to ask uh
 
01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:24.799 align:start position:0%
chris wasschuck to
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
walk you through the presentation um
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
and you know we're happy mr chairman to
 
01:02:31.990 --> 01:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
either take questions as we go or go
 
01:02:33.270 --> 01:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
through the presentation and take
 
01:02:34.789 --> 01:02:34.799 align:start position:0%
questions at the end whatever is most
 
01:02:34.799 --> 01:02:36.069 align:start position:0%
questions at the end whatever is most
appropriate

01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:02:38.549 --> 01:02:38.559 align:start position:0%
why don't we take questions
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
at the end of the general funded portion
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
and then we'll see how how it's going on
 
01:02:48.309 --> 01:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
on the rest probably at the break of
 
01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
what is in the
 
01:02:53.589 --> 01:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal and then after your
 
01:02:55.990 --> 01:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
suggestions on
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
prior appropriations and then we'll talk
 
01:03:03.270 --> 01:03:03.280 align:start position:0%

01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:05.440 align:start position:0%
additional requests and take questions
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
at that kind of break it up into the
 
01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:09.280 align:start position:0%
pieces that you
 
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880 align:start position:0%

01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
questions answered right then rather
 
01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.200 align:start position:0%

01:03:17.109 --> 01:03:17.119 align:start position:0%

is kind of the overview these are three
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh projects that
 
01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
have been approved by the governor um
 
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
and there were three projects that we
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
submitted as part of our capital budget
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
requests in essence they total 1.72
 
01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
million in general funds
 
01:04:16.069 --> 01:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
and it leverages actually there's only
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
27 million shown there but it leverages
 
01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
uh quite a bit more of federal funds
 
01:04:23.829 --> 01:04:23.839 align:start position:0%
um and we'll talk about that in in a
 
01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
moment um but the three projects in
 
01:04:28.789 --> 01:04:28.799 align:start position:0%

01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
in essence and we've put this
 
01:04:54.069 --> 01:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
we send the sheet out to all the
 
01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
directors to fill in information
 
01:04:56.319 --> 01:04:57.270 align:start position:0%
directors to fill in information
um

01:04:57.270 --> 01:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
so in essence um the first priority um
 
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
first general funded priority is um is
 
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
for 1.2 million of general funds to
 
01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:10.829 align:start position:0%
for 1.2 million of general funds to
leverage

01:05:10.829 --> 01:05:10.839 align:start position:0%
leverage
 
01:05:13.589 --> 01:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
27.7 million of federal funds and it
 
01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
really is to support the continued
 
01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
safety improvements and development of
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
airports uh within the state by
 
01:05:22.150 --> 01:05:22.160 align:start position:0%
providing that five percent uh of the
 
01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:25.599 align:start position:0%
required ten percent match for the faa
 
01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
program which in essence involves the
 
01:05:29.829 --> 01:05:29.839 align:start position:0%
airport improvement projects
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
uh the ratio of funds feature um for
 
01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:34.640 align:start position:0%
each of the uh projects is based on
 
01:05:36.549 --> 01:05:36.559 align:start position:0%
ninety percent federal funding a five
 
01:05:38.789 --> 01:05:38.799 align:start position:0%
percent state share which
 
01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
in this case will be this general funded
 
01:05:42.870 --> 01:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
capital budget request and a five
 
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
percent local share
 
01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:45.990 align:start position:0%
percent local share
um

01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:47.829 --> 01:05:47.839 align:start position:0%
in essence the funds for these projects
 
01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
will be used you know for for federally
 
01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
eligible airports from manchester all
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
the way to uh to berlin i believe there
 
01:05:57.270 --> 01:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
are 12
 
01:06:00.150 --> 01:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
federally eligible airports
 
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
the request will include approximately
 
01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:05.029 align:start position:0%
the request will include approximately
30

01:06:05.029 --> 01:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
airport improvement projects
 
01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
for planning and infrastructure
 
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
improvements at those 12
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
public use airports
 
01:06:15.910 --> 01:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
and also it will include improvements to
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire aircraft registration
 
01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
excuse me aircraft rescue and
 
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
firefighting training facility which is
 
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
located in concord
 
01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
you know typical
 
01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:32.710 --> 01:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
involve runway rehabilitation
 
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
you know taxiway uh
 
01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:38.480 align:start position:0%
apron uh rehabilitation airport uh
 
01:06:41.430 --> 01:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
airport obstruction removal and lighting
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
land acquisition easement acquisition
 
01:06:45.270 --> 01:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
and so on so those are kind of the
 
01:06:47.349 --> 01:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
typical projects that are included with
 
01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
this request
 
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:06:58.870 --> 01:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
a request
 
01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:03.109 align:start position:0%
a request
for

01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh 251
 
01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
and 250 of general funds as a match to
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
leverage 2.5 million of federal uh
 
01:07:14.549 --> 01:07:14.559 align:start position:0%
transit funds from fta
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
these federal funds you know provide at
 
01:07:17.910 --> 01:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
least eighty percent of the capital
 
01:07:19.990 --> 01:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
needs for eligible transit capital
 
01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
projects and this requested capital uh
 
01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
excuse me uh capital match will provide
 
01:07:28.309 --> 01:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
um no more than 10
 
01:07:30.549 --> 01:07:30.559 align:start position:0%
or half of the required match it's an 80
 
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
20 program
 
01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%
and the remaining 10
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
will be local funds
 
01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:36.309 align:start position:0%
will be local funds
um

01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:38.799 align:start position:0%
so state participation enables transit
 
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
providers to leverage federal capital
 
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
funds for needed vehicle replacements
 
01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
and facility improvements that might not
 
01:07:49.349 --> 01:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
otherwise be available and completed
 
01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
in essence the state
 
01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
federal and local funds will provide the
 
01:07:55.829 --> 01:07:55.839 align:start position:0%
ability to replace approximately 25
 
01:07:55.839 --> 01:07:56.950 align:start position:0%
ability to replace approximately 25
vehicles

01:07:56.950 --> 01:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
vehicles
 
01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
um from the non-profit agencies that
 
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
provide transportation for our seniors
 
01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
and individuals with disabilities and
 
01:08:05.670 --> 01:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
also provide the ability to acquire some
 
01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
intermodal infrastructure that may be
 
01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
included such as bicycle pedestrian
 
01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:11.829 align:start position:0%
included such as bicycle pedestrian
infrastructure

01:08:11.829 --> 01:08:11.839 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
01:08:11.839 --> 01:08:12.870 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
um

01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:13.750 align:start position:0%
um
which

01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
typically a bike rack passenger shelters
 
01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
um wayfair signage and so on
 
01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
you know so in essence again this 251
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
250 of general funds
 
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
will leverage um and match 2.5 million
 
01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
of federal transit funds
 
01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
and um we have just a couple photos here
 
01:08:37.349 --> 01:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
showing uh what the typical vehicle that
 
01:08:38.709 --> 01:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
is replaced
 
01:08:41.669 --> 01:08:41.679 align:start position:0%
with these with these funds you can see
 
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
the vehicle is
 
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
quite quite aged and um and quite
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
this is the third um
 
01:08:58.470 --> 01:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
priority um that is funded with general
 
01:08:58.480 --> 01:08:59.590 align:start position:0%
priority um that is funded with general
funds

01:08:59.590 --> 01:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
and it requests 300 000 for the
 
01:09:04.470 --> 01:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
replacement of the department's aircraft
 
01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
registration program
 
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
in essence um the existing registration
 
01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
system was developed back in 2001 and
 
01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
implemented in 2003 so it's
 
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
just about 20 years old
 
01:09:19.510 --> 01:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
it is archaic
 
01:09:22.070 --> 01:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
and really needs to be replaced
 
01:09:25.110 --> 01:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
what the aviation registration program
 
01:09:26.709 --> 01:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
does is it collects revenue for the
 
01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
state to support airports and aviation
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
programs in the state it also the
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
registration also provides additional
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
benefits to department
 
01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
such as data collection
 
01:09:39.189 --> 01:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
that is done as part of the registration
 
01:09:40.709 --> 01:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
process is used by the department for
 
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
various regulatory needs and compliance
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
uh needs and
 
01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
successfully planned for airport
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
development programs
 
01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
so during the as you may know during the
 
01:09:59.750 --> 01:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
2018 legislative session senate bill 565
 
01:10:01.750 --> 01:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
was passed and signed by the governor
 
01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
which changed the methodology to
 
01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:04.310 align:start position:0%
which changed the methodology to
register

01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
register
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
aircraft in the state this legislation
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
changed the fee methodology to a
 
01:10:11.510 --> 01:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
weight-based uh rate structure with
 
01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
associated fees
 
01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
in in an effort to attract more aircraft
 
01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
to businesses to the state this change
 
01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
reduced the aircraft their registration
 
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
fees from approximately 1 million to 400
 
01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:23.510 align:start position:0%
fees from approximately 1 million to 400
000.

01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
000.
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
you know so in essence um what happens
 
01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
is up to 400 000 250 000 are provided to
 
01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
airports based on formula
 
01:10:33.669 --> 01:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
uh where the aircraft is based and the
 
01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
remaining revenue is deposited into
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
general fund which is approximately 150
 
01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
000 of the 400.
 
01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
due to the useful life of the current
 
01:10:46.149 --> 01:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
software um in this legislative change
 
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
a new system is really needed
 
01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
and this system will be web-based and
 
01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:52.310 align:start position:0%
and this system will be web-based and
allow

01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
allow
 
01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
payments to be made by credit cards
 
01:10:58.149 --> 01:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
as well as to be more interactive and
 
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
useful by the public
 
01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.630 align:start position:0%
useful by the public
so

01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:04.470 --> 01:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
again this is for three hundred thousand
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
dollar general funded
 
01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:07.910 align:start position:0%
dollar general funded
request

01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
request
 
01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
to replace the existing aircraft
 
01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:11.750 align:start position:0%
to replace the existing aircraft
registration

01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
registration
 
01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
and with that those are the three
 
01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
general fund funded items so i'll pause
 
01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
here for any questions
 
01:11:19.189 --> 01:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
the committee may have
 
01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
representative jack
 
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
mr chairman uh thank you
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
everyone uh
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
benefit of the new do you think it would
 
01:11:29.910 --> 01:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
be worth high low that uh the aaa is who
 
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
decides what airport projects are being
 
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
done and has taken the five percent
 
01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
match we don't really have anything to
 
01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
and you're correct um based on faa's
 
01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
changing priorities um they may
 
01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
the the projects um may change
 
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:11:53.189 --> 01:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
we do have
 
01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
you know based on the common priorities
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
and patrick hurley he may be able to
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
answer this a little better but based on
 
01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
the current priorities we anticipate um
 
01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
what those projects are and the level of
 
01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
funding needed and that's that's how the
 
01:12:09.430 --> 01:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
patrick do you have anything to add
 
01:12:15.830 --> 01:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
01:12:19.110 --> 01:12:19.120 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
01:12:20.709 --> 01:12:20.719 align:start position:0%
patrick curlahie i'm the director of
 
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
aeronautics rail and transit at d.o.t
 
01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
um yeah um the way the faa aip program
 
01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
works we are heavily we rely heavily on
 
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
discretionary funding
 
01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
so that's why the faa has has a great
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
say in what the priority for the
 
01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
projects are what we do is we go with
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
each of the federally eligible airports
 
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
we go through a capital improvement
 
01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
planning process for a five-year period
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
then we sit down with faa and look at
 
01:12:49.510 --> 01:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
what faa is going to
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
believes will be the priorities in the
 
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
coming years uh for the types of
 
01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
projects whether they be runway
 
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation projects taxiways
 
01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:58.709 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation projects taxiways
obstruction

01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
obstruction
 
01:13:00.149 --> 01:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
uh removal
 
01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
and then uh try to to work with it with
 
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
the capital improvement programs and
 
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
come up with uh the list that then we
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
send to faa for their review
 
01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
and scoring and and then their
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
determination on what projects will get
 
01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
funded so
 
01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
we do have a say we do
 
01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
we do um meet with faa we advocate for
 
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
the projects that are in each of the
 
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
airports capital improvement plans and
 
01:13:26.149 --> 01:13:26.159 align:start position:0%
they certainly take that into
 
01:13:26.159 --> 01:13:31.189 align:start position:0%
they certainly take that into
consideration

01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative abbott
 
01:13:36.630 --> 01:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i just wanted to
 
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
ask the standard question
 
01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
with this software as the dit been
 
01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
involved in
 
01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:46.470 align:start position:0%
involved in
um

01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative we're very fortunate
 
01:13:55.510 --> 01:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
doit staff embedded at dut
 
01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
and they support both our current
 
01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
registration software and will also be
 
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
involved in implementation of any new
 
01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:08.950 align:start position:0%
involved in implementation of any new
software

01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman on
 
01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
point number four there nice to see all
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
d.o.t without saying
 
01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
um on um where talked about the change
 
01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
in legislation from 2018
 
01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
to the weight-based rate structure did
 
01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
that result in
 
01:14:34.149 --> 01:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
more income
 
01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
more registrations i guess i'm saying
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
for planes aircraft
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
i can answer that question um
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative mcconkey it's still a
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
little too early to tell we've only been
 
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
doing this now for a year and a half the
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
20 2018
 
01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
legislation took place in in happy we do
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
a calendar year registration but the
 
01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
change didn't take effect until until
 
01:15:02.550 --> 01:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
july first of that year
 
01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
um so we're still looking at that we've
 
01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
had an uptick actually in smaller planes
 
01:15:10.470 --> 01:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
in experimental planes versus
 
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
the heavy the heavier planes
 
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
the the uh revenue from that is still
 
01:15:18.390 --> 01:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
down to about five um
 
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
about four hundred thousand dollars
 
01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
a year four hundred to five hundred
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a year where prior to
 
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
the change we were receiving
 
01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
approximately a million dollars a year
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
so but i still think it's still a little
 
01:15:32.229 --> 01:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
too early to to tell uh if it's been
 
01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
that's if it's been successful or not
 
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you patrick thank you mr chairman
 
01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
see no no other hands i do have one
 
01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:44.149 align:start position:0%
see no no other hands i do have one
question

01:15:44.149 --> 01:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
on the the transit bus
 
01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:48.070 align:start position:0%
on the the transit bus
um

01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:50.709 --> 01:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
where it comfort 10 match
 
01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
i believe you were talking about a match
 
01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
for 2.5 million
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
is it safe to
 
01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
talk about that as as leveraging 2.5 or
 
01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
is it just in the hopes that there will
 
01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
i think it's actually 5 million
 
01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
um because it's half the
 
01:16:18.149 --> 01:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
is is used for that um
 
01:16:21.990 --> 01:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
i think but
 
01:16:25.669 --> 01:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
my math is not my starting point so um
 
01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
but yes this is funding that's in
 
01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
that that we anticipate we anticipate
 
01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
level funding even though the fast act
 
01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:33.270 align:start position:0%
level funding even though the fast act
authorization

01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
authorization
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
lasts for only a year we are we're
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
anticipating that we will receive at
 
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
least level funding uh through that
 
01:16:41.669 --> 01:16:41.679 align:start position:0%
program right i would also
 
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
um like to add that this is a lot less
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
than what we usually ask for in this
 
01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
category we've been up to almost a
 
01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
million dollars before in this
 
01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
uh that's uh if if we if we're granted
 
01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
the lapse extensions we sh we have
 
01:16:57.669 --> 01:16:57.679 align:start position:0%
enough funding to fund all of the public
 
01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
transit vehicles the fixed route transit
 
01:17:04.229 --> 01:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
vehicles in the next biennium this is
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
mostly for
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
human service agencies that provide
 
01:17:11.350 --> 01:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
transportation for seniors and and
 
01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
those with disabilities and also some
 
01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that would be done for
 
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
the public transit system the
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure would be but a majority
 
01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
of this is is for vehicles for the that
 
01:17:25.990 --> 01:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
service the elderly and disabled
 
01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
the reason i ask is sometimes it is
 
01:17:30.470 --> 01:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
easier to sell things
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
to members of the general court if you
 
01:17:34.630 --> 01:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
can say that this is in there to
 
01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:36.149 align:start position:0%
can say that this is in there to
leverage

01:17:36.149 --> 01:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
leverage
 
01:17:39.030 --> 01:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
x amount of federal funds
 
01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
rather than just a standalone
 
01:17:43.189 --> 01:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
appropriation that
 
01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't look like it's leveraging much
 
01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
and i think we did that in the actual
 
01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
project justification in the form that
 
01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
went to the capitol for
 
01:17:54.630 --> 01:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh for this capital budget item it talks
 
01:17:56.870 --> 01:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
about that the reason it's not in the
 
01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:57.669 align:start position:0%
about that the reason it's not in the
cas

01:17:57.669 --> 01:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
cas
 
01:17:57.679 --> 01:17:58.470 align:start position:0%
cas
it

01:17:58.470 --> 01:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
the federal funding for this particular
 
01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
item is in the actually in the operating
 
01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:03.669 align:start position:0%
item is in the actually in the operating
budget

01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:18:05.350 --> 01:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
and not like in aeronautics where it's
 
01:18:07.189 --> 01:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
in the capital budget
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
so the you would see the federal funding
 
01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
in in class 72 in the operating budget
 
01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
oh another one of those fun things yeah
 
01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i just wanted to make
 
01:18:22.229 --> 01:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
sure that that when we say something
 
01:18:22.239 --> 01:18:23.030 align:start position:0%
sure that that when we say something
that

01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:25.669 --> 01:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
we we are selling it correctly
 
01:18:28.229 --> 01:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
yeah so if i may mr chairman you know as
 
01:18:30.630 --> 01:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
patrick said the fast act the current
 
01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
federal authorization does expire in
 
01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:33.990 align:start position:0%
federal authorization does expire in
september

01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
september
 
01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
um we are extremely optimistic that in
 
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
this area we'll get at least
 
01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
the same funding if not more
 
01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
so i think it's safe to say that you
 
01:18:46.630 --> 01:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
truly are leveraging our federal dollars
 
01:18:47.990 --> 01:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:18:52.229 --> 01:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
see no other questions on this section
 
01:18:57.669 --> 01:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:59.270 --> 01:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
so in essence uh
 
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
this this
 
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
chart shows um
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
that the department submitted 10
 
01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
10 priority items to be
 
01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
bonded and and that service funded with
 
01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
highway funds
 
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
that totaled
 
01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
what what the governor approved were the
 
01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
top five priorities
 
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
um and they totaled 14.8 million
 
01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:29.910 align:start position:0%
um and they totaled 14.8 million
um

01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:32.709 --> 01:19:32.719 align:start position:0%
in essence the the biggest um
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
differences between
 
01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
us our requests and the governance
 
01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
approved um
 
01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:39.990 align:start position:0%
approved um
items

01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
items
 
01:19:42.470 --> 01:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
were an additional 500 000 dollars for
 
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
statewide construction of salt sheds
 
01:19:48.630 --> 01:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
and nearly doubling
 
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
of the estimate for the londonderry
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
patrol shed replacement and i'll talk
 
01:19:56.310 --> 01:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
about that um when we get to the
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
individual items
 
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:06.870 --> 01:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
so in essence the first highway funded
 
01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:07.830 align:start position:0%
so in essence the first highway funded
uh

01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
priority um on the highway side
 
01:20:13.510 --> 01:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
was for 1.7 million
 
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
and this is this is the government
 
01:20:17.350 --> 01:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
approved dollar figure
 
01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
for the statewide replacement of of salt
 
01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:21.590 align:start position:0%
for the statewide replacement of of salt
sheds

01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
sheds
 
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
in essence
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
um the department cannot
 
01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
currently store seasons worth of salt at
 
01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:30.719 align:start position:0%
each patrol shed location and some of
 
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
the sheds really have reached their
 
01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
useful life
 
01:20:36.310 --> 01:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
they require significant maintenance um
 
01:20:38.709 --> 01:20:38.719 align:start position:0%
or they're very very you know in very
 
01:20:40.310 --> 01:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
very poor condition
 
01:20:44.709 --> 01:20:44.719 align:start position:0%
um the ability to store ample salt um in
 
01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
one season will save funds by by by
 
01:20:49.750 --> 01:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
being able to
 
01:20:52.630 --> 01:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
purchase that that salt and store under
 
01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:53.590 align:start position:0%
purchase that that salt and store under
um

01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
under that facility um when the best
 
01:20:58.229 --> 01:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
price is available and also there are
 
01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
environmental regulations that require
 
01:21:04.229 --> 01:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
that all salt be stored under cover
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
the apartment uses a typical high arch
 
01:21:08.950 --> 01:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
gambrell design which allows delivery of
 
01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
the salt to generally occur within the
 
01:21:11.199 --> 01:21:13.270 align:start position:0%
the salt to generally occur within the
shed

01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
shed
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
due to that high door opening and it
 
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
limits you know any kind of
 
01:21:19.990 --> 01:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts in the area
 
01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:20.870 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts in the area
um

01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
this project will construct you know new
 
01:21:25.669 --> 01:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
standalone salt buildings at different
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
locations throughout the state you know
 
01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
based on a priority um at the bottom of
 
01:21:32.709 --> 01:21:32.719 align:start position:0%
the page
 
01:21:35.910 --> 01:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
you know the different um locations are
 
01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
listed for example north hampton is a
 
01:21:40.470 --> 01:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
shed that's 32 years old it's under
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
capacity and really structurally
 
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.110 align:start position:0%
capacity and really structurally
deficient

01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
deficient
 
01:21:45.189 --> 01:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
you know a second one lincoln it's 37
 
01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
years old and has the same issues uh
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
that one there we can have a current
 
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
capacity of 1650 tons
 
01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
and what's used at that location is over
 
01:21:58.229 --> 01:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
you know over 4 300 tons so um those are
 
01:21:59.350 --> 01:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
the type of
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
facilities that we replace kind of in a
 
01:22:04.390 --> 01:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
prior priority order based on the
 
01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
available funding um that is allocated
 
01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
so next slide marie
 
01:22:14.550 --> 01:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
you know in essence um and this was this
 
01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
was based on information last um
 
01:22:20.229 --> 01:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
last fall
 
01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
but recent you know based on that at
 
01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
that time construction costs were
 
01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
showing that we really needed to use
 
01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
about 120 dollars per square foot uh to
 
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
construct that kind of building um
 
01:22:34.709 --> 01:22:34.719 align:start position:0%
public works is telling us that is
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
probably about 20 percent higher today
 
01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
um so based on the numbers above you
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
know we estimate that
 
01:22:46.229 --> 01:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
locations would cost roughly around 400
 
01:22:50.149 --> 01:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
to 450 000 upwards of to a million
 
01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
dollars based on size and location
 
01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:55.270 align:start position:0%
dollars based on size and location
um

01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:57.750 --> 01:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
next slide marie
 
01:22:59.110 --> 01:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
and these are just some photos i
 
01:23:01.350 --> 01:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned northampton and lincoln so for
 
01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
example this one here is a photo of
 
01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
northampton you can see that it's um
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
it's very old in some cases it's leaning
 
01:23:11.669 --> 01:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh the structural stability is you know
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
really at risk here uh next next sheet
 
01:23:20.149 --> 01:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
this is another um you know showing some
 
01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
of the deterioration in post rod at
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
northampton and the one below is the
 
01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
site at lincoln you know again you know
 
01:23:31.669 --> 01:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
showing the undersized nature um and um
 
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you can make it out but
 
01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
and we had a few more slides sent with
 
01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
the original book teacher the committee
 
01:23:43.590 --> 01:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
members that kind of give examples of
 
01:23:46.629 --> 01:23:46.639 align:start position:0%
the conditions of the sheds that
 
01:23:49.110 --> 01:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
we feel need to be replaced
 
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:57.350 --> 01:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
priority i am the second highway funded
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
priority item is for 5 million for the
 
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
replacement of the current fuel
 
01:24:04.470 --> 01:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
management system
 
01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
as you know
 
01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
the dot's fuel distribution system is
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
the strategic fuel reserve for all of
 
01:24:12.709 --> 01:24:12.719 align:start position:0%
new hampshire state government
 
01:24:14.229 --> 01:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
the fuel district
 
01:24:17.830 --> 01:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
distribution system is uh computerized
 
01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
um it's a fuel management system fmis
 
01:24:23.189 --> 01:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
we call it it was originally
 
01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
supplied by opec which is now
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
gas boy in essence and it's slated to
 
01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:30.870 align:start position:0%
gas boy in essence and it's slated to
sunset

01:24:30.870 --> 01:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
sunset
 
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
by that company in the next few years
 
01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
the the sunset date is 2022 um and
 
01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:39.750 align:start position:0%
the the sunset date is 2022 um and
coincidentally

01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
coincidentally
 
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
the coming contract with
 
01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
gas boy also ends
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
in june of 2022.
 
01:24:49.830 --> 01:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
at that time the system will no longer
 
01:24:51.510 --> 01:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
be supported you know any of the
 
01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
software and hardware um at the 90 plus
 
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
fuel sites that that we have throughout
 
01:24:58.790 --> 01:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:25:01.189 --> 01:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
the fuel distribution system normally
 
01:25:02.709 --> 01:25:02.719 align:start position:0%
sees about four and a half to five
 
01:25:05.110 --> 01:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
million gallons of throughput per year
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
and really requires a stable system to
 
01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
manage and maintain those volumes any
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
disruption will certainly be
 
01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:11.590 align:start position:0%
disruption will certainly be
programmatic

01:25:11.590 --> 01:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
programmatic
 
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh problem problematic sorry
 
01:25:19.110 --> 01:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
um this is a proprietary system um and
 
01:25:21.030 --> 01:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
we will be hard pressed to deal with any
 
01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:21.990 align:start position:0%
we will be hard pressed to deal with any
issues

01:25:21.990 --> 01:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
that crop up or any major breakdowns
 
01:25:26.629 --> 01:25:26.639 align:start position:0%
with a system we don't own the software
 
01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
we own the data
 
01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:30.719 align:start position:0%
you know so in essence what this system
 
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
will do um we are intending what this
 
01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
request will do
 
01:25:37.590 --> 01:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
is secure services to provide and
 
01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
install a new new fuel management system
 
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
that will include all the hardware
 
01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
operating system database
 
01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:47.030 align:start position:0%
operating system database
and

01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
fuel management software
 
01:25:51.189 --> 01:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
the vendor
 
01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
will be responsible for all aspects of
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
the project
 
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
including but not limiting
 
01:25:58.709 --> 01:25:58.719 align:start position:0%
limited to the design development
 
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
installation implementation testing
 
01:26:04.709 --> 01:26:04.719 align:start position:0%
training and so on of the entire system
 
01:26:04.719 --> 01:26:06.229 align:start position:0%
training and so on of the entire system
we

01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:26:08.470 --> 01:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
we have received proposals and we'll
 
01:26:09.910 --> 01:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
talk about this
 
01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
in a later section but we feel that this
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
item can be reduced down to the four
 
01:26:17.189 --> 01:26:17.199 align:start position:0%
million dollar level um we've requested
 
01:26:19.669 --> 01:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
five million and again we feel it can be
 
01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
reduced down to the four million dollar
 
01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:23.270 align:start position:0%
reduced down to the four million dollar
level

01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
so this is the third priority it's the
 
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
lancaster storage building replacement
 
01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
um it is for 595 000 to replace
 
01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
this this storage building the existing
 
01:26:41.669 --> 01:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
building is a wooden building
 
01:26:44.149 --> 01:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
it's used for cold storage of materials
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
and some equipment
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
and this building has been in kind of a
 
01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
deteriorated state for the last number
 
01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
of years with main uh with repairs being
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
done at different times
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
one of the sidewalls of the building is
 
01:26:59.830 --> 01:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
in very poor condition uh foundation
 
01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
slab is broken several sections and
 
01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
heaves which jams the sliding doors as
 
01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
you can imagine is very problematic in
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
the wintertime and the roof has been
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
repaired several times because of its
 
01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:13.270 align:start position:0%
repaired several times because of its
leaks

01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
leaks
 
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
this project replaces to remove the
 
01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:17.189 align:start position:0%
this project replaces to remove the
existing

01:27:17.189 --> 01:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
existing
 
01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
50 by 35 foot wooden structure and
 
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
replace it with a new 30 by 60 foot
 
01:27:25.669 --> 01:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
steel building on a concrete slab
 
01:27:25.679 --> 01:27:26.709 align:start position:0%
steel building on a concrete slab
next

01:27:26.709 --> 01:27:26.719 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:27:28.709 --> 01:27:28.719 align:start position:0%
three pages kind of show
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
the building
 
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.189 align:start position:0%
the building
[Music]

01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:27:33.510 --> 01:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
the bottom picture shows the side wall i
 
01:27:35.189 --> 01:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
don't i don't believe you you can really
 
01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
tell that's in poor shape but it is in
 
01:27:38.470 --> 01:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
poor shape
 
01:27:40.709 --> 01:27:40.719 align:start position:0%
um next few slides
 
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh show again the sidewall and some of
 
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
the some of the rut um that exists at
 
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
that building and then lastly this slide
 
01:27:50.709 --> 01:27:50.719 align:start position:0%
kind of shows the concept we're going to
 
01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
remove the existing building and put a
 
01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
new pre-engineered a metal building up
 
01:27:58.470 --> 01:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
in kind of the same location
 
01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
or rotated 90 degrees
 
01:28:05.750 --> 01:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:07.910 --> 01:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh so the fourth highway funded priority
 
01:28:10.229 --> 01:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
is this um
 
01:28:10.239 --> 01:28:11.110 align:start position:0%
is this um
is

01:28:11.110 --> 01:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
for 6.75 million for the replacement of
 
01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
the londonderry patrol shed
 
01:28:19.830 --> 01:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
what this also should state is it
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
includes the uh it includes a new salt
 
01:28:24.310 --> 01:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
shed as well
 
01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:26.800 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that was captured
 
01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
when the original estimate was submitted
 
01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
but this facility is undersized um
 
01:28:36.550 --> 01:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
this facility services i-93 you know
 
01:28:39.430 --> 01:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
with the expansion of i-93 from four to
 
01:28:40.629 --> 01:28:40.639 align:start position:0%
eight lanes
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
um this facility is certainly not
 
01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
capable in its current state of keeping
 
01:28:47.830 --> 01:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
up with the the maintenance associated
 
01:28:51.189 --> 01:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
with the increased lane miles of i-93
 
01:28:53.110 --> 01:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
the facility also
 
01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
does not meet modern building codes it's
 
01:29:00.149 --> 01:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
so the new facility will be cited on the
 
01:29:04.629 --> 01:29:04.639 align:start position:0%
on the same property
 
01:29:06.629 --> 01:29:06.639 align:start position:0%
and also will have utility and computer
 
01:29:10.229 --> 01:29:10.239 align:start position:0%
system upgrades are included
 
01:29:12.950 --> 01:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
so the project will will construct a new
 
01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:15.199 align:start position:0%
what we call right side right size
 
01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
facility and it will include crew
 
01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
quarters bathrooms foreman uh office and
 
01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle storage bays for trucks right
 
01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:25.679 align:start position:0%
now there's a five-person crew there
 
01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
that are full-time with one temporary
 
01:29:31.110 --> 01:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
person um for the winter and also we
 
01:29:33.430 --> 01:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
have up to eight hired uh trucks with
 
01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:34.629 align:start position:0%
have up to eight hired uh trucks with
operators

01:29:34.629 --> 01:29:34.639 align:start position:0%
operators
 
01:29:34.639 --> 01:29:35.669 align:start position:0%
operators
that

01:29:35.669 --> 01:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:37.990 --> 01:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
function out of that facility
 
01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
the common facility is
 
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
too small to allow for the crew members
 
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
to take a break
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
it really only has one bathroom which is
 
01:29:48.709 --> 01:29:48.719 align:start position:0%
inadequate for the crew size especially
 
01:29:50.550 --> 01:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
in the winter when you have the added
 
01:29:53.350 --> 01:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
higher trucks coming in and currently
 
01:29:55.110 --> 01:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
the foreman uses a portion of the crew
 
01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
quarters as an office which is really
 
01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
not secure and conducive for employee
 
01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:01.510 align:start position:0%
not secure and conducive for employee
relations

01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
relations
 
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
also this facility's roof was leaking
 
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
we placed a rubber membrane over the
 
01:30:08.070 --> 01:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
entire roof
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
as a temporary repair
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
in the winter there's only two plow
 
01:30:14.470 --> 01:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
trucks that can be stored inside this
 
01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
facility without any plow equipment
 
01:30:19.110 --> 01:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
so the facility is scheduled to add an
 
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
another employee another truck
 
01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:22.310 align:start position:0%
another employee another truck
um

01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:24.470 --> 01:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
really with with these trucks they
 
01:30:27.669 --> 01:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
really should be stored inside um to
 
01:30:30.709 --> 01:30:30.719 align:start position:0%
prevent you know issues with um
 
01:30:33.110 --> 01:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
with starting
 
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
01:30:37.189 --> 01:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
you know emission controls
 
01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
um when temperature is dropping below
 
01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.990 align:start position:0%
um when temperature is dropping below
freezing

01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
freezing
 
01:30:43.990 --> 01:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
the project will include an 80 by 100
 
01:30:45.189 --> 01:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
foot building
 
01:30:47.669 --> 01:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
that meets the common building codes
 
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
as well as utility hookups and as i
 
01:30:53.110 --> 01:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned it will include a new salt
 
01:30:53.120 --> 01:30:55.430 align:start position:0%
mentioned it will include a new salt
shed

01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:58.790 --> 01:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
so on the next page we have
 
01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:07.990 --> 01:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
and you can see the size of it
 
01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:13.590 --> 01:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
in the lower portion that will be
 
01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:15.830 align:start position:0%
in the lower portion that will be
replaced

01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
replaced
 
01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
and again we had additional photos
 
01:31:19.830 --> 01:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
included in the packet that was
 
01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
submitted that i think provides a little
 
01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
more description of the cramped quarters
 
01:31:27.270 --> 01:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
of of this location
 
01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
i do want to say and i probably didn't
 
01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:30.629 align:start position:0%
i do want to say and i probably didn't
not

01:31:30.629 --> 01:31:30.639 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:31:33.590 --> 01:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
mention that um
 
01:31:35.669 --> 01:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
when we provided the initial estimate it
 
01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
was based on
 
01:31:38.950 --> 01:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
just the square footage of the new
 
01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:40.149 align:start position:0%
just the square footage of the new
facility

01:31:40.149 --> 01:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:31:42.149 --> 01:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
as public as the bureau of public works
 
01:31:45.110 --> 01:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
took how to look at this location
 
01:31:46.870 --> 01:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
they really increased
 
01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
the cost based on the current climate
 
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
for public um public works type of
 
01:31:54.310 --> 01:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
building construction
 
01:31:57.030 --> 01:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
as well as additional utility costs
 
01:31:59.830 --> 01:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
01:32:01.669 --> 01:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
to account for the replacement of the
 
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
solid so that's why
 
01:32:05.910 --> 01:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
the uh the cost has increased um
 
01:32:09.189 --> 01:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
dramatically from i think our
 
01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
request of roughly three three and a
 
01:32:13.510 --> 01:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
half million to the governor's approved
 
01:32:17.669 --> 01:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:21.590 --> 01:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
and this is the fifth highway funded
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
priority that was approved by the
 
01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
governor it's for 500 excuse me 800 000
 
01:32:28.159 --> 01:32:29.110 align:start position:0%
governor it's for 500 excuse me 800 000
um

01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
you know in essence this is for
 
01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
phase two of the work order system
 
01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
that's currently underway
 
01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:36.229 align:start position:0%
that's currently underway
uh

01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
i should say phase one is underway
 
01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:39.590 align:start position:0%
i should say phase one is underway
um

01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:42.149 --> 01:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
in essence the state has invested tens
 
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
of billions of dollars in transportation
 
01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:44.870 align:start position:0%
of billions of dollars in transportation
assets

01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
assets
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
in order to get uh the most out of this
 
01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
major investment the department really
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
needs a modern and efficient means to
 
01:32:53.110 --> 01:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
track future current and past
 
01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
maintenance efforts for assets such as
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
bridges culverts guardrail and so on
 
01:32:58.320 --> 01:32:59.750 align:start position:0%
bridges culverts guardrail and so on
um

01:32:59.750 --> 01:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:01.830 --> 01:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
in essence this phase two
 
01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:03.189 align:start position:0%
in essence this phase two
um

01:33:03.189 --> 01:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:05.110 --> 01:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
the software will build on the benefits
 
01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
of phase one and focus on technology
 
01:33:10.149 --> 01:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
enhancements um
 
01:33:13.350 --> 01:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
enhanced field mobility and real-time uh
 
01:33:16.629 --> 01:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
data uh availability you know so in
 
01:33:16.639 --> 01:33:17.590 align:start position:0%
data uh availability you know so in
essence

01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
essence
 
01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:18.629 align:start position:0%
essence
um

01:33:18.629 --> 01:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
i'll go down to a brief description of
 
01:33:23.189 --> 01:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
the project it really provides uh mobile
 
01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
devices in connectivity across the
 
01:33:27.510 --> 01:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
departments 100 plus permanent field
 
01:33:29.590 --> 01:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
locations to enable easy and efficient
 
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
access to the system
 
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
they also provide additional resources
 
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
to insist
 
01:33:36.950 --> 01:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
assist with the implementation system
 
01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
and enhance the integration with
 
01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
real-time data
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
i will pause
 
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from members of
 
01:33:55.189 --> 01:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:33:57.750 --> 01:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
on what was included
 
01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
in the governor's proposal and that we
 
01:34:03.510 --> 01:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
just went over for highway funding
 
01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:04.629 align:start position:0%
just went over for highway funding
i

01:34:04.629 --> 01:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:34:08.070 --> 01:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:09.910 --> 01:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman i just
 
01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
wondered with this work order
 
01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:14.950 align:start position:0%
wondered with this work order
um

01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:16.310 align:start position:0%
um
system

01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:34:20.950 --> 01:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh we've been asked to consider um
 
01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:21.830 align:start position:0%
uh we've been asked to consider um
uh

01:34:21.830 --> 01:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:34:24.950 --> 01:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
with the emergency system and efficient
 
01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:26.149 align:start position:0%
with the emergency system and efficient
game

01:34:26.149 --> 01:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
game
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
um it has there been any coordination
 
01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
with this i mean in terms of
 
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:39.750 --> 01:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
telecommunication i guess what i'm
 
01:34:46.229 --> 01:34:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:49.030 --> 01:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
so representative um this system is a
 
01:34:50.629 --> 01:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
work order system
 
01:34:52.470 --> 01:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
um so that we can
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh track both planned work as well as
 
01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
accomplishments associated with
 
01:34:59.350 --> 01:34:59.360 align:start position:0%
maintaining our assets and so this is
 
01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
more about tracking people
 
01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
um equipment material usage as well as
 
01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
estimating and developing work plans for
 
01:35:09.510 --> 01:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
each of our different asset types
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
whether that's
 
01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:13.110 align:start position:0%
whether that's
routine

01:35:13.110 --> 01:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
routine
 
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
preventative maintenance
 
01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:15.750 align:start position:0%
preventative maintenance
or

01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:16.950 align:start position:0%
or
assigning

01:35:16.950 --> 01:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
assigning
 
01:35:19.270 --> 01:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
tasks associated with advancing larger
 
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
scale projects
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
while we may use this to track you know
 
01:35:27.189 --> 01:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
the status and assign um
 
01:35:29.669 --> 01:35:29.679 align:start position:0%
work associated with communications
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
making sure that we're timely in
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
addressing um
 
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
maybe constituent issues that come in
 
01:35:38.229 --> 01:35:38.239 align:start position:0%
this isn't really a communications type
 
01:35:38.239 --> 01:35:39.669 align:start position:0%
this isn't really a communications type
project

01:35:39.669 --> 01:35:39.679 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:35:41.750 --> 01:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
when it comes to
 
01:35:43.990 --> 01:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
our dispatch
 
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
solutions and our traffic management
 
01:35:50.709 --> 01:35:50.719 align:start position:0%
systems we are actively engaged
 
01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
across the state agencies and looking
 
01:35:54.790 --> 01:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
for opportunities to have efficiency so
 
01:35:56.070 --> 01:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
we work closely with department of
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
safety and homeland security
 
01:36:00.870 --> 01:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
as well as fishing game and the others
 
01:36:02.709 --> 01:36:02.719 align:start position:0%
that do
 
01:36:04.629 --> 01:36:04.639 align:start position:0%
dispatch work and emergency response
 
01:36:04.639 --> 01:36:06.229 align:start position:0%
dispatch work and emergency response
work

01:36:06.229 --> 01:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:36:12.229 --> 01:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
01:36:16.629 --> 01:36:16.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and great to see
 
01:36:19.350 --> 01:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
everyone from d.o.t and congratulations
 
01:36:22.149 --> 01:36:22.159 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner our new president of
 
01:36:22.159 --> 01:36:24.470 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner our new president of
ashto

01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
ashto
 
01:36:27.270 --> 01:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
the question i had was just how are we
 
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
doing with the salt sheds i'm in my
 
01:36:31.830 --> 01:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
fifth term i can't believe it on this
 
01:36:33.750 --> 01:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
committee and it seems like we've been
 
01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
replacing salt sheds for
 
01:36:37.830 --> 01:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
quite a while are we making good
 
01:36:39.669 --> 01:36:39.679 align:start position:0%
progress or
 
01:36:43.189 --> 01:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:45.270 --> 01:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
representative um i can answer that
 
01:36:47.109 --> 01:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
question thank you for the question and
 
01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
it's good to see you as well
 
01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
in essence we try to replace about two
 
01:36:54.390 --> 01:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
to three locations
 
01:36:57.109 --> 01:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
you know per biennium um with the
 
01:36:59.270 --> 01:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
funding that is allocated
 
01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
and you know in some cases um and we'll
 
01:37:04.830 --> 01:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about
 
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
um you know a couple projects where we
 
01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:09.679 align:start position:0%
need additional funds uh
 
01:37:12.149 --> 01:37:12.159 align:start position:0%
costs have been increasing so we may get
 
01:37:14.229 --> 01:37:14.239 align:start position:0%
down to you know instead of the two or
 
01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
three that we planned we may only be
 
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
able to replace two
 
01:37:21.189 --> 01:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
um but we where we have a lot of old
 
01:37:23.430 --> 01:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
facilities that were you know
 
01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
constructed not to any kind of modern
 
01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:26.550 align:start position:0%
constructed not to any kind of modern
standard

01:37:26.550 --> 01:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
standard
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:37:30.229 --> 01:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
you know they're severely undersized
 
01:37:32.830 --> 01:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
they worked in their day and age and and
 
01:37:35.109 --> 01:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
now um
 
01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
we need to i i can't say how many um we
 
01:37:41.830 --> 01:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
you know the list i think that we had
 
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
probably list about eight of them
 
01:37:46.950 --> 01:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
that um have been prioritized
 
01:37:48.709 --> 01:37:48.719 align:start position:0%
you know so we keep on trying to whittle
 
01:37:53.109 --> 01:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
just quick follow-up mr chair
 
01:37:56.960 --> 01:37:58.149 align:start position:0%
just quick follow-up mr chair
um

01:37:58.149 --> 01:37:58.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:00.510 --> 01:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
are there other any opportunities for
 
01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
consolidating the sheds or they really
 
01:38:06.070 --> 01:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
need to be where they are
 
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
the sheds are in strategic locations to
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
save on travel you know particularly
 
01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
um when you have a plow truck and
 
01:38:17.590 --> 01:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
it does it's it's does its plowing route
 
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
um if the shed if they have to travel
 
01:38:21.430 --> 01:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:38:23.669 --> 01:38:23.679 align:start position:0%
too far then it's way in addition to
 
01:38:27.189 --> 01:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
wasted time it is really um you know
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
added cost on
 
01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
fuel and all that so
 
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
they're really strategically you know
 
01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:34.870 align:start position:0%
they're really strategically you know
placed

01:38:34.870 --> 01:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
placed
 
01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
and if i may it's really about public
 
01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
safety um you know when we have
 
01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
large-scale snow events
 
01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.109 align:start position:0%
large-scale snow events
um

01:38:41.109 --> 01:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:42.790 --> 01:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
that's one thing we have one strategy
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
but if we have you know icing calls and
 
01:38:47.590 --> 01:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
situations where we've unexpected
 
01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
weather making sure that
 
01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
trucks can get loaded and out on their
 
01:38:53.830 --> 01:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
beats as quickly as possible that's
 
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
factoring into where we site and locate
 
01:38:58.470 --> 01:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
these sheds as well
 
01:39:00.629 --> 01:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
just quick i'd just be curious how many
 
01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
we have if you at some point if it's
 
01:39:05.990 --> 01:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
convenient if you could uh share that
 
01:39:07.109 --> 01:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
so representative i do want to
 
01:39:08.629 --> 01:39:08.639 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that dave rodrigue our
 
01:39:11.990 --> 01:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
director of operations just joined us um
 
01:39:13.590 --> 01:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
dave perhaps you could answer that
 
01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:15.669 align:start position:0%
dave perhaps you could answer that
question

01:39:15.669 --> 01:39:15.679 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:18.159 align:start position:0%
yes good morning representative and
 
01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
01:39:22.310 --> 01:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
my name's david rodriguez i'm the
 
01:39:25.590 --> 01:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
director of operations we do have about
 
01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
a hundred salt sheds
 
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
so this is a capital budget item i
 
01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
expect you to see for years and years to
 
01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:36.870 align:start position:0%
expect you to see for years and years to
come

01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
come
 
01:39:38.550 --> 01:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
if if we
 
01:39:42.870 --> 01:39:42.880 align:start position:0%
replace two salt sheds per biennium
 
01:39:46.070 --> 01:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
that assumes a life of a salt shed of a
 
01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
hundred years um our salt sheds will not
 
01:39:52.550 --> 01:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
last uh a hundred years
 
01:39:55.030 --> 01:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
which is why we try to get three per
 
01:39:57.430 --> 01:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
biennium when you think of the state of
 
01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire there's over 200 towns in
 
01:40:02.950 --> 01:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
when we think of consolidating winter
 
01:40:07.750 --> 01:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
maintenance right now with the number of
 
01:40:09.510 --> 01:40:09.520 align:start position:0%
facilities we have
 
01:40:11.109 --> 01:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
each facility
 
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
covers the state roads within two towns
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
if we consolidate that too much as the
 
01:40:20.709 --> 01:40:20.719 align:start position:0%
commissioner said we delay our response
 
01:40:23.750 --> 01:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
and we come very inefficient because we
 
01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
have many trucks doing what we call
 
01:40:30.390 --> 01:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
dead heading driving over the same roads
 
01:40:33.109 --> 01:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
without providing service so
 
01:40:36.070 --> 01:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
we feel that um winter maintenance is
 
01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
really a logistics effort
 
01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
our current system was designed by
 
01:40:45.590 --> 01:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
military officials after world war ii
 
01:40:48.149 --> 01:40:48.159 align:start position:0%
they really set us up the way we're set
 
01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
up now and we feel that that we have set
 
01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:02.550 --> 01:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
representative faulkner
 
01:41:05.270 --> 01:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman
 
01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
um my question i guess is
 
01:41:10.390 --> 01:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
related somewhat to the fuel management
 
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh project but i was curious as to where
 
01:41:15.270 --> 01:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
we are in terms of
 
01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
alternative fuel vehicles for the state
 
01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
fleet and whether that might change how
 
01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:20.790 align:start position:0%
fleet and whether that might change how
we

01:41:20.790 --> 01:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:22.719 align:start position:0%
how we deal with the fueling
 
01:41:27.189 --> 01:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:29.350 --> 01:41:29.360 align:start position:0%
so dave as our director of operations
 
01:41:31.830 --> 01:41:31.840 align:start position:0%
has been representing the department on
 
01:41:34.629 --> 01:41:34.639 align:start position:0%
the electric charging commission um so
 
01:41:37.350 --> 01:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
we've been engaged in conversations
 
01:41:39.350 --> 01:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
about supporting the statewide effort to
 
01:41:40.470 --> 01:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
build out
 
01:41:42.149 --> 01:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
electric charging infrastructure but
 
01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:44.159 align:start position:0%
then internally we've had conversations
 
01:41:46.390 --> 01:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
about the greening of our own fleet
 
01:41:49.910 --> 01:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
so dave do you want to touch on
 
01:41:51.430 --> 01:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
where those conversations have led up
 
01:41:52.629 --> 01:41:52.639 align:start position:0%
until now we've been focused on
 
01:41:54.310 --> 01:41:54.320 align:start position:0%
purchasing more fuel-efficient vehicles
 
01:41:56.629 --> 01:41:56.639 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily exploring
 
01:41:59.750 --> 01:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
alternative fuel vehicles
 
01:42:01.910 --> 01:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
would like to address that thank you
 
01:42:03.510 --> 01:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner and thank you for the
 
01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
01:42:09.590 --> 01:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
faulkner we do we have historically
 
01:42:13.590 --> 01:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
and we continue to look at incorporating
 
01:42:16.470 --> 01:42:16.480 align:start position:0%
alternative fuel vehicles
 
01:42:18.430 --> 01:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
in our fleet
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunately today there are still
 
01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:22.870 align:start position:0%
unfortunately today there are still
limitations

01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
limitations
 
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
in our all electronic vehicles or all
 
01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles um with how far they
 
01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
can travel
 
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
in the need to stop and charge that
 
01:42:36.229 --> 01:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
vehicle during the day
 
01:42:38.950 --> 01:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
when it comes to what we call a white
 
01:42:43.109 --> 01:42:43.119 align:start position:0%
fleet or our light vehicles we continue
 
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
to watch the improvements in battery
 
01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:47.830 align:start position:0%
to watch the improvements in battery
technology

01:42:47.830 --> 01:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
technology
 
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
in ranges of vehicles and when the time
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
is right and we can do it most cost
 
01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:54.950 align:start position:0%
is right and we can do it most cost
effectively

01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
we will move forward transitioning our
 
01:43:01.750 --> 01:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
white fleet to to electric vehicles when
 
01:43:04.390 --> 01:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
it comes to the heavy fleet i want you
 
01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
to think of a large plow truck pushing a
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
very heavy load of snow
 
01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
with a very heavy salt spreader in the
 
01:43:17.350 --> 01:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
back that also takes power to control
 
01:43:19.830 --> 01:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
with levers for plows that go up and
 
01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:20.790 align:start position:0%
with levers for plows that go up and
down

01:43:20.790 --> 01:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
windshield wipers on heaters on radios
 
01:43:28.470 --> 01:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
on lights on the technology simply is
 
01:43:30.310 --> 01:43:30.320 align:start position:0%
not there today
 
01:43:33.109 --> 01:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
to power that size of vehicle
 
01:43:36.470 --> 01:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
um and frankly may not be for
 
01:43:41.510 --> 01:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
for some time um so we continue to watch
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
the technology we're very interested in
 
01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
it but it has to be at a time that makes
 
01:43:50.470 --> 01:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
both economic and efficiency sense for
 
01:43:56.310 --> 01:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:00.390 --> 01:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
any other questions on this portion of
 
01:44:02.390 --> 01:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
the presentation
 
01:44:04.870 --> 01:44:04.880 align:start position:0%
seeing the commissioner
 
01:44:04.880 --> 01:44:05.669 align:start position:0%
seeing the commissioner
i

01:44:05.669 --> 01:44:05.679 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:44:09.990 --> 01:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
did hear a reduction of one from five
 
01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:10.950 align:start position:0%
did hear a reduction of one from five
to

01:44:10.950 --> 01:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:44:13.590 --> 01:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh four million for the fuel management
 
01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:15.030 align:start position:0%
uh four million for the fuel management
system

01:44:15.030 --> 01:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:44:17.030 --> 01:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
and if i heard that correctly i believe
 
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
that leads into your next slide
 
01:44:23.189 --> 01:44:23.199 align:start position:0%
yes so as chris explained
 
01:44:24.709 --> 01:44:24.719 align:start position:0%
as we've worked through the capital
 
01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
budget process um with public works
 
01:44:30.629 --> 01:44:30.639 align:start position:0%
there was a significant increase in the
 
01:44:33.510 --> 01:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
cost of the londonderry project um that
 
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
was just presented um so the next couple
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
of slides uh deal with projects that
 
01:44:39.990 --> 01:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
were approved in
 
01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.030 align:start position:0%
were approved in
prior

01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
prior
 
01:44:44.070 --> 01:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
um capital budgets that had not yet
 
01:44:45.669 --> 01:44:45.679 align:start position:0%
entered construction
 
01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:44:48.629 --> 01:44:48.639 align:start position:0%
just as we've seen
 
01:44:50.390 --> 01:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
costs increase in some of the work that
 
01:44:52.149 --> 01:44:52.159 align:start position:0%
we have completed
 
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
we've been working with public works to
 
01:44:55.190 --> 01:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
understand what the
 
01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:56.390 align:start position:0%
understand what the
[Music]

01:44:56.390 --> 01:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:44:59.030 --> 01:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate amount to budget is for some
 
01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
of our
 
01:45:01.990 --> 01:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
previously approved projects so i'm
 
01:45:03.109 --> 01:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
going to turn it over to chris he's
 
01:45:04.629 --> 01:45:04.639 align:start position:0%
going to touch on
 
01:45:06.310 --> 01:45:06.320 align:start position:0%
three projects where
 
01:45:08.229 --> 01:45:08.239 align:start position:0%
we are concerned because the amount that
 
01:45:10.390 --> 01:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
was approved um
 
01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
during previous biennium you know may
 
01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
not be adequate going forward um so in
 
01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:17.109 align:start position:0%
not be adequate going forward um so in
addition

01:45:17.109 --> 01:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
addition
 
01:45:18.629 --> 01:45:18.639 align:start position:0%
so in addition to talking about lapse
 
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
extensions later in the week um at chris
 
01:45:22.470 --> 01:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
shea's recommendation he wanted us to
 
01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
touch very briefly on this today and
 
01:45:26.229 --> 01:45:26.239 align:start position:0%
then we can have a more robust
 
01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
conversation when we come back for the
 
01:45:30.070 --> 01:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
last presentation if that's appropriate
 
01:45:32.229 --> 01:45:32.239 align:start position:0%
well it will also play into our
 
01:45:35.109 --> 01:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
executive sessions when we get to that
 
01:45:37.830 --> 01:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
but i want to be sure that you are very
 
01:45:41.590 --> 01:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
confident that that reduction from 5 to
 
01:45:42.870 --> 01:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
4 million
 
01:45:45.750 --> 01:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
for that fuel management system
 
01:45:48.950 --> 01:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
will stand the test of this biennium and
 
01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
that when it goes to the senate you will
 
01:45:53.830 --> 01:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
not have revised figures that say no it
 
01:45:55.229 --> 01:45:55.239 align:start position:0%
has to be
 
01:45:58.629 --> 01:45:58.639 align:start position:0%
4.5 or 5 million and so thank you for
 
01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
that question mr chairman and we are
 
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
very confident so our strategy has been
 
01:46:07.030 --> 01:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
as we prepare for capital budgets we
 
01:46:08.550 --> 01:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
if we have a piece of software we want
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
to replace we do a rfi process and just
 
01:46:14.149 --> 01:46:14.159 align:start position:0%
to see what different solutions are on
 
01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
the market and that's how we came up
 
01:46:18.310 --> 01:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
with the five million dollar amount that
 
01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:19.189 align:start position:0%
with the five million dollar amount that
we

01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:46:21.510 --> 01:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
included in our agency request
 
01:46:24.070 --> 01:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
since then we have
 
01:46:25.750 --> 01:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
been working on the procurement of that
 
01:46:27.910 --> 01:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
new software so at the point that we're
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
at in the procurement process
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
we're very confident that we could
 
01:46:34.149 --> 01:46:34.159 align:start position:0%
deliver that particular project for the
 
01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
adjusted a budget amount of 4 million
 
01:46:38.310 --> 01:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:39.990 --> 01:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
so we've worked hard to time our
 
01:46:41.830 --> 01:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
procurements to make sure that we have
 
01:46:43.669 --> 01:46:43.679 align:start position:0%
the best possible information to inform
 
01:46:47.430 --> 01:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:52.070 --> 01:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:54.550 --> 01:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you mr chairman so these are
 
01:46:56.950 --> 01:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
three uh capital
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
budget items that were previously
 
01:47:01.350 --> 01:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
approved in past bienniums
 
01:47:05.270 --> 01:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:08.149 --> 01:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
since since the original appropriation
 
01:47:10.709 --> 01:47:10.719 align:start position:0%
they've been progressed either
 
01:47:13.270 --> 01:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
in an initial design or all the way up
 
01:47:17.910 --> 01:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
to advertisement and and bids received
 
01:47:20.390 --> 01:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
and the result has been that the costs
 
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
are uh dramatically higher so for
 
01:47:25.669 --> 01:47:25.679 align:start position:0%
example the first one is the manchester
 
01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
patrol shed um in this location in this
 
01:47:33.590 --> 01:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
situation here um i knew and we had um
 
01:47:36.070 --> 01:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
the existing patrol shed
 
01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
was going to be renovated and
 
01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:40.229 align:start position:0%
was going to be renovated and
additions

01:47:40.229 --> 01:47:40.239 align:start position:0%
additions
 
01:47:40.239 --> 01:47:42.310 align:start position:0%
additions
included

01:47:42.310 --> 01:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
included
 
01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:43.750 align:start position:0%
included
and

01:47:43.750 --> 01:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:45.350 align:start position:0%
and
design

01:47:45.350 --> 01:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
design
 
01:47:47.350 --> 01:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
moved forth
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
because of because and the project was
 
01:47:53.750 --> 01:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
advertised actually in in the spring of
 
01:47:56.950 --> 01:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
2020 prior to covid and then it had to
 
01:47:58.470 --> 01:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
be put on hold
 
01:48:02.070 --> 01:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
um when covert hit because of
 
01:48:05.350 --> 01:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
the impact on revenue and uncertainty
 
01:48:07.990 --> 01:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh the bids at that time um that were
 
01:48:10.310 --> 01:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
received exceeded the budget in public
 
01:48:13.430 --> 01:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
works has also since indicated that the
 
01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
current costs are even anticipated to be
 
01:48:18.550 --> 01:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
about 10 to 20 percent higher than
 
01:48:21.590 --> 01:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
um the bids received last spring
 
01:48:23.590 --> 01:48:23.600 align:start position:0%
so therefore we are requesting an
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
additional uh one million dollars
 
01:48:28.550 --> 01:48:28.560 align:start position:0%
um for this item the initial
 
01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
appropriation was 2.1 million
 
01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
and we believe the cost will now
 
01:48:36.870 --> 01:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
be in the order of 3.1 million so
 
01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
there's an additional million dollars
 
01:48:40.870 --> 01:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
that the department's requesting for for
 
01:48:43.430 --> 01:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
this item
 
01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
the second item is in addition to the
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
lancaster district office
 
01:48:50.550 --> 01:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
again design um
 
01:48:52.790 --> 01:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
and construction work was recently
 
01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
approved to advance but was delayed to
 
01:48:57.830 --> 01:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh due to covid
 
01:49:00.870 --> 01:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
this project does include an addition of
 
01:49:03.669 --> 01:49:03.679 align:start position:0%
1500 square foot of office space i think
 
01:49:04.950 --> 01:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
it renovates
 
01:49:07.590 --> 01:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
the existing roughly 2 800 square foot
 
01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:09.669 align:start position:0%
the existing roughly 2 800 square foot
facility

01:49:09.669 --> 01:49:09.679 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:49:11.590 --> 01:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
this project will address state fire
 
01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:12.550 align:start position:0%
this project will address state fire
marshal

01:49:12.550 --> 01:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
marshal
 
01:49:15.669 --> 01:49:15.679 align:start position:0%
office comments and will advertise for
 
01:49:17.109 --> 01:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
construction once that design is
 
01:49:18.950 --> 01:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
complete which we anticipate to be
 
01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:19.990 align:start position:0%
complete which we anticipate to be
shortly

01:49:19.990 --> 01:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
shortly
 
01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh design estimates from public works
 
01:49:24.790 --> 01:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
prior to covet exceeded the budget and
 
01:49:26.709 --> 01:49:26.719 align:start position:0%
now public works has also indicated that
 
01:49:28.390 --> 01:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
the common costs are anticipated to be
 
01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:29.270 align:start position:0%
the common costs are anticipated to be
even

01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
even
 
01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:32.159 align:start position:0%
higher than that by 10 to 20 percent so
 
01:49:34.310 --> 01:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
therefore we are requesting an increase
 
01:49:36.070 --> 01:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
of 450 000
 
01:49:38.629 --> 01:49:38.639 align:start position:0%
for this item the initial appropriation
 
01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
was 760 000
 
01:49:44.149 --> 01:49:44.159 align:start position:0%
so we are requesting this to be amended
 
01:49:46.550 --> 01:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
to 1.21 million
 
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
and lastly the third one was the
 
01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
district patrol shed
 
01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:51.990 align:start position:0%
district patrol shed
um

01:49:51.990 --> 01:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:53.750 --> 01:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
the initial appropriation for this item
 
01:49:56.070 --> 01:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
was 1.4 million
 
01:49:57.990 --> 01:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
it was for design and construction of a
 
01:50:00.229 --> 01:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
new patrol shed up in dixville
 
01:50:01.910 --> 01:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
on property that was acquired by the
 
01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
department from the balsams
 
01:50:06.550 --> 01:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
this project actually has been bid twice
 
01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
and put on hold
 
01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh most recently mo after after the
 
01:50:14.790 --> 01:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
latest bit due to covert um
 
01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:15.910 align:start position:0%
latest bit due to covert um
uh

01:50:15.910 --> 01:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:50:18.790 --> 01:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
in essence and also since that time the
 
01:50:20.310 --> 01:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
design will need to be revised to meet
 
01:50:22.149 --> 01:50:22.159 align:start position:0%
all the regulatory items and address
 
01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
state fire marshal office comments uh
 
01:50:28.470 --> 01:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
bids where we were much higher
 
01:50:31.350 --> 01:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
than budget and
 
01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
public works has indicated the current
 
01:50:35.830 --> 01:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
costs are anticipated to be even 10 to
 
01:50:37.350 --> 01:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
20 higher
 
01:50:39.030 --> 01:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
so therefore we're requesting seven
 
01:50:40.790 --> 01:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars to properly
 
01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
fund this item
 
01:50:44.550 --> 01:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
um so we're requesting this be amended
 
01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:48.719 align:start position:0%
to 2.1 million so in total uh this would
 
01:50:50.629 --> 01:50:50.639 align:start position:0%
these three editions
 
01:50:52.870 --> 01:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
total 2.15 million
 
01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
and if we re we reduce um the
 
01:50:58.790 --> 01:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
fuel management system by a million
 
01:51:01.229 --> 01:51:01.239 align:start position:0%
it's a net change of
 
01:51:03.270 --> 01:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
1.15 million
 
01:51:05.030 --> 01:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
that is needed
 
01:51:06.310 --> 01:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll be happy to answer
 
01:51:07.590 --> 01:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
representative jack
 
01:51:11.669 --> 01:51:11.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman this being highway
 
01:51:14.790 --> 01:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
funded makes it easier to do
 
01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:15.750 align:start position:0%
funded makes it easier to do
but

01:51:15.750 --> 01:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
it does it would impact the hospital one
 
01:51:21.030 --> 01:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
operating highway fund
 
01:51:24.390 --> 01:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
can um marie mullen tell us what the
 
01:51:26.390 --> 01:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
debt service impact on the actual
 
01:51:28.310 --> 01:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
highway fund cash flow would be if we
 
01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
were to do this
 
01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative jack thank you for
 
01:51:33.510 --> 01:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
the question
 
01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:34.390 align:start position:0%
the question
um

01:51:34.390 --> 01:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:37.990 --> 01:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
in in reviewing uh for this change um
 
01:51:40.629 --> 01:51:40.639 align:start position:0%
i have had conversations with the
 
01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
department uh the state treasury and in
 
01:51:46.390 --> 01:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
december they went out for a refunding
 
01:51:48.629 --> 01:51:48.639 align:start position:0%
on several
 
01:51:51.750 --> 01:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
bonds that were previously issued
 
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
a portion of those bonds were related to
 
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
the highway fund into
 
01:51:57.990 --> 01:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
dot projects
 
01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
and we have identified savings related
 
01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:02.159 align:start position:0%
to those refunding so we have
 
01:52:02.159 --> 01:52:03.510 align:start position:0%
to those refunding so we have
approximately

01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
01:52:06.629 --> 01:52:06.639 align:start position:0%
740 000 over the next 10 years of
 
01:52:08.550 --> 01:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
savings related to those that could
 
01:52:09.910 --> 01:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
offset this
 
01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:10.790 align:start position:0%
offset this
and

01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:52:12.870 --> 01:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
with the savings
 
01:52:15.750 --> 01:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
in fy 22 and 23
 
01:52:17.830 --> 01:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
we believe we have sufficient funds in
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
the operating budget to cover this
 
01:52:27.910 --> 01:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:30.550 --> 01:52:30.560 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:52:33.270 --> 01:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
so if we were to ex
 
01:52:37.990 --> 01:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:38.790 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:52:38.790 --> 01:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:52:40.229 --> 01:52:40.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:52:42.149 --> 01:52:42.159 align:start position:0%
i'm going to apologize ahead of time
 
01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
because this might be a real stupid
 
01:52:47.109 --> 01:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
question for the experts but are all of
 
01:52:50.229 --> 01:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
these patrol sheds do they all have to
 
01:52:52.629 --> 01:52:52.639 align:start position:0%
be designed and constructed for the
 
01:52:56.310 --> 01:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
particular site they're on or is there
 
01:52:56.320 --> 01:52:57.589 align:start position:0%
particular site they're on or is there
any

01:52:57.589 --> 01:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:52:59.910 --> 01:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
capability for
 
01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
one or two or four designs specific that
 
01:53:06.070 --> 01:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
would fit into new hampshire so they
 
01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
could be almost
 
01:53:10.709 --> 01:53:10.719 align:start position:0%
constructed off-site like a modular home
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
and delivered to a um
 
01:53:19.270 --> 01:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
the first two projects representative um
 
01:53:24.149 --> 01:53:24.159 align:start position:0%
are both additions or renovations of
 
01:53:27.030 --> 01:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
existing spaces um so unfortunately that
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
occurred it wouldn't work
 
01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:30.550 align:start position:0%
occurred it wouldn't work
um

01:53:30.550 --> 01:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:32.390 --> 01:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
the we've looked at this with public
 
01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
works in the past if there's sort of a
 
01:53:35.910 --> 01:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
standard design but you know each of our
 
01:53:38.070 --> 01:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
sites is so different
 
01:53:39.669 --> 01:53:39.679 align:start position:0%
the facilities
 
01:53:41.109 --> 01:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
that we are
 
01:53:43.270 --> 01:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
replacing um
 
01:53:45.189 --> 01:53:45.199 align:start position:0%
serve different purposes
 
01:53:45.199 --> 01:53:46.629 align:start position:0%
serve different purposes
um

01:53:46.629 --> 01:53:46.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:48.790 --> 01:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
dave touched on it earlier but our crew
 
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
size from shed to shed is quite
 
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
different um some sheds we have a small
 
01:53:55.030 --> 01:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
number of state employees but we have a
 
01:53:56.709 --> 01:53:56.719 align:start position:0%
large number of contractors there in the
 
01:53:56.719 --> 01:53:57.669 align:start position:0%
large number of contractors there in the
winter

01:53:57.669 --> 01:53:57.679 align:start position:0%
winter
 
01:53:59.910 --> 01:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
other sheds we have a much larger
 
01:54:02.950 --> 01:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
workforce year-round um
 
01:54:04.870 --> 01:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
and their state positions that are
 
01:54:06.629 --> 01:54:06.639 align:start position:0%
responsible for maintaining the roadway
 
01:54:06.639 --> 01:54:07.510 align:start position:0%
responsible for maintaining the roadway
so

01:54:07.510 --> 01:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
um no two sheds are the same
 
01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:10.950 align:start position:0%
um no two sheds are the same
unfortunately

01:54:10.950 --> 01:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
01:54:13.030 --> 01:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know if perhaps dave um all
 
01:54:16.950 --> 01:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:21.430 --> 01:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um this is just in
 
01:54:27.030 --> 01:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
anticipation of getting some other kind
 
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
of questions regarding this i i
 
01:54:31.270 --> 01:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
personally don't have any problem with
 
01:54:33.430 --> 01:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
these figures however i want to be able
 
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
to answer the question should it come up
 
01:54:39.270 --> 01:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
how your uh original let's just and i
 
01:54:41.189 --> 01:54:41.199 align:start position:0%
noticed this common for all three of
 
01:54:42.629 --> 01:54:42.639 align:start position:0%
these projects
 
01:54:44.709 --> 01:54:44.719 align:start position:0%
your original all three of them say that
 
01:54:47.109 --> 01:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
you're anticipating 10 to 20 percent
 
01:54:48.629 --> 01:54:48.639 align:start position:0%
higher costs
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
and let's just go with that 20
 
01:54:51.830 --> 01:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
figure let's say they're all going to be
 
01:54:54.870 --> 01:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
20 higher costs and yet you're asking
 
01:54:56.470 --> 01:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
for all three of them
 
01:54:57.910 --> 01:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
over 50
 
01:55:00.550 --> 01:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
of the original budget
 
01:55:04.390 --> 01:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
so how do we reconcile that
 
01:55:06.149 --> 01:55:06.159 align:start position:0%
should the question come up
 
01:55:08.629 --> 01:55:08.639 align:start position:0%
because we went up 20 you're asking for
 
01:55:11.430 --> 01:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
50 over the original budget on all three
 
01:55:12.550 --> 01:55:12.560 align:start position:0%
of them
 
01:55:14.229 --> 01:55:14.239 align:start position:0%
so representative thank you for the
 
01:55:15.750 --> 01:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
question and and that's a good
 
01:55:19.030 --> 01:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
observation um the 20 percent
 
01:55:22.149 --> 01:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
the 10 to 20 percent higher is is
 
01:55:23.510 --> 01:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
based on
 
01:55:26.790 --> 01:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
um higher than the bids we received last
 
01:55:29.270 --> 01:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
spring summer when covet hit
 
01:55:29.280 --> 01:55:30.950 align:start position:0%
spring summer when covet hit
so

01:55:30.950 --> 01:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
when when those bids came in they were
 
01:55:37.669 --> 01:55:37.679 align:start position:0%
higher than the the the budget and now
 
01:55:39.990 --> 01:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
since that time uh costs have even
 
01:55:42.550 --> 01:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
increased by 10 20 we've actually used
 
01:55:46.149 --> 01:55:46.159 align:start position:0%
the roughly 15 figure to come up with
 
01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
the uh the additional amount requested
 
01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:50.149 align:start position:0%
the uh the additional amount requested
but

01:55:50.149 --> 01:55:50.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:55:52.149 --> 01:55:52.159 align:start position:0%
um in the case of manchester and
 
01:55:52.159 --> 01:55:53.189 align:start position:0%
um in the case of manchester and
dixville

01:55:53.189 --> 01:55:53.199 align:start position:0%
dixville
 
01:55:56.950 --> 01:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
the bids that were received uh came in
 
01:56:00.870 --> 01:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
considerably higher than the the budget
 
01:56:02.709 --> 01:56:02.719 align:start position:0%
thank you that's that's
 
01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
exactly what i wanted to hear
 
01:56:06.470 --> 01:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
01:56:08.310 --> 01:56:08.320 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
01:56:10.310 --> 01:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:56:13.189 --> 01:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
i i'm just curious it seems like there's
 
01:56:16.310 --> 01:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of pent-up demand for construction
 
01:56:18.629 --> 01:56:18.639 align:start position:0%
in the state and i wondered what you
 
01:56:21.189 --> 01:56:21.199 align:start position:0%
thought your how your schedule would be
 
01:56:21.199 --> 01:56:22.870 align:start position:0%
thought your how your schedule would be
and

01:56:22.870 --> 01:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:24.629 --> 01:56:24.639 align:start position:0%
if you get your projects done there'll
 
01:56:27.990 --> 01:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
be fewer cost overruns in the future so
 
01:56:29.510 --> 01:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
i just wondered if you had any thoughts
 
01:56:31.430 --> 01:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so we rely heavily on the bureau of
 
01:56:36.310 --> 01:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
public works for these estimates frankly
 
01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:38.229 align:start position:0%
public works for these estimates frankly
um

01:56:38.229 --> 01:56:38.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:40.229 --> 01:56:40.239 align:start position:0%
they they hire the architect and the
 
01:56:42.870 --> 01:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
consultant and come up with with
 
01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
the cost estimates for work that is you
 
01:56:46.950 --> 01:56:46.960 align:start position:0%
know way more on the
 
01:56:49.589 --> 01:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
highways and bridges um and they're more
 
01:56:52.470 --> 01:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
experts in the building area but um with
 
01:56:53.910 --> 01:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
all that said
 
01:56:55.589 --> 01:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
um we do
 
01:56:57.830 --> 01:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
you know so
 
01:57:00.950 --> 01:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
we we will need approval of this item so
 
01:57:02.229 --> 01:57:02.239 align:start position:0%
we cannot
 
01:57:04.870 --> 01:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
we cannot award the contract until
 
01:57:07.750 --> 01:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
after june so we're targeting probably a
 
01:57:10.310 --> 01:57:10.320 align:start position:0%
july time frame uh to be able to award a
 
01:57:12.550 --> 01:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
contract and we've kind of backed things
 
01:57:15.830 --> 01:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
in so if we get a positive response from
 
01:57:18.470 --> 01:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
from this committee
 
01:57:21.669 --> 01:57:21.679 align:start position:0%
we may put these bids out in
 
01:57:24.550 --> 01:57:24.560 align:start position:0%
maybe the may time frame um
 
01:57:26.310 --> 01:57:26.320 align:start position:0%
you know certainly
 
01:57:29.189 --> 01:57:29.199 align:start position:0%
we can't put them out as of yet too soon
 
01:57:31.270 --> 01:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
without knowing that we have approval
 
01:57:33.990 --> 01:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
for this additional increase
 
01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:34.870 align:start position:0%
for this additional increase
but

01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:57:37.030 --> 01:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
we are hopeful that
 
01:57:38.870 --> 01:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a competitive process
 
01:57:41.430 --> 01:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
and the estimates that public works has
 
01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
provided us um are going to be
 
01:57:46.629 --> 01:57:46.639 align:start position:0%
you know in line with what um what the
 
01:57:48.550 --> 01:57:48.560 align:start position:0%
bidding environment will be you know
 
01:57:50.390 --> 01:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
that time frame but i agree with you
 
01:57:52.550 --> 01:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative it seems like there's a
 
01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
lot of pent up demand
 
01:58:01.830 --> 01:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:05.430 --> 01:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
see no other questions i do have one on
 
01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:06.470 align:start position:0%
see no other questions i do have one on
this

01:58:06.470 --> 01:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:58:06.480 --> 01:58:07.510 align:start position:0%
this
um

01:58:07.510 --> 01:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:10.310 --> 01:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
by you like if we were to accept this by
 
01:58:12.870 --> 01:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
using that one million that you say you
 
01:58:14.229 --> 01:58:14.239 align:start position:0%
can save
 
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:58:18.950 --> 01:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
what is in house bill 25 currently we
 
01:58:21.510 --> 01:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
still have to come up with a million in
 
01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:22.550 align:start position:0%
still have to come up with a million in
change

01:58:22.550 --> 01:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:58:23.910 --> 01:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
to fund this
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
which means that anything additionally
 
01:58:27.510 --> 01:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
you ask for
 
01:58:30.030 --> 01:58:30.040 align:start position:0%
is on top of that
 
01:58:33.189 --> 01:58:33.199 align:start position:0%
1.15 million
 
01:58:34.390 --> 01:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
am i correct
 
01:58:37.990 --> 01:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.550 align:start position:0%
 
chris

01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
yes that is correct representative
 
01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
now i'm mr shay
 
01:58:47.910 --> 01:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you represent graham i just wanted
 
01:58:50.149 --> 01:58:50.159 align:start position:0%
to jump in for a moment
 
01:58:50.159 --> 01:58:51.750 align:start position:0%
to jump in for a moment
um

01:58:51.750 --> 01:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
just to make if the committee is is um
 
01:58:55.830 --> 01:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
thinking this is something they might
 
01:58:57.510 --> 01:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
like to do
 
01:58:59.910 --> 01:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
that one approach to to taking care of
 
01:59:02.310 --> 01:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
this instead of going back to the three
 
01:59:03.589 --> 01:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
projects that are identified
 
01:59:05.350 --> 01:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
individually and
 
01:59:07.830 --> 01:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
um amending the appropriations back in
 
01:59:10.629 --> 01:59:10.639 align:start position:0%
those house bill 25s you could just put
 
01:59:13.830 --> 01:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
a new section in this house bill 25
 
01:59:16.390 --> 01:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
for the appropriation of 2.15 million
 
01:59:16.400 --> 01:59:17.510 align:start position:0%
for the appropriation of 2.15 million
dollars

01:59:17.510 --> 01:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:59:20.149 --> 01:59:20.159 align:start position:0%
um you could leave it as a as a block
 
01:59:21.270 --> 01:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
amount so that would give a little
 
01:59:23.910 --> 01:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
flexibility to the department in case
 
01:59:27.669 --> 01:59:27.679 align:start position:0%
it's 20 in one instance but only a 10
 
01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
increase in another instance so they
 
01:59:30.950 --> 01:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
could move some money between those
 
01:59:32.390 --> 01:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
three projects
 
01:59:34.550 --> 01:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
i mean we could have it tied again to
 
01:59:36.070 --> 01:59:36.080 align:start position:0%
those three projects if it was a new
 
01:59:38.310 --> 01:59:38.320 align:start position:0%
appropriation in this budget otherwise
 
01:59:40.470 --> 01:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
if you go back to those
 
01:59:42.229 --> 01:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
existing projects
 
01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to see a lot of language in
 
01:59:45.510 --> 01:59:45.520 align:start position:0%
house bill 25
 
01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:46.870 align:start position:0%
house bill 25
striking

01:59:46.870 --> 01:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
striking
 
01:59:49.430 --> 01:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
amounts and putting new amounts in and
 
01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
um it becomes
 
01:59:53.510 --> 01:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
more confusing to look at and to try to
 
01:59:56.310 --> 01:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
explain so it's just a suggestion unless
 
01:59:59.430 --> 01:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
the department has um a strong desire to
 
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
go back and amend the previous capital
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
budget or do not want to group
 
02:00:04.870 --> 02:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
the dollars into a single appropriation
 
02:00:07.030 --> 02:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
for the three projects
 
02:00:09.270 --> 02:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr shea i just made a note
 
02:00:12.790 --> 02:00:12.800 align:start position:0%
of that but when we get into our actual
 
02:00:15.189 --> 02:00:15.199 align:start position:0%
work sessions and exec sessions
 
02:00:18.149 --> 02:00:18.159 align:start position:0%
if i forget if somebody on the committee
 
02:00:21.510 --> 02:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
or from lba would remind me so that we
 
02:00:24.870 --> 02:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
can at least discuss this uh this
 
02:00:28.870 --> 02:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:31.589 --> 02:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
mr chairman if i may the department
 
02:00:33.750 --> 02:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
very much supports what
 
02:00:37.270 --> 02:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:39.669 --> 02:00:39.679 align:start position:0%
it probably would work easier assuming
 
02:00:40.709 --> 02:00:40.719 align:start position:0%
that we
 
02:00:44.229 --> 02:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:47.270 --> 02:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
any other questions on this
 
02:00:49.350 --> 02:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
section and proposal on these three
 
02:00:51.350 --> 02:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
prior appropriations
 
02:00:53.669 --> 02:00:53.679 align:start position:0%
if not
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
unfunded med um
 
02:00:55.920 --> 02:00:58.149 align:start position:0%
unfunded med um
desires

02:00:58.149 --> 02:00:58.159 align:start position:0%
desires
 
02:01:00.070 --> 02:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
before we go to that uh mr chairman i'm
 
02:01:01.830 --> 02:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
sorry i think perhaps representative
 
02:01:03.589 --> 02:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
thompson has a question i don't think he
 
02:01:05.189 --> 02:01:05.199 align:start position:0%
raised his hand electronically but i've
 
02:01:06.790 --> 02:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
seen him motion a couple of times on my
 
02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:08.550 align:start position:0%
seen him motion a couple of times on my
screen

02:01:08.550 --> 02:01:08.560 align:start position:0%
screen
 
02:01:10.790 --> 02:01:10.800 align:start position:0%
well with with screen sharing i don't
 
02:01:14.149 --> 02:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
see much um representative thompson
 
02:01:17.030 --> 02:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chairman and
 
02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:18.149 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chairman and
commissioner

02:01:18.149 --> 02:01:18.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
02:01:18.159 --> 02:01:19.270 align:start position:0%
commissioner
um

02:01:19.270 --> 02:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:21.510 --> 02:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
with respect to the dicksville project
 
02:01:23.350 --> 02:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
which is in my district
 
02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:24.310 align:start position:0%
which is in my district
um

02:01:24.310 --> 02:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:26.470 --> 02:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
this has kind of been a
 
02:01:28.709 --> 02:01:28.719 align:start position:0%
topic of discussion in the north country
 
02:01:31.350 --> 02:01:31.360 align:start position:0%
for a number of years now
 
02:01:33.910 --> 02:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
since the balsams project seemed to come
 
02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:35.109 align:start position:0%
since the balsams project seemed to come
alive

02:01:35.109 --> 02:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
alive
 
02:01:38.629 --> 02:01:38.639 align:start position:0%
and has since basically died
 
02:01:41.669 --> 02:01:41.679 align:start position:0%
um the original figure that we heard for
 
02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
relocating the shed
 
02:01:46.629 --> 02:01:46.639 align:start position:0%
that's up there currently was a half a
 
02:01:48.390 --> 02:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
02:01:52.070 --> 02:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
and now we're up to 1.4 million dollars
 
02:01:52.080 --> 02:01:54.550 align:start position:0%
and now we're up to 1.4 million dollars
um

02:01:54.550 --> 02:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:58.229 --> 02:01:58.239 align:start position:0%
and i think probably um
 
02:02:01.270 --> 02:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
chris's assumption that the costs are
 
02:02:03.589 --> 02:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
going to be 50 percent higher or this
 
02:02:07.030 --> 02:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:09.510 --> 02:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
there is virtually no work in the north
 
02:02:11.589 --> 02:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
carolina i've owned a construction
 
02:02:14.149 --> 02:02:14.159 align:start position:0%
company for 45 years
 
02:02:16.470 --> 02:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
so i can tell you that that's true i
 
02:02:18.310 --> 02:02:18.320 align:start position:0%
would think that this could be done much
 
02:02:19.750 --> 02:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
cheaper than this
 
02:02:24.149 --> 02:02:24.159 align:start position:0%
and i still question the need for it um
 
02:02:27.350 --> 02:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
maybe you can explain to me
 
02:02:29.669 --> 02:02:29.679 align:start position:0%
why we need this
 
02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
i guess it's my basic question
 
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
so representative thompson thank you for
 
02:02:36.550 --> 02:02:36.560 align:start position:0%
the question i'll let dave rodrigue
 
02:02:39.109 --> 02:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
address the history of this particular
 
02:02:41.990 --> 02:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
project and on the cost estimates
 
02:02:43.430 --> 02:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
and explain from an operations
 
02:02:45.589 --> 02:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
perspective why we really
 
02:02:50.629 --> 02:02:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:53.109 --> 02:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much for for the
 
02:02:55.430 --> 02:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
question and it gives me an opportunity
 
02:02:57.669 --> 02:02:57.679 align:start position:0%
to address a couple of things
 
02:03:01.109 --> 02:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
the first thing is please be assured
 
02:03:04.229 --> 02:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
that the department of transportation
 
02:03:07.830 --> 02:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
is as disappointed as everybody
 
02:03:10.870 --> 02:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
with the increase in cost for these
 
02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
projects that that we
 
02:03:15.270 --> 02:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
we see um
 
02:03:19.189 --> 02:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
i get sticker shock every time i i see
 
02:03:21.669 --> 02:03:21.679 align:start position:0%
an estimate however
 
02:03:24.550 --> 02:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
every building we construct needs to
 
02:03:26.629 --> 02:03:26.639 align:start position:0%
follow every
 
02:03:29.830 --> 02:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
building code every state fire marshall
 
02:03:32.709 --> 02:03:32.719 align:start position:0%
requirement every requirement that the
 
02:03:36.470 --> 02:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
legislature puts on buildings for energy
 
02:03:39.030 --> 02:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
efficiency and everything else which we
 
02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
support they're they're good in the long
 
02:03:41.520 --> 02:03:42.390 align:start position:0%
support they're they're good in the long
run

02:03:42.390 --> 02:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
run
 
02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:43.830 align:start position:0%
run
however

02:03:43.830 --> 02:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:03:46.470 --> 02:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
they do drive up the cost of
 
02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:47.910 align:start position:0%
they do drive up the cost of
construction

02:03:47.910 --> 02:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
construction
 
02:03:51.669 --> 02:03:51.679 align:start position:0%
with respect to lancaster and dixville
 
02:03:54.870 --> 02:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
um those estimates are higher because
 
02:03:57.990 --> 02:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
those projects are in the north country
 
02:04:01.189 --> 02:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
these these the contractors for these
 
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
projects will be determined by low bid
 
02:04:08.310 --> 02:04:08.320 align:start position:0%
so anybody is welcome to bid on them and
 
02:04:11.189 --> 02:04:11.199 align:start position:0%
we strongly um would like some some
 
02:04:13.669 --> 02:04:13.679 align:start position:0%
lower bids and some lower costs to
 
02:04:16.390 --> 02:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
construct these and hopefully we will
 
02:04:17.589 --> 02:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
see that
 
02:04:20.709 --> 02:04:20.719 align:start position:0%
um but we have not seen that recently
 
02:04:23.350 --> 02:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
certainly in the new shed in lisbon we
 
02:04:27.270 --> 02:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
did not see that we we saw increases
 
02:04:30.629 --> 02:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
um we did look as as others have
 
02:04:34.390 --> 02:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
suggested this morning at consolidation
 
02:04:35.910 --> 02:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
the dixville
 
02:04:39.430 --> 02:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
patrol shed has nothing to do with the
 
02:04:42.550 --> 02:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
balsams and the balsams resort it has
 
02:04:45.589 --> 02:04:45.599 align:start position:0%
everything to do with dicksville notch
 
02:04:49.030 --> 02:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
in route 26 in the micro climate that
 
02:04:51.910 --> 02:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
exists there in the trucks that start
 
02:04:54.390 --> 02:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
driving through there at three in the
 
02:04:56.790 --> 02:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
morning trying to get up through the
 
02:04:56.800 --> 02:04:57.750 align:start position:0%
morning trying to get up through the
notch

02:04:57.750 --> 02:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
notch
 
02:05:01.830 --> 02:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
and we need this local shed that is not
 
02:05:04.270 --> 02:05:04.280 align:start position:0%
staffed 24 7
 
02:05:06.470 --> 02:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
365 days a year
 
02:05:09.510 --> 02:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
it is staffed during the winter time
 
02:05:12.790 --> 02:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
to have people there available to
 
02:05:16.390 --> 02:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
continuously keep that notch open so
 
02:05:18.950 --> 02:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
that commerce can move through the north
 
02:05:21.669 --> 02:05:21.679 align:start position:0%
country if there was a way to
 
02:05:25.270 --> 02:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
consolidate this we we would do that but
 
02:05:28.790 --> 02:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
we would not be able to keep route 26
 
02:05:31.189 --> 02:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
open the way it has been
 
02:05:36.229 --> 02:05:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:39.350 --> 02:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:39.360 --> 02:05:40.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:05:40.310 --> 02:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:43.030 --> 02:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
let's see no other questions
 
02:05:45.350 --> 02:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
and i would reiterate what i've said
 
02:05:48.229 --> 02:05:48.239 align:start position:0%
before about if you want to ask a
 
02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
question please raise your electronic
 
02:05:52.629 --> 02:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
hand right now
 
02:05:54.149 --> 02:05:54.159 align:start position:0%
i can only see
 
02:05:57.669 --> 02:05:57.679 align:start position:0%
a small fraction of those who are on the
 
02:05:57.679 --> 02:05:59.270 align:start position:0%
a small fraction of those who are on the
zoom

02:05:59.270 --> 02:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
zoom
 
02:06:03.430 --> 02:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
so plea please do that commissioner that
 
02:06:05.350 --> 02:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
your unfunded
 
02:06:05.360 --> 02:06:06.550 align:start position:0%
your unfunded
needs

02:06:06.550 --> 02:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
needs
 
02:06:10.790 --> 02:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
which are going to be a harder sell even
 
02:06:12.550 --> 02:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to
 
02:06:14.310 --> 02:06:14.320 align:start position:0%
very quickly just walk you through some
 
02:06:15.990 --> 02:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
of these projects to give you a sense of
 
02:06:17.510 --> 02:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
the work that
 
02:06:19.510 --> 02:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
was not unfortunately supported in the
 
02:06:21.030 --> 02:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
governor's phase
 
02:06:22.229 --> 02:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
primarily because we saw that
 
02:06:24.310 --> 02:06:24.320 align:start position:0%
significant cost increase in the
 
02:06:26.629 --> 02:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
londonderry project
 
02:06:29.109 --> 02:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
we talked earlier about our strategy
 
02:06:30.709 --> 02:06:30.719 align:start position:0%
when it comes to
 
02:06:33.030 --> 02:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
estimating the capital budget needs for
 
02:06:34.470 --> 02:06:34.480 align:start position:0%
software projects you know we've been
 
02:06:36.629 --> 02:06:36.639 align:start position:0%
trying to time our procurements to have
 
02:06:40.870 --> 02:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
good information and solid uh cost data
 
02:06:42.870 --> 02:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
to inform the process
 
02:06:45.189 --> 02:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
likewise we've been trying to advocate
 
02:06:45.199 --> 02:06:46.470 align:start position:0%
likewise we've been trying to advocate
um

02:06:46.470 --> 02:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:49.109 --> 02:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
for the design funds for our
 
02:06:49.119 --> 02:06:49.910 align:start position:0%
for the design funds for our
uh

02:06:49.910 --> 02:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:06:49.920 --> 02:06:51.030 align:start position:0%
uh
capital

02:06:51.030 --> 02:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
capital
 
02:06:53.430 --> 02:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
vertical construction projects um in one
 
02:06:55.510 --> 02:06:55.520 align:start position:0%
biennium so that we can advance the
 
02:06:58.629 --> 02:06:58.639 align:start position:0%
design adequately to then have real
 
02:07:00.229 --> 02:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
numbers when we're talking about what
 
02:07:02.470 --> 02:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
the cost of construction is going to be
 
02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
um and trying to secure those dollars um
 
02:07:06.790 --> 02:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
so the remaining projects that chris is
 
02:07:09.669 --> 02:07:09.679 align:start position:0%
going to go through very quickly um
 
02:07:11.910 --> 02:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
this week these were requests for design
 
02:07:15.030 --> 02:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
funds only to be able to advance some
 
02:07:17.430 --> 02:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
projects and then have good numbers as
 
02:07:19.750 --> 02:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
we go into the next capital budget
 
02:07:21.350 --> 02:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
and are advocating for dollars for
 
02:07:24.629 --> 02:07:24.639 align:start position:0%
construction and so these are all
 
02:07:26.390 --> 02:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
different building projects
 
02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:27.589 align:start position:0%
different building projects
um

02:07:27.589 --> 02:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:30.390 --> 02:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
and these estimates are designed only
 
02:07:30.400 --> 02:07:34.390 align:start position:0%
and these estimates are designed only
chris

02:07:34.390 --> 02:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:37.109 --> 02:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
yes so thank you commissioner um so
 
02:07:38.790 --> 02:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
actually this first one was not just for
 
02:07:41.430 --> 02:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
design this was for a roof replacement
 
02:07:45.350 --> 02:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
um this was our sixth priority um in
 
02:07:47.830 --> 02:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
total the the the five prior the five
 
02:07:49.109 --> 02:07:49.119 align:start position:0%
items that were not funded by the
 
02:07:51.510 --> 02:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
governor i think total roughly 2.2 2.3
 
02:07:53.589 --> 02:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
million this one here was a little under
 
02:07:56.390 --> 02:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
300 000 it was to replace an existing
 
02:08:00.390 --> 02:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
roof uh that was constructed in 16 1969
 
02:08:02.229 --> 02:08:02.239 align:start position:0%
um it's an aluminum roof that was
 
02:08:04.310 --> 02:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
designed with only two inches of
 
02:08:07.189 --> 02:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
insulation which has caused some issues
 
02:08:11.589 --> 02:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
with um with snow and ice melt um and
 
02:08:13.910 --> 02:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
frankly it has caused some damage to the
 
02:08:16.550 --> 02:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
building and certainly a serious issue
 
02:08:19.750 --> 02:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
when large sheets of snow and ice uh
 
02:08:22.229 --> 02:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
slide off the building um you know
 
02:08:24.470 --> 02:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
certainly we would also uh by by
 
02:08:27.270 --> 02:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
completing this um this roof replacement
 
02:08:29.030 --> 02:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
we would also see some energy
 
02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:30.310 align:start position:0%
we would also see some energy
efficiencies

02:08:30.310 --> 02:08:30.320 align:start position:0%
efficiencies
 
02:08:32.390 --> 02:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
um but um
 
02:08:33.990 --> 02:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
you know we realize we need to
 
02:08:37.589 --> 02:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
prioritize uh items so this uh this um
 
02:08:41.430 --> 02:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
just to make the cut um
 
02:08:43.589 --> 02:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
and i think next slide will show a
 
02:08:46.790 --> 02:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
picture of the facility um
 
02:08:48.790 --> 02:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
and you know certainly i think this is
 
02:08:51.270 --> 02:08:51.280 align:start position:0%
an item that that can wait until the
 
02:08:53.510 --> 02:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
next biennium
 
02:08:55.189 --> 02:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
next next slide
 
02:08:58.310 --> 02:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
uh this was actually for um it was 200
 
02:09:00.229 --> 02:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for the design of this
 
02:09:02.069 --> 02:09:02.079 align:start position:0%
patrol shed facility as the commissioner
 
02:09:03.990 --> 02:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
noted we'd like to get the design
 
02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
started so we can get a better idea of
 
02:09:08.870 --> 02:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
what the construction um cost would be
 
02:09:11.990 --> 02:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh so we can put that forth um at the
 
02:09:14.149 --> 02:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
you know in the next biennium this
 
02:09:18.149 --> 02:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
facility is um over 90 years old um it
 
02:09:21.109 --> 02:09:21.119 align:start position:0%
is undersized um it does not meet modern
 
02:09:23.189 --> 02:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
uh building codes uh electric codes and
 
02:09:25.669 --> 02:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
mechanical codes you know so certainly
 
02:09:27.589 --> 02:09:27.599 align:start position:0%
this facility is
 
02:09:27.599 --> 02:09:28.629 align:start position:0%
this facility is
um

02:09:28.629 --> 02:09:28.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:30.390 --> 02:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
a facility that will need to be
 
02:09:33.109 --> 02:09:33.119 align:start position:0%
addressed in the near future
 
02:09:35.830 --> 02:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
and the next slide kind of shows
 
02:09:40.870 --> 02:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
a picture of of the facility um
 
02:09:42.870 --> 02:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
and then you know
 
02:09:45.350 --> 02:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
kind of shows how cramped the facility
 
02:09:49.669 --> 02:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
is when you put a plow truck inside
 
02:09:52.390 --> 02:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:55.109 --> 02:09:55.119 align:start position:0%
um this is
 
02:09:56.870 --> 02:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
the milford patrol shed again
 
02:09:59.750 --> 02:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
replacement design i believe this was
 
02:10:02.550 --> 02:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
roughly three hundred thousand um
 
02:10:04.229 --> 02:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
dollars excuse me three hundred fifty
 
02:10:07.189 --> 02:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for this design uh this
 
02:10:10.390 --> 02:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
facility was built in 1939 so
 
02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:11.669 align:start position:0%
facility was built in 1939 so
um

02:10:11.669 --> 02:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:13.589 --> 02:10:13.599 align:start position:0%
over 80 years old
 
02:10:17.270 --> 02:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
it is also undersized does not meet um
 
02:10:19.589 --> 02:10:19.599 align:start position:0%
not capable of storing all the uh all
 
02:10:21.589 --> 02:10:21.599 align:start position:0%
the maintenance vehicles
 
02:10:23.910 --> 02:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
does not meet modern building codes uh
 
02:10:26.229 --> 02:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
is obsolete and
 
02:10:28.229 --> 02:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
um you know really what we're reviewing
 
02:10:30.950 --> 02:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
here is to site um
 
02:10:33.669 --> 02:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
a new facility on the existing property
 
02:10:35.990 --> 02:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh again this was just for the design to
 
02:10:37.990 --> 02:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
better understand what the construction
 
02:10:40.470 --> 02:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
funding needs are and that would be uh
 
02:10:42.709 --> 02:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
asked to be appropriated uh at in the
 
02:10:45.750 --> 02:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
future um biennium
 
02:10:47.589 --> 02:10:47.599 align:start position:0%
uh and next slide kind of shows a
 
02:10:50.550 --> 02:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
picture of the facility um if you go on
 
02:10:51.990 --> 02:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
the next slide
 
02:10:54.950 --> 02:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
um kind of again cramped quarters when
 
02:10:58.870 --> 02:10:58.880 align:start position:0%
you when you start to insert um the plow
 
02:11:00.470 --> 02:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
trucks inside the facility i believe
 
02:11:02.550 --> 02:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
this facility can't even
 
02:11:02.560 --> 02:11:03.589 align:start position:0%
this facility can't even
house

02:11:03.589 --> 02:11:03.599 align:start position:0%
house
 
02:11:05.510 --> 02:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
a plow truck with all the equipment
 
02:11:07.350 --> 02:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
which is certainly problematic because
 
02:11:08.870 --> 02:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
we mount the equipment at the start of
 
02:11:10.709 --> 02:11:10.719 align:start position:0%
the winter and do not take the equipment
 
02:11:14.149 --> 02:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
off until after the winter is completed
 
02:11:16.390 --> 02:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
next slide
 
02:11:19.669 --> 02:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
this is um again a request for five
 
02:11:21.430 --> 02:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars to start the
 
02:11:23.189 --> 02:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
design for
 
02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
a new satellite garage
 
02:11:28.310 --> 02:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
for the lancaster mechanical services
 
02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:29.990 align:start position:0%
for the lancaster mechanical services
mechanical

02:11:29.990 --> 02:11:30.000 align:start position:0%

02:11:33.430 --> 02:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
bureau you know the existing structure
 
02:11:36.950 --> 02:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
was constructed in 1981
 
02:11:38.629 --> 02:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
so certainly not as old as the other
 
02:11:40.550 --> 02:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
facilities but this layout of this
 
02:11:43.189 --> 02:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
building is obsolete and really unsafe
 
02:11:44.950 --> 02:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
it lacks the ability to lift fleet
 
02:11:46.470 --> 02:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
vehicles in the air
 
02:11:46.480 --> 02:11:47.430 align:start position:0%
vehicles in the air
um

02:11:47.430 --> 02:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:49.430 --> 02:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
you know right now vehicles need to
 
02:11:50.870 --> 02:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
slide under
 
02:11:53.189 --> 02:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
excuse me employees need to slide under
 
02:11:56.950 --> 02:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
underneath um heavy fleet units so it is
 
02:11:58.790 --> 02:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
problematic in that regard not very
 
02:12:00.790 --> 02:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
efficient um
 
02:12:03.550 --> 02:12:03.560 align:start position:0%
and also not uh not
 
02:12:07.189 --> 02:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
ergonomic um
 
02:12:09.189 --> 02:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
several pictures are shown
 
02:12:12.950 --> 02:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
on the next page of this facility again
 
02:12:14.470 --> 02:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
this is not a typical mechanical
 
02:12:14.480 --> 02:12:15.669 align:start position:0%
this is not a typical mechanical

02:12:15.669 --> 02:12:15.679 align:start position:0%

02:12:17.990 --> 02:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
garage that you would you would see
 
02:12:21.030 --> 02:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
and lastly um the last item
 
02:12:23.990 --> 02:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
um there was you know unfunded list was
 
02:12:26.310 --> 02:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
500 000 and this is actually not a
 
02:12:28.149 --> 02:12:28.159 align:start position:0%
design this is for the continued
 
02:12:30.790 --> 02:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
replacements of our under underground
 
02:12:32.550 --> 02:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
fuel tank
 
02:12:35.669 --> 02:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
replacement program um as you know the
 
02:12:37.990 --> 02:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
department currently has roughly 40 fuel
 
02:12:40.229 --> 02:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
sites that have underground storage
 
02:12:40.239 --> 02:12:41.189 align:start position:0%
sites that have underground storage
tanks

02:12:41.189 --> 02:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
tanks
 
02:12:45.109 --> 02:12:45.119 align:start position:0%
and apprentices that are 25 years older
 
02:12:47.109 --> 02:12:47.119 align:start position:0%
each biennium we try to
 
02:12:49.830 --> 02:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
allocate one to two million dollars
 
02:12:52.629 --> 02:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
for this program to replace the most
 
02:12:55.030 --> 02:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
the most efficient or oldest
 
02:12:57.910 --> 02:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
underground storage tanks to prevent any
 
02:12:59.589 --> 02:12:59.599 align:start position:0%
environmental issues
 
02:13:01.430 --> 02:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
from from
 
02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:02.629 align:start position:0%
from from
resulting

02:13:02.629 --> 02:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
resulting
 
02:13:05.430 --> 02:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
um you know and at the bottom of the
 
02:13:09.270 --> 02:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
page there under uh item three it just
 
02:13:12.709 --> 02:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
shows um several several locations where
 
02:13:15.030 --> 02:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
we have tanks that are that are over 30
 
02:13:16.870 --> 02:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
years old
 
02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
and you know potentially problematic
 
02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
from from an environmental standpoint so
 
02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:22.870 align:start position:0%
from from an environmental standpoint so
um

02:13:22.870 --> 02:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:25.669 --> 02:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
this is an area that we we have we try
 
02:13:26.870 --> 02:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
to replace
 
02:13:31.109 --> 02:13:31.119 align:start position:0%
um one to two to three tanks um a year
 
02:13:34.470 --> 02:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
um and um you know certainly this is an
 
02:13:36.950 --> 02:13:36.960 align:start position:0%
area that um
 
02:13:38.870 --> 02:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
we we uh we
 
02:13:41.750 --> 02:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
try to advocate for in each biennium
 
02:13:43.750 --> 02:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
so those were the five items you know
 
02:13:45.430 --> 02:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
certainly we understand
 
02:13:48.870 --> 02:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
the um precarious nature of
 
02:13:50.709 --> 02:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
the highway fund and
 
02:13:52.069 --> 02:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
the situation
 
02:13:54.709 --> 02:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
um but we want to present these items to
 
02:13:56.069 --> 02:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
the committee to give the committee an
 
02:13:57.910 --> 02:13:57.920 align:start position:0%
understanding of
 
02:14:00.229 --> 02:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
which five items we we saw as a priority
 
02:14:01.669 --> 02:14:01.679 align:start position:0%
but due to
 
02:14:03.109 --> 02:14:03.119 align:start position:0%
primarily the increased cost for the
 
02:14:05.109 --> 02:14:05.119 align:start position:0%
londonderry location
 
02:14:06.550 --> 02:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
we're not able to move forward with
 
02:14:09.430 --> 02:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:12.310 --> 02:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from members of
 
02:14:14.229 --> 02:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:14:16.069 --> 02:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
on this
 
02:14:23.109 --> 02:14:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:24.950 --> 02:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative newman uh representative
 
02:14:26.470 --> 02:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
newman yes
 
02:14:27.589 --> 02:14:27.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:14:30.550 --> 02:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
um could i just ask is there a
 
02:14:34.149 --> 02:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
an alarm system or something set up in
 
02:14:36.870 --> 02:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
case any of the underground
 
02:14:39.189 --> 02:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
tanks get compromised or how do you
 
02:14:41.510 --> 02:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
determine if there's been a compromise
 
02:14:43.350 --> 02:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
and they're leaking
 
02:14:45.589 --> 02:14:45.599 align:start position:0%
dave can you answer that please
 
02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
yes so so the modern tank design has two
 
02:14:53.589 --> 02:14:53.599 align:start position:0%
two tanks it's essentially a tank in a
 
02:14:53.599 --> 02:14:54.550 align:start position:0%
two tanks it's essentially a tank in a
tank

02:14:54.550 --> 02:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
tank
 
02:14:57.910 --> 02:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
and there is what we call an
 
02:15:02.069 --> 02:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
interstitial alarm that will go off and
 
02:15:05.270 --> 02:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
let us know if a tank has been ruptured
 
02:15:08.950 --> 02:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
in fact one of our tanks in in lancaster
 
02:15:10.709 --> 02:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
several years ago
 
02:15:14.229 --> 02:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
um we did have a rupture in the interior
 
02:15:18.709 --> 02:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
tank the alarm um worked properly
 
02:15:23.510 --> 02:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
our fix was to to pump that tank and
 
02:15:26.550 --> 02:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
send professionals in not d.o.t folks
 
02:15:30.629 --> 02:15:30.639 align:start position:0%
put professional tank repair folks in to
 
02:15:33.669 --> 02:15:33.679 align:start position:0%
fix that tank and that tank is still in
 
02:15:36.390 --> 02:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
service part of the crux
 
02:15:39.910 --> 02:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
behind this replacement um is to make
 
02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
sure we do not get to that point where
 
02:15:47.270 --> 02:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
we have leakages because of course um
 
02:15:51.350 --> 02:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
any any fuel leakages are environmental
 
02:15:54.550 --> 02:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
concerns and one of the the dot's
 
02:15:56.870 --> 02:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
principles is to be sure that we are
 
02:16:01.270 --> 02:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:02.790 --> 02:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
representative ebal
 
02:16:05.189 --> 02:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh my question has to
 
02:16:08.069 --> 02:16:08.079 align:start position:0%
do with the underground tanks as well um
 
02:16:09.910 --> 02:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
you said you're it's sort of like the
 
02:16:12.069 --> 02:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
salt shed things you're you're always
 
02:16:14.550 --> 02:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
advocating to keep up to date on these
 
02:16:14.560 --> 02:16:15.510 align:start position:0%
advocating to keep up to date on these
tanks

02:16:15.510 --> 02:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
tanks
 
02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:16.470 align:start position:0%
tanks
um

02:16:16.470 --> 02:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:18.550 --> 02:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
how are we doing with that i don't know
 
02:16:19.910 --> 02:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
if we we
 
02:16:22.229 --> 02:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
funded any replacements in the last
 
02:16:25.109 --> 02:16:25.119 align:start position:0%
biennium i see the chair nodding
 
02:16:25.119 --> 02:16:26.229 align:start position:0%
biennium i see the chair nodding
um

02:16:26.229 --> 02:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:28.310 --> 02:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
i just was curious how we're doing i see
 
02:16:30.870 --> 02:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
it's your last priority but it's an
 
02:16:34.070 --> 02:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:36.469 --> 02:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
so representative i believe last year we
 
02:16:39.669 --> 02:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
uh funded it at the million-dollar level
 
02:16:41.429 --> 02:16:41.439 align:start position:0%
i think in years past it's been funded
 
02:16:43.429 --> 02:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
at a two million dollar level
 
02:16:47.030 --> 02:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
i will say dave rodriguez can um
 
02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:48.070 align:start position:0%
i will say dave rodriguez can um
can

02:16:48.070 --> 02:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:16:50.709 --> 02:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
jump in but i will say we've been we've
 
02:16:53.669 --> 02:16:53.679 align:start position:0%
addressed the most serious locations
 
02:16:55.830 --> 02:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
um however
 
02:16:58.150 --> 02:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
whenever a location gets to be better
 
02:17:00.309 --> 02:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
than 30 years old we start having
 
02:17:00.319 --> 02:17:01.429 align:start position:0%
than 30 years old we start having
concerns

02:17:01.429 --> 02:17:01.439 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
02:17:03.110 --> 02:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
um because
 
02:17:04.389 --> 02:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
we're you know
 
02:17:05.830 --> 02:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
we don't want to get into a situation
 
02:17:07.270 --> 02:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
where we're reactive and have
 
02:17:08.950 --> 02:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
environmental issues we've got to be
 
02:17:10.950 --> 02:17:10.960 align:start position:0%
proactive and replace these
 
02:17:10.960 --> 02:17:12.549 align:start position:0%
proactive and replace these
um

02:17:12.549 --> 02:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:15.910 --> 02:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
sooner rather than later and we do have
 
02:17:18.070 --> 02:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
i think there's eight or nine sites
 
02:17:19.429 --> 02:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
listed there they're better than 30
 
02:17:22.389 --> 02:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
years old so uh this is um
 
02:17:24.709 --> 02:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
this is a looming liability
 
02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
you know and you know certainly
 
02:17:28.549 --> 02:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
we'll be coming back at the next
 
02:17:28.559 --> 02:17:30.230 align:start position:0%
we'll be coming back at the next
biennium

02:17:30.230 --> 02:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
02:17:32.629 --> 02:17:32.639 align:start position:0%
with the request
 
02:17:36.309 --> 02:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
okay follow up mr chair follow-up so
 
02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
if i understood what just as we're going
 
02:17:41.349 --> 02:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
forward into work sessions and whatever
 
02:17:45.270 --> 02:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
if i understand your request the 240 is
 
02:17:48.070 --> 02:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
for two or three of them i mean would a
 
02:17:50.870 --> 02:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
lesser amount that you could pay for one
 
02:17:53.190 --> 02:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
be helpful or is there some way to split
 
02:17:55.349 --> 02:17:55.359 align:start position:0%
that up a little bit if we just wanted
 
02:17:58.629 --> 02:17:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:00.469 --> 02:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
so representative i believe this request
 
02:18:02.549 --> 02:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
was for 500 000 and i believe that
 
02:18:04.230 --> 02:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
allows us
 
02:18:05.990 --> 02:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
02:18:07.990 --> 02:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
can you hear me okay yeah yeah i've
 
02:18:10.709 --> 02:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
misread the thing yeah so it's for 500
 
02:18:12.469 --> 02:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
000 i believe it allows us to address
 
02:18:15.190 --> 02:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
one to two locations um
 
02:18:17.509 --> 02:18:17.519 align:start position:0%
if if that and dave can you know maybe
 
02:18:18.469 --> 02:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
you can
 
02:18:18.479 --> 02:18:19.349 align:start position:0%
you can
um

02:18:19.349 --> 02:18:19.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:23.190 --> 02:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:28.070 --> 02:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
yes if if if i may the the 500 000 would
 
02:18:30.709 --> 02:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
would be something would be something to
 
02:18:34.709 --> 02:18:34.719 align:start position:0%
allow us to do some some work it may
 
02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
allow us to replace a a smaller site
 
02:18:42.309 --> 02:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
um or it may allow us to do some of the
 
02:18:45.349 --> 02:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
tank top upgrades if we go back to the
 
02:18:45.359 --> 02:18:46.629 align:start position:0%
tank top upgrades if we go back to the
pictures

02:18:46.629 --> 02:18:46.639 align:start position:0%
pictures
 
02:18:49.589 --> 02:18:49.599 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that a modern
 
02:18:49.599 --> 02:18:51.030 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that a modern
installation

02:18:51.030 --> 02:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
installation
 
02:18:53.030 --> 02:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
is required to have
 
02:18:57.030 --> 02:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
is a full concrete pad with no cracks in
 
02:18:59.349 --> 02:18:59.359 align:start position:0%
it and be able to
 
02:19:02.629 --> 02:19:02.639 align:start position:0%
um catch any potential fuel that has
 
02:19:05.270 --> 02:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
been leaking so if you see the picture
 
02:19:08.629 --> 02:19:08.639 align:start position:0%
in my well if if fuel leaks it's going
 
02:19:11.990 --> 02:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
to run off from that concrete pad and go
 
02:19:13.990 --> 02:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
through the cracks in the in the
 
02:19:17.190 --> 02:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
concrete and into the the ground
 
02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:18.870 align:start position:0%
concrete and into the the ground
um

02:19:18.870 --> 02:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:21.750 --> 02:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
that's not an environmentally compliant
 
02:19:25.589 --> 02:19:25.599 align:start position:0%
site we need a full concrete pad there
 
02:19:28.549 --> 02:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
with the the grooves in it to catch any
 
02:19:31.830 --> 02:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
fuel that leaks and when we do that we
 
02:19:35.349 --> 02:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
also need to replace the piping and
 
02:19:37.349 --> 02:19:37.359 align:start position:0%
other things underneath
 
02:19:40.790 --> 02:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
if there is not a modern tank underneath
 
02:19:43.750 --> 02:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make sense to do that full
 
02:19:46.469 --> 02:19:46.479 align:start position:0%
improvement and then to dig it up in
 
02:19:49.030 --> 02:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
four or five years when we do get the
 
02:19:52.230 --> 02:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
capital funds to replace the tank which
 
02:19:54.790 --> 02:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
is why we typically request the amount
 
02:19:58.150 --> 02:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
of two million per biennium to allow us
 
02:19:59.510 --> 02:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:20:02.630 --> 02:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
two to four of these sites per year to
 
02:20:04.469 --> 02:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
to keep up with them
 
02:20:07.110 --> 02:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
but the 500 000 would allow us to
 
02:20:09.429 --> 02:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
address some of these and if we couldn't
 
02:20:15.190 --> 02:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
get the 500 and got 250 that's certainly
 
02:20:18.870 --> 02:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
that was kind of my question thank you
 
02:20:21.429 --> 02:20:21.439 align:start position:0%
um thank you and i was going to ask a
 
02:20:23.910 --> 02:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
lot of those same questions because i
 
02:20:26.150 --> 02:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
know for several by india
 
02:20:29.990 --> 02:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
we have been doing these replacements
 
02:20:33.190 --> 02:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
and it would be
 
02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunate if we had to stop so the
 
02:20:38.950 --> 02:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
question would be in my mind not having
 
02:20:38.960 --> 02:20:39.830 align:start position:0%
question would be in my mind not having
looked

02:20:39.830 --> 02:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
looked
 
02:20:42.230 --> 02:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
is there
 
02:20:42.240 --> 02:20:43.270 align:start position:0%
is there
any

02:20:43.270 --> 02:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:20:45.750 --> 02:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
money for this that you're extending in
 
02:20:48.870 --> 02:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
in lapse extensions so that work can
 
02:20:57.190 --> 02:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:59.590 --> 02:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
representative if i may um
 
02:21:02.389 --> 02:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
so last the last biennium i was mistaken
 
02:21:03.510 --> 02:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
we received
 
02:21:06.309 --> 02:21:06.319 align:start position:0%
um two million dollars for for these
 
02:21:09.270 --> 02:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
upgrades and you know certainly um we
 
02:21:11.830 --> 02:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
are continuing to work on sites we
 
02:21:13.750 --> 02:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
actually have a couple sites that we're
 
02:21:15.510 --> 02:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
going to be putting out to bid
 
02:21:18.550 --> 02:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
soon to to address two locations and i
 
02:21:20.230 --> 02:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
believe we're looking at
 
02:21:22.469 --> 02:21:22.479 align:start position:0%
two other locations that
 
02:21:25.110 --> 02:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
we may need additional money to
 
02:21:29.510 --> 02:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
be able to progress all all four however
 
02:21:31.349 --> 02:21:31.359 align:start position:0%
um you know we were gonna
 
02:21:33.110 --> 02:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
we would we're
 
02:21:35.349 --> 02:21:35.359 align:start position:0%
proceeding with putting two out to bid
 
02:21:37.110 --> 02:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
to see what the bids were
 
02:21:40.469 --> 02:21:40.479 align:start position:0%
and then assessing whether um the other
 
02:21:42.550 --> 02:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
two could go or whether we needed to uh
 
02:21:44.550 --> 02:21:44.560 align:start position:0%
we needed additional money so
 
02:21:46.630 --> 02:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
um you know certainly
 
02:21:49.270 --> 02:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
any additional funds uh for this effort
 
02:21:52.230 --> 02:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
would be appreciated um
 
02:21:52.240 --> 02:21:54.469 align:start position:0%
would be appreciated um
[Applause]

02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
02:21:55.910 --> 02:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
i hope that
 
02:21:59.270 --> 02:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:01.030 --> 02:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
it does thank you
 
02:22:04.389 --> 02:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
any other questions of the department on
 
02:22:07.349 --> 02:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
what they have presented today
 
02:22:13.990 --> 02:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:16.550 --> 02:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative mcconkey
 
02:22:18.870 --> 02:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
02:22:22.389 --> 02:22:22.399 align:start position:0%
gentlemen can you remind me why um why
 
02:22:25.110 --> 02:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
the state is not able to use odd funds
 
02:22:25.120 --> 02:22:25.910 align:start position:0%
the state is not able to use odd funds
to

02:22:25.910 --> 02:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:22:27.429 --> 02:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
make these uh
 
02:22:27.439 --> 02:22:29.110 align:start position:0%
make these uh
replacements

02:22:29.110 --> 02:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
replacements
 
02:22:30.870 --> 02:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
i will turn that question over to
 
02:22:34.830 --> 02:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:38.550 --> 02:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
i i will take uh uh
 
02:22:40.790 --> 02:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
my understanding is odd fund is for
 
02:22:43.750 --> 02:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
leaking to address the leaking locations
 
02:22:45.590 --> 02:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh these are not leaking as of yet and
 
02:22:47.910 --> 02:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
we certainly do not want them to leak
 
02:22:49.110 --> 02:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:22:51.030 --> 02:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
um i i believe
 
02:22:54.070 --> 02:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
that is why and maybe dave um
 
02:22:56.550 --> 02:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
understands it uh better or differently
 
02:22:58.950 --> 02:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:01.510 --> 02:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
you you explained it correctly
 
02:23:04.230 --> 02:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
when we have leaky tanks that create
 
02:23:04.240 --> 02:23:05.750 align:start position:0%
when we have leaky tanks that create
contamination

02:23:05.750 --> 02:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
contamination
 
02:23:08.870 --> 02:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
we are able to use odd funds and we have
 
02:23:12.110 --> 02:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
used odd funds to help clean up the
 
02:23:14.230 --> 02:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
contaminated soil
 
02:23:18.309 --> 02:23:18.319 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately odd funds uh are used
 
02:23:21.190 --> 02:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
not as a proactive measure but as a
 
02:23:23.990 --> 02:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
measure to come in after and clean up
 
02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
the mess um not to help us keep modern
 
02:23:30.870 --> 02:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
equipment to avoid a mess in the in the
 
02:23:33.830 --> 02:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
first place
 
02:23:36.389 --> 02:23:36.399 align:start position:0%
mr chairman if i could follow up
 
02:23:37.910 --> 02:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
02:23:38.950 --> 02:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:23:38.960 --> 02:23:39.910 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:23:39.910 --> 02:23:39.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:39.920 --> 02:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:23:40.160 --> 02:23:40.170 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:23:40.170 --> 02:23:41.510 align:start position:0%
so
[Music]

02:23:41.510 --> 02:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:23:43.910 --> 02:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
people that dispense gasoline not the
 
02:23:43.920 --> 02:23:45.270 align:start position:0%
people that dispense gasoline not the
state

02:23:45.270 --> 02:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:23:47.349 --> 02:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
were mandated to replace all their tanks
 
02:23:50.389 --> 02:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
a number of years ago
 
02:23:53.910 --> 02:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
and so how were we able to avoid that
 
02:23:55.670 --> 02:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
as the state
 
02:23:59.670 --> 02:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
we met all the state requirements and um
 
02:24:02.389 --> 02:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
when the requirements for double line
 
02:24:05.670 --> 02:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
tanks came into two place
 
02:24:08.710 --> 02:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
we were in compliance with with that
 
02:24:11.950 --> 02:24:11.960 align:start position:0%
that requirement there was also a
 
02:24:15.510 --> 02:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
derefds requirement after the the double
 
02:24:19.349 --> 02:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
line tanks to have double lined piping
 
02:24:23.349 --> 02:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
to the the pumps um that was an issue
 
02:24:26.389 --> 02:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
that we we did an in-house project
 
02:24:28.790 --> 02:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
largely to come into
 
02:24:31.670 --> 02:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
compliance with those des requirements
 
02:24:35.110 --> 02:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
as well so we are required to meet every
 
02:24:38.070 --> 02:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
regulation that the private industry is
 
02:24:39.750 --> 02:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
required to meet
 
02:24:42.630 --> 02:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
and then the the other important aspect
 
02:24:45.270 --> 02:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
of our fuel distribution system
 
02:24:48.150 --> 02:24:48.160 align:start position:0%
is it meets the needs not not only of
 
02:24:49.590 --> 02:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
the dot
 
02:24:52.230 --> 02:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
although we have the big use
 
02:24:55.750 --> 02:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
for diesel um it means meets the needs
 
02:24:58.870 --> 02:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
of other state agencies local
 
02:24:58.880 --> 02:25:00.870 align:start position:0%
of other state agencies local
municipalities

02:25:00.870 --> 02:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
02:25:00.880 --> 02:25:02.230 align:start position:0%
municipalities
and

02:25:02.230 --> 02:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:25:05.830 --> 02:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
some non-profit organizations as well
 
02:25:08.830 --> 02:25:08.840 align:start position:0%
and serves as the state strategic
 
02:25:11.030 --> 02:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
reserve should a
 
02:25:13.830 --> 02:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
national event occur there'd be a fuel
 
02:25:16.790 --> 02:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
shortage we have a the state of new
 
02:25:19.590 --> 02:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire has a supply of fuel that can
 
02:25:22.710 --> 02:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
be rationed and used to respond to
 
02:25:28.070 --> 02:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:30.230 --> 02:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:25:31.910 --> 02:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
see no
 
02:25:35.270 --> 02:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
more one more thing mr chairman
 
02:25:36.790 --> 02:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
02:25:39.349 --> 02:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
thank you um hate to get in the way of
 
02:25:40.550 --> 02:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
lunch here
 
02:25:43.910 --> 02:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
so we have another presentation
 
02:25:46.710 --> 02:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
thank you our our tanks are uh compliant
 
02:25:49.190 --> 02:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
they're not leaking so we can't use odd
 
02:25:49.200 --> 02:25:50.230 align:start position:0%
they're not leaking so we can't use odd
fund

02:25:50.230 --> 02:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:25:53.110 --> 02:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
as i believe uh
 
02:25:55.429 --> 02:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
chairman campbell had investigated that
 
02:25:57.750 --> 02:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
at length a number of years ago
 
02:26:01.190 --> 02:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
but it's clear it's clear that your
 
02:26:03.270 --> 02:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
your surface doesn't even come close to
 
02:26:07.830 --> 02:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:10.230 --> 02:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
or your earlier conversation when you're
 
02:26:12.389 --> 02:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
talking about driving in and any waste
 
02:26:14.389 --> 02:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
fuel is collected in the
 
02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
concrete apron and held by grooves
 
02:26:19.510 --> 02:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm somewhat confused i guess we can
 
02:26:29.190 --> 02:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:32.230 --> 02:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner i wish to thank you and all
 
02:26:34.469 --> 02:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
of your staff for coming in
 
02:26:37.990 --> 02:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
and trying to answer our questions and
 
02:26:39.750 --> 02:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
doing your presentation and i do
 
02:26:41.990 --> 02:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that you
 
02:26:44.150 --> 02:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
did shorten your presentation somewhat
 
02:26:45.670 --> 02:26:45.680 align:start position:0%
from your original
 
02:26:47.590 --> 02:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
uh booklet that you sent out to all of
 
02:26:51.349 --> 02:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
us so that we could get through this
 
02:26:53.830 --> 02:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
and i am sure that if we have additional
 
02:26:55.990 --> 02:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
questions about any of this
 
02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:57.349 align:start position:0%
questions about any of this
that

02:26:57.349 --> 02:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:26:59.110 --> 02:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
you and your staff will be able to
 
02:27:03.429 --> 02:27:03.439 align:start position:0%
answer them for us as we go forward
 
02:27:05.510 --> 02:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
don't hesitate to reach out we're ready
 
02:27:07.270 --> 02:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
um to respond i know you're on a tight
 
02:27:09.349 --> 02:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
deadline in terms of approving
 
02:27:11.670 --> 02:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
hb 25.
 
02:27:13.830 --> 02:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
and i thank you
 
02:27:15.750 --> 02:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
now as i said at the start of this
 
02:27:20.070 --> 02:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
morning we do have one additional agency
 
02:27:21.590 --> 02:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
that has requested to make a
 
02:27:23.910 --> 02:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
presentation today
 
02:27:25.750 --> 02:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
something has come up at ports and
 
02:27:28.469 --> 02:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
harbors and
 
02:27:31.830 --> 02:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
gino marconi is online
 
02:27:34.469 --> 02:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
and ready to
 
02:27:36.950 --> 02:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
do his presentation now
 
02:27:39.830 --> 02:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
um it is important that we hear this
 
02:27:42.630 --> 02:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
and because we will need to discuss it
 
02:27:46.790 --> 02:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:48.550 --> 02:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman members
 
02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh for the record
 
02:27:52.230 --> 02:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
genome icony the director of the
 
02:27:54.550 --> 02:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
division of ports and harbors
 
02:27:57.110 --> 02:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh and with me today is paul breen he's
 
02:27:59.030 --> 02:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
the executive director of the pease
 
02:28:00.950 --> 02:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
development authority
 
02:28:03.510 --> 02:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
and and i welcome the opportunity to to
 
02:28:06.550 --> 02:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
talk about this the discussion is the
 
02:28:09.110 --> 02:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
uppermost turning basin in this in the
 
02:28:10.950 --> 02:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
deep watership channel here in piscata
 
02:28:14.710 --> 02:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:16.950 --> 02:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
this this project was first identified
 
02:28:19.349 --> 02:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
in a navigation safety improvement study
 
02:28:21.030 --> 02:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
that was published by the army corps of
 
02:28:23.150 --> 02:28:23.160 align:start position:0%
engineers back in
 
02:28:23.160 --> 02:28:24.870 align:start position:0%
engineers back in
1987.

02:28:24.870 --> 02:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
1987.
 
02:28:24.880 --> 02:28:26.070 align:start position:0%
1987.
uh

02:28:26.070 --> 02:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:28:27.990 --> 02:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
the deep water channel is a federal
 
02:28:30.710 --> 02:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
navigation channel and it's designed and
 
02:28:33.670 --> 02:28:33.680 align:start position:0%
maintained by the corps of engineers
 
02:28:35.590 --> 02:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
and in that study there were five
 
02:28:38.550 --> 02:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
projects office navigation safety that
 
02:28:40.389 --> 02:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
were identified
 
02:28:42.950 --> 02:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
this is the last one of those
 
02:28:44.950 --> 02:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
of those projects
 
02:28:47.670 --> 02:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
and i will tell you that
 
02:28:49.670 --> 02:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
there's been 20 years of my time trying
 
02:28:52.550 --> 02:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
to move this forward
 
02:28:54.550 --> 02:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
so what happened was
 
02:28:57.389 --> 02:28:57.399 align:start position:0%
uh the court came to us back in around
 
02:28:59.990 --> 02:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
2015 said oh yeah we're going to get
 
02:29:01.670 --> 02:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
ready to do this
 
02:29:04.710 --> 02:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
and uh they estimated the
 
02:29:06.630 --> 02:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
local sponsor being the state of new
 
02:29:09.190 --> 02:29:09.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire the cost share
 
02:29:11.670 --> 02:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
and we submitted a capital request to
 
02:29:11.680 --> 02:29:12.710 align:start position:0%
and we submitted a capital request to
that

02:29:12.710 --> 02:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:29:15.110 --> 02:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
and then at the same time we we
 
02:29:19.110 --> 02:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
submitted a capital request for the post
 
02:29:19.120 --> 02:29:21.190 align:start position:0%
submitted a capital request for the post
construction

02:29:21.190 --> 02:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
construction
 
02:29:23.190 --> 02:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
contribution to operations and
 
02:29:23.200 --> 02:29:24.630 align:start position:0%
contribution to operations and
maintenance

02:29:24.630 --> 02:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
02:29:24.640 --> 02:29:25.830 align:start position:0%
maintenance
um

02:29:25.830 --> 02:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:28.309 --> 02:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
obviously the corps of engineers did not
 
02:29:30.309 --> 02:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
get the funding
 
02:29:33.349 --> 02:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
but this last session of congress
 
02:29:38.630 --> 02:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh through um um a lot of push by our
 
02:29:40.469 --> 02:29:40.479 align:start position:0%
senate delegation
 
02:29:43.190 --> 02:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh the uppermost turning basin project
 
02:29:45.030 --> 02:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
was included in the water resource
 
02:29:46.710 --> 02:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
development act
 
02:29:49.510 --> 02:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh it was a very specific saying that
 
02:29:52.870 --> 02:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
the corps of engineers shall
 
02:29:54.550 --> 02:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
do this project
 
02:29:57.030 --> 02:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
so back in the end of december we got
 
02:29:58.950 --> 02:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
notified by
 
02:30:00.150 --> 02:30:00.160 align:start position:0%
the district
 
02:30:01.429 --> 02:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
down in
 
02:30:03.190 --> 02:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
massachusetts that
 
02:30:05.990 --> 02:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
the project was put on the 2021 work
 
02:30:06.000 --> 02:30:07.510 align:start position:0%
the project was put on the 2021 work
schedule

02:30:07.510 --> 02:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
02:30:07.520 --> 02:30:09.270 align:start position:0%
schedule
so

02:30:09.270 --> 02:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:30:11.270 --> 02:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
they they told me that they were going
 
02:30:13.429 --> 02:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
to go back and they were going to
 
02:30:15.910 --> 02:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
re-estimate the project
 
02:30:15.920 --> 02:30:17.270 align:start position:0%
re-estimate the project
and

02:30:17.270 --> 02:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:30:18.389 --> 02:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
no surprise
 
02:30:21.030 --> 02:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
on the car the cost of the project uh
 
02:30:22.230 --> 02:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
went up
 
02:30:23.150 --> 02:30:23.160 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
02:30:23.160 --> 02:30:24.790 align:start position:0%
uh so
[Music]

02:30:24.790 --> 02:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:30:26.150 --> 02:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
our estimates
 
02:30:28.870 --> 02:30:28.880 align:start position:0%
according to what they provided us
 
02:30:29.990 --> 02:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:30:32.070 --> 02:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
we're about a million five hundred
 
02:30:34.950 --> 02:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars short on this project
 
02:30:36.790 --> 02:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
um we have
 
02:30:36.800 --> 02:30:38.150 align:start position:0%
um we have
um

02:30:38.150 --> 02:30:38.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:40.070 --> 02:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
we have seven million two hundred and
 
02:30:41.990 --> 02:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
forty one thousand five hundred and
 
02:30:44.870 --> 02:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars uh in that
 
02:30:48.070 --> 02:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
those original appropriations
 
02:30:49.349 --> 02:30:49.359 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:30:52.150 --> 02:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
they're telling us that uh
 
02:30:55.590 --> 02:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's an additional
 
02:30:58.070 --> 02:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
the cost share is gonna be over over
 
02:31:00.790 --> 02:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
eight million dollars and so we're a
 
02:31:02.870 --> 02:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
million five short
 
02:31:02.880 --> 02:31:06.469 align:start position:0%
million five short
um

02:31:06.469 --> 02:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:08.150 --> 02:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
this is this is a one-time thing with
 
02:31:09.910 --> 02:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
the corps of engineers
 
02:31:12.309 --> 02:31:12.319 align:start position:0%
if we don't do this project now they're
 
02:31:13.750 --> 02:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
gonna divert that
 
02:31:16.309 --> 02:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
this uh the total project cost is 24
 
02:31:19.030 --> 02:31:19.040 align:start position:0%
million dollars so uh
 
02:31:21.190 --> 02:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
that this is the state's cost share in
 
02:31:23.910 --> 02:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
this if the if this project doesn't get
 
02:31:26.070 --> 02:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
done they're going to divert those funds
 
02:31:29.670 --> 02:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
to another harbor and and who knows who
 
02:31:31.270 --> 02:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
knows when this opportunity is going to
 
02:31:33.110 --> 02:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
come up again
 
02:31:36.309 --> 02:31:36.319 align:start position:0%
the the importance of this project um
 
02:31:37.590 --> 02:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
when that
 
02:31:40.389 --> 02:31:40.399 align:start position:0%
the uppermost turning basin is
 
02:31:43.190 --> 02:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
800 feet wide
 
02:31:47.429 --> 02:31:47.439 align:start position:0%
our state pilots are turning 764-foot
 
02:31:49.590 --> 02:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
ships around in that in that turning
 
02:31:49.600 --> 02:31:51.030 align:start position:0%
ships around in that in that turning
basin

02:31:51.030 --> 02:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
basin
 
02:31:54.070 --> 02:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
and uh it's uh
 
02:31:57.190 --> 02:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
the safety factor is greatly reduced
 
02:31:57.200 --> 02:31:58.710 align:start position:0%
the safety factor is greatly reduced
um

02:31:58.710 --> 02:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:01.110 --> 02:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
the project calls for expanding the
 
02:32:04.389 --> 02:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
turning basin to 1200 feet
 
02:32:06.940 --> 02:32:06.950 align:start position:0%
so that would give us a safety factor so
 
02:32:06.950 --> 02:32:08.150 align:start position:0%
so that would give us a safety factor so
[Music]

02:32:08.150 --> 02:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:32:10.150 --> 02:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
what they what they're moving up there
 
02:32:12.550 --> 02:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
02:32:16.389 --> 02:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
petroleum products lpg uh bulk carriers
 
02:32:19.190 --> 02:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
carrying road salt and uh
 
02:32:21.750 --> 02:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
and uh gypsum rock
 
02:32:21.760 --> 02:32:22.710 align:start position:0%
and uh gypsum rock
um

02:32:22.710 --> 02:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:25.110 --> 02:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
so it's it's an important
 
02:32:25.120 --> 02:32:26.309 align:start position:0%
so it's it's an important
important

02:32:26.309 --> 02:32:26.319 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:32:29.590 --> 02:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
part of marine transportation here
 
02:32:32.150 --> 02:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
i can just give you an example
 
02:32:35.190 --> 02:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
of how this affects the whole state
 
02:32:35.200 --> 02:32:36.230 align:start position:0%
of how this affects the whole state
um

02:32:36.230 --> 02:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:37.590 --> 02:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
first off
 
02:32:39.590 --> 02:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
a few years ago we
 
02:32:44.150 --> 02:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:46.389 --> 02:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
russ cadell was at the university of new
 
02:32:48.950 --> 02:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire that at the time it was one of
 
02:32:52.469 --> 02:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
his phd students matt magnuson and then
 
02:32:54.710 --> 02:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
professor colson from the university of
 
02:32:56.950 --> 02:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
maine participated in this
 
02:33:01.270 --> 02:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:03.110 --> 02:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
this is not including what goes on of
 
02:33:05.110 --> 02:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
course with naval shipyard
 
02:33:08.150 --> 02:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
but in the local economy at that time
 
02:33:09.070 --> 02:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
there were
 
02:33:11.990 --> 02:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
987 direct jobs
 
02:33:13.429 --> 02:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
from the
 
02:33:16.070 --> 02:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
16 businesses utilizing the terminals
 
02:33:17.750 --> 02:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
here at the at the
 
02:33:19.030 --> 02:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
in the harbor
 
02:33:22.150 --> 02:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
and it was over 90 million dollars of
 
02:33:24.630 --> 02:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
direct wages and benefits paid to those
 
02:33:27.030 --> 02:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
those people that work there
 
02:33:27.040 --> 02:33:28.790 align:start position:0%
those people that work there
and

02:33:28.790 --> 02:33:28.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:33:31.510 --> 02:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
but the total regional impacts they
 
02:33:31.520 --> 02:33:32.790 align:start position:0%
but the total regional impacts they
estimated

02:33:32.790 --> 02:33:32.800 align:start position:0%
estimated
 
02:33:36.710 --> 02:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
included 2300 jobs
 
02:33:38.790 --> 02:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
and over two thousand or just over two
 
02:33:41.110 --> 02:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
thousand were in new hampshire
 
02:33:42.790 --> 02:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:33:46.389 --> 02:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
there was a 156 million dollars in wages
 
02:33:49.270 --> 02:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
and benefits are generated there
 
02:33:52.150 --> 02:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
what was in what was interesting was uh
 
02:33:54.950 --> 02:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
90 percent of the economic impacts from
 
02:33:56.469 --> 02:33:56.479 align:start position:0%
the terminals
 
02:33:58.550 --> 02:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
in the piscataqua river is in new
 
02:34:00.309 --> 02:34:00.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire only 10 percent of it is in
 
02:34:03.910 --> 02:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
the state of maine so
 
02:34:06.630 --> 02:34:06.640 align:start position:0%
that's a brief overview of the economics
 
02:34:07.750 --> 02:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
of it
 
02:34:09.590 --> 02:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
getting down into the nuts and bolts of
 
02:34:13.349 --> 02:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
it a little bit mr chairman um
 
02:34:16.309 --> 02:34:16.319 align:start position:0%
the effect on the state
 
02:34:16.319 --> 02:34:17.190 align:start position:0%
the effect on the state
and

02:34:17.190 --> 02:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:34:19.510 --> 02:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
i looked at this a couple of years ago
 
02:34:20.950 --> 02:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
when we were working with the state
 
02:34:23.750 --> 02:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
freight transportation study committee
 
02:34:23.760 --> 02:34:24.630 align:start position:0%
freight transportation study committee
and

02:34:24.630 --> 02:34:24.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:34:24.640 --> 02:34:25.990 align:start position:0%
and
so

02:34:25.990 --> 02:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:34:28.070 --> 02:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
back in 2016
 
02:34:30.150 --> 02:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
which is the information that i tried to
 
02:34:31.990 --> 02:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
pull together
 
02:34:33.830 --> 02:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
the census identified that there were
 
02:34:37.429 --> 02:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
over 520 000 households in the state of
 
02:34:38.870 --> 02:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:34:41.750 --> 02:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
and 60 of those households heat with
 
02:34:43.670 --> 02:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
home heating oil
 
02:34:46.630 --> 02:34:46.640 align:start position:0%
and the scatter core river terminals up
 
02:34:48.710 --> 02:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
there where the turning basin is
 
02:34:52.070 --> 02:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
provides 85 of that home heating oil to
 
02:34:54.070 --> 02:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
those houses
 
02:34:56.150 --> 02:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:34:58.630 --> 02:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
what we looked at
 
02:35:00.630 --> 02:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
well how do we how do we get that home
 
02:35:03.030 --> 02:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
heating oil to those homes from those
 
02:35:03.040 --> 02:35:04.150 align:start position:0%
heating oil to those homes from those
households

02:35:04.150 --> 02:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
households
 
02:35:05.750 --> 02:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
so we looked at
 
02:35:07.750 --> 02:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
the amount of liquid asphalt that comes
 
02:35:09.429 --> 02:35:09.439 align:start position:0%
into the terminals up there where the
 
02:35:11.270 --> 02:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
turning basin is
 
02:35:11.280 --> 02:35:12.790 align:start position:0%
turning basin is
and

02:35:12.790 --> 02:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:35:15.389 --> 02:35:15.399 align:start position:0%
i'll boil it down that in
 
02:35:18.790 --> 02:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
2017 there was enough liquid asphalt to
 
02:35:20.230 --> 02:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
pave uh
 
02:35:24.309 --> 02:35:24.319 align:start position:0%
3 500 road lane miles highway
 
02:35:25.349 --> 02:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:35:27.190 --> 02:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
you look at it and you say well okay
 
02:35:28.469 --> 02:35:28.479 align:start position:0%
we're going to bring this home heating
 
02:35:30.710 --> 02:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
oil over these roads that have been
 
02:35:30.720 --> 02:35:31.750 align:start position:0%
oil over these roads that have been
paved

02:35:31.750 --> 02:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
paved
 
02:35:33.910 --> 02:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
but how do we keep them open
 
02:35:33.920 --> 02:35:35.110 align:start position:0%
but how do we keep them open
and

02:35:35.110 --> 02:35:35.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:35:36.950 --> 02:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
we keep them open and they only they're
 
02:35:38.830 --> 02:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
only delivering this oil mostly in the
 
02:35:42.790 --> 02:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
wintertime so we looked at the road song
 
02:35:45.750 --> 02:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
and we came up with some numbers that
 
02:35:47.830 --> 02:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh you know there was over a half a
 
02:35:49.830 --> 02:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
million tons of road salt just
 
02:35:52.070 --> 02:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
discharged in the in the terminals along
 
02:35:53.270 --> 02:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
the river
 
02:35:54.790 --> 02:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:35:57.910 --> 02:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
and back in 2017
 
02:35:59.830 --> 02:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
new hampshire d.o.t
 
02:35:59.840 --> 02:36:00.830 align:start position:0%
new hampshire d.o.t
used

02:36:00.830 --> 02:36:00.840 align:start position:0%
used
 
02:36:04.230 --> 02:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
225 000 tons of that road salt
 
02:36:06.309 --> 02:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
and 85 percent of that came from the
 
02:36:09.190 --> 02:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
terminals here in the river
 
02:36:11.110 --> 02:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
though those numbers have gone up since
 
02:36:13.910 --> 02:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
then because uh
 
02:36:15.510 --> 02:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
there are two
 
02:36:17.270 --> 02:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
two of the road salt companies that are
 
02:36:19.590 --> 02:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
operating in the harbor here
 
02:36:19.600 --> 02:36:21.270 align:start position:0%
operating in the harbor here
uh

02:36:21.270 --> 02:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:36:23.590 --> 02:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
got the majority of the
 
02:36:25.830 --> 02:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
districts for d.o.t so
 
02:36:29.110 --> 02:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
that's an example of the importance of
 
02:36:30.870 --> 02:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
traffic here
 
02:36:30.880 --> 02:36:32.469 align:start position:0%
traffic here
but

02:36:32.469 --> 02:36:32.479 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:36:34.389 --> 02:36:34.399 align:start position:0%
going back to the turning basin when it
 
02:36:36.389 --> 02:36:36.399 align:start position:0%
was originally constructed the largest
 
02:36:38.550 --> 02:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
ship that was coming into the harbor was
 
02:36:42.670 --> 02:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
a jumbo wise t2 tanker which is about
 
02:36:45.270 --> 02:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
524 feet long
 
02:36:47.990 --> 02:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
today we have tugging badge units
 
02:36:50.630 --> 02:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
delivering home heating oil and kerosene
 
02:36:51.910 --> 02:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
up the river
 
02:36:54.150 --> 02:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
there that are bigger than that and then
 
02:36:57.030 --> 02:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
we have the lpg tankers uh bringing
 
02:36:59.910 --> 02:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
propane to the terminal up there that
 
02:37:03.670 --> 02:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
are 700 plus feet long so the importance
 
02:37:05.270 --> 02:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
of expanding
 
02:37:08.150 --> 02:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
this turning basin from
 
02:37:12.630 --> 02:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
800 feet to 1200 feet
 
02:37:15.349 --> 02:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
from a navigation safety standpoint
 
02:37:17.590 --> 02:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
i think it's rather obvious that
 
02:37:17.600 --> 02:37:18.550 align:start position:0%
i think it's rather obvious that
we

02:37:18.550 --> 02:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:37:21.429 --> 02:37:21.439 align:start position:0%
the radius of the turning basin
 
02:37:23.190 --> 02:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
02:37:23.200 --> 02:37:24.630 align:start position:0%
needs to be
improved

02:37:24.630 --> 02:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
improved
 
02:37:26.710 --> 02:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
to protect the environment
 
02:37:28.950 --> 02:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
to protect the people that live along
 
02:37:30.070 --> 02:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
the river
 
02:37:33.030 --> 02:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
to allow more efficient uh uh
 
02:37:34.870 --> 02:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
transportation of these products that
 
02:37:37.270 --> 02:37:37.280 align:start position:0%
the citizens of new hampshire need
 
02:37:40.550 --> 02:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:42.710 --> 02:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
the transit restrictions that have been
 
02:37:47.110 --> 02:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
placed on the ships coming in here on
 
02:37:49.590 --> 02:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
daylight only
 
02:37:51.990 --> 02:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh if they're carrying a certain amount
 
02:37:54.070 --> 02:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
of product they only allow them to come
 
02:37:55.910 --> 02:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
in on high tide
 
02:37:58.389 --> 02:37:58.399 align:start position:0%
uh if there are if there's reduced
 
02:38:00.790 --> 02:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
visibility or a certain amount of wind
 
02:38:00.800 --> 02:38:03.190 align:start position:0%
visibility or a certain amount of wind
factor

02:38:03.190 --> 02:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
factor
 
02:38:05.349 --> 02:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
it causes delays and the ships are
 
02:38:07.110 --> 02:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
coming and going
 
02:38:10.070 --> 02:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
and a ship that may be stuck at the
 
02:38:11.990 --> 02:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
terminal up the river because they can't
 
02:38:14.309 --> 02:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
leave because of the restrictions of the
 
02:38:15.830 --> 02:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
turning basin
 
02:38:18.790 --> 02:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh the demerged fees on a ship that's
 
02:38:18.800 --> 02:38:19.990 align:start position:0%
uh the demerged fees on a ship that's
delayed

02:38:19.990 --> 02:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
delayed
 
02:38:23.590 --> 02:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
can be upwards of 80 or 85 000 a day and
 
02:38:25.670 --> 02:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
those extra costs go back to the
 
02:38:25.680 --> 02:38:27.349 align:start position:0%
those extra costs go back to the
consumer

02:38:27.349 --> 02:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
02:38:27.359 --> 02:38:28.870 align:start position:0%
consumer
um

02:38:28.870 --> 02:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:31.030 --> 02:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the cliff notes
 
02:38:33.750 --> 02:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
version mr chairman and i
 
02:38:35.349 --> 02:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
i apologize
 
02:38:37.429 --> 02:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
i i know i was allowed to come in here
 
02:38:39.830 --> 02:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
at the last minute so i don't have
 
02:38:44.870 --> 02:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:46.710 --> 02:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of familiar faces on
 
02:38:48.790 --> 02:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
this committee that i've
 
02:38:52.070 --> 02:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
talked to this about before
 
02:38:54.070 --> 02:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you miss marconi and i would point
 
02:38:55.910 --> 02:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
out that
 
02:38:57.910 --> 02:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
this morning while we've been in
 
02:38:59.910 --> 02:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
committee there was a
 
02:39:02.309 --> 02:39:02.319 align:start position:0%
presentation that that miss marconi had
 
02:39:05.510 --> 02:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
put together about the basin
 
02:39:07.910 --> 02:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
powerpoint presentation was emailed to
 
02:39:10.150 --> 02:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
everybody i would ask that the committee
 
02:39:14.790 --> 02:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
look at that not now but at some point
 
02:39:17.349 --> 02:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
and we'll take a couple of questions
 
02:39:19.030 --> 02:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
representative jack
 
02:39:20.870 --> 02:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you director
 
02:39:23.270 --> 02:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's always a pleasure to see you
 
02:39:24.870 --> 02:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
can you tell us what the source of funds
 
02:39:26.790 --> 02:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
for this is i think in some previous
 
02:39:28.389 --> 02:39:28.399 align:start position:0%
projects you've had your own source of
 
02:39:30.950 --> 02:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
funds rather than general funds
 
02:39:30.960 --> 02:39:31.750 align:start position:0%
funds rather than general funds
uh

02:39:31.750 --> 02:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:39:34.230 --> 02:39:34.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for that uh in the in the
 
02:39:37.510 --> 02:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation from 2015
 
02:39:42.309 --> 02:39:42.319 align:start position:0%
which uh was 500 5 million and 355
 
02:39:43.910 --> 02:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
500 dollars
 
02:39:46.950 --> 02:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
of that 285
 
02:39:46.960 --> 02:39:48.469 align:start position:0%
of that 285
550.

02:39:48.469 --> 02:39:48.479 align:start position:0%
550.
 
02:39:48.479 --> 02:39:49.349 align:start position:0%
550.
uh

02:39:49.349 --> 02:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:39:51.590 --> 02:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to be responsible for paying
 
02:39:55.510 --> 02:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
those bonds back to the general fund
 
02:39:57.750 --> 02:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
other other than that is
 
02:39:59.830 --> 02:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
this money is just the state of capital
 
02:39:59.840 --> 02:40:04.710 align:start position:0%
this money is just the state of capital
appropriation

02:40:04.710 --> 02:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:07.990 --> 02:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:09.990 --> 02:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:40:12.070 --> 02:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
uh my question is
 
02:40:12.080 --> 02:40:13.110 align:start position:0%
uh my question is
um

02:40:13.110 --> 02:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:16.309 --> 02:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
and i recall um
 
02:40:19.429 --> 02:40:19.439 align:start position:0%
voting on this prior
 
02:40:19.439 --> 02:40:20.389 align:start position:0%
voting on this prior
but

02:40:20.389 --> 02:40:20.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:40:22.309 --> 02:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
um is the state of maine going to
 
02:40:24.870 --> 02:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
contribute anything to this uh
 
02:40:24.880 --> 02:40:26.469 align:start position:0%
contribute anything to this uh
project

02:40:26.469 --> 02:40:26.479 align:start position:0%
project
 
02:40:30.550 --> 02:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
no no they are not served and uh
 
02:40:32.150 --> 02:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
part of that
 
02:40:34.710 --> 02:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
part of that is that um
 
02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
90 percent of the economic benefit is in
 
02:40:40.710 --> 02:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:43.429 --> 02:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
representative thompson
 
02:40:47.670 --> 02:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr uh chairman and mr director
 
02:40:47.680 --> 02:40:48.550 align:start position:0%
thank you mr uh chairman and mr director
is

02:40:48.550 --> 02:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:40:50.870 --> 02:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know a lot about the river but i
 
02:40:53.030 --> 02:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
know a little bit about it is this
 
02:40:57.429 --> 02:40:57.439 align:start position:0%
turning area up by the propane terminal
 
02:40:59.750 --> 02:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
yes sir it's it's just up above the
 
02:41:02.950 --> 02:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
propane terminal uh propane terminal is
 
02:41:05.030 --> 02:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
on avery lane
 
02:41:06.550 --> 02:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
and then the next
 
02:41:08.630 --> 02:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
the last terminal up is on river road
 
02:41:10.550 --> 02:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
just just before you make the turn in
 
02:41:12.070 --> 02:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
the river to go under
 
02:41:14.469 --> 02:41:14.479 align:start position:0%
the two bridges connecting newington and
 
02:41:18.790 --> 02:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:23.110 --> 02:41:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:26.710 --> 02:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
if this is done by the uh core
 
02:41:28.630 --> 02:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh what's gonna happen to the waste
 
02:41:32.070 --> 02:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:37.110 --> 02:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:42.070 --> 02:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:44.790 --> 02:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
over three quarters of a million dollars
 
02:41:46.230 --> 02:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
in into
 
02:41:48.469 --> 02:41:48.479 align:start position:0%
the planning of this project
 
02:41:51.349 --> 02:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh and those funds the majority of those
 
02:41:53.590 --> 02:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
funds did come from
 
02:41:57.190 --> 02:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
um the division here ourselves from our
 
02:42:00.309 --> 02:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
one of our restricted funds part of the
 
02:42:00.319 --> 02:42:01.429 align:start position:0%
one of our restricted funds part of the
design

02:42:01.429 --> 02:42:01.439 align:start position:0%
design
 
02:42:03.990 --> 02:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh and permitting for this was
 
02:42:06.950 --> 02:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
identification of an offshore
 
02:42:09.750 --> 02:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh disposal site
 
02:42:12.790 --> 02:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh just out up east of the isles of
 
02:42:14.870 --> 02:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
shoals uh there was a considerable
 
02:42:16.630 --> 02:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
amount of expense that went in there
 
02:42:19.190 --> 02:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
because that was required in the base
 
02:42:19.200 --> 02:42:21.510 align:start position:0%
because that was required in the base
plan

02:42:21.510 --> 02:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
plan
 
02:42:23.750 --> 02:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
here's the interesting part of what
 
02:42:25.830 --> 02:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
happened during the delay of this
 
02:42:28.070 --> 02:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
project was
 
02:42:29.590 --> 02:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
it's been determined that there's a
 
02:42:31.670 --> 02:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
beneficial use of this
 
02:42:34.710 --> 02:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
material because uh ninety percent of it
 
02:42:37.830 --> 02:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
is high packed glacial sand there's very
 
02:42:40.230 --> 02:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
very little ledge or rock involved in
 
02:42:40.240 --> 02:42:41.190 align:start position:0%
very little ledge or rock involved in
this

02:42:41.190 --> 02:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:42:43.590 --> 02:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
and so the corps of engineers
 
02:42:47.110 --> 02:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
made it available to other communities
 
02:42:49.670 --> 02:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
along the seacoast for beach nourishment
 
02:42:51.590 --> 02:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
and there's a there's a tremendous
 
02:42:53.030 --> 02:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
02:42:55.349 --> 02:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
interest in it down in the salisbury
 
02:42:57.830 --> 02:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
beach we've all read in the newspapers
 
02:42:59.110 --> 02:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
about how
 
02:43:02.230 --> 02:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
uh plum island and newbury massachusetts
 
02:43:04.790 --> 02:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
and even his fire are down the scituate
 
02:43:04.800 --> 02:43:05.910 align:start position:0%
and even his fire are down the scituate
mass

02:43:05.910 --> 02:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
mass
 
02:43:05.920 --> 02:43:06.710 align:start position:0%
mass
are

02:43:06.710 --> 02:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:43:09.110 --> 02:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
all interested in the sand
 
02:43:12.230 --> 02:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
uh and then the corps did come up with a
 
02:43:15.349 --> 02:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
grant program to assist these
 
02:43:17.910 --> 02:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
communities to pay the difference in the
 
02:43:21.110 --> 02:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
transportation costs so if the cost of
 
02:43:23.429 --> 02:43:23.439 align:start position:0%
taking the material
 
02:43:26.790 --> 02:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
to the base disposal site
 
02:43:29.349 --> 02:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
is going to go to newbury massachusetts
 
02:43:31.910 --> 02:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
and transportation costs
 
02:43:34.309 --> 02:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
are more than what the base plan called
 
02:43:36.230 --> 02:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
for the municipality was going to be
 
02:43:39.510 --> 02:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
responsible for making those costs
 
02:43:42.070 --> 02:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
and then sold the state of massachusetts
 
02:43:42.080 --> 02:43:43.590 align:start position:0%
and then sold the state of massachusetts
and

02:43:43.590 --> 02:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:43:45.670 --> 02:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
the municipalities working with the
 
02:43:45.680 --> 02:43:47.110 align:start position:0%
the municipalities working with the
corps

02:43:47.110 --> 02:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
corps
 
02:43:49.269 --> 02:43:49.279 align:start position:0%
have made that sand available so
 
02:43:51.269 --> 02:43:51.279 align:start position:0%
considerable amount of that
 
02:43:53.910 --> 02:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
sand is going to go down for beach
 
02:43:56.469 --> 02:43:56.479 align:start position:0%
nourishment sir
 
02:43:58.469 --> 02:43:58.479 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chairman
 
02:43:59.750 --> 02:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
02:43:59.760 --> 02:44:00.710 align:start position:0%
go ahead
um

02:44:00.710 --> 02:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:44:02.950 --> 02:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
is this going this material going to be
 
02:44:05.269 --> 02:44:05.279 align:start position:0%
put ashore and de-watered and trucked
 
02:44:08.309 --> 02:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
down or is it going to go by barge
 
02:44:11.429 --> 02:44:11.439 align:start position:0%
it goes by badge sir okay
 
02:44:12.630 --> 02:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much i
 
02:44:15.030 --> 02:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate it yes sir
 
02:44:19.590 --> 02:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:22.950 --> 02:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr marconi
 
02:44:27.670 --> 02:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
so if you're increasing a turning radius
 
02:44:29.429 --> 02:44:29.439 align:start position:0%
i mean as i envision it you're
 
02:44:32.070 --> 02:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
increasing the circumference of the area
 
02:44:35.030 --> 02:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
where things can turn i mean who own do
 
02:44:36.950 --> 02:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
you have like right away to the
 
02:44:39.750 --> 02:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
adjoining land or
 
02:44:41.670 --> 02:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
because you're expanding that opening i
 
02:44:48.469 --> 02:44:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:50.630 --> 02:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
and maybe i just don't understand well
 
02:44:52.550 --> 02:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's i'm trying to i'm trying to
 
02:44:55.349 --> 02:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
think of how to put it the army corps of
 
02:44:57.670 --> 02:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
engineers um
 
02:45:01.429 --> 02:45:01.439 align:start position:0%
takes takes ownership of the waterways
 
02:45:04.630 --> 02:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
all the way to the high watermark
 
02:45:04.640 --> 02:45:06.070 align:start position:0%
all the way to the high watermark
um

02:45:06.070 --> 02:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:10.309 --> 02:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:11.830 --> 02:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
legal issue
 
02:45:13.750 --> 02:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
that you know the state of new hampshire
 
02:45:16.389 --> 02:45:16.399 align:start position:0%
controls the submerged lands under that
 
02:45:17.510 --> 02:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
water that's
 
02:45:19.510 --> 02:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
under the jurisdiction of the army corps
 
02:45:21.190 --> 02:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
of engineers
 
02:45:24.950 --> 02:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:27.670 --> 02:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
98 of this project is over on the main
 
02:45:29.190 --> 02:45:29.200 align:start position:0%
side of the river
 
02:45:32.469 --> 02:45:32.479 align:start position:0%
so there are there are some permits that
 
02:45:34.710 --> 02:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
the corps of engineers had to secure
 
02:45:37.670 --> 02:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
from the state of maine but
 
02:45:39.670 --> 02:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
it's basically
 
02:45:41.670 --> 02:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
state and federally jointly owned
 
02:45:44.389 --> 02:45:44.399 align:start position:0%
property i guess it's i'm not the legal
 
02:45:47.190 --> 02:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
eagle on this one
 
02:45:49.110 --> 02:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:45:50.870 --> 02:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
robert edgar
 
02:45:52.950 --> 02:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
02:45:56.070 --> 02:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question captain marconi
 
02:45:59.990 --> 02:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
um this project by increasing the uh the
 
02:46:03.190 --> 02:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
length of the of the uh of the ships
 
02:46:05.750 --> 02:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
but also combined with the fact that we
 
02:46:07.910 --> 02:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
can get bigger bigger ships up
 
02:46:10.230 --> 02:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
underneath or through the sarah long
 
02:46:11.429 --> 02:46:11.439 align:start position:0%
bridge now
 
02:46:12.870 --> 02:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
seemed like it would be quite a benefit
 
02:46:15.110 --> 02:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
for the uh for the economy
 
02:46:17.910 --> 02:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
here and it was really good to see uh
 
02:46:21.030 --> 02:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
see this this money being
 
02:46:22.870 --> 02:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
recently released you know by the
 
02:46:25.429 --> 02:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
federal government so could you maybe
 
02:46:27.670 --> 02:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
expand upon expand a little bit on the
 
02:46:27.680 --> 02:46:28.389 align:start position:0%
expand upon expand a little bit on the
uh

02:46:28.389 --> 02:46:28.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:46:30.950 --> 02:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
the effect on the economy of
 
02:46:33.670 --> 02:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
having this project complete
 
02:46:36.230 --> 02:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
sure um
 
02:46:38.870 --> 02:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
this has been going on now for
 
02:46:41.429 --> 02:46:41.439 align:start position:0%
the past number of years and and
 
02:46:43.910 --> 02:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
the real the real push behind it was the
 
02:46:46.230 --> 02:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
expansion of the uh
 
02:46:47.830 --> 02:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
panama canal
 
02:46:49.670 --> 02:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh there was a whole new set of locks
 
02:46:52.710 --> 02:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
built uh next to the existing panama
 
02:46:56.070 --> 02:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
canal that would handle larger ships
 
02:46:58.790 --> 02:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh for example container ships that you
 
02:47:01.030 --> 02:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
know traditionally carried
 
02:47:04.309 --> 02:47:04.319 align:start position:0%
uh five or six thousand teus now they've
 
02:47:08.469 --> 02:47:08.479 align:start position:0%
got ships that are carrying 19 000 teus
 
02:47:11.910 --> 02:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
and these larger ships on the scale of
 
02:47:14.070 --> 02:47:14.080 align:start position:0%
economy and efficiency
 
02:47:16.790 --> 02:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh you're putting more cargo on a larger
 
02:47:20.309 --> 02:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
ship reducing the transportation costs
 
02:47:23.030 --> 02:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
so these larger ships are displacing
 
02:47:26.309 --> 02:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
ships that had traditionally been on
 
02:47:27.670 --> 02:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh on
 
02:47:30.870 --> 02:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
these routes and those ships are
 
02:47:33.590 --> 02:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
displacing the smaller ships that we had
 
02:47:35.910 --> 02:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
historically seen come in here
 
02:47:35.920 --> 02:47:36.870 align:start position:0%
historically seen come in here
so

02:47:36.870 --> 02:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:47:39.750 --> 02:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
um as those smaller ships are retiring
 
02:47:41.830 --> 02:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
we're seeing larger ships
 
02:47:41.840 --> 02:47:43.510 align:start position:0%
we're seeing larger ships
um

02:47:43.510 --> 02:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:45.910 --> 02:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
in the in the northeast sector are
 
02:47:49.190 --> 02:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
handling cargo um another factor that
 
02:47:51.670 --> 02:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
was taken into consideration here is
 
02:47:51.680 --> 02:47:52.469 align:start position:0%
was taken into consideration here is
that

02:47:52.469 --> 02:47:52.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:47:54.790 --> 02:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
um so so that that kind of deals with
 
02:47:56.950 --> 02:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
the length of the ship but also
 
02:48:00.070 --> 02:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
um ships are getting wider which goes to
 
02:48:00.080 --> 02:48:01.990 align:start position:0%
um ships are getting wider which goes to
representative

02:48:01.990 --> 02:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:48:04.309 --> 02:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
edgar's comment about the sarah long
 
02:48:04.319 --> 02:48:05.510 align:start position:0%
edgar's comment about the sarah long
bridge

02:48:05.510 --> 02:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
bridge
 
02:48:07.510 --> 02:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
the naval architects have
 
02:48:09.030 --> 02:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
determined that
 
02:48:11.110 --> 02:48:11.120 align:start position:0%
they can put a percentage more cargo on
 
02:48:12.309 --> 02:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
a ship
 
02:48:17.590 --> 02:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
by making it a wider instead of longer
 
02:48:21.030 --> 02:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
and not and not re and not require more
 
02:48:21.040 --> 02:48:22.230 align:start position:0%
and not and not re and not require more
draft

02:48:22.230 --> 02:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
draft
 
02:48:22.240 --> 02:48:23.030 align:start position:0%
draft
so

02:48:23.030 --> 02:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:48:25.110 --> 02:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
we're seeing we're seeing these older
 
02:48:27.510 --> 02:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
ships that historically came in here
 
02:48:29.429 --> 02:48:29.439 align:start position:0%
being retired
 
02:48:32.790 --> 02:48:32.800 align:start position:0%
which is why we're seeing now these 765
 
02:48:35.590 --> 02:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
foot ships uh coming into the harbor and
 
02:48:37.429 --> 02:48:37.439 align:start position:0%
they're being displayed and the older
 
02:48:39.670 --> 02:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
ships are being displaced by
 
02:48:42.230 --> 02:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
a larger more efficient ship
 
02:48:44.630 --> 02:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
i hope that answers your question
 
02:48:47.750 --> 02:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
oh yes thank you very much captain
 
02:48:49.190 --> 02:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
02:48:50.469 --> 02:48:50.479 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
02:48:52.870 --> 02:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh captain marconi seeing no other
 
02:48:54.630 --> 02:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
02:48:55.990 --> 02:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
and i would
 
02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:57.510 align:start position:0%
and i would
um

02:48:57.510 --> 02:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:59.110 --> 02:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
again mention that there is that
 
02:49:01.510 --> 02:49:01.520 align:start position:0%
powerpoint presentation which shows
 
02:49:04.309 --> 02:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
where the basin will be in relation to
 
02:49:07.510 --> 02:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
the bridges and all the rest um which
 
02:49:10.070 --> 02:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
will is helpful in visualizing what
 
02:49:12.630 --> 02:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
we're talking about and this is
 
02:49:14.950 --> 02:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
something that we will have to do
 
02:49:14.960 --> 02:49:15.830 align:start position:0%
something that we will have to do
um

02:49:15.830 --> 02:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:17.910 --> 02:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
because i believe the way the language
 
02:49:19.030 --> 02:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
is written
 
02:49:21.349 --> 02:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
at the federal level if we do not
 
02:49:22.870 --> 02:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
support this
 
02:49:26.389 --> 02:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
then we do not get the work done
 
02:49:29.110 --> 02:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
for the foreseeable future am i correct
 
02:49:30.870 --> 02:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
in that you know
 
02:49:34.469 --> 02:49:34.479 align:start position:0%
you're always correct mr chairman
 
02:49:36.230 --> 02:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
most of the committee won't agree with
 
02:49:38.389 --> 02:49:38.399 align:start position:0%
you but thank you
 
02:49:41.349 --> 02:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
well i thank you for the opportunity to
 
02:49:43.590 --> 02:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh to crash your party here and and say
 
02:49:45.349 --> 02:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
what i had to say and
 
02:49:45.359 --> 02:49:46.790 align:start position:0%
what i had to say and
um

02:49:46.790 --> 02:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:48.870 --> 02:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
most of you have my phone number please
 
02:49:51.269 --> 02:49:51.279 align:start position:0%
don't hesitate to call me and i'm sure
 
02:49:53.750 --> 02:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
i'll be back up and and
 
02:49:56.309 --> 02:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
you mentioned 1.5 if you could give us
 
02:49:56.319 --> 02:49:57.030 align:start position:0%
you mentioned 1.5 if you could give us
some

02:49:57.030 --> 02:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:49:59.349 --> 02:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
if that's the number that's fine if you
 
02:50:01.590 --> 02:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
have a more refined number it would be
 
02:50:04.630 --> 02:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
helpful to provide to mr shea or to
 
02:50:04.640 --> 02:50:05.910 align:start position:0%
helpful to provide to mr shea or to
myself

02:50:05.910 --> 02:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
myself
 
02:50:07.510 --> 02:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
so that we can have that in our
 
02:50:07.520 --> 02:50:09.269 align:start position:0%
so that we can have that in our
discussions

02:50:09.269 --> 02:50:09.279 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
02:50:11.110 --> 02:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
yes so that that does have about a
 
02:50:12.950 --> 02:50:12.960 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollar contingency
 
02:50:14.389 --> 02:50:14.399 align:start position:0%
because the course still hasn't
 
02:50:14.399 --> 02:50:15.590 align:start position:0%
because the course still hasn't
fine-tuned

02:50:15.590 --> 02:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
fine-tuned
 
02:50:18.070 --> 02:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh what the cost of the mitigation is
 
02:50:20.070 --> 02:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
going to be the yield
 
02:50:22.469 --> 02:50:22.479 align:start position:0%
thank you yes sir
 
02:50:25.030 --> 02:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
all right see no other questions for the
 
02:50:27.590 --> 02:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
pr on the presentations
 
02:50:27.600 --> 02:50:28.790 align:start position:0%
pr on the presentations
um

02:50:28.790 --> 02:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:32.389 --> 02:50:32.399 align:start position:0%
the committee will stand in recess until
 
02:50:33.910 --> 02:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
1 pm
 
02:50:36.150 --> 02:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
where we will have a full committee work
 
02:50:36.160 --> 02:50:37.269 align:start position:0%
where we will have a full committee work
session

02:50:37.269 --> 02:50:37.279 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:50:40.389 --> 02:50:40.399 align:start position:0%
on the presentations it is my intention
 
02:50:42.070 --> 02:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
as i said earlier
 
02:50:45.429 --> 02:50:45.439 align:start position:0%
to begin talking about the presentations
 
02:50:47.269 --> 02:50:47.279 align:start position:0%
and see if we can't
 
02:50:49.030 --> 02:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
reach agreement on
 
02:50:50.790 --> 02:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
on several of them
 
02:50:53.190 --> 02:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
so that when we meet again next week and
 
02:50:54.630 --> 02:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
the week after
 
02:50:58.309 --> 02:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
we are only talking about those that
 
02:51:00.710 --> 02:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
may be increased or decreased as the
 
02:51:03.030 --> 02:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
case may be
 
02:51:05.590 --> 02:51:05.600 align:start position:0%
so with that the committee is in recess
 
02:51:08.150 --> 02:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
until 1pm
 
03:27:50.070 --> 03:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:52.070 --> 03:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
if members could start taking their
 
03:28:09.990 --> 03:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:12.950 --> 03:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
i was listening to sb43
 
03:28:14.710 --> 03:28:14.720 align:start position:0%

03:28:26.229 --> 03:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:29.110 --> 03:28:29.120 align:start position:0%

too
 
03:28:45.520 --> 03:28:46.790 align:start position:0%

03:28:49.120 --> 03:28:50.309 align:start position:0%
yep keeping the family happy is
important

03:28:50.309 --> 03:28:50.319 align:start position:0%
important
 
03:29:05.830 --> 03:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:08.550 --> 03:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
we have like one more minute i do like
 
03:29:08.560 --> 03:29:09.590 align:start position:0%
we have like one more minute i do like
to

03:29:09.590 --> 03:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:29:11.670 --> 03:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
start on time
 
03:29:14.309 --> 03:29:14.319 align:start position:0%
and it's fortunate that we are all at
 
03:29:16.790 --> 03:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
home and can grab something to eat
 
03:29:20.790 --> 03:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
having run over into the lunch hour
 
03:29:22.950 --> 03:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
so in this committee room one side isn't
 
03:29:24.870 --> 03:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
crushed into the wall and the other side
 
03:29:24.880 --> 03:29:28.630 align:start position:0%
crushed into the wall and the other side
isn't

03:29:28.630 --> 03:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:34.469 --> 03:29:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:36.229 --> 03:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
now that tended to change depending on
 
03:29:38.070 --> 03:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
when they reset the room from doubles
 
03:29:38.970 --> 03:29:38.980 align:start position:0%
and not
 
03:29:38.980 --> 03:29:46.229 align:start position:0%
and not

03:32:02.070 --> 03:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
zoom licenses to go forward so we need
 
03:32:07.110 --> 03:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:09.830 --> 03:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
first up
 
03:32:11.590 --> 03:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
what i want to do
 
03:32:16.309 --> 03:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
is reach consensus as i said on some
 
03:32:18.950 --> 03:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
um agencies requests
 
03:32:21.429 --> 03:32:21.439 align:start position:0%
that have um
 
03:32:24.870 --> 03:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
little or no changes or no changes
 
03:32:24.880 --> 03:32:25.910 align:start position:0%
little or no changes or no changes
actually

03:32:25.910 --> 03:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:32:29.030 --> 03:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
and no controversy when we were asking
 
03:32:29.040 --> 03:32:30.150 align:start position:0%
and no controversy when we were asking
questions

03:32:30.150 --> 03:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:32:32.389 --> 03:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
but before we get to that
 
03:32:34.389 --> 03:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
i just have
 
03:32:37.750 --> 03:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
two items that we have to think about
 
03:32:39.830 --> 03:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
um first up
 
03:32:41.429 --> 03:32:41.439 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
03:32:44.229 --> 03:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
house bill 595
 
03:32:46.950 --> 03:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
which is the supreme court records
 
03:32:48.630 --> 03:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
we're talking
 
03:32:51.110 --> 03:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
money in this biennium money in the next
 
03:32:54.150 --> 03:32:54.160 align:start position:0%
biennium to digitize the supreme court
 
03:32:56.309 --> 03:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
is we retain that bill
 
03:32:57.990 --> 03:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
to think about
 
03:32:58.000 --> 03:32:59.590 align:start position:0%
to think about
um

03:32:59.590 --> 03:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:02.710 --> 03:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
as you remember there is a
 
03:33:04.830 --> 03:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
absence of anybody wants to claim
 
03:33:08.150 --> 03:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility to to take on the project
 
03:33:10.950 --> 03:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
the archivist when i talk to
 
03:33:10.960 --> 03:33:11.830 align:start position:0%
the archivist when i talk to
him

03:33:11.830 --> 03:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
him
 
03:33:15.269 --> 03:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
uh then talk uh email back and forth
 
03:33:17.750 --> 03:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
um is interested in the idea but he
 
03:33:20.710 --> 03:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
needs a lot more information
 
03:33:20.720 --> 03:33:21.670 align:start position:0%
needs a lot more information
do

03:33:21.670 --> 03:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:33:23.030 --> 03:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
we want to
 
03:33:24.630 --> 03:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
the only question i'm going to ask about
 
03:33:27.510 --> 03:33:27.520 align:start position:0%

03:34:38.550 --> 03:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:41.269 --> 03:34:41.279 align:start position:0%
representative claudia
 
03:34:43.510 --> 03:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
unmute yourself

thank you sorry about that mr chairman
uh

03:34:46.710 --> 03:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:34:49.190 --> 03:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
former representative campbell called me
 
03:34:50.870 --> 03:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
said he didn't think he need as much
 
03:34:53.990 --> 03:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
money as or you know for the railroad as
 
03:34:55.670 --> 03:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
in the previous capital budget that was
 
03:34:57.670 --> 03:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
my understanding
 
03:35:00.870 --> 03:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
um he called me as well and and rather
 
03:35:03.110 --> 03:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
than asking for what's in that bill he
 
03:35:04.389 --> 03:35:04.399 align:start position:0%
was talking somewhere in the
 
03:35:07.269 --> 03:35:07.279 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of 300 000 but we still
 
03:35:09.429 --> 03:35:09.439 align:start position:0%
have the other rail that we would have
 
03:35:10.550 --> 03:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
to discuss
 
03:35:13.030 --> 03:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
and try to find room within the capital
 
03:35:13.040 --> 03:35:13.990 align:start position:0%
and try to find room within the capital
budget

03:35:13.990 --> 03:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
budget
 
03:35:16.870 --> 03:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
remembering that we're already over what
 
03:35:18.309 --> 03:35:18.319 align:start position:0%
the treasurer
 
03:35:22.389 --> 03:35:22.399 align:start position:0%
has recommended be the maximum mile
 
03:35:24.229 --> 03:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
along with everybody else who has asked
 
03:35:27.910 --> 03:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:29.510 --> 03:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
so we will
 
03:35:31.030 --> 03:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
03:35:33.830 --> 03:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
yeah just to refresh our recollection as
 
03:35:35.830 --> 03:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
we start in this so
 
03:35:38.630 --> 03:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
i think that the governor's budget was
 
03:35:39.710 --> 03:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
what like
 
03:35:42.550 --> 03:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
127 in general funds
 
03:35:44.950 --> 03:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
and then was the treasurer in the
 
03:35:47.590 --> 03:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
vicinity of 125 i just i'm trying to
 
03:35:52.309 --> 03:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
remember the treasurer recommended 120.
 
03:35:52.319 --> 03:35:53.110 align:start position:0%
remember the treasurer recommended 120.
uh

03:35:53.110 --> 03:35:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:35:53.120 --> 03:35:55.429 align:start position:0%
uh
yes

03:35:55.429 --> 03:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:35:55.439 --> 03:35:56.309 align:start position:0%
yes
your

03:35:56.309 --> 03:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:35:58.469 --> 03:35:58.479 align:start position:0%
shock is noted representative evil but
 
03:36:00.630 --> 03:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
that was her recommendation
 
03:36:03.510 --> 03:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
um she was going to try to be on today
 
03:36:03.520 --> 03:36:04.950 align:start position:0%
um she was going to try to be on today
but

03:36:04.950 --> 03:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:36:07.750 --> 03:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
there was a conflict with with other
 
03:36:09.750 --> 03:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
um committees and
 
03:36:11.750 --> 03:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
and her other business
 
03:36:14.550 --> 03:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
i will try to get her on um at a future
 
03:36:16.550 --> 03:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
work session to talk a little bit about
 
03:36:16.560 --> 03:36:17.429 align:start position:0%
work session to talk a little bit about
it

03:36:17.429 --> 03:36:17.439 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:36:19.750 --> 03:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
but um
 
03:36:24.150 --> 03:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:27.269 --> 03:36:27.279 align:start position:0%
the way 125 is structured
 
03:36:31.269 --> 03:36:31.279 align:start position:0%
we are at 124 788.
 
03:36:35.429 --> 03:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
um so right at the 125.
 
03:36:37.910 --> 03:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
um the only thing that dropped out was
 
03:36:40.630 --> 03:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
2.5 million dollars for the cte in
 
03:36:43.910 --> 03:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
hudson so anything that we add goes
 
03:36:43.920 --> 03:36:45.110 align:start position:0%
hudson so anything that we add goes
above

03:36:45.110 --> 03:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
above
 
03:36:46.309 --> 03:36:46.319 align:start position:0%
above that
 
03:36:49.990 --> 03:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
unless we substitute projects for
 
03:36:53.190 --> 03:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:55.590 --> 03:36:55.600 align:start position:0%

doing omnibus bills that they've even
 
03:37:20.389 --> 03:37:20.399 align:start position:0%
thought about doing the either the
 
03:37:22.630 --> 03:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
budget or the capital budget
 
03:37:25.269 --> 03:37:25.279 align:start position:0%

to share the comparison report
 
03:37:33.269 --> 03:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
so all members can see the same document
 
03:37:35.030 --> 03:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
and then we can
 
03:37:37.510 --> 03:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
people that would be helpful
 
03:37:37.520 --> 03:37:38.469 align:start position:0%

03:38:19.670 --> 03:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:38:21.269 --> 03:38:21.279 align:start position:0%
on one of them
 
03:38:23.510 --> 03:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
the the lobbyists did say that if we
 
03:38:25.750 --> 03:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
gave them the full 2 million that for
 
03:38:28.469 --> 03:38:28.479 align:start position:0%
that one railroad that would complete it
 
03:38:30.950 --> 03:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
but that's a two million dollar general
 
03:38:34.389 --> 03:38:34.399 align:start position:0%
fund project that we would have to add
 
03:38:37.190 --> 03:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
any money we give them would be matched
 
03:38:37.200 --> 03:38:38.150 align:start position:0%
any money we give them would be matched
um

03:38:38.150 --> 03:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:41.190 --> 03:38:41.200 align:start position:0%
so i think that we need to postpone that
 
03:38:41.200 --> 03:38:42.630 align:start position:0%
so i think that we need to postpone that
discussion

03:38:42.630 --> 03:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
03:38:44.790 --> 03:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
until we start dealing with all of the
 
03:38:46.790 --> 03:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
requests from people like
 
03:38:49.830 --> 03:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
um hhs corrections and others who have
 
03:38:52.070 --> 03:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
asked for additional
 
03:38:54.950 --> 03:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
general fund yeah thank you i i just got
 
03:38:57.110 --> 03:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
that confused with the
 
03:38:57.120 --> 03:38:58.630 align:start position:0%
that confused with the
capitol

03:38:58.630 --> 03:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
capitol
 
03:39:00.550 --> 03:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
what i would like to do
 
03:39:02.790 --> 03:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
today is i said the ones i don't think
 
03:39:04.229 --> 03:39:04.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a lot of problems
 
03:39:06.229 --> 03:39:06.239 align:start position:0%
with i just wanted to see if we wanted
 
03:39:09.110 --> 03:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
to to discuss those two things
 
03:39:09.120 --> 03:39:11.830 align:start position:0%
to to discuss those two things
further

03:39:11.830 --> 03:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:14.630 --> 03:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
if we could find the room for them but
 
03:39:16.469 --> 03:39:16.479 align:start position:0%
we shall see
 
03:39:18.070 --> 03:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
all right first i'm just going to go
 
03:39:18.080 --> 03:39:20.469 align:start position:0%
all right first i'm just going to go
alphabetically

03:39:20.469 --> 03:39:20.479 align:start position:0%
alphabetically
 
03:39:22.630 --> 03:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture
 
03:39:22.640 --> 03:39:23.990 align:start position:0%
department of agriculture
um

03:39:23.990 --> 03:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:29.830 --> 03:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
markets and food has asked for 180 000
 
03:39:29.840 --> 03:39:32.309 align:start position:0%
markets and food has asked for 180 000
for

03:39:32.309 --> 03:39:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:35.030 --> 03:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
their building at the eastern states
 
03:39:35.040 --> 03:39:37.590 align:start position:0%
their building at the eastern states
exposition

03:39:37.590 --> 03:39:37.600 align:start position:0%
exposition
 
03:39:43.510 --> 03:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:46.070 --> 03:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
it's going to go quickly
 
03:39:48.469 --> 03:39:48.479 align:start position:0%
see none then i would
 
03:39:51.590 --> 03:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
without objection i will say that
 
03:39:54.469 --> 03:39:54.479 align:start position:0%
we agree that that should stay in
 
03:39:57.429 --> 03:39:57.439 align:start position:0%
the capital budget as as
 
03:40:02.950 --> 03:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:02.960 --> 03:40:04.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:40:04.870 --> 03:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:40:04.880 --> 03:40:06.630 align:start position:0%
okay
second

03:40:06.630 --> 03:40:06.640 align:start position:0%
second
 
03:40:06.640 --> 03:40:08.630 align:start position:0%
second
what

03:40:08.630 --> 03:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:40:11.190 --> 03:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
fishing game
 
03:40:11.200 --> 03:40:12.309 align:start position:0%
fishing game
um

03:40:12.309 --> 03:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:14.150 --> 03:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
what is that amount
 
03:40:16.229 --> 03:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
four million six hundred fifteen
 
03:40:18.790 --> 03:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for the powder mill
 
03:40:21.750 --> 03:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
fish hatchery i will say that one of the
 
03:40:24.150 --> 03:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
members is very interested in that
 
03:40:26.790 --> 03:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh representative newton and i have also
 
03:40:29.590 --> 03:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
received several phone calls at home
 
03:40:32.550 --> 03:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
about the need to do that this is
 
03:40:34.309 --> 03:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
fishing game
 
03:40:38.150 --> 03:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:40.389 --> 03:40:40.399 align:start position:0%
so i open that
 
03:40:42.150 --> 03:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
particular project
 
03:40:43.670 --> 03:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
up to
 
03:40:49.510 --> 03:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:55.269 --> 03:40:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:58.870 --> 03:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
okay so i will without objection
 
03:41:01.910 --> 03:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
we will not discuss that
 
03:41:03.349 --> 03:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
further today
 
03:41:03.359 --> 03:41:05.190 align:start position:0%
further today
and

03:41:05.190 --> 03:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:41:07.030 --> 03:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
suggest that we leave that in the
 
03:41:10.550 --> 03:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
capital budget as it is
 
03:41:10.560 --> 03:41:11.830 align:start position:0%
capital budget as it is
um

03:41:11.830 --> 03:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:15.510 --> 03:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
it's going much quicker um
 
03:41:17.590 --> 03:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
judicial branch
 
03:41:20.389 --> 03:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:22.870 --> 03:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
mr chairman are up for just a second
 
03:41:22.880 --> 03:41:23.990 align:start position:0%
mr chairman are up for just a second
sure

03:41:23.990 --> 03:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:41:24.000 --> 03:41:25.990 align:start position:0%
sure
um

03:41:25.990 --> 03:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:27.830 --> 03:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
this is obviously representative mills
 
03:41:29.750 --> 03:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm trying to keep track of this for
 
03:41:31.910 --> 03:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
so that we don't have to go all over so
 
03:41:33.429 --> 03:41:33.439 align:start position:0%
if we go a little bit slowly i'm going
 
03:41:35.830 --> 03:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
to write down all the ones that we're uh
 
03:41:37.590 --> 03:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
in agreement with
 
03:41:39.030 --> 03:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:41:40.950 --> 03:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
just just keep track of it for future
 
03:41:40.960 --> 03:41:42.790 align:start position:0%
just just keep track of it for future
reference

03:41:42.790 --> 03:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
reference
 
03:41:45.269 --> 03:41:45.279 align:start position:0%
and uh i think the only place we'll
 
03:41:46.790 --> 03:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
start will probably get into some
 
03:41:48.550 --> 03:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
trouble is when we're going into
 
03:41:51.429 --> 03:41:51.439 align:start position:0%
something like uh you know uh
 
03:41:53.349 --> 03:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
health and human services where they've
 
03:41:55.190 --> 03:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
got a huge huge
 
03:41:57.990 --> 03:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
that's let's do them one at a time
 
03:42:00.870 --> 03:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
that's it and and that's well these so
 
03:42:03.030 --> 03:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
far have been like single things under
 
03:42:04.710 --> 03:42:04.720 align:start position:0%
the agency that's the only thing that
 
03:42:07.750 --> 03:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
they're doing and plus there was no
 
03:42:07.760 --> 03:42:08.870 align:start position:0%
they're doing and plus there was no
um

03:42:08.870 --> 03:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:10.710 --> 03:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
apparent discussion
 
03:42:13.269 --> 03:42:13.279 align:start position:0%
or or disagreement with these
 
03:42:15.429 --> 03:42:15.439 align:start position:0%
as we were um
 
03:42:17.030 --> 03:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
03:42:19.349 --> 03:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
with the hearings from
 
03:42:22.150 --> 03:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
from all of them
 
03:42:24.469 --> 03:42:24.479 align:start position:0%
which is why i wanted to discuss them
 
03:42:24.479 --> 03:42:25.510 align:start position:0%
which is why i wanted to discuss them
today

03:42:25.510 --> 03:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:42:25.520 --> 03:42:26.950 align:start position:0%
today
um

03:42:26.950 --> 03:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:29.030 --> 03:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
your hands still up david no i'm
 
03:42:30.950 --> 03:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
lowering it thank you and muting myself
 
03:42:30.960 --> 03:42:33.349 align:start position:0%
lowering it thank you and muting myself
barry

03:42:33.349 --> 03:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
barry
 
03:42:35.910 --> 03:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
you know i just want to say i mean i
 
03:42:39.030 --> 03:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
want to do a general comment about
 
03:42:41.030 --> 03:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
software being a capital
 
03:42:43.510 --> 03:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
item or not being a capital item but in
 
03:42:45.590 --> 03:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
this particular case i think this is a
 
03:42:47.429 --> 03:42:47.439 align:start position:0%
this is a particularly important project
 
03:42:49.190 --> 03:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
and one that
 
03:42:51.510 --> 03:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
is a sort of it's not just an update of
 
03:42:53.349 --> 03:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
existing things it's a radical change in
 
03:42:54.710 --> 03:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
procedures so
 
03:42:54.720 --> 03:42:56.389 align:start position:0%
procedures so
hey

03:42:56.389 --> 03:42:56.399 align:start position:0%
hey
 
03:42:58.070 --> 03:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
which one uh
 
03:42:59.349 --> 03:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
the e chord
 
03:43:00.710 --> 03:43:00.720 align:start position:0%
e chord right i thought that's the only
 
03:43:04.550 --> 03:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
one i do and i i have and i think
 
03:43:07.110 --> 03:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
several of us on the the committee have
 
03:43:09.110 --> 03:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
shared that concern
 
03:43:10.950 --> 03:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
over the uh
 
03:43:12.710 --> 03:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
several um
 
03:43:12.720 --> 03:43:13.910 align:start position:0%
several um
biennia

03:43:13.910 --> 03:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
biennia
 
03:43:16.950 --> 03:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
about the amount of hardware and
 
03:43:20.870 --> 03:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:24.469 --> 03:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
but without an ability to put it into
 
03:43:26.950 --> 03:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
the operating budget without busting
 
03:43:30.469 --> 03:43:30.479 align:start position:0%
that budget um we've had to to do some
 
03:43:32.150 --> 03:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
of it um
 
03:43:32.160 --> 03:43:32.830 align:start position:0%
of it um
with

03:43:32.830 --> 03:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:43:34.950 --> 03:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
capital um
 
03:43:37.349 --> 03:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
we tried trying to do it with five or
 
03:43:39.590 --> 03:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
ten year bonds that just the treasurer
 
03:43:44.469 --> 03:43:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:48.070 --> 03:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
so any questions or comments about um
 
03:43:51.590 --> 03:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
the continuation for funding of
 
03:43:54.070 --> 03:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire e court under judicial
 
03:43:57.750 --> 03:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
branch which is 1.4 million dollars
 
03:44:00.790 --> 03:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
representative evil the lawyer speaks
 
03:44:03.030 --> 03:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
well i mean i just think this is a
 
03:44:05.590 --> 03:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
continuation of a process that we
 
03:44:08.950 --> 03:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
started you know several years ago and
 
03:44:08.960 --> 03:44:10.070 align:start position:0%
started you know several years ago and
um

03:44:10.070 --> 03:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:12.630 --> 03:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
they've spoken very highly of it that
 
03:44:15.189 --> 03:44:15.199 align:start position:0%
it's very effective it's become even
 
03:44:17.510 --> 03:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
more obvious how good this is because of
 
03:44:17.520 --> 03:44:18.710 align:start position:0%
more obvious how good this is because of
covid

03:44:18.710 --> 03:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
covid
 
03:44:20.790 --> 03:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
and i um
 
03:44:23.670 --> 03:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
i think it would be folly to uh
 
03:44:25.830 --> 03:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
shut it down now i think we just need to
 
03:44:28.389 --> 03:44:28.399 align:start position:0%
keep the progress going so i would be in
 
03:44:32.150 --> 03:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
favor of keeping it in
 
03:44:38.870 --> 03:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:41.429 --> 03:44:41.439 align:start position:0%
yes mr thank you mr chairman
 
03:44:42.950 --> 03:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
just echo
 
03:44:46.229 --> 03:44:46.239 align:start position:0%
representative eagle says
 
03:44:48.550 --> 03:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not a big fan of the
 
03:44:51.670 --> 03:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
software being the capital budget but it
 
03:44:54.229 --> 03:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
is what it is so
 
03:44:54.239 --> 03:44:55.110 align:start position:0%
is what it is so
and

03:44:55.110 --> 03:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:44:57.030 --> 03:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
it needs to be done and it's been
 
03:45:01.670 --> 03:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:03.830 --> 03:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
and it has it
 
03:45:09.189 --> 03:45:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:11.030 --> 03:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
tv about
 
03:45:12.790 --> 03:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
remote arraignments and all the rest
 
03:45:14.790 --> 03:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
it's all been part of this what we're
 
03:45:16.469 --> 03:45:16.479 align:start position:0%
doing with this so
 
03:45:16.479 --> 03:45:17.429 align:start position:0%
doing with this so
um

03:45:17.429 --> 03:45:17.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:19.750 --> 03:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
it has been helpful representative jack
 
03:45:21.510 --> 03:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so everyone's aware they have lapse
 
03:45:24.150 --> 03:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
extensions from the three previous
 
03:45:25.670 --> 03:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
times that we've given money that we're
 
03:45:26.710 --> 03:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
going to carry forward and they're going
 
03:45:29.510 --> 03:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
to pool it all and continue on
 
03:45:31.030 --> 03:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:45:31.040 --> 03:45:32.469 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
barry

03:45:32.469 --> 03:45:32.479 align:start position:0%
barry
 
03:45:35.590 --> 03:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
just a quick addition this is one
 
03:45:37.750 --> 03:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
one case and then maybe maybe true for
 
03:45:39.750 --> 03:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
other software cases too but they you
 
03:45:41.110 --> 03:45:41.120 align:start position:0%
know it's allowed the court to save a
 
03:45:42.309 --> 03:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
lot of money
 
03:45:44.469 --> 03:45:44.479 align:start position:0%
in terms of personnel
 
03:45:44.479 --> 03:45:45.590 align:start position:0%
in terms of personnel
and

03:45:45.590 --> 03:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:45:47.590 --> 03:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of what you know with the
 
03:45:49.510 --> 03:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
clients and and other people that
 
03:45:51.030 --> 03:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
participate in the court system from
 
03:45:51.040 --> 03:45:52.309 align:start position:0%
participate in the court system from
outside

03:45:52.309 --> 03:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
outside
 
03:45:54.870 --> 03:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
save a lot of time and money as well so
 
03:45:56.550 --> 03:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
i mean there's there's a good payoff
 
03:45:59.189 --> 03:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
here as well as being you know
 
03:46:00.790 --> 03:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
getting with them i
 
03:46:03.429 --> 03:46:03.439 align:start position:0%
i totally agree as if you've
 
03:46:06.309 --> 03:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
ever had to deal with the court as a
 
03:46:09.590 --> 03:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
non-lawyer trying to find out what forms
 
03:46:13.030 --> 03:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
or where to file you know the ecord is
 
03:46:15.429 --> 03:46:15.439 align:start position:0%
making it more accessible to our
 
03:46:19.590 --> 03:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
citizens as we go forward
 
03:46:23.670 --> 03:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
so we are in agreement to
 
03:46:27.510 --> 03:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
not change or reduce 1.4 million for new
 
03:46:29.670 --> 03:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire e court
 
03:46:31.670 --> 03:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
at this point and just
 
03:46:37.429 --> 03:46:37.439 align:start position:0%
that will stay in in house bill 25 as is
 
03:46:40.870 --> 03:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
see no disagreement
 
03:46:42.710 --> 03:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
liquor commission
 
03:46:45.750 --> 03:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
computer software uh credit card point
 
03:46:47.429 --> 03:46:47.439 align:start position:0%
of service
 
03:46:51.349 --> 03:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
for one million dollars there was
 
03:46:53.830 --> 03:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
this is bond's other
 
03:46:53.840 --> 03:46:55.269 align:start position:0%
this is bond's other
um

03:46:55.269 --> 03:46:55.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:57.670 --> 03:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
and i will make a comment that that 1
 
03:46:59.750 --> 03:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
million from the liquor commission is
 
03:47:03.030 --> 03:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
the least amount i've seen at hb 25
 
03:47:05.990 --> 03:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
for at least 15 years
 
03:47:07.670 --> 03:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
because usually they're asking for new
 
03:47:10.070 --> 03:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
buildings and the rest representative
 
03:47:10.080 --> 03:47:11.349 align:start position:0%
buildings and the rest representative
mills

03:47:11.349 --> 03:47:11.359 align:start position:0%
mills
 
03:47:12.950 --> 03:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i just want to go on record saying
 
03:47:15.030 --> 03:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
one thing i i don't mind the fact that
 
03:47:17.030 --> 03:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
we're bonding the million dollars once
 
03:47:19.510 --> 03:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
again this is coming strictly out of
 
03:47:21.269 --> 03:47:21.279 align:start position:0%
liquor commission
 
03:47:23.349 --> 03:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh bonding authority anyway so it is
 
03:47:25.590 --> 03:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
their money but this is at least the
 
03:47:28.469 --> 03:47:28.479 align:start position:0%
third biennium we have seen this same
 
03:47:32.150 --> 03:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
item for computer software for up for
 
03:47:36.150 --> 03:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
point of sales for credit cards and
 
03:47:38.389 --> 03:47:38.399 align:start position:0%
at what point do they ever think this is
 
03:47:39.830 --> 03:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
going to end there's only so many credit
 
03:47:41.750 --> 03:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
cards out there how much can they
 
03:47:47.349 --> 03:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:47.359 --> 03:47:48.630 align:start position:0%
 
any

03:47:48.630 --> 03:47:48.640 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:47:50.070 --> 03:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
any ideas
 
03:47:51.510 --> 03:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
at all
 
03:47:55.670 --> 03:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
i wish you to ask that question when the
 
03:47:58.630 --> 03:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
director was there um yeah i i thought
 
03:48:00.469 --> 03:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
about it well too late but i guess it's
 
03:48:01.830 --> 03:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
something um
 
03:48:03.670 --> 03:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's a little awkward this year not
 
03:48:05.670 --> 03:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
having all the the books spread out in
 
03:48:07.429 --> 03:48:07.439 align:start position:0%
front of us and all of last year's
 
03:48:09.830 --> 03:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
figures to look at you sometimes can't
 
03:48:12.950 --> 03:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
get to the the figures in a in a timely
 
03:48:15.269 --> 03:48:15.279 align:start position:0%
manner but i do remember noticing that
 
03:48:16.870 --> 03:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
wow this is at least
 
03:48:18.710 --> 03:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
three bienniums now we've given them
 
03:48:22.389 --> 03:48:22.399 align:start position:0%
money to upgrade a point of sale
 
03:48:22.399 --> 03:48:23.750 align:start position:0%
money to upgrade a point of sale
marty

03:48:23.750 --> 03:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
marty
 
03:48:25.590 --> 03:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
yeah uh if i remember the testimony
 
03:48:27.750 --> 03:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
correctly they did address the fact that
 
03:48:29.189 --> 03:48:29.199 align:start position:0%
they had a problem with their vendor and
 
03:48:30.950 --> 03:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
they had to re-bid it and is that the
 
03:48:33.269 --> 03:48:33.279 align:start position:0%
project they had to do that on
 
03:48:35.349 --> 03:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
it's the only project they pitched so
 
03:48:37.510 --> 03:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
03:48:39.110 --> 03:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you that's that's
 
03:48:40.710 --> 03:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
like i said i'm fine with the money i'm
 
03:48:42.630 --> 03:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
fine with the amount it's just something
 
03:48:45.110 --> 03:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
i'm going to make a close note of for
 
03:48:47.910 --> 03:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
two years from now
 
03:48:51.510 --> 03:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
if if any of us are still here
 
03:48:54.150 --> 03:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
melissa you had your hand up
 
03:48:54.160 --> 03:48:55.670 align:start position:0%
melissa you had your hand up
okay

03:48:55.670 --> 03:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:48:58.070 --> 03:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
so we're in agreement to to leave the
 
03:48:59.670 --> 03:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
liquor commission
 
03:48:59.680 --> 03:49:03.670 align:start position:0%
liquor commission
alone

03:49:03.670 --> 03:49:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:05.189 --> 03:49:05.199 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:49:05.199 --> 03:49:06.150 align:start position:0%
all right
um

03:49:06.150 --> 03:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:09.429 --> 03:49:09.439 align:start position:0%
police standards and training
 
03:49:12.150 --> 03:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
um there were two projects
 
03:49:15.189 --> 03:49:15.199 align:start position:0%
um the air conditioner replacements and
 
03:49:19.590 --> 03:49:19.600 align:start position:0%
range ventilation and filtration upgrade
 
03:49:20.950 --> 03:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
between them
 
03:49:24.150 --> 03:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
they were 1.325
 
03:49:25.670 --> 03:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
03:49:28.630 --> 03:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
of generally funded bonds
 
03:49:30.309 --> 03:49:30.319 align:start position:0%
discussion on
 
03:49:37.030 --> 03:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:38.950 --> 03:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
seeing none is anybody opposed to
 
03:49:41.830 --> 03:49:41.840 align:start position:0%
leaving this in house bill 25 as
 
03:49:45.990 --> 03:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:49.269 --> 03:49:49.279 align:start position:0%
seeing none that
 
03:49:50.630 --> 03:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
will stay
 
03:49:52.870 --> 03:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
and the reason as i said earlier i'm
 
03:49:55.510 --> 03:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
doing this is because in our next work
 
03:49:58.309 --> 03:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
sessions after we've had a chance to
 
03:50:00.630 --> 03:50:00.640 align:start position:0%
think through some of the other stuff
 
03:50:02.309 --> 03:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to have longer discussions
 
03:50:05.830 --> 03:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
on people who have asked for more money
 
03:50:07.670 --> 03:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
so i want to get the ones that we're not
 
03:50:10.309 --> 03:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
going to argue about done
 
03:50:10.319 --> 03:50:12.630 align:start position:0%
going to argue about done
um

03:50:12.630 --> 03:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:14.070 --> 03:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
veterans home
 
03:50:17.910 --> 03:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
um two projects generally funded uh up
 
03:50:20.710 --> 03:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
master plan update and parking lot
 
03:50:24.910 --> 03:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
repairs and improvements for a total of
 
03:50:29.590 --> 03:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
1.460 million dollars generally funded
 
03:50:29.600 --> 03:50:31.670 align:start position:0%
1.460 million dollars generally funded
bonds

03:50:31.670 --> 03:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
bonds
 
03:50:35.269 --> 03:50:35.279 align:start position:0%
any questions about that
 
03:50:35.279 --> 03:50:37.830 align:start position:0%
any questions about that
comments

03:50:37.830 --> 03:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
comments
 
03:50:39.030 --> 03:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
see none
 
03:50:41.189 --> 03:50:41.199 align:start position:0%
i would
 
03:50:43.510 --> 03:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
accept that is that is also one that
 
03:50:45.110 --> 03:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
we're not going to
 
03:50:46.830 --> 03:50:46.840 align:start position:0%
have to discuss
 
03:50:50.389 --> 03:50:50.399 align:start position:0%
um in the future
 
03:50:53.110 --> 03:50:53.120 align:start position:0%
now surprisingly uh i added one this
 
03:50:53.120 --> 03:50:54.229 align:start position:0%
now surprisingly uh i added one this
morning

03:50:54.229 --> 03:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
morning
 
03:50:57.670 --> 03:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
on the university system
 
03:50:59.269 --> 03:50:59.279 align:start position:0%
since they didn't
 
03:51:01.750 --> 03:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
did not come in and ask for anything
 
03:51:03.189 --> 03:51:03.199 align:start position:0%
other than what
 
03:51:06.229 --> 03:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
was in the governor's proposal the 15
 
03:51:08.710 --> 03:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
03:51:11.189 --> 03:51:11.199 align:start position:0%
i don't want to reopen that whole
 
03:51:11.199 --> 03:51:12.710 align:start position:0%
i don't want to reopen that whole
uh

03:51:12.710 --> 03:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:51:14.950 --> 03:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
discussion we always have about what to
 
03:51:17.110 --> 03:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
give to the university system and i
 
03:51:20.229 --> 03:51:20.239 align:start position:0%
would suggest that since we did promise
 
03:51:20.239 --> 03:51:21.830 align:start position:0%
would suggest that since we did promise
that

03:51:21.830 --> 03:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:51:25.030 --> 03:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
while not appropriating it two years ago
 
03:51:27.429 --> 03:51:27.439 align:start position:0%
it was part of a larger plan
 
03:51:29.990 --> 03:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
that we would fund their projects over
 
03:51:33.030 --> 03:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
three biennium um just to split up the
 
03:51:33.040 --> 03:51:33.910 align:start position:0%
three biennium um just to split up the
cost

03:51:33.910 --> 03:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
cost
 
03:51:38.309 --> 03:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
that we leave that at 15 million
 
03:51:41.030 --> 03:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
for the university system for the
 
03:51:43.349 --> 03:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
projects that they showed at the three
 
03:51:43.359 --> 03:51:44.469 align:start position:0%
projects that they showed at the three
campuses

03:51:44.469 --> 03:51:44.479 align:start position:0%
campuses
 
03:51:45.990 --> 03:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh marty
 
03:51:48.550 --> 03:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
yeah just so everyone's not confused uh
 
03:51:50.950 --> 03:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
this appropriation is in is in section
 
03:51:50.960 --> 03:51:52.309 align:start position:0%
this appropriation is in is in section
11

03:51:52.309 --> 03:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
11
 
03:51:55.429 --> 03:51:55.439 align:start position:0%
on line 16 of page seven
 
03:51:57.670 --> 03:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
that's on the
 
03:51:59.910 --> 03:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet the compare sheet
 
03:52:02.150 --> 03:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
and as i said this morning
 
03:52:04.469 --> 03:52:04.479 align:start position:0%
that does count towards
 
03:52:07.269 --> 03:52:07.279 align:start position:0%
our overall um
 
03:52:09.189 --> 03:52:09.199 align:start position:0%
generally funded
 
03:52:09.199 --> 03:52:13.110 align:start position:0%
generally funded
um

03:52:13.110 --> 03:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:15.110 --> 03:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
what's the word anyways what what will
 
03:52:17.670 --> 03:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
be generally funded in house bill 25
 
03:52:19.910 --> 03:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
this time even though it was promised
 
03:52:24.870 --> 03:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:26.950 --> 03:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
just just a clarification i just want to
 
03:52:29.750 --> 03:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
um let the committee know that the the
 
03:52:31.990 --> 03:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
university's um appropriation was
 
03:52:32.000 --> 03:52:33.429 align:start position:0%
university's um appropriation was
actually

03:52:33.429 --> 03:52:33.439 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:52:33.439 --> 03:52:34.790 align:start position:0%
actually
um

03:52:34.790 --> 03:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:36.950 --> 03:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
done in 2019 so that was approved in
 
03:52:40.630 --> 03:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
2019 in the 29th capital budget
 
03:52:42.550 --> 03:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
so when you look at your bonds
 
03:52:45.670 --> 03:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
authorized in section 5 of house bill 25
 
03:52:47.349 --> 03:52:47.359 align:start position:0%
that number won't show up there because
 
03:52:49.349 --> 03:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
that's only going to show from section 1
 
03:52:52.309 --> 03:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
and 2 of the house bill 25 before you
 
03:52:54.150 --> 03:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
and that is why um just to make sure
 
03:52:55.830 --> 03:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
everybody knew
 
03:52:57.750 --> 03:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
that the governor was still in support
 
03:52:59.590 --> 03:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
of this 15 million appropriation you've
 
03:53:02.870 --> 03:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
got you have the section 11 in the um
 
03:53:05.110 --> 03:53:05.120 align:start position:0%
capital budget is introduced
 
03:53:07.590 --> 03:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
but as it has been discussed so far this
 
03:53:08.870 --> 03:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
does count
 
03:53:10.870 --> 03:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
or will count against the the total
 
03:53:14.550 --> 03:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
bonding that does occur in 22 and 23.
 
03:53:15.990 --> 03:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to make that clear
 
03:53:17.590 --> 03:53:17.600 align:start position:0%
because if you're trying to add that and
 
03:53:19.269 --> 03:53:19.279 align:start position:0%
you're looking at section 5 of the
 
03:53:20.790 --> 03:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
capital budget
 
03:53:25.429 --> 03:53:25.439 align:start position:0%
yeah it says 109.7 million dollars
 
03:53:27.189 --> 03:53:27.199 align:start position:0%
you're not going to add the 15 to that
 
03:53:28.950 --> 03:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
because it's already been appropriated
 
03:53:29.990 --> 03:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's only going to be the new
 
03:53:34.309 --> 03:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:37.189 --> 03:53:37.199 align:start position:0%
but it does count against what
 
03:53:40.070 --> 03:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
the treasurer looks at as
 
03:53:40.080 --> 03:53:41.750 align:start position:0%
the treasurer looks at as
um

03:53:41.750 --> 03:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:41.760 --> 03:53:43.510 align:start position:0%
um
bonding

03:53:43.510 --> 03:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
bonding
 
03:53:45.590 --> 03:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
new bonding within
 
03:53:47.830 --> 03:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh this biennium
 
03:53:49.590 --> 03:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely correct
 
03:53:51.670 --> 03:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
this bill could fail you could itl house
 
03:53:54.229 --> 03:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
bill 25 but the appropriation for the 15
 
03:53:55.910 --> 03:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
million dollars to unh
 
03:53:57.030 --> 03:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
is still
 
03:53:59.349 --> 03:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
allowed because it was approved by the
 
03:54:03.750 --> 03:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:05.510 --> 03:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
but what i'm trying to get at is we
 
03:54:07.830 --> 03:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
don't have 15 million dollars to play
 
03:54:11.030 --> 03:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
with for for other projects
 
03:54:13.110 --> 03:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
no you don't
 
03:54:13.120 --> 03:54:13.990 align:start position:0%
no you don't
okay

03:54:13.990 --> 03:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:54:18.229 --> 03:54:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:20.150 --> 03:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i just wanted to
 
03:54:22.229 --> 03:54:22.239 align:start position:0%
say that i think is it
 
03:54:25.110 --> 03:54:25.120 align:start position:0%
i'm committing to this for
 
03:54:27.030 --> 03:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
the three bienniums
 
03:54:31.110 --> 03:54:31.120 align:start position:0%
that it would be inappropriate not to
 
03:54:35.030 --> 03:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:37.830 --> 03:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
well i i tend to agree i've
 
03:54:40.550 --> 03:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
been working on these multiple
 
03:54:44.070 --> 03:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
um biennium projects for the university
 
03:54:46.630 --> 03:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
since 2001.
 
03:54:48.150 --> 03:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
we have always lived up to our
 
03:54:50.790 --> 03:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
obligation that we've committed to
 
03:54:53.269 --> 03:54:53.279 align:start position:0%
as we go went forward
 
03:54:55.830 --> 03:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
because the caveat on all of these as
 
03:54:58.790 --> 03:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
they said earlier today was
 
03:55:00.710 --> 03:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
we give them a certain amount of money
 
03:55:02.790 --> 03:55:02.800 align:start position:0%
based on what the estimate is
 
03:55:04.630 --> 03:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
we don't give them any more if it goes
 
03:55:06.710 --> 03:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
over they pick up the uh
 
03:55:09.830 --> 03:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
the additional cost from some source
 
03:55:11.510 --> 03:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:55:15.590 --> 03:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
from our our perspective as as
 
03:55:17.990 --> 03:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
public works and highways that works out
 
03:55:20.070 --> 03:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
well may not work out well for the
 
03:55:21.429 --> 03:55:21.439 align:start position:0%
budget of
 
03:55:23.910 --> 03:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
the university system but
 
03:55:27.510 --> 03:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:29.910 --> 03:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
so we are in agreement that
 
03:55:29.920 --> 03:55:30.950 align:start position:0%
so we are in agreement that
that

03:55:30.950 --> 03:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:55:32.790 --> 03:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
03:55:34.710 --> 03:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
university system
 
03:55:36.309 --> 03:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
stays at
 
03:55:37.830 --> 03:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
15 million
 
03:55:42.790 --> 03:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
with no in increases or decreases
 
03:55:47.349 --> 03:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:47.359 --> 03:55:50.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:55:50.950 --> 03:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:54.790 --> 03:55:54.800 align:start position:0%
i don't know does anybody want to tackle
 
03:55:54.800 --> 03:55:56.950 align:start position:0%
i don't know does anybody want to tackle
um

03:55:56.950 --> 03:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:00.309 --> 03:56:00.319 align:start position:0%
one or more of the
 
03:56:03.990 --> 03:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
additional i don't i have not looked at
 
03:56:06.309 --> 03:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
um for example admin services
 
03:56:10.389 --> 03:56:10.399 align:start position:0%
corrections or hhs hhs
 
03:56:15.990 --> 03:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:16.000 --> 03:56:19.030 align:start position:0%
 
but

03:56:19.030 --> 03:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:21.590 --> 03:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
we also don't have
 
03:56:25.590 --> 03:56:25.600 align:start position:0%
in front of us what if any monies
 
03:56:30.229 --> 03:56:30.239 align:start position:0%
marty and his crew will be able to find
 
03:56:32.229 --> 03:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
with the lapse
 
03:56:32.239 --> 03:56:33.990 align:start position:0%
with the lapse
extensions

03:56:33.990 --> 03:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
extensions
 
03:56:35.349 --> 03:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
i don't think we're going to find
 
03:56:37.429 --> 03:56:37.439 align:start position:0%
millions this time around
 
03:56:41.189 --> 03:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
but if we do it would be nice
 
03:56:43.590 --> 03:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh david mills
 
03:56:45.590 --> 03:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh yes mr chair i was just wondering
 
03:56:47.990 --> 03:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not before we even start
 
03:56:50.630 --> 03:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
attacking everything uh uh department at
 
03:56:52.790 --> 03:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
a time if we'd like to take a couple of
 
03:56:54.309 --> 03:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
smaller ones
 
03:56:57.030 --> 03:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
such as a department of safety
 
03:57:00.309 --> 03:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
uh for 750 000 and just
 
03:57:03.110 --> 03:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
just agree to that without considering
 
03:57:04.870 --> 03:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
any add-ons or anything else that
 
03:57:06.630 --> 03:57:06.640 align:start position:0%
they've already asked for if we just
 
03:57:08.710 --> 03:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
want to prove some of the things that
 
03:57:10.469 --> 03:57:10.479 align:start position:0%
have been asked for and the governor is
 
03:57:10.479 --> 03:57:11.990 align:start position:0%
have been asked for and the governor is
okay

03:57:11.990 --> 03:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:57:13.590 --> 03:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
just to lighten up the workload for the
 
03:57:13.600 --> 03:57:16.309 align:start position:0%
just to lighten up the workload for the
future

03:57:16.309 --> 03:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:18.550 --> 03:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
i must have missed that um
 
03:57:20.950 --> 03:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
safety did not ask for anything more did
 
03:57:20.960 --> 03:57:21.750 align:start position:0%
safety did not ask for anything more did
they

03:57:21.750 --> 03:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:57:23.269 --> 03:57:23.279 align:start position:0%
i i don't know i don't have that in
 
03:57:25.349 --> 03:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
front of me but i do know that this is a
 
03:57:27.830 --> 03:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
is an amount we could probably agree on
 
03:57:29.349 --> 03:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
for right now
 
03:57:31.429 --> 03:57:31.439 align:start position:0%
for this particular
 
03:57:34.309 --> 03:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
budget item if they ask for you know 25
 
03:57:36.950 --> 03:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
000 to fix a sewer cover or something we
 
03:57:38.870 --> 03:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
can take that up separate when we decide
 
03:57:41.670 --> 03:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
to take uh add-ons
 
03:57:43.670 --> 03:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
but these are just existing requests
 
03:57:46.870 --> 03:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:49.830 --> 03:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
make your make your pitch
 
03:57:51.429 --> 03:57:51.439 align:start position:0%
that that's it i don't know whether they
 
03:57:52.870 --> 03:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
have an add-on or not but i'd like to
 
03:57:56.870 --> 03:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
see if we would we have any problem uh
 
03:57:58.630 --> 03:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
putting forth seven hundred and fifty
 
03:58:01.429 --> 03:58:01.439 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of bond it
 
03:58:03.670 --> 03:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
our general funds for the operations
 
03:58:03.680 --> 03:58:07.110 align:start position:0%
our general funds for the operations
center

03:58:07.110 --> 03:58:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:11.510 --> 03:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:11.520 --> 03:58:13.990 align:start position:0%
 
marty

03:58:13.990 --> 03:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:16.469 --> 03:58:16.479 align:start position:0%
i was i i was just going to respond to
 
03:58:18.309 --> 03:58:18.319 align:start position:0%
what do we know about the lapses uh the
 
03:58:20.070 --> 03:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
agencies have been a little slow this
 
03:58:20.080 --> 03:58:20.950 align:start position:0%
agencies have been a little slow this
year

03:58:20.950 --> 03:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:58:23.830 --> 03:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh getting back to us so i don't have
 
03:58:25.750 --> 03:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
all the information yet the one big
 
03:58:27.510 --> 03:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
number i was able to find was a million
 
03:58:29.830 --> 03:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
dollars but it's liquor funds so it
 
03:58:31.830 --> 03:58:31.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't help us
 
03:58:34.229 --> 03:58:34.239 align:start position:0%
yeah that's true now the other thing i'd
 
03:58:35.750 --> 03:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
like to see is there were quite a few
 
03:58:35.760 --> 03:58:37.030 align:start position:0%
like to see is there were quite a few
agencies

03:58:37.030 --> 03:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
03:58:40.070 --> 03:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
that had quite a long list of
 
03:58:42.150 --> 03:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
things that didn't get funded
 
03:58:44.630 --> 03:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
and it just points out that we really
 
03:58:47.670 --> 03:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
could use some more bonding authority
 
03:58:49.189 --> 03:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
which really points out that we could
 
03:58:52.950 --> 03:58:52.960 align:start position:0%
use some more unrestricted revenue to
 
03:58:56.150 --> 03:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
use in the denominator
 
03:58:58.790 --> 03:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
we also have bad discussion for ways and
 
03:59:01.030 --> 03:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
means but we don't have it this time but
 
03:59:02.150 --> 03:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
it it
 
03:59:04.790 --> 03:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a a ticking time bomb that
 
03:59:07.590 --> 03:59:07.600 align:start position:0%
there's all this deferred stuff that
 
03:59:09.910 --> 03:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
people seem like they need and it's not
 
03:59:12.070 --> 03:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
getting funded
 
03:59:14.150 --> 03:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
and david i just went through their
 
03:59:16.870 --> 03:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
presentation from safety somehow i
 
03:59:19.510 --> 03:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
missed that in my my making my list they
 
03:59:22.389 --> 03:59:22.399 align:start position:0%
did not ask for anything else
 
03:59:24.830 --> 03:59:24.840 align:start position:0%
other than the 750
 
03:59:24.840 --> 03:59:26.389 align:start position:0%
other than the 750
000.

03:59:26.389 --> 03:59:26.399 align:start position:0%
000.
 
03:59:26.399 --> 03:59:28.630 align:start position:0%
000.
so

03:59:28.630 --> 03:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:59:32.150 --> 03:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
anybody else have questions mark
 
03:59:34.070 --> 03:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh john
 
03:59:36.630 --> 03:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
um hasn't it historically been when we
 
03:59:38.870 --> 03:59:38.880 align:start position:0%
go through the lapse monies
 
03:59:40.630 --> 03:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
that a lot of that money
 
03:59:43.670 --> 03:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
has been repurposed for projects and
 
03:59:46.229 --> 03:59:46.239 align:start position:0%
uh possibly projects that they'd like to
 
03:59:48.550 --> 03:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
do as opposed to
 
03:59:50.950 --> 03:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
pulling much of that money out and using
 
03:59:54.870 --> 03:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
it for something different am i wrong um
 
03:59:57.990 --> 03:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
we have habitually taken it as
 
03:59:58.000 --> 03:59:59.030 align:start position:0%
we have habitually taken it as
money

03:59:59.030 --> 03:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:00:01.269 --> 04:00:01.279 align:start position:0%
that the committee can use
 
04:00:04.309 --> 04:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
if it is within the same department fine
 
04:00:07.830 --> 04:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
but if we see a higher priority
 
04:00:10.870 --> 04:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
we've used it for that
 
04:00:13.189 --> 04:00:13.199 align:start position:0%
so it really is
 
04:00:17.429 --> 04:00:17.439 align:start position:0%
the state's money not the agency's money
 
04:00:19.670 --> 04:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
so we can have that discussion if we
 
04:00:21.110 --> 04:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
find it
 
04:00:21.120 --> 04:00:22.469 align:start position:0%
find it
um

04:00:22.469 --> 04:00:22.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:22.479 --> 04:00:24.150 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:00:24.150 --> 04:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:00:24.160 --> 04:00:26.710 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:00:26.710 --> 04:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:28.950 --> 04:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
that's that's kind of where we've left
 
04:00:31.110 --> 04:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
it in the past
 
04:00:31.120 --> 04:00:32.389 align:start position:0%
it in the past
okay

04:00:32.389 --> 04:00:32.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:00:35.349 --> 04:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
mike you abbott
 
04:00:37.590 --> 04:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman i did
 
04:00:39.910 --> 04:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
the other thing i just like to uh
 
04:00:42.309 --> 04:00:42.319 align:start position:0%
second what representative mills said
 
04:00:45.670 --> 04:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
before but um
 
04:00:48.469 --> 04:00:48.479 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that i don't
 
04:00:50.550 --> 04:00:50.560 align:start position:0%
have any problem with the department of
 
04:00:52.790 --> 04:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
safety's request
 
04:00:56.710 --> 04:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:58.389 --> 04:00:58.399 align:start position:0%
i would agree
 
04:00:58.399 --> 04:01:00.630 align:start position:0%
i would agree
no

04:01:00.630 --> 04:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:00.640 --> 04:01:01.670 align:start position:0%
 
martin

04:01:01.670 --> 04:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
martin
 
04:01:04.469 --> 04:01:04.479 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh can mr shea explain
 
04:01:06.870 --> 04:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
sections 12 and 13
 
04:01:09.750 --> 04:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh repurposing department of safety how
 
04:01:15.189 --> 04:01:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:16.950 --> 04:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
that was a request
 
04:01:18.950 --> 04:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
that the department of safety made
 
04:01:20.870 --> 04:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
during the governor's phase
 
04:01:23.030 --> 04:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
originally it was in the draft of house
 
04:01:24.469 --> 04:01:24.479 align:start position:0%
bill 2
 
04:01:26.550 --> 04:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
and through discussions it was felt that
 
04:01:28.469 --> 04:01:28.479 align:start position:0%
would be better placed in house bill 25
 
04:01:29.750 --> 04:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
because that's typically where you find
 
04:01:32.070 --> 04:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
that repurposing language and what
 
04:01:34.229 --> 04:01:34.239 align:start position:0%
they're asking to do is repurpose some
 
04:01:37.030 --> 04:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
highway funds from two projects and some
 
04:01:38.870 --> 04:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
general funds from two projects for
 
04:01:40.630 --> 04:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
their um
 
04:01:42.630 --> 04:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
the aviation hangar that they've been
 
04:01:46.790 --> 04:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:48.229 --> 04:01:48.239 align:start position:0%
but that that's how it ended up in there
 
04:01:49.429 --> 04:01:49.439 align:start position:0%
the department of safety made the
 
04:01:51.429 --> 04:01:51.439 align:start position:0%
request as they were building the
 
04:01:51.439 --> 04:01:53.030 align:start position:0%
request as they were building the
um

04:01:53.030 --> 04:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:55.110 --> 04:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 and house bill 25 during
 
04:01:59.670 --> 04:01:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:07.429 --> 04:02:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:07.439 --> 04:02:08.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:02:08.550 --> 04:02:08.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:02:08.560 --> 04:02:10.870 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:02:10.870 --> 04:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:12.950 --> 04:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
we'll have to talk about that is
 
04:02:15.349 --> 04:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
separate from their new appropriation
 
04:02:17.030 --> 04:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
though correct
 
04:02:18.950 --> 04:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
04:02:18.960 --> 04:02:20.070 align:start position:0%
that's correct
okay

04:02:20.070 --> 04:02:20.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:02:21.510 --> 04:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
so when
 
04:02:23.189 --> 04:02:23.199 align:start position:0%
when we get
 
04:02:23.199 --> 04:02:24.710 align:start position:0%
when we get
um

04:02:24.710 --> 04:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:27.830 --> 04:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
marty's um report back we can discuss
 
04:02:29.990 --> 04:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
what we're doing with with all the
 
04:02:32.469 --> 04:02:32.479 align:start position:0%
collapse extensions and
 
04:02:34.790 --> 04:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
changes and make sure the committee
 
04:02:36.389 --> 04:02:36.399 align:start position:0%
totally knows
 
04:02:38.550 --> 04:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
what all of these are you you have your
 
04:02:44.950 --> 04:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:44.960 --> 04:02:45.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:02:45.990 --> 04:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:02:46.000 --> 04:02:47.750 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:02:47.750 --> 04:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:49.750 --> 04:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
one other thing i think
 
04:02:52.550 --> 04:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
i think we could probably agree on
 
04:02:55.030 --> 04:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
is the
 
04:02:57.269 --> 04:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
department of transportation
 
04:02:59.110 --> 04:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
generally funded
 
04:03:01.030 --> 04:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh portion
 
04:03:03.750 --> 04:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
for the the matches for
 
04:03:03.760 --> 04:03:05.189 align:start position:0%
for the the matches for
aviation

04:03:05.189 --> 04:03:05.199 align:start position:0%
aviation
 
04:03:05.199 --> 04:03:06.710 align:start position:0%
aviation
um

04:03:06.710 --> 04:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:06.720 --> 04:03:07.750 align:start position:0%
um
and

04:03:07.750 --> 04:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:03:07.760 --> 04:03:08.550 align:start position:0%
and
uh

04:03:08.550 --> 04:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:03:10.790 --> 04:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
public bus and
 
04:03:12.389 --> 04:03:12.399 align:start position:0%
and facilities
 
04:03:15.830 --> 04:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
um which is 1.724
 
04:03:19.830 --> 04:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh million dollars which leverages well
 
04:03:19.840 --> 04:03:20.870 align:start position:0%
uh million dollars which leverages well
over

04:03:20.870 --> 04:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
over
 
04:03:25.110 --> 04:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
um 27 million dollars of uh federal
 
04:03:25.120 --> 04:03:26.150 align:start position:0%
um 27 million dollars of uh federal
funds

04:03:26.150 --> 04:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
funds
 
04:03:29.590 --> 04:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh for for these projects
 
04:03:31.030 --> 04:03:31.040 align:start position:0%

04:03:33.349 --> 04:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh yes mr chairman i totally concur with
 
04:03:36.070 --> 04:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
your sentiments i urge that we i have no
 
04:03:37.269 --> 04:03:37.279 align:start position:0%
problem with the department of
 
04:03:39.189 --> 04:03:39.199 align:start position:0%
transportation's requests under federal
 
04:03:41.030 --> 04:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
and general funds and we're getting a
 
04:03:43.269 --> 04:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
lot of federal money for just one about
 
04:03:46.790 --> 04:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
1.7 million in change so i totally agree
 
04:03:49.590 --> 04:03:49.600 align:start position:0%
with that proposal and support and i i
 
04:03:51.349 --> 04:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
think and i was trying to pin him down
 
04:03:54.469 --> 04:03:54.479 align:start position:0%
but i couldn't that why i said
 
04:03:54.479 --> 04:03:55.269 align:start position:0%
but i couldn't that why i said
um

04:03:55.269 --> 04:03:55.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:57.750 --> 04:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
well north of the 27 million that's
 
04:03:57.760 --> 04:03:58.790 align:start position:0%
well north of the 27 million that's
listed

04:03:58.790 --> 04:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
listed
 
04:04:00.229 --> 04:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
currently is
 
04:04:02.229 --> 04:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
um there is a match
 
04:04:04.790 --> 04:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
that is and for
 
04:04:07.750 --> 04:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
the public transit and bus
 
04:04:07.760 --> 04:04:08.550 align:start position:0%
the public transit and bus
um

04:04:08.550 --> 04:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:10.870 --> 04:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
that 250 k
 
04:04:13.429 --> 04:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
is is going to be matched for
 
04:04:13.439 --> 04:04:14.389 align:start position:0%
is is going to be matched for
um

04:04:14.389 --> 04:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:17.189 --> 04:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
several million dollars as well so
 
04:04:20.070 --> 04:04:20.080 align:start position:0%
i think it's worthwhile to do that it
 
04:04:23.349 --> 04:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:25.590 --> 04:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of our constituents scattered
 
04:04:31.990 --> 04:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:32.000 --> 04:04:36.070 align:start position:0%
 
dennis

04:04:36.070 --> 04:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:38.790 --> 04:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
dennis thompson
 
04:04:42.070 --> 04:04:42.080 align:start position:0%
unmute sorry i'm sorry miss
 
04:04:44.070 --> 04:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
chairman i'm having brought in
 
04:04:47.349 --> 04:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
i'm having bandwidth issues but
 
04:04:49.429 --> 04:04:49.439 align:start position:0%
i had one question about the the
 
04:04:51.910 --> 04:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
aviation budget i saw her in there that
 
04:04:54.150 --> 04:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
they're looking to repave
 
04:04:56.229 --> 04:04:56.239 align:start position:0%
at the milan airport
 
04:04:59.030 --> 04:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
and uh i just want to make sure that
 
04:05:00.790 --> 04:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
that's going to be coordinated with the
 
04:05:02.229 --> 04:05:02.239 align:start position:0%
national guard's
 
04:05:04.389 --> 04:05:04.399 align:start position:0%
effort to build a new facility at that
 
04:05:04.399 --> 04:05:05.990 align:start position:0%
effort to build a new facility at that
airport

04:05:05.990 --> 04:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
airport
 
04:05:06.000 --> 04:05:09.349 align:start position:0%
airport
um

04:05:09.349 --> 04:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:10.870 --> 04:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
we can
 
04:05:10.880 --> 04:05:13.510 align:start position:0%
we can
ask

04:05:13.510 --> 04:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:16.870 --> 04:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
and i think that it would um
 
04:05:16.880 --> 04:05:18.469 align:start position:0%
and i think that it would um
but

04:05:18.469 --> 04:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:05:20.150 --> 04:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
we haven't got to whether we're going to
 
04:05:22.790 --> 04:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
fund the the request from the
 
04:05:24.950 --> 04:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
national guard or not and we'll take
 
04:05:26.630 --> 04:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
that at some point
 
04:05:28.830 --> 04:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
um but now all of those
 
04:05:32.469 --> 04:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
projects um tend to get coordinated
 
04:05:32.479 --> 04:05:33.590 align:start position:0%
projects um tend to get coordinated
um

04:05:33.590 --> 04:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:05:36.070 --> 04:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
just so that we're not uh paving
 
04:05:37.429 --> 04:05:37.439 align:start position:0%
something and then
 
04:05:39.670 --> 04:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
um digging a ditch across it to put a
 
04:05:41.590 --> 04:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
pipe down
 
04:05:43.830 --> 04:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
no and i understand that i'm just
 
04:05:46.309 --> 04:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
curious if uh
 
04:05:48.469 --> 04:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
with the national guard project being
 
04:05:50.229 --> 04:05:50.239 align:start position:0%
the size that it is
 
04:05:52.389 --> 04:05:52.399 align:start position:0%
if this project on the highway part of
 
04:05:53.830 --> 04:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
it is even going to get done in this
 
04:05:53.840 --> 04:05:56.830 align:start position:0%
it is even going to get done in this
biennium

04:05:56.830 --> 04:05:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:00.469 --> 04:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
um there is if i remember looking at
 
04:06:00.479 --> 04:06:01.670 align:start position:0%
um there is if i remember looking at
their

04:06:01.670 --> 04:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:06:05.030 --> 04:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
their pitch for the um
 
04:06:07.590 --> 04:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
the money for the aviation
 
04:06:10.309 --> 04:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
um there is a priority list
 
04:06:12.950 --> 04:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
which is probably larger than the money
 
04:06:15.110 --> 04:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
that they are going to be getting
 
04:06:15.120 --> 04:06:16.469 align:start position:0%
that they are going to be getting
um

04:06:16.469 --> 04:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:16.479 --> 04:06:17.349 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:06:17.349 --> 04:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:06:17.359 --> 04:06:18.630 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:06:18.630 --> 04:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:22.150 --> 04:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
they they have the ability to move
 
04:06:25.349 --> 04:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
within the license there move from one
 
04:06:27.110 --> 04:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
to the other if something's not ready
 
04:06:28.870 --> 04:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
they go to another one
 
04:06:28.880 --> 04:06:29.910 align:start position:0%
they go to another one
um

04:06:29.910 --> 04:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:32.309 --> 04:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
and that's true of a lot of these
 
04:06:34.309 --> 04:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
projects like that where
 
04:06:37.269 --> 04:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
they may have a priority list under
 
04:06:37.279 --> 04:06:38.030 align:start position:0%
they may have a priority list under
um

04:06:38.030 --> 04:06:38.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:42.229 --> 04:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
a line item that if for either
 
04:06:44.389 --> 04:06:44.399 align:start position:0%
permitting environmental study or
 
04:06:46.550 --> 04:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
whatever there's something that they
 
04:06:46.560 --> 04:06:47.349 align:start position:0%
whatever there's something that they
can't

04:06:47.349 --> 04:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
can't
 
04:06:48.309 --> 04:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
get to
 
04:06:50.630 --> 04:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
they go to to another one i mean
 
04:06:52.469 --> 04:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
especially true as everybody on this
 
04:06:54.950 --> 04:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
committee should know of highways and
 
04:06:56.229 --> 04:06:56.239 align:start position:0%
building uh
 
04:06:57.670 --> 04:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
things like that
 
04:07:00.229 --> 04:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
marty yeah um
 
04:07:02.870 --> 04:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
as an initial matter the the way that
 
04:07:06.070 --> 04:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
the aip funding works is it's 90 federal
 
04:07:07.910 --> 04:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
five percent state which is what we're
 
04:07:09.990 --> 04:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
appropriating now and five percent local
 
04:07:10.000 --> 04:07:10.950 align:start position:0%
appropriating now and five percent local
match

04:07:10.950 --> 04:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
match
 
04:07:12.710 --> 04:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
as to the timing of the projects it's
 
04:07:14.150 --> 04:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
very similar to the way the corps of
 
04:07:16.870 --> 04:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
engineers works on the port the faa
 
04:07:18.790 --> 04:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
works on the airports and it's they
 
04:07:18.800 --> 04:07:19.910 align:start position:0%
works on the airports and it's they
decide

04:07:19.910 --> 04:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
decide
 
04:07:21.510 --> 04:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
when they're going to do the project and
 
04:07:23.030 --> 04:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
we have to be ready
 
04:07:25.510 --> 04:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
with the 5 match at the time they decide
 
04:07:27.830 --> 04:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
to start the project so that's why we
 
04:07:30.550 --> 04:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
and so yes that money
 
04:07:32.790 --> 04:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
tends to stay around until the faa
 
04:07:36.790 --> 04:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
decides to use it and it is flexed
 
04:07:39.110 --> 04:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
as to what project it's used on and they
 
04:07:41.349 --> 04:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
don't always ask for it because they
 
04:07:41.359 --> 04:07:42.389 align:start position:0%
don't always ask for it because they
have

04:07:42.389 --> 04:07:42.399 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:07:44.070 --> 04:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
leftover money
 
04:07:46.229 --> 04:07:46.239 align:start position:0%
uh where the faa hasn't gotten around to
 
04:07:49.590 --> 04:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:54.550 --> 04:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:54.560 --> 04:07:56.150 align:start position:0%
 
annie

04:07:56.150 --> 04:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
annie
 
04:07:58.150 --> 04:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
04:07:58.160 --> 04:07:59.750 align:start position:0%
okay so
um

04:07:59.750 --> 04:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:03.030 --> 04:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
harry no negative comment david oh no no
 
04:08:04.550 --> 04:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
i was moving on to the next one i didn't
 
04:08:06.229 --> 04:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
know you were finishing up on this one i
 
04:08:08.150 --> 04:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that nobody has
 
04:08:08.160 --> 04:08:09.429 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that nobody has
objections

04:08:09.429 --> 04:08:09.439 align:start position:0%
objections
 
04:08:12.309 --> 04:08:12.319 align:start position:0%
to the department of transportation
 
04:08:14.790 --> 04:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
generally funded portion so that we
 
04:08:18.309 --> 04:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
don't have to drag that back up again in
 
04:08:20.070 --> 04:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
another work session
 
04:08:22.070 --> 04:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
although there is plenty of opportunity
 
04:08:23.750 --> 04:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
when we get
 
04:08:26.550 --> 04:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
working on the actual amendment to have
 
04:08:29.030 --> 04:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on any of these
 
04:08:30.790 --> 04:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
or we may hear something different at
 
04:08:32.630 --> 04:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
the public area
 
04:08:34.389 --> 04:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
all right david
 
04:08:37.030 --> 04:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh then then i would just i want to go
 
04:08:39.110 --> 04:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
back to one other the department of
 
04:08:41.830 --> 04:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
education that we didn't touch on
 
04:08:44.150 --> 04:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
and only for what they've asked not for
 
04:08:46.630 --> 04:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
any of the add-ons but i'd like to see
 
04:08:49.590 --> 04:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
if we would approve the total it's 560
 
04:08:49.600 --> 04:08:50.790 align:start position:0%
if we would approve the total it's 560
000

04:08:50.790 --> 04:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
000
 
04:08:52.309 --> 04:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
for two different projects the
 
04:08:54.229 --> 04:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
generation installation at walker
 
04:08:56.150 --> 04:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
building and the pre-engineering
 
04:08:58.550 --> 04:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
technology i wonder if we could just
 
04:09:00.630 --> 04:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
sign off on that
 
04:09:03.429 --> 04:09:03.439 align:start position:0%
without considering any other
 
04:09:07.830 --> 04:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
they did have one other request
 
04:09:09.750 --> 04:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
and we did ask them for some additional
 
04:09:09.760 --> 04:09:10.950 align:start position:0%
and we did ask them for some additional
information

04:09:10.950 --> 04:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:09:12.550 --> 04:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
so we will have to discuss the
 
04:09:14.870 --> 04:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
department of education again but i
 
04:09:16.630 --> 04:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
think that we can
 
04:09:18.800 --> 04:09:18.810 align:start position:0%
at least talk about agreeing to
 
04:09:18.810 --> 04:09:21.269 align:start position:0%
at least talk about agreeing to
[Music]

04:09:21.269 --> 04:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:09:23.910 --> 04:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
these two items which
 
04:09:29.670 --> 04:09:29.680 align:start position:0%
total 300 000 generally funded portions
 
04:09:32.150 --> 04:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
any comments actually they think they're
 
04:09:34.469 --> 04:09:34.479 align:start position:0%
560 i'm sorry you're right you're right
 
04:09:36.630 --> 04:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
general fund of course i'm right you're
 
04:09:38.309 --> 04:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
always right i forgot you're always
 
04:09:38.319 --> 04:09:40.950 align:start position:0%
always right i forgot you're always
right

04:09:40.950 --> 04:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:43.990 --> 04:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
okay david uh
 
04:09:46.790 --> 04:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
any anybody have problems with
 
04:09:49.830 --> 04:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
those two items
 
04:09:52.070 --> 04:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
but we will have to
 
04:09:55.429 --> 04:09:55.439 align:start position:0%
at least we did ask him since town
 
04:09:57.510 --> 04:09:57.520 align:start position:0%
meeting was yesterday i have no idea
 
04:10:00.229 --> 04:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
what whitefield did or where they are
 
04:10:02.710 --> 04:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
um on a cte i don't know how we would
 
04:10:03.750 --> 04:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
fit it
 
04:10:06.229 --> 04:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
in all honesty into this budget even if
 
04:10:07.670 --> 04:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
they did
 
04:10:07.680 --> 04:10:08.710 align:start position:0%
they did
um

04:10:08.710 --> 04:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:11.110 --> 04:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
we may have to
 
04:10:11.120 --> 04:10:12.150 align:start position:0%
we may have to
um

04:10:12.150 --> 04:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:14.070 --> 04:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
give some serious consideration other
 
04:10:16.389 --> 04:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
things if we want to do that
 
04:10:16.399 --> 04:10:17.750 align:start position:0%
things if we want to do that
um

04:10:17.750 --> 04:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:17.760 --> 04:10:20.070 align:start position:0%
um
but

04:10:20.070 --> 04:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:23.030 --> 04:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative newman what do you
 
04:10:23.040 --> 04:10:25.590 align:start position:0%
representative newman what do you
so

04:10:25.590 --> 04:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:10:28.950 --> 04:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
on mu yes thank you i'm on muting
 
04:10:31.590 --> 04:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
um could you just repeat which which of
 
04:10:33.510 --> 04:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
those two items
 
04:10:35.269 --> 04:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
it is we're talking about
 
04:10:36.870 --> 04:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
for education that was the
 
04:10:36.880 --> 04:10:38.550 align:start position:0%
for education that was the
pre-engineering

04:10:38.550 --> 04:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
pre-engineering
 
04:10:41.429 --> 04:10:41.439 align:start position:0%
pre-engineering technology
 
04:10:43.750 --> 04:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
and the generator installation at the
 
04:10:45.189 --> 04:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
walker building
 
04:10:47.830 --> 04:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
which is um
 
04:10:51.349 --> 04:10:51.359 align:start position:0%
federally funded in part
 
04:10:51.359 --> 04:10:53.030 align:start position:0%
federally funded in part
so

04:10:53.030 --> 04:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:10:53.040 --> 04:10:54.469 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:10:54.469 --> 04:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:07.189 --> 04:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:12.710 --> 04:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:15.269 --> 04:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
any other comments about those couple
 
04:11:15.279 --> 04:11:16.229 align:start position:0%
any other comments about those couple
items

04:11:16.229 --> 04:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
items
 
04:11:17.910 --> 04:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
right like i said again we're going to
 
04:11:18.750 --> 04:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
have to
 
04:11:18.760 --> 04:11:21.030 align:start position:0%
have to
[Music]

04:11:21.030 --> 04:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:11:23.590 --> 04:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
look at
 
04:11:25.349 --> 04:11:25.359 align:start position:0%
the department again
 
04:11:27.510 --> 04:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
at our next work session
 
04:11:30.309 --> 04:11:30.319 align:start position:0%
on their additional requests
 
04:11:30.319 --> 04:11:32.309 align:start position:0%
on their additional requests
and

04:11:32.309 --> 04:11:32.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:11:34.150 --> 04:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
see where we think we're going to be
 
04:11:36.469 --> 04:11:36.479 align:start position:0%
going because as we
 
04:11:38.309 --> 04:11:38.319 align:start position:0%
add or subtract
 
04:11:38.319 --> 04:11:39.269 align:start position:0%
add or subtract
um

04:11:39.269 --> 04:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:41.990 --> 04:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's not while not quite a zero-sum game
 
04:11:43.910 --> 04:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's getting close to that
 
04:11:46.830 --> 04:11:46.840 align:start position:0%
this time around
 
04:11:50.550 --> 04:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
um it's just a fact of life
 
04:11:50.560 --> 04:11:54.150 align:start position:0%
um it's just a fact of life
um

04:11:54.150 --> 04:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:57.670 --> 04:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
any others that we want to try to
 
04:11:57.680 --> 04:12:02.710 align:start position:0%
any others that we want to try to
um

04:12:02.710 --> 04:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:02.720 --> 04:12:03.910 align:start position:0%
 
do

04:12:03.910 --> 04:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:12:03.920 --> 04:12:07.110 align:start position:0%
do
today

04:12:07.110 --> 04:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:08.309 --> 04:12:08.319 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
04:12:08.319 --> 04:12:09.189 align:start position:0%
mr chair
yes

04:12:09.189 --> 04:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:12:11.830 --> 04:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
the only one that jumps out on me that
 
04:12:13.910 --> 04:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
we could we could do with very little
 
04:12:15.830 --> 04:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
discussion is under the community
 
04:12:17.510 --> 04:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
college system and i know they have
 
04:12:19.670 --> 04:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
additional requests but the current
 
04:12:21.750 --> 04:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
request that has been already approved
 
04:12:23.110 --> 04:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
by the governor
 
04:12:26.389 --> 04:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
for 2 million 550 000
 
04:12:27.830 --> 04:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
for the
 
04:12:31.830 --> 04:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
engineering technology renovation
 
04:12:31.840 --> 04:12:32.630 align:start position:0%
engineering technology renovation
um

04:12:32.630 --> 04:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:12:34.550 --> 04:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
04:12:36.950 --> 04:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
there is no discussion shouldn't be any
 
04:12:39.429 --> 04:12:39.439 align:start position:0%
of this real discussion on that one
 
04:12:41.830 --> 04:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
since that is something that we promised
 
04:12:45.110 --> 04:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
them two years ago
 
04:12:47.670 --> 04:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
but we're still going to need to discuss
 
04:12:50.469 --> 04:12:50.479 align:start position:0%
whether or not we need to give them
 
04:12:52.550 --> 04:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
anything additional for critical
 
04:12:55.910 --> 04:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
maintenance or any of the rest
 
04:12:58.870 --> 04:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
but i think that um
 
04:13:01.189 --> 04:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
from my from my own personal point of
 
04:13:01.199 --> 04:13:02.070 align:start position:0%
from my from my own personal point of
view

04:13:02.070 --> 04:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
view
 
04:13:03.830 --> 04:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
um we should
 
04:13:07.670 --> 04:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
um go ahead and say that the 2.55
 
04:13:07.680 --> 04:13:09.590 align:start position:0%
um go ahead and say that the 2.55
million

04:13:09.590 --> 04:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
million
 
04:13:11.510 --> 04:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
that was there
 
04:13:13.530 --> 04:13:13.540 align:start position:0%
from previous
 
04:13:13.540 --> 04:13:16.110 align:start position:0%
from previous
[Music]

04:13:16.110 --> 04:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:13:20.469 --> 04:13:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:22.550 --> 04:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
so i don't have a problem with that
 
04:13:24.149 --> 04:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
mike edgar
 
04:13:27.349 --> 04:13:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh yeah thanks john um
 
04:13:28.469 --> 04:13:28.479 align:start position:0%
i was
 
04:13:29.990 --> 04:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
going through my papers here and trying
 
04:13:33.189 --> 04:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
to see what i saw last night but uh
 
04:13:35.830 --> 04:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
on the community colleges with the
 
04:13:38.469 --> 04:13:38.479 align:start position:0%
second part of the uh
 
04:13:40.149 --> 04:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
the plot that supposedly had been
 
04:13:41.910 --> 04:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
approved uh are kind of like
 
04:13:43.750 --> 04:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
conceptually approved uh
 
04:13:45.910 --> 04:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
3.3 million
 
04:13:48.229 --> 04:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
that we talked about it before we're
 
04:13:50.790 --> 04:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
also going to include the mcc uh science
 
04:13:50.800 --> 04:13:52.070 align:start position:0%
also going to include the mcc uh science
lab

04:13:52.070 --> 04:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
lab
 
04:13:53.990 --> 04:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
and it's not included this time the
 
04:13:56.389 --> 04:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
governor didn't do it we kind of said
 
04:13:59.189 --> 04:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
before that we were going to approve it
 
04:14:01.429 --> 04:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to bring that one up
 
04:14:01.439 --> 04:14:03.750 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to bring that one up
okay

04:14:03.750 --> 04:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:14:03.760 --> 04:14:04.790 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:14:04.790 --> 04:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:07.990 --> 04:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
i'd have to i have not looked at that
 
04:14:08.000 --> 04:14:11.349 align:start position:0%
i'd have to i have not looked at that
today

04:14:11.349 --> 04:14:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:14.229 --> 04:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
what is the ncc engineering versus what
 
04:14:16.309 --> 04:14:16.319 align:start position:0%
you're talking about
 
04:14:18.550 --> 04:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh this is a science lab it was the
 
04:14:20.630 --> 04:14:20.640 align:start position:0%
second part of what we supposedly were
 
04:14:23.189 --> 04:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
had conceptually approved before
 
04:14:26.550 --> 04:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
um renovation of a science lab it was
 
04:14:28.229 --> 04:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
it's a separate one it was
 
04:14:29.510 --> 04:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
it was like a two-part thing we
 
04:14:31.670 --> 04:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
supposedly said we would fund in the you
 
04:14:33.670 --> 04:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
know next next time and i was trying to
 
04:14:35.269 --> 04:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
find out where it was in here i saw it
 
04:14:38.790 --> 04:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
last night and maybe uh mr shea uh
 
04:14:40.229 --> 04:14:40.239 align:start position:0%
who knows uh
 
04:14:42.790 --> 04:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
where that is or
 
04:14:44.630 --> 04:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
but i wanted to bring that one up anyway
 
04:14:46.309 --> 04:14:46.319 align:start position:0%
i know and also dude like you mentioned
 
04:14:47.429 --> 04:14:47.439 align:start position:0%
you have the
 
04:14:49.750 --> 04:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
like some life and safety stuff that
 
04:14:51.349 --> 04:14:51.359 align:start position:0%
it'd be nice to be able to talk about i
 
04:14:52.550 --> 04:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
don't know if we can with the money we
 
04:14:52.560 --> 04:14:53.590 align:start position:0%
don't know if we can with the money we
got

04:14:53.590 --> 04:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
got
 
04:14:56.950 --> 04:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
well and that's why i didn't bring
 
04:14:56.960 --> 04:14:59.269 align:start position:0%
well and that's why i didn't bring
um

04:14:59.269 --> 04:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:01.030 --> 04:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
this one's going to take a lot more
 
04:15:01.040 --> 04:15:03.510 align:start position:0%
this one's going to take a lot more
discussion

04:15:03.510 --> 04:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:15:05.429 --> 04:15:05.439 align:start position:0%
because everything that they're asking
 
04:15:06.790 --> 04:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
for is in the
 
04:15:09.590 --> 04:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
if i remember correctly in the millions
 
04:15:09.600 --> 04:15:10.870 align:start position:0%
if i remember correctly in the millions
um

04:15:10.870 --> 04:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:13.030 --> 04:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
which is um
 
04:15:15.110 --> 04:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
going to be difficult to do
 
04:15:17.030 --> 04:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
and we having we got to the hard ones
 
04:15:20.149 --> 04:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
like corrections and
 
04:15:23.510 --> 04:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
and the rest and maybe
 
04:15:25.110 --> 04:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
when we get to
 
04:15:30.469 --> 04:15:30.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:32.870 --> 04:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
the emergency funds and what's already
 
04:15:34.389 --> 04:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
what's still there and what they're
 
04:15:35.670 --> 04:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
asking for
 
04:15:38.229 --> 04:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
and the rest to see if we can't
 
04:15:40.790 --> 04:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
find some money that way which we have
 
04:15:42.309 --> 04:15:42.319 align:start position:0%
done in the past
 
04:15:47.030 --> 04:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
um but those are all longer discussions
 
04:15:50.710 --> 04:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
and i don't want to get too far ahead of
 
04:15:53.670 --> 04:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:56.309 --> 04:15:56.319 align:start position:0%
with everything
 
04:15:58.149 --> 04:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
before we actually have the public
 
04:15:58.159 --> 04:15:59.750 align:start position:0%
before we actually have the public
hearing

04:15:59.750 --> 04:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:16:02.870 --> 04:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
because there may be some impact
 
04:16:05.349 --> 04:16:05.359 align:start position:0%
on that mr shea you have your hand
 
04:16:05.359 --> 04:16:07.189 align:start position:0%
on that mr shea you have your hand
raised

04:16:07.189 --> 04:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
raised
 
04:16:08.710 --> 04:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh just to follow up on representative
 
04:16:12.950 --> 04:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
edgar's comment in looking at the 2019
 
04:16:14.950 --> 04:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
capital budget there was a note related
 
04:16:15.830 --> 04:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:16:18.149 --> 04:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
3.3 million dollars for the ncc
 
04:16:20.309 --> 04:16:20.319 align:start position:0%
engineering technology renovation
 
04:16:22.630 --> 04:16:22.640 align:start position:0%
but there wasn't um a note related to
 
04:16:25.750 --> 04:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:28.070 --> 04:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
and that's what the 2.5 million um that
 
04:16:29.910 --> 04:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
you see in the current budget is
 
04:16:31.349 --> 04:16:31.359 align:start position:0%
reflective of
 
04:16:32.950 --> 04:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
that's where the general court said if
 
04:16:34.790 --> 04:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
they can find the money going forward
 
04:16:35.990 --> 04:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
essentially they would give it to them
 
04:16:39.510 --> 04:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
in this upcoming capital budget
 
04:16:41.269 --> 04:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
and that's the challenge finding the
 
04:16:41.279 --> 04:16:42.950 align:start position:0%
and that's the challenge finding the
money

04:16:42.950 --> 04:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:16:50.070 --> 04:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:53.110 --> 04:16:53.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman
 
04:16:56.309 --> 04:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
and the other thing i i just needs to be
 
04:16:58.630 --> 04:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
done another day because
 
04:17:00.950 --> 04:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
um i wasn't really happy with the
 
04:17:02.710 --> 04:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
response to
 
04:17:05.750 --> 04:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
the statewide student information system
 
04:17:08.630 --> 04:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
and data warehouse that was proposed in
 
04:17:13.429 --> 04:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:15.990 --> 04:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
and that all of that
 
04:17:18.630 --> 04:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
as i've said several times now today is
 
04:17:21.189 --> 04:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
going to be our challenge of what do we
 
04:17:23.110 --> 04:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
win all out change
 
04:17:26.630 --> 04:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
or whatever to stay within
 
04:17:30.389 --> 04:17:30.399 align:start position:0%
what we can reasonably bond
 
04:17:32.710 --> 04:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
this biennium
 
04:17:32.720 --> 04:17:36.070 align:start position:0%
this biennium
and

04:17:36.070 --> 04:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:37.510 --> 04:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
it's harder
 
04:17:39.750 --> 04:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
than it looks folks it's harder than it
 
04:17:39.760 --> 04:17:40.790 align:start position:0%
than it looks folks it's harder than it
looks

04:17:40.790 --> 04:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
looks
 
04:17:42.229 --> 04:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
uh karen
 
04:17:44.149 --> 04:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
yeah it's always a puzzle that's for
 
04:17:44.159 --> 04:17:44.950 align:start position:0%
yeah it's always a puzzle that's for
sure

04:17:44.950 --> 04:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:17:47.349 --> 04:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm struggling a little bit
 
04:17:49.670 --> 04:17:49.680 align:start position:0%
because i always uh kind of know what
 
04:17:53.670 --> 04:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
the debt ratio is for what the what the
 
04:17:53.680 --> 04:17:55.030 align:start position:0%
the debt ratio is for what the what the
um

04:17:55.030 --> 04:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:57.429 --> 04:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
treasurer has i've been trying to find
 
04:17:59.990 --> 04:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
it in here like what the debt ratio is
 
04:18:03.349 --> 04:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
for 120 then what it is for what the
 
04:18:07.269 --> 04:18:07.279 align:start position:0%
governor uh is proposing and then
 
04:18:09.269 --> 04:18:09.279 align:start position:0%
not that we would ever dream of going
 
04:18:11.269 --> 04:18:11.279 align:start position:0%
above what the governor has but maybe
 
04:18:14.149 --> 04:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
130 what that would be i mean i think
 
04:18:16.070 --> 04:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
that would be really helpful just to
 
04:18:18.389 --> 04:18:18.399 align:start position:0%
give us some kind of framework
 
04:18:18.399 --> 04:18:19.269 align:start position:0%
give us some kind of framework
um

04:18:19.269 --> 04:18:19.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:22.070 --> 04:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
so that was one thought
 
04:18:24.070 --> 04:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh and then
 
04:18:25.910 --> 04:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if it's possible when
 
04:18:27.830 --> 04:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
she comes in if we could just talk a
 
04:18:31.670 --> 04:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
little bit uh more about that
 
04:18:34.389 --> 04:18:34.399 align:start position:0%
um i'm looking what
 
04:18:36.309 --> 04:18:36.319 align:start position:0%
i'm going to suggest that you send her
 
04:18:37.429 --> 04:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
an email
 
04:18:39.670 --> 04:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
and ask her
 
04:18:41.910 --> 04:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely fine i mean
 
04:18:46.389 --> 04:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
and and at 120 125 130 i'm gonna i'm
 
04:18:47.910 --> 04:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
sure she's going to
 
04:18:52.710 --> 04:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
come back of it's 6.11 or 6.1
 
04:18:55.110 --> 04:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
it's not going to change the debt ratio
 
04:18:55.120 --> 04:18:56.469 align:start position:0%
it's not going to change the debt ratio
appreciably

04:18:56.469 --> 04:18:56.479 align:start position:0%
appreciably
 
04:19:00.389 --> 04:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
but what it is going to change is
 
04:19:02.790 --> 04:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
my ability to sell it
 
04:19:02.800 --> 04:19:04.229 align:start position:0%
my ability to sell it
to

04:19:04.229 --> 04:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:19:06.710 --> 04:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
the house of representatives
 
04:19:06.720 --> 04:19:07.830 align:start position:0%
the house of representatives
um

04:19:07.830 --> 04:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:10.389 --> 04:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
remember we have to get it through
 
04:19:12.950 --> 04:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
not just this committee but the floor of
 
04:19:15.189 --> 04:19:15.199 align:start position:0%
the house and it's going to be
 
04:19:18.149 --> 04:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
an interesting couple of days in
 
04:19:21.670 --> 04:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh april since every committee now is go
 
04:19:23.910 --> 04:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
as the same reporting date for every
 
04:19:23.920 --> 04:19:24.710 align:start position:0%
as the same reporting date for every
bill

04:19:24.710 --> 04:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:19:26.790 --> 04:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
i mean there you got that nifty rule
 
04:19:29.349 --> 04:19:29.359 align:start position:0%
change and everything and here we are
 
04:19:31.750 --> 04:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
um i i just find that you know we've
 
04:19:33.910 --> 04:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
done that in the past i find that a
 
04:19:36.550 --> 04:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
really a good framework so we sort of
 
04:19:38.389 --> 04:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
know what we're about i remember the
 
04:19:38.399 --> 04:19:39.510 align:start position:0%
know what we're about i remember the
last

04:19:39.510 --> 04:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
last
 
04:19:42.389 --> 04:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
two years ago when i asked well what
 
04:19:44.870 --> 04:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
does it do if it goes from
 
04:19:46.790 --> 04:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
i think it was up a couple percentage
 
04:19:48.790 --> 04:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
point right it took it up like 30
 
04:19:50.950 --> 04:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars right which was a
 
04:19:50.960 --> 04:19:52.389 align:start position:0%
million dollars right which was a
non-starter

04:19:52.389 --> 04:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
non-starter
 
04:19:54.710 --> 04:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
um even though it stays within the debt
 
04:19:54.720 --> 04:19:56.149 align:start position:0%
um even though it stays within the debt
affordability

04:19:56.149 --> 04:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
affordability
 
04:19:59.670 --> 04:19:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh ratios um you still have to sell it
 
04:20:02.389 --> 04:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
to the house and the finance because
 
04:20:04.550 --> 04:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
every dollar we take out
 
04:20:04.560 --> 04:20:05.990 align:start position:0%
every dollar we take out
um

04:20:05.990 --> 04:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:09.590 --> 04:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
for debt service is money that uh can't
 
04:20:13.030 --> 04:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
go to other programs as everybody should
 
04:20:15.670 --> 04:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
be aware it's a
 
04:20:18.070 --> 04:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
balancing act between all of those
 
04:20:18.080 --> 04:20:19.110 align:start position:0%
balancing act between all of those
things

04:20:19.110 --> 04:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:20:23.110 --> 04:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
so so then just um along those lines
 
04:20:25.750 --> 04:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
we all there's just a staggering amount
 
04:20:29.510 --> 04:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
of this budget that is going to i.t
 
04:20:29.520 --> 04:20:31.910 align:start position:0%
of this budget that is going to i.t
and

04:20:31.910 --> 04:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:34.149 --> 04:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
i remember last year we did work with
 
04:20:37.269 --> 04:20:37.279 align:start position:0%
doit i think we paired their request a
 
04:20:39.429 --> 04:20:39.439 align:start position:0%
little bit because they were going to be
 
04:20:43.110 --> 04:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
implementing their concept over time
 
04:20:43.120 --> 04:20:44.870 align:start position:0%
implementing their concept over time
and

04:20:44.870 --> 04:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:47.670 --> 04:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it's help i mean maybe
 
04:20:49.510 --> 04:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
we could have asked each individual
 
04:20:51.670 --> 04:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
agency this but i don't know if it's
 
04:20:54.469 --> 04:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
helpful to talk to commissioner goulet
 
04:20:56.630 --> 04:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
again and see if he thinks that there's
 
04:20:56.640 --> 04:20:57.830 align:start position:0%
again and see if he thinks that there's
any

04:20:57.830 --> 04:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:21:00.469 --> 04:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
room to sort of stretch this out a
 
04:21:02.070 --> 04:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
little bit i mean
 
04:21:05.189 --> 04:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
i don't have an it's got to be 25 of our
 
04:21:11.030 --> 04:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
budget or so for these huge i.t requests
 
04:21:13.189 --> 04:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
and i just i mean they're so huge it's
 
04:21:17.349 --> 04:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:18.710 --> 04:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
and if they're do you know what i'm
 
04:21:18.720 --> 04:21:19.830 align:start position:0%
and if they're do you know what i'm
saying

04:21:19.830 --> 04:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
saying
 
04:21:22.469 --> 04:21:22.479 align:start position:0%
i do i'm also willing to call him if
 
04:21:25.429 --> 04:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
that's helpful it would be you know i'm
 
04:21:27.510 --> 04:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
sure he can talk about his own agency
 
04:21:29.910 --> 04:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
which is only six million but just
 
04:21:31.910 --> 04:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
looking at um
 
04:21:36.630 --> 04:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
well hhs for instance hhs but all of the
 
04:21:39.750 --> 04:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
those or almost all of them are
 
04:21:39.760 --> 04:21:41.189 align:start position:0%
those or almost all of them are
50

04:21:41.189 --> 04:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
50
 
04:21:41.199 --> 04:21:42.710 align:start position:0%
50
uh

04:21:42.710 --> 04:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:21:45.189 --> 04:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
us and 50 federal
 
04:21:48.550 --> 04:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
um so if we cut those we cut the federal
 
04:21:50.469 --> 04:21:50.479 align:start position:0%
right delay the pro
 
04:21:52.070 --> 04:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
04:21:54.790 --> 04:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
we can ask them to come back and
 
04:21:57.349 --> 04:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
justify all of them but
 
04:21:58.950 --> 04:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
they were in there and they talked about
 
04:22:01.189 --> 04:22:01.199 align:start position:0%
each of them before we do that i would
 
04:22:03.110 --> 04:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
ask that each member
 
04:22:07.110 --> 04:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
go through the presentation from hhs and
 
04:22:09.110 --> 04:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
see whether or not
 
04:22:10.469 --> 04:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
it makes sense
 
04:22:10.479 --> 04:22:11.590 align:start position:0%
it makes sense
and

04:22:11.590 --> 04:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:22:13.110 --> 04:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
yeah just so
 
04:22:15.830 --> 04:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
i think hhs is a tough case because
 
04:22:17.990 --> 04:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
they're such a huge portion of what
 
04:22:20.309 --> 04:22:20.319 align:start position:0%
they're doing is federally funded anyway
 
04:22:23.670 --> 04:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
but since since doit has in beds and all
 
04:22:25.750 --> 04:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
the different agencies
 
04:22:28.710 --> 04:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
um you know maybe he would have some
 
04:22:30.790 --> 04:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
some thought on that i
 
04:22:32.950 --> 04:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
we just have so little wiggle room this
 
04:22:34.790 --> 04:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
year that
 
04:22:37.030 --> 04:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
i thought that might be a source it
 
04:22:38.149 --> 04:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
might be
 
04:22:38.159 --> 04:22:39.349 align:start position:0%
might be
um

04:22:39.349 --> 04:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:42.389 --> 04:22:42.399 align:start position:0%
we can ask him to come back
 
04:22:42.399 --> 04:22:43.670 align:start position:0%
we can ask him to come back
um

04:22:43.670 --> 04:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:45.830 --> 04:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
or i can just give him a call if he says
 
04:22:47.670 --> 04:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
if you would if
 
04:22:49.990 --> 04:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
if he's comfortable with
 
04:22:52.229 --> 04:22:52.239 align:start position:0%
um coming back on the afternoon of the
 
04:22:54.950 --> 04:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
16th he's more than welcome to talk a
 
04:22:56.389 --> 04:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
little bit about
 
04:23:00.070 --> 04:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
the overall i.t picture i mean i just
 
04:23:01.750 --> 04:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
think for the committee that might be
 
04:23:01.760 --> 04:23:02.870 align:start position:0%
think for the committee that might be
helpful

04:23:02.870 --> 04:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
04:23:04.790 --> 04:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
i i think so too
 
04:23:04.800 --> 04:23:05.990 align:start position:0%
i i think so too
um

04:23:05.990 --> 04:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:07.269 --> 04:23:07.279 align:start position:0%
it's no
 
04:23:08.950 --> 04:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
secret to those who've been on the
 
04:23:11.189 --> 04:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
committee for a while i've always had
 
04:23:12.790 --> 04:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
problems with
 
04:23:14.950 --> 04:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh the amount and it seems to be
 
04:23:17.269 --> 04:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
increasing every biennium
 
04:23:21.030 --> 04:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
on what we're buying for software
 
04:23:24.630 --> 04:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:31.670 --> 04:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:33.750 --> 04:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
marty jack yeah the other thing about
 
04:23:36.149 --> 04:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
hhs we need to keep in mind is
 
04:23:37.349 --> 04:23:37.359 align:start position:0%
they were
 
04:23:38.630 --> 04:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
04:23:39.990 --> 04:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
they have a lot of compliance
 
04:23:41.429 --> 04:23:41.439 align:start position:0%
requirements and they were saying we're
 
04:23:42.950 --> 04:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
getting fined because we haven't done
 
04:23:45.189 --> 04:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
this so the longer we delay it
 
04:23:47.429 --> 04:23:47.439 align:start position:0%
the more we get fined
 
04:23:49.510 --> 04:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
yeah and you know there could be there
 
04:23:51.750 --> 04:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
could be issues of losing funding and
 
04:23:53.349 --> 04:23:53.359 align:start position:0%
that type of thing so
 
04:23:55.189 --> 04:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
we need we need to really keep that in
 
04:23:55.199 --> 04:23:56.469 align:start position:0%
we need we need to really keep that in
mind

04:23:56.469 --> 04:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
mind
 
04:23:57.429 --> 04:23:57.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:23:57.439 --> 04:23:58.309 align:start position:0%
thank you
uh

04:23:58.309 --> 04:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:23:58.319 --> 04:24:00.469 align:start position:0%
uh
barry

04:24:00.469 --> 04:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
barry
 
04:24:02.870 --> 04:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i i just want to add that
 
04:24:04.710 --> 04:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
i went through i flagged about 11
 
04:24:06.790 --> 04:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
million dollars worth of yt stuff
 
04:24:08.630 --> 04:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
i wanted to talk about and all of that's
 
04:24:11.590 --> 04:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
outside of hhs recognizing that
 
04:24:15.750 --> 04:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:19.349 --> 04:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:21.670 --> 04:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
but if we drop it then the projects
 
04:24:23.590 --> 04:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
aren't going to get done
 
04:24:26.710 --> 04:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
and that that's the fact of life those
 
04:24:29.750 --> 04:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
projects are not at this point in time
 
04:24:31.269 --> 04:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
are not going to get put into the
 
04:24:33.030 --> 04:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
operating budget
 
04:24:33.040 --> 04:24:34.229 align:start position:0%
operating budget
um

04:24:34.229 --> 04:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:37.590 --> 04:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:37.600 --> 04:24:38.469 align:start position:0%
 
work

04:24:38.469 --> 04:24:38.479 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:24:40.389 --> 04:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
a little
 
04:24:42.070 --> 04:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
with with less money than even the
 
04:24:43.910 --> 04:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
governor thought he had
 
04:24:45.830 --> 04:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
although he's never mind i'm not gonna
 
04:24:49.429 --> 04:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
get into that whole thing but um
 
04:24:52.870 --> 04:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
we shall we shall see mr shay
 
04:24:54.469 --> 04:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
yeah i just wanted to remind the uh
 
04:24:56.469 --> 04:24:56.479 align:start position:0%
committee that if you look at the doit
 
04:24:56.479 --> 04:24:57.830 align:start position:0%
committee that if you look at the doit
presentation

04:24:57.830 --> 04:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
04:25:00.070 --> 04:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
on page seven of their documents yeah
 
04:25:03.510 --> 04:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
they list all the um i.t projects
 
04:25:06.630 --> 04:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
contained in house 25. it's about 40
 
04:25:09.110 --> 04:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
million if i remember right uh 35
 
04:25:11.910 --> 04:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
general funds 107 million when you
 
04:25:14.469 --> 04:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
include the other funds yeah they also
 
04:25:17.590 --> 04:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
provide in there the agency priority
 
04:25:19.910 --> 04:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
when it was requested um you know which
 
04:25:22.149 --> 04:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
agency the project title and then the
 
04:25:23.750 --> 04:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
requested amount and the breakout by
 
04:25:25.189 --> 04:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
fund sources
 
04:25:25.199 --> 04:25:26.229 align:start position:0%
fund sources
so

04:25:26.229 --> 04:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:25:28.389 --> 04:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
they put that in there just to
 
04:25:29.750 --> 04:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
make the committee aware that they have
 
04:25:33.110 --> 04:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
been involved with the various projects
 
04:25:34.870 --> 04:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
but again just page seven of their
 
04:25:37.990 --> 04:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
documentation may help you yeah
 
04:25:41.429 --> 04:25:41.439 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and i think that
 
04:25:43.510 --> 04:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
at our next work session if everybody
 
04:25:45.349 --> 04:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
could look at that because
 
04:25:47.750 --> 04:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
this is gonna be a continuing
 
04:25:50.550 --> 04:25:50.560 align:start position:0%
question john cloutier yes thank you mr
 
04:25:53.510 --> 04:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
chairman um i just was looking over the
 
04:25:56.389 --> 04:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
2019 capital budget and
 
04:25:59.269 --> 04:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
looking at it we actually cut 2 million
 
04:26:01.110 --> 04:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
from the department of informational
 
04:26:03.110 --> 04:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
technology a two million dollar cut that
 
04:26:05.510 --> 04:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
the senate went along with so we have
 
04:26:07.429 --> 04:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
debated this issue before and i struggle
 
04:26:08.710 --> 04:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
with this too
 
04:26:10.870 --> 04:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
but i think we may be ought to look at
 
04:26:12.469 --> 04:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
it and but there is a precedent because
 
04:26:16.389 --> 04:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
we did it two years ago cut their budget
 
04:26:19.429 --> 04:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
if i remember correctly on that one uh
 
04:26:21.349 --> 04:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
karen ebel was the one who carried the
 
04:26:23.910 --> 04:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
water with oit
 
04:26:26.630 --> 04:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
to spread it out over
 
04:26:28.870 --> 04:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh more than one biennium and now we're
 
04:26:32.149 --> 04:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
into the this year yep that's that's
 
04:26:35.030 --> 04:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
exactly right and that's why i i raised
 
04:26:38.309 --> 04:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
it um as i said i think hhs and
 
04:26:40.950 --> 04:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
compliance related issues that's that's
 
04:26:42.630 --> 04:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
different but
 
04:26:45.830 --> 04:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
anyway he i he the commissioner is
 
04:26:48.149 --> 04:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
incredibly helpful and knowledgeable
 
04:26:49.990 --> 04:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
about these things so
 
04:26:51.590 --> 04:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
i think he could answer just about
 
04:26:51.600 --> 04:26:53.030 align:start position:0%
i think he could answer just about
anything

04:26:53.030 --> 04:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
anything
 
04:26:53.990 --> 04:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:26:54.000 --> 04:26:57.269 align:start position:0%
thank you
yeah

04:26:57.269 --> 04:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:00.149 --> 04:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:05.110 --> 04:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:11.750 --> 04:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:13.750 --> 04:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
i just want to go over one last thing
 
04:27:17.590 --> 04:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
and then i i with your permission i will
 
04:27:19.830 --> 04:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
read out to everybody what we've all
 
04:27:22.070 --> 04:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
agreed on that we've already agreed on
 
04:27:24.149 --> 04:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
okay that's the only thing i didn't get
 
04:27:26.550 --> 04:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
a definitive answer on
 
04:27:28.149 --> 04:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
is the community college i know we're
 
04:27:29.349 --> 04:27:29.359 align:start position:0%

um

04:31:17.189 --> 04:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:31:18.950 --> 04:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
do we want to take a stab at
 
04:31:24.710 --> 04:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:26.550 --> 04:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
is everybody ready to do that or would
 
04:31:29.510 --> 04:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
you rather have some time to go back and
 
04:31:29.520 --> 04:31:32.389 align:start position:0%
you rather have some time to go back and
look

04:31:32.389 --> 04:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:34.309 --> 04:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
mr chair if i can weigh in i think
 
04:31:36.229 --> 04:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
environmental services is something that
 
04:31:41.830 --> 04:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:43.429 --> 04:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
has always treated as
 
04:31:45.590 --> 04:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
as something that we just about have to
 
04:31:47.830 --> 04:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
do unless we've got some good recourse
 
04:31:49.830 --> 04:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
as to not doing it
 
04:31:52.309 --> 04:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
and i think they uh of all the
 
04:31:54.309 --> 04:31:54.319 align:start position:0%
departments come through pretty much
 
04:31:56.309 --> 04:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
with a this is something that we can't
 
04:31:58.469 --> 04:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
delay anymore this is something that we
 
04:32:00.790 --> 04:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
have to get done or this is one of those
 
04:32:02.149 --> 04:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
projects that we're going to start
 
04:32:05.269 --> 04:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
facing fines on so i'm just weighing and
 
04:32:06.870 --> 04:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
i have no problem
 
04:32:10.790 --> 04:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
with the uh 27 million 113
 
04:32:10.800 --> 04:32:11.910 align:start position:0%
with the uh 27 million 113
500

04:32:11.910 --> 04:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
500
 
04:32:13.110 --> 04:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
that we are
 
04:32:15.110 --> 04:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
obligated to come up with under general
 
04:32:15.120 --> 04:32:16.389 align:start position:0%
obligated to come up with under general
funds

04:32:16.389 --> 04:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
funds
 
04:32:18.830 --> 04:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
and the total for the
 
04:32:21.990 --> 04:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh entire agency subtotal
 
04:32:30.950 --> 04:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:35.269 --> 04:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:37.429 --> 04:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to look through here real
 
04:32:40.550 --> 04:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
quick as i'm listening to
 
04:32:40.560 --> 04:32:41.750 align:start position:0%

for that
 
04:32:57.510 --> 04:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
um i'm in agreement with representative
 
04:33:00.510 --> 04:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
mills the only the only one that i might
 
04:33:03.110 --> 04:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
possibly have a follow-up question is
 
04:33:05.990 --> 04:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
the one-stop it system upgrade
 
04:33:08.949 --> 04:33:08.959 align:start position:0%
which is five what's that five million
 
04:33:11.590 --> 04:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
but other than that i and i and i'm not
 
04:33:14.470 --> 04:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not overly not in favor of that i
 
04:33:16.949 --> 04:33:16.959 align:start position:0%
just i thought there was some questions
 
04:33:19.029 --> 04:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
asked about that
 
04:33:22.150 --> 04:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
but in general i'm in favor

04:33:51.910 --> 04:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:53.670 --> 04:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
but to have a model like that would be
 
04:33:55.269 --> 04:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
helpful for the state and a lot of
 
04:33:59.269 --> 04:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
agencies and um and that is for
 
04:34:02.150 --> 04:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh they say in a range of 350 000 i
 
04:34:04.310 --> 04:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
think you'll find a lot of
 
04:34:06.070 --> 04:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
support for that
 
04:34:09.109 --> 04:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:10.949 --> 04:34:10.959 align:start position:0%
uh karen
 
04:34:14.150 --> 04:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
yeah uh actually the same is what what
 
04:34:18.230 --> 04:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
mark said um i'm i'm fine with the rest
 
04:34:19.990 --> 04:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
of it but if we were going to talk
 
04:34:21.830 --> 04:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
anymore to um
 
04:34:24.070 --> 04:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner goulet it might be
 
04:34:26.150 --> 04:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
interesting to check in with him just
 
04:34:29.830 --> 04:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
generally about the one-stop system um
 
04:34:29.840 --> 04:34:30.629 align:start position:0%
generally about the one-stop system um
so

04:34:30.629 --> 04:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:34:30.639 --> 04:34:31.990 align:start position:0%
so
yeah

04:34:31.990 --> 04:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:34:32.000 --> 04:34:33.189 align:start position:0%
yeah
okay

04:34:33.189 --> 04:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:34:35.349 --> 04:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh barry
 
04:34:36.789 --> 04:34:36.799 align:start position:0%
you know i agree with what mark and
 
04:34:38.230 --> 04:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
karen said that was i had the same
 
04:34:38.240 --> 04:34:39.429 align:start position:0%
karen said that was i had the same
questions

04:34:39.429 --> 04:34:39.439 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:34:39.439 --> 04:34:40.551 align:start position:0%
questions
okay

04:34:40.551 --> 04:34:40.561 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:34:45.910 --> 04:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:49.109 --> 04:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
yes thank you mr chairman
 
04:34:51.830 --> 04:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to echo it but the same
 
04:34:55.029 --> 04:34:55.039 align:start position:0%
thing that theory is karen and mark said
 
04:35:02.789 --> 04:35:02.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:04.629 --> 04:35:04.639 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
04:35:07.189 --> 04:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
what i'm hearing
 
04:35:09.750 --> 04:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
with no objections so far
 
04:35:12.709 --> 04:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
is that what they have asked for
 
04:35:12.719 --> 04:35:13.429 align:start position:0%
is that what they have asked for
in

04:35:13.429 --> 04:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:35:15.590 --> 04:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
house bill 25
 
04:35:17.349 --> 04:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
we're okay with
 
04:35:19.990 --> 04:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
but if we can find money
 
04:35:23.029 --> 04:35:23.039 align:start position:0%
uh mike edgar would like to at least add
 
04:35:25.670 --> 04:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
one project to them
 
04:35:29.429 --> 04:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:31.269 --> 04:35:31.279 align:start position:0%
well i think we ought to consider taking
 
04:35:33.750 --> 04:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
that extra money for the
 
04:35:35.990 --> 04:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
project mike mentioned out of the one
 
04:35:37.349 --> 04:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
stop i thought that were a little bit
 
04:35:39.029 --> 04:35:39.039 align:start position:0%
loosey-goosey about
 
04:35:40.709 --> 04:35:40.719 align:start position:0%
what they needed for one stop and that
 
04:35:42.310 --> 04:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
seemed a little more flexible than some
 
04:35:44.150 --> 04:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
of the other
 
04:35:44.160 --> 04:35:45.510 align:start position:0%
of the other
um

04:35:45.510 --> 04:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:50.629 --> 04:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:53.189 --> 04:35:53.199 align:start position:0%
get an answer too and i'm not sure
 
04:35:55.349 --> 04:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
because i'm looking through my notes and
 
04:35:56.869 --> 04:35:56.879 align:start position:0%
the rest and
 
04:35:56.879 --> 04:35:58.789 align:start position:0%
the rest and
it

04:35:58.789 --> 04:35:58.799 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:36:02.310 --> 04:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't say a lot about uh
 
04:36:04.949 --> 04:36:04.959 align:start position:0%
and i haven't gone back and re-read the
 
04:36:07.269 --> 04:36:07.279 align:start position:0%
project summaries and the rest
 
04:36:09.349 --> 04:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
but if we were to do that i don't know
 
04:36:11.670 --> 04:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
what it would do to the overall
 
04:36:15.910 --> 04:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
um one-stop uh upgrade if we took you
 
04:36:19.189 --> 04:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
know 300 whatever thousand out of that
 
04:36:21.910 --> 04:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
well mr chair i think this was the one
 
04:36:24.709 --> 04:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
where the governor actually um
 
04:36:26.869 --> 04:36:26.879 align:start position:0%
appropriated less than what they had
 
04:36:29.910 --> 04:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
requested for for the clean water and
 
04:36:33.269 --> 04:36:33.279 align:start position:0%
dam repair projects
 
04:36:36.869 --> 04:36:36.879 align:start position:0%
um that's true it was but um i don't
 
04:36:39.670 --> 04:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
remember what they said about that but
 
04:36:42.470 --> 04:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
they could it's it's a match
 
04:36:45.109 --> 04:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
it's it's to match um if you give them
 
04:36:47.750 --> 04:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
more they can match more um
 
04:36:51.510 --> 04:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
but at some point it's um
 
04:36:54.551 --> 04:36:54.561 align:start position:0%
i don't want to um
 
04:36:57.349 --> 04:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
on the federal matches
 
04:36:57.359 --> 04:36:58.789 align:start position:0%
on the federal matches
um

04:36:58.789 --> 04:36:58.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:01.269 --> 04:37:01.279 align:start position:0%
if there's
 
04:37:03.910 --> 04:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
i think he just did a a quick
 
04:37:06.150 --> 04:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
you know gave it even numbers rather
 
04:37:13.269 --> 04:37:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:13.279 --> 04:37:15.029 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:37:15.029 --> 04:37:15.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:37:16.310 --> 04:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
so we're in
 
04:37:19.590 --> 04:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
i okay um then let's not have put a pin
 
04:37:22.230 --> 04:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
in any of these at this point
 
04:37:24.551 --> 04:37:24.561 align:start position:0%
um on des
 
04:37:28.150 --> 04:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
um mark you had something
 
04:37:30.390 --> 04:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
um i was i was just gonna say that you
 
04:37:32.869 --> 04:37:32.879 align:start position:0%
know i i'd move that we would uh just
 
04:37:34.869 --> 04:37:34.879 align:start position:0%
remove the five million
 
04:37:36.949 --> 04:37:36.959 align:start position:0%
uh for further discussion and you know
 
04:37:39.189 --> 04:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
and approve uh 22
 
04:37:42.949 --> 04:37:42.959 align:start position:0%
113 500 agree on those
 
04:37:45.189 --> 04:37:45.199 align:start position:0%
and then we'll look uh when we have that
 
04:37:47.189 --> 04:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
discussion and we look to add on
 
04:37:49.750 --> 04:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
projects if there's money uh
 
04:37:52.150 --> 04:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
then we'll we'll bring up uh michael's
 
04:37:54.789 --> 04:37:54.799 align:start position:0%
project and talk about it then
 
04:37:56.310 --> 04:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
if that if that would be helpful if you
 
04:37:58.150 --> 04:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
want to leave the whole thing open for
 
04:37:58.160 --> 04:37:59.269 align:start position:0%
want to leave the whole thing open for
discussion

04:37:59.269 --> 04:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:38:01.429 --> 04:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
i can go but
 
04:38:03.670 --> 04:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
you know we can agree on on those light
 
04:38:05.910 --> 04:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
items on page two
 
04:38:08.230 --> 04:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
of the compare sheet
 
04:38:08.240 --> 04:38:09.670 align:start position:0%
of the compare sheet
um

04:38:09.670 --> 04:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:11.990 --> 04:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
it is line 49
 
04:38:12.000 --> 04:38:13.189 align:start position:0%
it is line 49
50

04:38:13.189 --> 04:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
50
 
04:38:13.199 --> 04:38:14.709 align:start position:0%
50
51

04:38:14.709 --> 04:38:14.719 align:start position:0%
51
 
04:38:16.949 --> 04:38:16.959 align:start position:0%
and 53
 
04:38:18.949 --> 04:38:18.959 align:start position:0%
that we would agree to
 
04:38:22.551 --> 04:38:22.561 align:start position:0%
um and then we have a further discussion
 
04:38:27.670 --> 04:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
on line 52 which is the system upgrade
 
04:38:30.390 --> 04:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
and then talk about that but that would
 
04:38:32.949 --> 04:38:32.959 align:start position:0%
solve some of our problems of
 
04:38:35.910 --> 04:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
um trying to get some things done in
 
04:38:38.310 --> 04:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
future work sessions
 
04:38:42.390 --> 04:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:49.910 --> 04:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:52.789 --> 04:38:52.799 align:start position:0%
mr chair could could somebody remind us
 
04:38:58.709 --> 04:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:01.189 --> 04:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that mike anger has it in front
 
04:39:02.470 --> 04:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
of them
 
04:39:08.070 --> 04:39:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:09.990 --> 04:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
well i have it too i have my books in
 
04:39:12.070 --> 04:39:12.080 align:start position:0%
front of me uh well i have a lot of
 
04:39:15.109 --> 04:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:16.789 --> 04:39:16.799 align:start position:0%
but um
 
04:39:18.869 --> 04:39:18.879 align:start position:0%
so we would have to find the money for
 
04:39:18.879 --> 04:39:20.150 align:start position:0%
so we would have to find the money for
that

04:39:20.150 --> 04:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:39:22.470 --> 04:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
but i don't want to arbitrarily take it
 
04:39:24.310 --> 04:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
out of that 5 million
 
04:39:25.830 --> 04:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
line item
 
04:39:27.750 --> 04:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
without knowing what that would do to
 
04:39:32.150 --> 04:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:35.750 --> 04:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
so we shall see
 
04:39:35.760 --> 04:39:37.830 align:start position:0%
so we shall see
any

04:39:37.830 --> 04:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:39:40.230 --> 04:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
thing else that i i'm not sure that we
 
04:39:40.240 --> 04:39:41.830 align:start position:0%
thing else that i i'm not sure that we
can

04:39:41.830 --> 04:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:39:41.840 --> 04:39:44.470 align:start position:0%
can
um

04:39:44.470 --> 04:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:46.628 --> 04:39:46.638 align:start position:0%
go through because i really do want to
 
04:39:49.590 --> 04:39:49.600 align:start position:0%

04:39:53.120 --> 04:39:54.470 align:start position:0%
have everybody go back through
especially

04:39:54.470 --> 04:39:54.480 align:start position:0%

admin services corrections
hhs

04:40:01.110 --> 04:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:03.350 --> 04:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
to to see
 
04:40:03.360 --> 04:40:05.430 align:start position:0%
to to see
what

04:40:05.430 --> 04:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:40:07.910 --> 04:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
you think about that
 
04:40:07.920 --> 04:40:10.310 align:start position:0%
you think about that
um

04:40:10.310 --> 04:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:10.320 --> 04:40:11.750 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:40:11.750 --> 04:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:40:14.830 --> 04:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
we shall go from there
 
04:40:17.190 --> 04:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
um natural
 
04:40:21.670 --> 04:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:23.270 --> 04:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
i don't remember if they asked for
 
04:40:25.910 --> 04:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
anything else or not
 
04:40:28.470 --> 04:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
they had quite a few additional projects
 
04:40:31.350 --> 04:40:31.360 align:start position:0%
then let's just hold off on them so that
 
04:40:33.750 --> 04:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
we can discuss all of that
 
04:40:33.760 --> 04:40:34.948 align:start position:0%
we can discuss all of that
um

04:40:34.948 --> 04:40:34.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:38.230 --> 04:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:40.708 --> 04:40:40.718 align:start position:0%
i think we got a lot done i mean
 
04:40:42.788 --> 04:40:42.798 align:start position:0%
none of these decisions are final as
 
04:40:45.190 --> 04:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
i've said several times
 
04:40:47.030 --> 04:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
nothing is final till we have the exact
 
04:40:49.670 --> 04:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
session but having these
 
04:40:49.680 --> 04:40:50.948 align:start position:0%
session but having these
discussions

04:40:50.948 --> 04:40:50.958 align:start position:0%
discussions
 
04:40:53.110 --> 04:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
and seeing where the committee is and
 
04:40:56.150 --> 04:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
working towards a consensus
 
04:40:58.948 --> 04:40:58.958 align:start position:0%
makes it easier as we go forward
 
04:41:02.868 --> 04:41:02.878 align:start position:0%

discussion
 
04:42:28.400 --> 04:42:29.430 align:start position:0%
discussion
um

04:42:29.430 --> 04:42:29.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:32.310 --> 04:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
separate as as an entity
 
04:42:32.320 --> 04:42:33.430 align:start position:0%
separate as as an entity
um

04:42:33.430 --> 04:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:36.708 --> 04:42:36.718 align:start position:0%
so that we can get it all done at once
 
04:42:38.470 --> 04:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
okay were you thinking of having them
 
04:42:40.310 --> 04:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
come back on wednesday you know for the
 
04:42:42.310 --> 04:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
work i think they gave us everything
 
04:42:44.230 --> 04:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
that they wanted to do
 
04:42:44.240 --> 04:42:45.270 align:start position:0%
that they wanted to do
okay

04:42:45.270 --> 04:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:42:48.310 --> 04:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
unless you want to hear from them again
 
04:42:49.830 --> 04:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
at this point okay i think hopefully
 
04:42:51.590 --> 04:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
we'll have enough information but as of
 
04:42:53.510 --> 04:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
now i i just maybe we should sift it
 
04:42:55.110 --> 04:42:55.120 align:start position:0%
through but it's they're not asking for
 
04:42:57.030 --> 04:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
very much in general funds it's mainly
 
04:42:59.670 --> 04:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
federal funds yeah but some changes
 
04:43:02.150 --> 04:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
around it okay all right i wasn't sure
 
04:43:02.160 --> 04:43:03.430 align:start position:0%
around it okay all right i wasn't sure
mark

uh page two under correct uh corrections
 
04:43:11.990 --> 04:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh line 38
 
04:43:13.910 --> 04:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
we had interest in
 
04:43:16.470 --> 04:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
talking about that uh rebuild the sewer
 
04:43:19.110 --> 04:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
line and grinder pump which i think was
 
04:43:21.030 --> 04:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
for an off-site building across the
 
04:43:21.040 --> 04:43:22.150 align:start position:0%
for an off-site building across the
street

04:43:22.150 --> 04:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
street
 
04:43:22.160 --> 04:43:23.270 align:start position:0%
street
and

04:43:23.270 --> 04:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:43:24.868 --> 04:43:24.878 align:start position:0%
whether they were going to build a new
 
04:43:24.878 --> 04:43:25.990 align:start position:0%
whether they were going to build a new
system

04:43:25.990 --> 04:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:43:28.628 --> 04:43:28.638 align:start position:0%
or whether to pump it into the uh
 
04:43:30.628 --> 04:43:30.638 align:start position:0%
and i believe into the
 
04:43:32.390 --> 04:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
town uh sewer
 
04:43:34.788 --> 04:43:34.798 align:start position:0%
or city server i i think we asked them
 
04:43:36.550 --> 04:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
for more information to follow up on
 
04:43:36.560 --> 04:43:37.590 align:start position:0%
for more information to follow up on
that

04:43:37.590 --> 04:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:43:39.350 --> 04:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if anybody's received
 
04:43:39.360 --> 04:43:40.470 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if anybody's received
that

04:43:40.470 --> 04:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:43:41.670 --> 04:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
i have not
 
04:43:41.680 --> 04:43:42.708 align:start position:0%
i have not
um

04:43:42.708 --> 04:43:42.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:43:44.708 --> 04:43:44.718 align:start position:0%
so mr shea if you could ask corrections
 
04:43:47.110 --> 04:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
to come back as well
 
04:43:48.788 --> 04:43:48.798 align:start position:0%
yep i'll do that
 
04:43:48.798 --> 04:43:49.910 align:start position:0%
yep i'll do that
okay

04:43:49.910 --> 04:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:43:49.920 --> 04:43:51.990 align:start position:0%

04:43:54.150 --> 04:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
your hands still up john include you no
 
04:43:57.270 --> 04:43:57.280 align:start position:0%

04:44:01.910 --> 04:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:04.390 --> 04:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
yes yes thank you mr chairman the only
 
04:44:07.270 --> 04:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
thing i wanted to
 
04:44:10.470 --> 04:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
ask is that i still have some questions
 
04:44:11.830 --> 04:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
about the
 
04:44:15.110 --> 04:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
natural cultural resources on the
 
04:44:17.590 --> 04:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
mult canon
 
04:44:17.600 --> 04:44:19.670 align:start position:0%
mult canon
proposal

04:44:19.670 --> 04:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
04:44:19.680 --> 04:44:22.310 align:start position:0%
proposal
um

04:44:22.310 --> 04:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:29.270 --> 04:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:31.270 --> 04:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
that is not
 
04:44:33.430 --> 04:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
within the capital budget
 
04:44:35.830 --> 04:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
and i don't see us being able to fund
 
04:44:38.230 --> 04:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
that this time but we can ask them to
 
04:44:40.788 --> 04:44:40.798 align:start position:0%
come back and explain it in more detail
 
04:44:42.628 --> 04:44:42.638 align:start position:0%
if you want
 
04:44:44.310 --> 04:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
no that's fine
 
04:44:44.320 --> 04:44:45.830 align:start position:0%
no that's fine
good

04:44:45.830 --> 04:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:44:47.830 --> 04:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
bye kendra
 
04:44:50.390 --> 04:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh thanks john um
 
04:44:52.948 --> 04:44:52.958 align:start position:0%
yeah as far as the corrections go i i
 
04:44:55.590 --> 04:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
believe that the rebuild sewer line and
 
04:44:57.350 --> 04:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
grinder is the infamous one we've been
 
04:44:59.430 --> 04:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
looking at for a bunch of years
 
04:45:01.350 --> 04:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
and it the the one that was referenced
 
04:45:03.590 --> 04:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
was an additional one that they wanted
 
04:45:05.430 --> 04:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
us to consider which was
 
04:45:07.430 --> 04:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
new septic system
 
04:45:09.750 --> 04:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
whether to put a septic system in or to
 
04:45:11.830 --> 04:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
a line out to the road i just want to
 
04:45:14.150 --> 04:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
mention that that's that's right
 
04:45:16.470 --> 04:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
at night
 
04:45:18.230 --> 04:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
that's right and i i think that there's
 
04:45:20.310 --> 04:45:20.320 align:start position:0%
enough confusion at least in my own mind
 
04:45:22.948 --> 04:45:22.958 align:start position:0%
about what we're talking about there
 
04:45:25.270 --> 04:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
that it might not be bad to spend five
 
04:45:28.310 --> 04:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
or ten minutes with them to get it done
 
04:45:28.320 --> 04:45:30.550 align:start position:0%
or ten minutes with them to get it done
karen

04:45:30.550 --> 04:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
karen
 
04:45:33.350 --> 04:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um i guess i just wanted to
 
04:45:35.270 --> 04:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
kind of clarify what i'm doing and what
 
04:45:38.150 --> 04:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
mr shea is doing so if mr shay uh is
 
04:45:40.230 --> 04:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
going to communicate with the treasurer
 
04:45:43.990 --> 04:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
then he could ask her to do the 120 125
 
04:45:46.470 --> 04:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
and 130 that okay
 
04:45:50.628 --> 04:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
so is that okay and then as far as doit
 
04:45:53.270 --> 04:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
um i just wanted to clarify
 
04:45:56.550 --> 04:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
i i actually i personally don't have a
 
04:45:59.510 --> 04:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
question on or a problem what they're
 
04:46:02.230 --> 04:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
requesting i mean this the so that's on
 
04:46:03.670 --> 04:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
page three
 
04:46:07.430 --> 04:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
um there's cyber security on line 85 is
 
04:46:09.910 --> 04:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
the other piece that they
 
04:46:13.510 --> 04:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
sort of gave back to us last year um
 
04:46:15.350 --> 04:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
and i don't have a problem with their
 
04:46:17.030 --> 04:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
budget so if
 
04:46:20.230 --> 04:46:20.240 align:start position:0%
chris if you're gonna ask uh
 
04:46:22.230 --> 04:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner goulet to come in it's not
 
04:46:24.390 --> 04:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
so much to defend his budget it's just
 
04:46:28.390 --> 04:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
to talk to us globally about all these
 
04:46:31.350 --> 04:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
issues and and get his thoughts and he
 
04:46:33.750 --> 04:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
can we can about one stop but then we'll
 
04:46:35.830 --> 04:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
also have des there so we can ask them a
 
04:46:37.430 --> 04:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
little bit more i mean does that make
 
04:46:37.440 --> 04:46:38.708 align:start position:0%
little bit more i mean does that make
sense

04:46:38.708 --> 04:46:38.718 align:start position:0%
sense
 
04:46:41.510 --> 04:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
so so my understanding for inviting doi
 
04:46:43.350 --> 04:46:43.360 align:start position:0%
is that there was a number of computer
 
04:46:43.360 --> 04:46:44.310 align:start position:0%
is that there was a number of computer
projects

04:46:44.310 --> 04:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
projects
 
04:46:46.150 --> 04:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
throughout the capital budget and there
 
04:46:47.430 --> 04:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
was a number of questions about
 
04:46:49.750 --> 04:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
scalability for some of those projects
 
04:46:51.430 --> 04:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
right so i assume that's why we would
 
04:46:52.550 --> 04:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
bring them back
 
04:46:52.560 --> 04:46:54.070 align:start position:0%
bring them back
to

04:46:54.070 --> 04:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:46:55.910 --> 04:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
individual questions
 
04:46:57.910 --> 04:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
but if you want to do it that that's
 
04:46:59.750 --> 04:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
that would be good no i can invite them
 
04:47:00.948 --> 04:47:00.958 align:start position:0%
in and let them know that's what we want
 
04:47:03.430 --> 04:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
to do one thing with the department of
 
04:47:05.430 --> 04:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
information technology they did have one
 
04:47:08.310 --> 04:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
ask related to their capital budget but
 
04:47:10.230 --> 04:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
it was a footnote the same type of
 
04:47:11.830 --> 04:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
footnote you saw
 
04:47:14.150 --> 04:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
in the 2019 budget and it just allows
 
04:47:16.070 --> 04:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
them to
 
04:47:18.550 --> 04:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
take their three capital appropriations
 
04:47:21.270 --> 04:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
money around between the three
 
04:47:21.280 --> 04:47:22.150 align:start position:0%
money around between the three
to

04:47:22.150 --> 04:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:47:24.230 --> 04:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
accommodate when they have issues that
 
04:47:26.788 --> 04:47:26.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:28.830 --> 04:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
but not an increase in any of the values
 
04:47:32.470 --> 04:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
that they were requesting
 
04:47:34.708 --> 04:47:34.718 align:start position:0%
but yeah he did ask to have that in
 
04:47:35.910 --> 04:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
there again
 
04:47:38.470 --> 04:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
and i don't think we have any problems
 
04:47:40.708 --> 04:47:40.718 align:start position:0%
with allowing them to move
 
04:47:40.718 --> 04:47:41.750 align:start position:0%
with allowing them to move
um

04:47:41.750 --> 04:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:45.270 --> 04:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
if cyber security becomes more important
 
04:47:48.230 --> 04:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
than than the others then letting them
 
04:47:50.788 --> 04:47:50.798 align:start position:0%
move some around
 
04:47:54.788 --> 04:47:54.798 align:start position:0%
we might look at language about um
 
04:47:57.270 --> 04:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
who oversees that but that's a whole
 
04:47:59.430 --> 04:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
different ballgame
 
04:48:05.590 --> 04:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:07.990 --> 04:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
all right hi um
 
04:48:10.470 --> 04:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
just i guess just a heads up
 
04:48:13.270 --> 04:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
under military affairs and veterans
 
04:48:13.280 --> 04:48:15.190 align:start position:0%
under military affairs and veterans
services

04:48:15.190 --> 04:48:15.200 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:48:18.470 --> 04:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
back uh february 16th we all got or at
 
04:48:20.948 --> 04:48:20.958 align:start position:0%
least it was included there was an e
 
04:48:23.750 --> 04:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh note that we got from uh general
 
04:48:26.948 --> 04:48:26.958 align:start position:0%
michael mccoloitis and and
 
04:48:30.070 --> 04:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
i printed it out on pink paper um anyway
 
04:48:32.868 --> 04:48:32.878 align:start position:0%
i think that is a good um
 
04:48:34.788 --> 04:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
i think that's a good reference to uh
 
04:48:38.470 --> 04:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
refer to that 415 000 and
 
04:48:40.470 --> 04:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
his other needs there i'm just throwing
 
04:48:42.788 --> 04:48:42.798 align:start position:0%
that out for people to just refer back
 
04:48:45.510 --> 04:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
to it when we get to that department
 
04:48:48.150 --> 04:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
and that's why i said i didn't want to
 
04:48:50.230 --> 04:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
take it up at this point so that we
 
04:48:52.948 --> 04:48:52.958 align:start position:0%
could all have a chance to examine yeah
 
04:48:55.590 --> 04:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
i agree thank you because
 
04:48:57.990 --> 04:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
again i'll i'll say that every time that
 
04:49:00.070 --> 04:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
we come up with another
 
04:49:03.270 --> 04:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
400 500 600 000
 
04:49:03.280 --> 04:49:04.628 align:start position:0%
400 500 600 000
it

04:49:04.628 --> 04:49:04.638 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:49:08.470 --> 04:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
keeps edging our bottom line up so
 
04:49:11.510 --> 04:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
we have to take all of this the entire
 
04:49:13.830 --> 04:49:13.840 align:start position:0%
budget into account
 
04:49:16.070 --> 04:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
as we look at individual
 
04:49:16.080 --> 04:49:17.350 align:start position:0%
as we look at individual
um

04:49:17.350 --> 04:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:19.430 --> 04:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
agencies because
 
04:49:22.868 --> 04:49:22.878 align:start position:0%
it does matter it and it matters
 
04:49:25.590 --> 04:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
for those retained bills it matters for
 
04:49:28.390 --> 04:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
agency requests
 
04:49:28.400 --> 04:49:29.270 align:start position:0%
agency requests
and

04:49:29.270 --> 04:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:49:32.390 --> 04:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
we really do need to
 
04:49:35.670 --> 04:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
keep the the bigger picture in mind
 
04:49:37.910 --> 04:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
because i know that once you get into an
 
04:49:37.920 --> 04:49:39.270 align:start position:0%
because i know that once you get into an
agency

04:49:39.270 --> 04:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
agency
 
04:49:40.550 --> 04:49:40.560 align:start position:0%
you go
 
04:49:42.868 --> 04:49:42.878 align:start position:0%
yes they really do need that
 
04:49:46.470 --> 04:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
um but what do you give up
 
04:49:48.070 --> 04:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
and i know that
 
04:49:50.470 --> 04:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
the returning members on the committee
 
04:49:52.470 --> 04:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
anybody who's dealt with budgets in the
 
04:49:52.480 --> 04:49:53.350 align:start position:0%
anybody who's dealt with budgets in the
past

04:49:53.350 --> 04:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
past
 
04:49:56.150 --> 04:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
understand the need to um
 
04:49:59.190 --> 04:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
step back every once in a while and say
 
04:50:05.430 --> 04:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:07.350 --> 04:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
is there anything else that anybody
 
04:50:15.030 --> 04:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:16.550 --> 04:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
04:50:16.560 --> 04:50:20.070 align:start position:0%
seeing none
um

04:50:20.070 --> 04:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:22.948 --> 04:50:22.958 align:start position:0%
i thought i heard somebody um

contacted me about wanting to testify so
 
04:50:50.628 --> 04:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
there will be public input on
 
04:50:53.990 --> 04:50:54.000 align:start position:0%

um to get any additional answers or
 
04:51:16.708 --> 04:51:16.718 align:start position:0%
information before we come back for
 
04:51:18.550 --> 04:51:18.560 align:start position:0%

hopefully a final work
session

04:51:19.830 --> 04:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
session
 
04:51:23.430 --> 04:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
um before getting an amendment done

to get the amendment done by
 
04:52:23.510 --> 04:52:23.520 align:start position:0%
afternoon at
 
04:52:25.030 --> 04:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
noon of the
 
04:52:27.190 --> 04:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
20th 23rd probably
 
04:52:29.750 --> 04:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
um hopefully
 
04:52:32.230 --> 04:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
to get that done so
 
04:52:35.590 --> 04:52:35.600 align:start position:0%
then it's turnaround time at um
 
04:52:37.830 --> 04:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
legislative services
 
04:52:40.948 --> 04:52:40.958 align:start position:0%
because with the
 
04:52:43.350 --> 04:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
deadlines having been changed
 
04:52:44.868 --> 04:52:44.878 align:start position:0%
every committee
 
04:52:44.878 --> 04:52:46.708 align:start position:0%
every committee
is

04:52:46.708 --> 04:52:46.718 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:52:49.350 --> 04:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
doing amendments
 
04:52:53.030 --> 04:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
so we will be competing for time um with
 
04:52:55.750 --> 04:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
the drafters for an amendment
 
04:52:58.390 --> 04:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
um because they all have to be done by
 
04:53:00.788 --> 04:53:00.798 align:start position:0%
the first of
 
04:53:00.798 --> 04:53:02.708 align:start position:0%
the first of
april

04:53:02.708 --> 04:53:02.718 align:start position:0%
april
 
04:53:03.750 --> 04:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
turned in
 
04:53:06.310 --> 04:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
by the first of april
 
04:53:08.550 --> 04:53:08.560 align:start position:0%
which means the exact session has to be
 
04:53:09.910 --> 04:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
before that
 
04:53:12.708 --> 04:53:12.718 align:start position:0%
okay i just wanted to get some idea give
 
04:53:14.868 --> 04:53:14.878 align:start position:0%
us some idea of how much longer was how
 
04:53:16.628 --> 04:53:16.638 align:start position:0%
many more meetings were you expect we're
 
04:53:17.990 --> 04:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
going to take if
 
04:53:22.310 --> 04:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
we cannot if we cannot finish because of
 
04:53:25.110 --> 04:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
either work or the amendment isn't done
 
04:53:27.990 --> 04:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
we will meet the morning of the 29th
 
04:53:30.470 --> 04:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
which is a monday for an exact session
 
04:53:32.948 --> 04:53:32.958 align:start position:0%
okay that's your fallback okay good
 
04:53:35.270 --> 04:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
would be just that um
 
04:53:37.990 --> 04:53:38.000 align:start position:0%

04:53:41.110 --> 04:53:41.120 align:start position:0%
