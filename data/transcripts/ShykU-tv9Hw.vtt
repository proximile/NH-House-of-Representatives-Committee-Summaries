I
 
00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.840 align:start position:0%

here with you this morning um so I'm
 
00:10:06.069 --> 00:10:06.079 align:start position:0%
going to provide an economic update
 
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
focusing on the national economy and uh
 
00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:12.200 align:start position:0%
Regional economy I was here uh at this
 
00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:14.839 align:start position:0%
briefing two years ago and when I give
 
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
economic presentations I like to focus
 
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
on one or two big questions and try to
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
address them question two years ago was
 
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
why is inflation so high so we're seeing
 
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
historically High inflation rates in
 
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
2022 9% um and we hadn't seen seen that
 
00:10:32.069 --> 00:10:32.079 align:start position:0%
kind of number in 50 years so the
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
question was why why was inflation so
 
00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:37.160 align:start position:0%
high so that was the topic two years ago
 
00:10:39.269 --> 00:10:39.279 align:start position:0%
and today I'm going to ask the flip side
 
00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
of that question why is inflation so
 
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
much lower between 2% and 3% how do we
 
00:10:46.509 --> 00:10:46.519 align:start position:0%
bring inflation down that low and what
 
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
is the outlook on inflation going
 
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:50.120 align:start position:0%
forward that is probably the key issue
 
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
that'll determine the stance of monetary
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
policy going forward and that'll impact
 
00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:56.959 align:start position:0%
the overall economy as well a question
 
00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
that follows from asking that question
 
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
why is inflation so much lower is um are
 
00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
we likely to see an economic downturn as
 
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
we continue this fight against inflation
 
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
that's always the concern you tighten
 
00:11:12.269 --> 00:11:12.279 align:start position:0%
policies to withdraw stimulus in hopes
 
00:11:14.829 --> 00:11:14.839 align:start position:0%
of bringing inflation down but the risk
 
00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:16.480 align:start position:0%
is will that lead to an economic
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
downturn and adversely impact employment
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
and uh National output so I'll address
 
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
that question as well okay so that's the
 
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
topic and
 
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
um let's start with this chart here on
 
00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
inflation um in your handout uh sorry we
 
00:11:34.269 --> 00:11:34.279 align:start position:0%
lost a color coding here the color
 
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
coding is helpful so I'll try to um
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
point you to uh sort of the key patterns
 
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
of the data describe them in words and
 
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
I've got my little uh laser pointer here
 
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
that you can follow on the uh the screen
 
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
as well so when I show these inflation
 
00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:53.160 align:start position:0%
charts I'm going to start right before
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
the pandemic to give us a baseline of
 
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
what inflation looked like before the
 
00:12:00.269 --> 00:12:00.279 align:start position:0%
pandemic so that on the horizontal axis
 
00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:02.680 align:start position:0%
I'm usually starting in late
 
00:12:05.069 --> 00:12:05.079 align:start position:0%
2019 and then I'll I'll continue that
 
00:12:07.069 --> 00:12:07.079 align:start position:0%
chart to the most recent data points
 
00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:09.519 align:start position:0%
which is December 2024 or a little bit
 
00:12:11.069 --> 00:12:11.079 align:start position:0%
earlier depending on what data was
 
00:12:13.189 --> 00:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
available as of last
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
week uh when I show inflation charts uh
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
I want to keep in mind what the FED is
 
00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:19.720 align:start position:0%
trying to get us to their target
 
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
inflation rate which is 2% so I
 
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
represent that with this uh dashed green
 
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
line here as you can see on the screen
 
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:27.560 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sort of pointing to it with my
 
00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:29.480 align:start position:0%
laser pointer that's the that's the
 
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
fed's Target and the goal is to bring
 
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
inflation to that level uh with monetary
 
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
policy I show two measures of inflation
 
00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:42.160 align:start position:0%
here the blue line is CPI Consumer Price
 
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
Index that's commonly referenced in the
 
00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:46.839 align:start position:0%
popular press and when we talk about
 
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
inflation the second measure uh shown in
 
00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
the red line is the pce or personal
 
00:12:55.949 --> 00:12:55.959 align:start position:0%
consumption expenditure price index and
 
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
that is the index that the FED focuses
 
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
on so the red line is what the FED
 
00:13:03.069 --> 00:13:03.079 align:start position:0%
watches and their goal is to bring that
 
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
red line down to 2% a year represented
 
00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:09.160 align:start position:0%
by the dashed Green Line uh in a
 
00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
sustainable way that's their goal so how
 
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
close are
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
we we're pretty close we're pretty close
 
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
look at the look at the red Dash red
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
line here the PC inflation and that is
 
00:13:24.189 --> 00:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
uh the most recent reading of that was
 
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
2.4% that's what's shown in the red
 
00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
line uh the Fest sometimes looks at a
 
00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:32.519 align:start position:0%
core measure of the pce index which
 
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
excludes more the more volatile
 
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
components of food and energy so once
 
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
you exclude that you're a little bit
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
higher at
 
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
2.7 so 2.4 is shown in this red line
 
00:13:43.949 --> 00:13:43.959 align:start position:0%
including the full basket of of goods
 
00:13:46.189 --> 00:13:46.199 align:start position:0%
goods and services and then once you
 
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
exclude food and energy sometimes called
 
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
core index a little bit higher at
 
00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
2.7 so overall though when you look at
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
sort of the full picture here during
 
00:13:58.590 --> 00:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
2022 we were at very high rates of
 
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
inflation we had not seen in 50 years n
 
00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
9% uh or thereabouts but since then
 
00:14:06.189 --> 00:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
we've made tremendous tremendous Pro
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
progress in bringing inflation down and
 
00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
we're now between 2% and 3% very close
 
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
to the feds Target of two but not quite
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
there yet because the core index is
 
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
still coming in a little bit closer to
 
00:14:19.749 --> 00:14:19.759 align:start position:0%
three than it is to two and that's why
 
00:14:21.509 --> 00:14:21.519 align:start position:0%
this fight against inflation continues
 
00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
and that's why there's a continuing
 
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
debate about whether to keep interest
 
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
rates where they are uh in a somewhat of
 
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
a tight monetary policy stance or to
 
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
bring rates down because hey it really
 
00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:34.959 align:start position:0%
feels like we've beaten inflation and
 
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
now the concern is on the labor market
 
00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
side make sure that there's no downturn
 
00:14:39.389 --> 00:14:39.399 align:start position:0%
there and so maybe we should be raise
 
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
lowering rates further so that's the
 
00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
debate that happens at the fomc so
 
00:14:46.910 --> 00:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
that's where we find ourselves so I want
 
00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:49.519 align:start position:0%
to offer a sort of a more of a
 
00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
perspective on how it is that we've
 
00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
brought inflation down this much how do
 
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
we go from 9% inflation to 2 point
 
00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
something per inflation that's a an
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
achievement so how do we get there all
 
00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:05.560 align:start position:0%
right so when we think about how we did
 
00:15:07.670 --> 00:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
this it's important to distinguish
 
00:15:09.949 --> 00:15:09.959 align:start position:0%
between goods and services
 
00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:15.519 align:start position:0%
consumers spend uh household budgets on
 
00:15:16.829 --> 00:15:16.839 align:start position:0%
goods and
 
00:15:19.629 --> 00:15:19.639 align:start position:0%
services and the inflation picture looks
 
00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:21.560 align:start position:0%
quite different depending on what you
 
00:15:23.749 --> 00:15:23.759 align:start position:0%
focus on the inflation on Services looks
 
00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
very different from inflation on Goods
 
00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
so what's shown here on this chart and
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
and this is a little busy might be to
 
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
see on your hand out here but I'll try
 
00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:32.920 align:start position:0%
to explain on the screen again the
 
00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:35.240 align:start position:0%
dashed green line is the target
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
2% um about 2/3 of household budgets is
 
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
spent on Services I'll I'll talk more
 
00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:43.240 align:start position:0%
about what that means what kinds of
 
00:15:44.749 --> 00:15:44.759 align:start position:0%
services we spend money on but that's
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
the majority of our household budget
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
goes to uh services and the inflation
 
00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
rate on Services is represented by the
 
00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
green line here which is this line here
 
00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
and as you can see the inflation rate on
 
00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.430 align:start position:0%
and as you can see the inflation rate on
services

00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
is higher than the fets rate target of
 
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
2% and quite a bit higher it's above
 
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
5% right now the remaining portion of
 
00:16:12.269 --> 00:16:12.279 align:start position:0%
our household budget about onethird of
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
our our budget is spent on Goods goods
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
are often distinguished between durable
 
00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:20.120 align:start position:0%
goods uh things that last a long time
 
00:16:22.269 --> 00:16:22.279 align:start position:0%
and and we purchase them less frequently
 
00:16:24.509 --> 00:16:24.519 align:start position:0%
versus non-durable Goods things that uh
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
don't last very long and we purchase
 
00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
them often like food and so durable
 
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
goods are represented by the blue line
 
00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:33.880 align:start position:0%
which is the bottom line here and that's
 
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
the inflation rate of durable goods and
 
00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:38.360 align:start position:0%
the red line is the inflation rate of
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
non- durable
 
00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
goods okay so what do you notice about
 
00:16:46.269 --> 00:16:46.279 align:start position:0%
Services versus Goods we have a very
 
00:16:48.269 --> 00:16:48.279 align:start position:0%
different story on inflation depending
 
00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
on what you're focusing on on
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
Goods we do not have an inflation
 
00:16:55.069 --> 00:16:55.079 align:start position:0%
problem on Goods the inflation rate is
 
00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
either below 2% as you can see here for
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
non-durable goods in the in the red line
 
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:01.240 align:start position:0%
L inflation rate is close to
 
00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
zero and what you noticed about durable
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
goods the Blue Line uh representing
 
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:08.360 align:start position:0%
inflation of durable goods it's actually
 
00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
in the negative territory meaning prices
 
00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:13.720 align:start position:0%
compared to a year ago are falling on
 
00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
the durable goods
 
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
category right we do not have an
 
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
inflation problem on goods and really
 
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
inflation issue is concentrated in the
 
00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:26.360 align:start position:0%
services sector as you can see in the
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
green line being higher than the dash
 
00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:32.440 align:start position:0%
horiz onal line right so why do we have
 
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
this uh a Divergent story here for goods
 
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
versus Services that's the crucial thing
 
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
to understand when we think about how it
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
is that we brought inflation down and
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
then what is the outlook on inflation
 
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:43.990 align:start position:0%
then what is the outlook on inflation
going

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
forward okay so let me start with Goods
 
00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:48.200 align:start position:0%
tell a story there and then I I'll turn
 
00:17:50.909 --> 00:17:50.919 align:start position:0%
to Services where the problem is okay so
 
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
let's focus on Goods first where the
 
00:17:55.149 --> 00:17:55.159 align:start position:0%
inflation picture looks pretty favorable
 
00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:57.480 align:start position:0%
so durable goods
 
00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
um these are are things that last a long
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
time and we purchase them uh
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
infrequently so what what would be the
 
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
classic example of durable goods that we
 
00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
purchase automobiles cars we we buy them
 
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know what all your uh car
 
00:18:14.270 --> 00:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
purchase habits are but in my case it's
 
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
a very long time before I purchased a
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
new car uh and so automobiles are
 
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
classic um durable goods it represents a
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
big uh chunk of the household budget as
 
00:18:28.110 --> 00:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
well and so I'm representing in the blue
 
00:18:32.149 --> 00:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
line the inflation rate of new cars and
 
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:33.640 align:start position:0%
then in the red line represents
 
00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
inflation rate of used cars so the new
 
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
car market used car market are a little
 
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
bit different uh and so the price
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
movements are represented by the Blue
 
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
Line new cars the red line um used cars
 
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
and uh the other category of durable
 
00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:51.039 align:start position:0%
goods that's uh uh important is uh
 
00:18:53.149 --> 00:18:53.159 align:start position:0%
appliances and these are like household
 
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
appliances washing machines dishwashers
 
00:18:59.029 --> 00:18:59.039 align:start position:0%
uh refrigerators we buy them one and
 
00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
then we use them for a long time so also
 
00:19:02.669 --> 00:19:02.679 align:start position:0%
an important category Furniture is
 
00:19:05.149 --> 00:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
similar as well um and so what do you
 
00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
noticed about the inflation rate on this
 
00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
category a very important category
 
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
durable goods represents um within the
 
00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
goods category durables versus non
 
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
durables the durables represent the
 
00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
larger portion uh and so this is an
 
00:19:20.909 --> 00:19:20.919 align:start position:0%
important category to track some people
 
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
think that this is also a leading
 
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
indicator of uh economic activity when
 
00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
folks feel like their job prospects
 
00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
aren't as good and and there's a risk of
 
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
an economic downturn what do folks do
 
00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
well you start cutting out uh
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
discretionary spending and also you you
 
00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:39.640 align:start position:0%
you adjust your spending on durable
 
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:41.480 align:start position:0%
goods maybe instead of getting that new
 
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
car I'm going to look at a used car
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
instead uh so the spending patterns
 
00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:47.320 align:start position:0%
shift and so what happens with durable
 
00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
goods sometimes is seen as a leading
 
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
indicator so an important category to
 
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
look at here but what is the inflation
 
00:19:54.669 --> 00:19:54.679 align:start position:0%
rate what what is the inflation rate
 
00:19:56.990 --> 00:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
relative to the feds Target of 2% it is
 
00:20:00.669 --> 00:20:00.679 align:start position:0%
lower for all of these categories here
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
uh we don't have an inflation problem in
 
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
cars anymore we did back in 2022 in a
 
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
big way uh as you can see here and this
 
00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
was a big part of what I presented to
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
you two years ago when I was asking the
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
question why why is inflation so high
 
00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679 align:start position:0%
big part of the story here was on
 
00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
durable goods especially ones that are
 
00:20:22.029 --> 00:20:22.039 align:start position:0%
manufactured outside the US having
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
trouble getting here uh because we had a
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
major supply chain issues and the lack
 
00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:29.039 align:start position:0%
of Supply driven by pandemic Rel supply
 
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:31.240 align:start position:0%
shortages led to this big run up in
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
prices and that was a big part of the
 
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
inflation story so we talked about that
 
00:20:37.909 --> 00:20:37.919 align:start position:0%
two years ago that problem is gone uh
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
and so we do not have that problem and
 
00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:42.200 align:start position:0%
uh prices on used cars in fact as you
 
00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
can see here used car prices are shown
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
in the red line and for the past year
 
00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:47.919 align:start position:0%
what do you notice the red line is below
 
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
the zero horizontal axis which means
 
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
that uh used car prices have been
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
declining over the past year so again we
 
00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
should be careful here though because
 
00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
there was such a big increase in price
 
00:21:03.270 --> 00:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
prices during 2020 to 23 yes we're
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
seeing a price decrease but the level is
 
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
still pretty high if if you go out there
 
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
and try to buy a car you that's a lot of
 
00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
money but what inflation is about
 
00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
year-over-year changes it's not about
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
the level it's it's about the changes
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
over the past year and so that is uh
 
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:20.360 align:start position:0%
looking favorable so far and the same is
 
00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:23.919 align:start position:0%
true on appliances um and if you think
 
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
about Appliance prices at Home Depot
 
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
consumer uh uh durable goods
 
00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
those prices are also looking pretty
 
00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:34.360 align:start position:0%
good in terms of uh being at or below F
 
00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
Target of
 
00:21:39.630 --> 00:21:39.640 align:start position:0%
2% okay so good story there so far what
 
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
about um non- durables so so within the
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
goods category which is a third of the
 
00:21:48.909 --> 00:21:48.919 align:start position:0%
consumer consumption basket we talked
 
00:21:51.149 --> 00:21:51.159 align:start position:0%
about durable goods which is more than a
 
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
half of that the remaining is
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
non-durable Goods which represent things
 
00:21:58.990 --> 00:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
like food uh which is the the most
 
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
important non-durable consumption
 
00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
category energy is in there apparel so
 
00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
these are things that we purchase more
 
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
frequently so here the story looks
 
00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
pretty good um a big thing that got
 
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
people's attention during the pandemic
 
00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
was the very sharp increase in food
 
00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:22.919 align:start position:0%
prices uh driven by uh shortages um and
 
00:22:24.909 --> 00:22:24.919 align:start position:0%
there were a commodity price inflation
 
00:22:26.789 --> 00:22:26.799 align:start position:0%
as well and you can see that in the blue
 
00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
line here that uh I'm sorry the the red
 
00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:31.400 align:start position:0%
line here is the inflation of food
 
00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
prices and you can kind of see very high
 
00:22:37.029 --> 00:22:37.039 align:start position:0%
levels of inflation in 2022 at 10% or so
 
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
but that's come down and it's close to
 
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
2% as you can see here in the most
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
recent data points the red
 
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
line if you look at non- durable goods
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
on everything else except food and
 
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:49.480 align:start position:0%
that's represented in the by the Blue
 
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
Line you can kind of see here that we
 
00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
did see a very sharp inflation rates in
 
00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
2022 but that's come down in 23 and it's
 
00:22:59.549 --> 00:22:59.559 align:start position:0%
now below 2% and in fact it's in it's in
 
00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
the negative Territory prices are
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
falling year-over
 
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
year okay so even here we T we looked at
 
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
non- durable goods we looked at
 
00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
non-durables and it seems like we we
 
00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
don't have an inflation problem we've
 
00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
beaten the inflation problem here right
 
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
so if all we consumed were Automobiles
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
and um food and uh
 
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:27.640 align:start position:0%
clothing uh and so on we will be done
 
00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:29.919 align:start position:0%
with this on inflation it's time to
 
00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
lower rates and and let's make sure that
 
00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:33.400 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't run into an issue with
 
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
employment that would be the stance
 
00:23:38.669 --> 00:23:38.679 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh the goods category
 
00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
which which is showing kind of these
 
00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
favorable patterns here is only a third
 
00:23:44.269 --> 00:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
of our consumption basket the bulk of
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
our budget isn't spent on here on on
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
these types of goods it's on Services
 
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
that's where the issue is so let's turn
 
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
there now and talk about what's
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
happening with Services inflation and
 
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
and why it is remaining persistent and
 
00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
what the Outlook might be one one more
 
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
thing here before we move on this is a
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
new index that the New York Federal
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
Reserve Bank uh Federal Reserve Bank of
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
New York developed during the pandemic
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's called the global supply chain
 
00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:09.559 align:start position:0%
pressure Index this is an index
 
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
measuring things like how long does it
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
take to ship a manufactured good from
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
Europe to the US from China to the US
 
00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
what is the cost of shipping something
 
00:24:21.990 --> 00:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
from a manufacturing Hub in China to the
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
US so they created an index um to track
 
00:24:29.389 --> 00:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
uh changes in uh these uh uh supply
 
00:24:31.909 --> 00:24:31.919 align:start position:0%
chain issues and what they're showing is
 
00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
that during the pandemic in 2022 for
 
00:24:36.909 --> 00:24:36.919 align:start position:0%
example about here uh we're we're about
 
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
four standard deviations away from kind
 
00:24:42.669 --> 00:24:42.679 align:start position:0%
of historical averages and four standard
 
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
deviations away from a mean in a
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
statistical sense is something that
 
00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:49.640 align:start position:0%
happens like six times out of 100,000
 
00:24:51.029 --> 00:24:51.039 align:start position:0%
like you would never expect to see this
 
00:24:52.909 --> 00:24:52.919 align:start position:0%
happen you You' almost this would almost
 
00:24:54.909 --> 00:24:54.919 align:start position:0%
never happen and that's how bad how
 
00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
severe the supply chain issues were
 
00:24:58.909 --> 00:24:58.919 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic
 
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
which is why we had supply issues and
 
00:25:03.549 --> 00:25:03.559 align:start position:0%
the very sharp increases in the goods
 
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
category the manufactured goods uh
 
00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:07.880 align:start position:0%
substantial portion of which comes to
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:16.269 --> 00:25:16.279 align:start position:0%
EXC okay of course yes sir um this is a
 
00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
global supply chain pressure index
 
00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:20.200 align:start position:0%
measuring things like the cost of
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
transporting goods from overseas to the
 
00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
us as well as the length of time it
 
00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
takes to ship something from Europe or
 
00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
China or elsewhere to the us and uh what
 
00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
is showing is that in 2022 it reached uh
 
00:25:37.149 --> 00:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
supply chain pressures meaning higher
 
00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
costs and and longer trans transport
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
times than we've ever seen uh in in in
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
the way this this uh uh index is
 
00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:47.919 align:start position:0%
measured so extreme levels of supply
 
00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
chain pressures uh that uh resulted from
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and and that's partly why
 
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh we saw the issues that we just saw in
 
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
do you want to take questions as we go
 
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
I'd be glad to yes sir thank you uh well
 
00:26:10.269 --> 00:26:10.279 align:start position:0%
you've got a peak that is almost as high
 
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
and I can't read any of the numbers so
 
00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
on I presume it's maybe six months
 
00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
before or a year
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
before Oh I'm I'm yeah it Peak I AP so
 
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
so the uh the the peak here is January
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
of 2022 the height of the pandemic and
 
00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:32.360 align:start position:0%
so since then it's been coming down and
 
00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
this here is uh the horizontal axis here
 
00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
is is the historical average and so if
 
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
you're if you're at this the black
 
00:26:41.549 --> 00:26:41.559 align:start position:0%
horizontal axis that means you're about
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
where you've been in the past uh and so
 
00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
that's where we are today yeah yeah but
 
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
I think she uh the ranking member is
 
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
asking about uh
 
00:26:55.149 --> 00:26:55.159 align:start position:0%
2019 ah is that 2019 uh
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
2019 this is January this is January 20
 
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:00.520 align:start position:0%
so the pic has started okay and so right
 
00:27:02.029 --> 00:27:02.039 align:start position:0%
at the outside of the pandemic we do see
 
00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
the small Peak here okay so it is
 
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:07.240 align:start position:0%
they're both both Peaks are oh yes I
 
00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
understand yes that's exactly right yeah
 
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
yes uh so correct me if I'm wrong but I
 
00:27:15.789 --> 00:27:15.799 align:start position:0%
think you said in the beginning that
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
your horizontal line is basically 2019
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
202 no no no the the the um the
 
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
horizontal axis is an historical average
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
that goes back well before the pandemic
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
so it represents well what is normal in
 
00:27:32.149 --> 00:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
a typical economic environment very good
 
00:27:32.159 --> 00:27:33.070 align:start position:0%
a typical economic environment very good
thank

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
you I just um just related sort of
 
00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:41.960 align:start position:0%
related to this on on the slides are
 
00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559 align:start position:0%
difficult to see this one didn't even
 
00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
manage to reprint oh uh but on would it
 
00:27:51.789 --> 00:27:51.799 align:start position:0%
be possible for us to get all of these
 
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
slides digital absolutely yes uh I I
 
00:27:56.230 --> 00:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
think the the colors on these charts
 
00:27:57.789 --> 00:27:57.799 align:start position:0%
have really helped and so I I'll I'll
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
make sure I'll send these to Jennifer
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
here so you have you have the full slide
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
deck Jennifer's already got them yeah
 
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
thank you right send them out to anyone
 
00:28:09.509 --> 00:28:09.519 align:start position:0%
who wants they can contact uh Miss Flor
 
00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
she has them thank you u a further
 
00:28:14.909 --> 00:28:14.919 align:start position:0%
question um under durable goods you did
 
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
not mention uh uh real estate you know a
 
00:28:19.789 --> 00:28:19.799 align:start position:0%
third of our budget more or less goes to
 
00:28:22.269 --> 00:28:22.279 align:start position:0%
either rent or goes toward owning a home
 
00:28:24.029 --> 00:28:24.039 align:start position:0%
you know we've seen substantial
 
00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
inflation across the country with you
 
00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
know affordability of homes where's that
 
00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
in this calc that's that's in Services
 
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
that's in Services yes it is yeah yeah
 
00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
that's a perfect segue so it's it's
 
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
called rent of shelter and rent of
 
00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
shelter is considered Services category
 
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:47.149 --> 00:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
yeah sorry let's try it again sorry this
 
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
isn't a question but thank you for this
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
chart we have never seen this kind of
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
chart before of course no thank you okay
 
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
so let's let's continue here so uh we
 
00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
we've covered the the goods category
 
00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:01.640 align:start position:0%
and uh the the bottom line here is that
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
things look favorable we don't have an
 
00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:05.240 align:start position:0%
infl problem but now we'll come to
 
00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
charts where we have an inflation
 
00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:08.440 align:start position:0%
problem so let's come to the next uh
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
chart here which is inflation on
 
00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:14.360 align:start position:0%
services so as representative just
 
00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:16.919 align:start position:0%
mentioned a very important Point uh
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
shelter alone Housing Services represent
 
00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
a third of the full budget it it's it's
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
more than half of the services category
 
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
60% or higher of the services and a
 
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
third of the entirety of of uh household
 
00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
budgets so as representative mentioned
 
00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:34.120 align:start position:0%
it's a very important category what
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
happens to it uh is a very important
 
00:29:38.909 --> 00:29:38.919 align:start position:0%
factor in determining overall rates of
 
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
inflation um in Services the most
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
important category is housing followed
 
00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:46.360 align:start position:0%
by Medical Services followed by
 
00:29:48.669 --> 00:29:48.679 align:start position:0%
transportation services followed by
 
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:52.559 align:start position:0%
education so those categories uh
 
00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
housing uh medical
 
00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:58.039 align:start position:0%
expenses uh transportation services
 
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
including airfare uh and so on and then
 
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
um educational tuition including Child
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
Care th those are the big categories
 
00:30:08.789 --> 00:30:08.799 align:start position:0%
within Services uh and let's see what's
 
00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:11.080 align:start position:0%
happening there so in this chart you
 
00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
have uh the um Red Line representing the
 
00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:18.200 align:start position:0%
rent of shelter so rent of shelter is
 
00:30:20.509 --> 00:30:20.519 align:start position:0%
something that captures
 
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
um the rent payments if you're a renter
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
but uh for homeowners you have an Ed
 
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
rent for homeowners of course do not pay
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
rent um they may have mortgage payments
 
00:30:35.549 --> 00:30:35.559 align:start position:0%
so so there's a lot of Statistics that
 
00:30:37.549 --> 00:30:37.559 align:start position:0%
goes in to determining what an imputed
 
00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
rent might be to rent that house that
 
00:30:41.789 --> 00:30:41.799 align:start position:0%
the homeowner owns what would a market
 
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
rent be so there's a kind of a lot of
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
calculation that happens at the Bureau
 
00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:48.799 align:start position:0%
of Labor Statistics yes sir so the the
 
00:30:51.789 --> 00:30:51.799 align:start position:0%
red line would also include uh your
 
00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
property taxes uh and utilities are
 
00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
separate util utilities are are separate
 
00:31:03.669 --> 00:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
utilities are in a separate category um
 
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
capture sometimes in energy costs and uh
 
00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
property taxes that's a great question
 
00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
um what carry that falls into exactly
 
00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
I'll have to go back and check um but
 
00:31:16.629 --> 00:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a good uh question as
 
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
well so uh rent of shelter is the red
 
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
line and then the blue line here is all
 
00:31:23.629 --> 00:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
other services so everything else I
 
00:31:25.149 --> 00:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned that's in the services
 
00:31:27.629 --> 00:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
category is captured in the blue line
 
00:31:29.549 --> 00:31:29.559 align:start position:0%
Okay so so what do you notice about the
 
00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:31.559 align:start position:0%
inflation rates in those categories
 
00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
which are kind of the the um you know
 
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
60% or more together of our household
 
00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:40.360 align:start position:0%
budgets what is happening with the rate
 
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
of inflation there the horizontal dash
 
00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
line again is 2% and so as you can see
 
00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
here we're quite a bit above 2% so this
 
00:31:50.509 --> 00:31:50.519 align:start position:0%
is where the inflation problem is uh
 
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
that the rent of shelter is still
 
00:31:55.629 --> 00:31:55.639 align:start position:0%
continued to rise at you know 5% or
 
00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
higher and all other services also
 
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
increasing at similar rates and this is
 
00:32:02.669 --> 00:32:02.679 align:start position:0%
where the inflation problem is yes sir
 
00:32:05.629 --> 00:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
on the all other services yes have any
 
00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
of the entities broken them out into the
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
categories of housing Medical
 
00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
Transportation okay so we we'll look at
 
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
some of that yes it's it's coming right
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
up yes okay so let's take a look at some
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
of those details here now let me just
 
00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:23.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:27.389 --> 00:32:27.399 align:start position:0%
shelter uh there there's because housing
 
00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:29.480 align:start position:0%
is so important and because housing has
 
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
been a big driver of the persistence in
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
inflation the 2022 big uh spike in
 
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:38.200 align:start position:0%
inflation a lot of had to do with you
 
00:32:40.029 --> 00:32:40.039 align:start position:0%
know car prices and supply chain
 
00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:41.320 align:start position:0%
challenges as we
 
00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:43.720 align:start position:0%
discussed but the fact that inflation
 
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
persists a lot of it has to do with
 
00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
housing so a lot of research is going
 
00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
into figuring out what is happening with
 
00:32:50.909 --> 00:32:50.919 align:start position:0%
the housing market how does it exactly
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
impact these inflation
 
00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:55.240 align:start position:0%
indices and uh one one thing that people
 
00:32:58.269 --> 00:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
are noticing is the housing component
 
00:33:01.389 --> 00:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
has a very important lag in impacting
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
inflation in this sense if you survey
 
00:33:06.269 --> 00:33:06.279 align:start position:0%
people CPI is based on the household
 
00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:07.960 align:start position:0%
survey if you survey people hey how much
 
00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
rent are you paying uh on your apartment
 
00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
uh you're going to get an answer and
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
then you can kind of track that over
 
00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
time but what what does that answer mean
 
00:33:20.789 --> 00:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
is really important right when you ask
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
somebody hey how much how much are you
 
00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:24.679 align:start position:0%
paying in rent that's a price quote
 
00:33:27.549 --> 00:33:27.559 align:start position:0%
unquote that usually lasts a year or
 
00:33:29.549 --> 00:33:29.559 align:start position:0%
longer longer right it may not be the
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
current market price if you if you were
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
to rent that unit out today you might be
 
00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
paying a different rate than the person
 
00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
who answered the survey who signed a you
 
00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
know a a lease or a contract with the
 
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
landlord a year ago two years ago
 
00:33:45.509 --> 00:33:45.519 align:start position:0%
locking in their rate and so to get a
 
00:33:47.629 --> 00:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
current market rate on that property you
 
00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:50.200 align:start position:0%
might need to do something so that's
 
00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
that's an important question yes yes sir
 
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
yeah quick question what's the time
 
00:33:55.269 --> 00:33:55.279 align:start position:0%
scale on that the chart okay so we're
 
00:33:57.430 --> 00:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
tracking monthly data here so this is
 
00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.389 align:start position:0%
tracking monthly data here so this is
from

00:33:58.389 --> 00:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
uh Zillow which is a real estate website
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
uh tracks housing prices and they they
 
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
make make available a lot of data so we
 
00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
we got monthly uh data here uh on
 
00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:11.480 align:start position:0%
something called observed rent so this
 
00:34:15.869 --> 00:34:15.879 align:start position:0%
is their attempt at track tracking true
 
00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
real-time Market rents so instead of
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
like surveying people to ask hey what
 
00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:20.919 align:start position:0%
what how much are you paying they're
 
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out on on rents on
 
00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:25.399 align:start position:0%
properties that turned over or new
 
00:34:27.710 --> 00:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
leases that were signed what is the rent
 
00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
so that's what this is trying to follow
 
00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:32.200 align:start position:0%
up please what's the end to endend time
 
00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
period on that chart okay and sir I'm
 
00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
this is hard to see January 2021 is the
 
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
starting starting point and then the uh
 
00:34:42.829 --> 00:34:42.839 align:start position:0%
last Point here is November
 
00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:48.200 align:start position:0%
2024 yes okay so
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
yes yeah state representative Chris ones
 
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
um just a question does this include
 
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.720 align:start position:0%
only rent or does it also include home
 
00:34:59.390 --> 00:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
ownership okay this is this is only rent
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
yes this is being recorded in order for
 
00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:11.960 align:start position:0%
it to be accurately recorded we got to
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
remember to use the microphones please
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
thank you okay one one further question
 
00:35:21.870 --> 00:35:21.880 align:start position:0%
yes I wanted to add on to that on people
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
remember that you're supposed to go
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
through the chair and this is the chair
 
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839 align:start position:0%
okay okay so the the the pattern that I
 
00:35:40.349 --> 00:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
want to uh talk about here is that when
 
00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
you look at realtime market-based rents
 
00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
that a website like Zillow is tracking
 
00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
here and this is showing year over your
 
00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
changes so you you kind of think it as
 
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
as like an inflation rate in uh rent um
 
00:35:56.910 --> 00:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
for rental units and what it's showing
 
00:35:59.790 --> 00:35:59.800 align:start position:0%
is that yes there was this big increase
 
00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
in in uh rent inflation in 2022 so again
 
00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh sorry it's the the horizont x is hard
 
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
to read here so the peak here is
 
00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
occurring in early 2022 and it's been
 
00:36:14.309 --> 00:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
coming down here and has been plateauing
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
at below 4% rate uh starting about in
 
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
late 2023 all of 2024 coming into 2025
 
00:36:26.109 --> 00:36:26.119 align:start position:0%
so the point here is that there there
 
00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
may be some good news that will
 
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
eventually be baked into the CPI rent
 
00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
component because we've seen this big
 
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
drop off in rent inflation when you look
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
at market-based data knowing that CPI is
 
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
a lagged indicator that'll eventually
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
reflect this over time that there may be
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
some additional good news to come on the
 
00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
rent component of CPI inflation going
 
00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.190 align:start position:0%
rent component of CPI inflation going
forward

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
yes however from your own dat data it
 
00:36:58.309 --> 00:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
seems to indicate
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
that the um core inflation rate is not
 
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
the 2% but it's closer to the 4% good
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
point good point so even uh the core
 
00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:11.800 align:start position:0%
inflation is so here the rent component
 
00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:13.960 align:start position:0%
is closer to four it's like three three
 
00:37:16.829 --> 00:37:16.839 align:start position:0%
point something percent maybe mid three%
 
00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
but here the thing to note is that even
 
00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
before the
 
00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:23.560 align:start position:0%
pandemic um this this is not showing the
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
full data here going back before the P
 
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
what things were like in the 2010s uh
 
00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
rent did increase faster than 2% per
 
00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
year and the overall inflation rate was
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
still below 2% meaning we we had a good
 
00:37:38.829 --> 00:37:38.839 align:start position:0%
inflation uh good economic environment
 
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
on inflation overall even when housing
 
00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:42.680 align:start position:0%
itself was increasing a little bit
 
00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:48.440 align:start position:0%
faster than 2% so uh the I think it'll
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
help CPI inflation on the rent component
 
00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
once sort of the market what's happening
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
in real time with the market R rising at
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
more moderate levels
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
is reflected in CPI okay so um there
 
00:38:04.349 --> 00:38:04.359 align:start position:0%
there may be maybe some good news to
 
00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:06.280 align:start position:0%
come here but the point remains that
 
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
housing inflation is high housing
 
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
inflation is more like 5% uh when we're
 
00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
trying to get to 2% so that continues to
 
00:38:16.589 --> 00:38:16.599 align:start position:0%
be the the one of the main issues
 
00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:19.839 align:start position:0%
here if I could we have to always
 
00:38:22.829 --> 00:38:22.839 align:start position:0%
remember that a lot of people are on
 
00:38:22.839 --> 00:38:24.589 align:start position:0%
remember that a lot of people are on
fixed

00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
fixed
 
00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
incomes and that on
 
00:38:31.950 --> 00:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't help them that now it's
 
00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
getting short uh less uh difficult for
 
00:38:40.750 --> 00:38:40.760 align:start position:0%
the people who are not on fixed
 
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
incomes thank you thank
 
00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair uh thanks for
 
00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:48.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question so could we just back
 
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
up one slide to the medical and
 
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
transportation or did or are they out of
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
order oh okay okay because I thought
 
00:38:58.750 --> 00:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
somehow I miss I think on this one I I
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh had the two in the wrong plac that's
 
00:39:05.829 --> 00:39:05.839 align:start position:0%
fine I good thank you okay now so having
 
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
looked at housing let's come to the
 
00:39:10.109 --> 00:39:10.119 align:start position:0%
other big categories within Services um
 
00:39:10.119 --> 00:39:11.270 align:start position:0%
other big categories within Services um
so

00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
Medical Care is a big component and
 
00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:17.720 align:start position:0%
inflation in medical care uh prices is
 
00:39:21.630 --> 00:39:21.640 align:start position:0%
shown in the BL line another uh category
 
00:39:23.309 --> 00:39:23.319 align:start position:0%
is transportation
 
00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
services and uh that is showing very
 
00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:27.160 align:start position:0%
high rates of inflation that's in the
 
00:39:29.309 --> 00:39:29.319 align:start position:0%
red line here and that is showing very
 
00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%
high rates inflation higher than 5% per
 
00:39:34.309 --> 00:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
year okay so let's start with medical uh
 
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
care so this is reflecting medical
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
insurance rates and then any outof
 
00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
pocket expenses we pay on Medical
 
00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
Services uh and that is increasing uh at
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
higher than uh 2% but pretty
 
00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:51.160 align:start position:0%
close this category um actually if you
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
look at this over time even even looking
 
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
at what it looked like before the
 
00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic before the pandemic it's
 
00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
showing only a little bit of data here
 
00:39:59.910 --> 00:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
to the very left of the of the chart
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
here the gray column represents the the
 
00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
covid recession in early uh 2020 and so
 
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
prior to that is before the pandemic uh
 
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
and what you see here is that medical
 
00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:13.720 align:start position:0%
price uh Medical Services inflation was
 
00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
higher than the um 2% Target even before
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and we're actually doing a
 
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
little bit better it it's it's
 
00:40:26.230 --> 00:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
increasing at about 3% a year uh Which
 
00:40:28.589 --> 00:40:28.599 align:start position:0%
is higher than two but better than what
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
it was uh before the pandemic so I I
 
00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
would think of this as we're doing okay
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:39.309 --> 00:40:39.319 align:start position:0%
inflation but we have a a bigger issue
 
00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
here on this other category uh
 
00:40:43.309 --> 00:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
transportation services inflation is
 
00:40:48.470 --> 00:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
running at uh close to 7% a year um any
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
guess as to what this might be here uh
 
00:40:52.589 --> 00:40:52.599 align:start position:0%
what what what related to car
 
00:40:54.349 --> 00:40:54.359 align:start position:0%
maintenance and
 
00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
Automobiles uh do we see going up in
 
00:41:00.190 --> 00:41:00.200 align:start position:0%
terms of prices a big component is auto
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
insurance so um I don't know if folks
 
00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
can relate but my I I my auto insurance
 
00:41:08.109 --> 00:41:08.119 align:start position:0%
certainly reflects this pattern here uh
 
00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:09.640 align:start position:0%
I I found that my insurance rates have
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
been going up quite a bit so after
 
00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
staying with one career for 10 years uh
 
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
I just switched uh this past year um
 
00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
after looking at some uh doing some
 
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
price comparisons okay so so that's uh
 
00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:26.680 align:start position:0%
another uh driver of uh transportation
 
00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
services category auto repairs uh uh I
 
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
don't know if any of you have had uh
 
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
cars repaired recently but the cost of
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
uh getting getting repairs done has also
 
00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:39.640 align:start position:0%
gone up quite a bit and that's that's
 
00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
also a thing that is driving up sort of
 
00:41:44.589 --> 00:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
Transportation Services
 
00:41:48.349 --> 00:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
when thanks um isn't
 
00:41:58.109 --> 00:41:58.119 align:start position:0%
um people were not
 
00:42:01.349 --> 00:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
flying hardly at all during the
 
00:42:01.359 --> 00:42:02.910 align:start position:0%
flying hardly at all during the
pandemic

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
and a lot of planes were put away in the
 
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
Arizona desert because they didn't need
 
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
them and then everybody came back and
 
00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
the planes were
 
00:42:21.309 --> 00:42:21.319 align:start position:0%
needed needed repairs and things like
 
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
that I was wondering um certainly now
 
00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
every single plane I
 
00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
I take which isn't very often are uh is
 
00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:36.440 align:start position:0%
completely full every single seat um
 
00:42:38.829 --> 00:42:38.839 align:start position:0%
right and so uh that's interesting
 
00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:43.240 align:start position:0%
observation there uh airfare was a big
 
00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:47.240 align:start position:0%
component of inflation in 2020 also so
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
this is when I think what representative
 
00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
is is talking about is sometimes called
 
00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
Revenge travel folks being under
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
lockdown for two years and then all
 
00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
their plans got canceled
 
00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:00.280 align:start position:0%
and then when things opened back up uh
 
00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
so many of us wanted to travel uh and
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
there was a huge demand surge in demand
 
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
for uh air travel and there was a big
 
00:43:09.549 --> 00:43:09.559 align:start position:0%
increase in airf fars and that was part
 
00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
of the story of 2022 inflation uh but
 
00:43:14.190 --> 00:43:14.200 align:start position:0%
what they saying is that that component
 
00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
it has definitely moderated uh we're not
 
00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
seeing that not nearly to the same
 
00:43:22.109 --> 00:43:22.119 align:start position:0%
extent though overall as a category this
 
00:43:23.710 --> 00:43:23.720 align:start position:0%
is an issue we we have an inflation
 
00:43:25.829 --> 00:43:25.839 align:start position:0%
issue here uh in in this category of
 
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
services Mr
 
00:43:33.069 --> 00:43:33.079 align:start position:0%
yes if I may um thank you for taking I I
 
00:43:34.549 --> 00:43:34.559 align:start position:0%
actually have two quick questions and
 
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
just um in terms of auto repairs the
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
component having just gone through this
 
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
the component is parts and labor is this
 
00:43:46.109 --> 00:43:46.119 align:start position:0%
is this does this include labor cost or
 
00:43:48.390 --> 00:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
is that calculated elsewhere okay so
 
00:43:51.549 --> 00:43:51.559 align:start position:0%
that that's a very um interesting and
 
00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:53.640 align:start position:0%
important observation because this
 
00:43:56.109 --> 00:43:56.119 align:start position:0%
includes uh auto repair costs would
 
00:43:58.870 --> 00:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
include labor as well as well as parts
 
00:44:01.589 --> 00:44:01.599 align:start position:0%
and uh perhaps this is what the question
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
is getting at is what distinguishes
 
00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:07.160 align:start position:0%
services from Goods what what's the
 
00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
primary distinction there is that wages
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
are a much bigger component of services
 
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh industry as as an input cost than it
 
00:44:18.670 --> 00:44:18.680 align:start position:0%
is in Goods often in Goods it's the cost
 
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
of of uh materials cost of things that
 
00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
you purchase from somewhere else to make
 
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
something whereas in Services you're not
 
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
really importing anything here and the
 
00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
big component is Wages of your employees
 
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
and that is something that we we're
 
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
seeing some uh inflationary pressures so
 
00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:37.880 align:start position:0%
that's a good observation follow up um
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
the other thing I and I just noticed on
 
00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
the chart um probably because I didn't
 
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
have my reading glasses on um it says
 
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
these are the Consumer Price Index for
 
00:44:50.109 --> 00:44:50.119 align:start position:0%
all Urban consumers yes um we're not a
 
00:44:52.829 --> 00:44:52.839 align:start position:0%
very Urban state so is there a is there
 
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
a difference is is there an
 
00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
applicability to this that's a good
 
00:44:58.910 --> 00:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
question so all of the data on CPI will
 
00:45:02.030 --> 00:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
say us City averages at the end and
 
00:45:04.109 --> 00:45:04.119 align:start position:0%
because the CPI is meant to be an urban
 
00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
price index now when uh the labor
 
00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
department a Bureau of Labor Statistics
 
00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
constructs this index they they say they
 
00:45:14.349 --> 00:45:14.359 align:start position:0%
capture 93% of the US population because
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
cities include very small cities uh but
 
00:45:20.109 --> 00:45:20.119 align:start position:0%
it does leave out uh like Farm
 
00:45:22.309 --> 00:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
households and very rural areas and
 
00:45:24.349 --> 00:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
their surveys don't reach uh those areas
 
00:45:27.069 --> 00:45:27.079 align:start position:0%
so the this this is an urban Price Index
 
00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:34.349 --> 00:45:34.359 align:start position:0%
States okay so that that was my last
 
00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
last slide on uh inflation here and I
 
00:45:38.349 --> 00:45:38.359 align:start position:0%
think we spent a good amount of time on
 
00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
this which I think is appropriate given
 
00:45:42.349 --> 00:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
how important this is so the story here
 
00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
is we're very close to meeting the fetch
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
Target of 2% we're in The Last Mile
 
00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:49.680 align:start position:0%
we're at 2.7 I think they're committed
 
00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
to bringing it all the way down to two
 
00:45:54.109 --> 00:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
how long that takes how quickly it takes
 
00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
that's the question here we've gotten
 
00:45:58.069 --> 00:45:58.079 align:start position:0%
there on Goods we don't have the supply
 
00:45:59.950 --> 00:45:59.960 align:start position:0%
issues that cause the problem on in the
 
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
goods category we do have remaining
 
00:46:04.230 --> 00:46:04.240 align:start position:0%
persistent inflation in services and I
 
00:46:06.069 --> 00:46:06.079 align:start position:0%
think there maybe some good news to come
 
00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
on housing uh but wages being a key
 
00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:11.480 align:start position:0%
category will be very important to watch
 
00:46:14.069 --> 00:46:14.079 align:start position:0%
as we think about inflation yes um
 
00:46:16.109 --> 00:46:16.119 align:start position:0%
before we leave inflation and we are
 
00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
running a little bit short on time um
 
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
but before we we'll leave that uh
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
there's an effect of the M2 U monetary 2
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
number which kind of keeps inflation or
 
00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:32.200 align:start position:0%
devalues the dollar whichever way you
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
want to take a look at it
 
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
um plus we were up high prices went up
 
00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
high but then your inflation which is a
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
month-to-month increase doesn't take
 
00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
into consideration that that's an number
 
00:46:49.309 --> 00:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
above the previous month's value which
 
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
was already artificially High because of
 
00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
the previe two months previous inflation
 
00:46:57.390 --> 00:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
value how do we get the price is back
 
00:46:59.829 --> 00:46:59.839 align:start position:0%
down low okay I I don't know that they
 
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
will so so this this is a important
 
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
question um the fet's target is low and
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
moderate inflation not bringing prices
 
00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
back to where they were before the
 
00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic so uh If the Fed achieves its
 
00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:17.480 align:start position:0%
goal which is a moderate level of 2%
 
00:47:19.589 --> 00:47:19.599 align:start position:0%
inflation year-over-year prices will
 
00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
always continue to increase and they'll
 
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
increase from the current levels as you
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
as you knowe yes we did have this big
 
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:27.640 align:start position:0%
big run up in prices as you see in some
 
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
categories we've actually seen a little
 
00:47:31.109 --> 00:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
bit of a reversal like in car prices
 
00:47:32.309 --> 00:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
we've seen a little bit of reversal
 
00:47:34.109 --> 00:47:34.119 align:start position:0%
there so they went a little bit in the
 
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
direction of uh going back to what they
 
00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
were but not fully we're not undoing the
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
40% inflation that we had in used car
 
00:47:44.349 --> 00:47:44.359 align:start position:0%
prices fully we're we're undoing a
 
00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
little bit of that uh so my expectation
 
00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
would be that if we get to fetch Target
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
we'll we're going to have moderate
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
levels inflation but the price levels I
 
00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
don't think will return to where they
 
00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:59.349 align:start position:0%
don't think will return to where they
were

00:47:59.349 --> 00:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:01.069 --> 00:48:01.079 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind our Senators have a
 
00:48:02.670 --> 00:48:02.680 align:start position:0%
couple of questions of course I tend to
 
00:48:11.270 --> 00:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:13.069 --> 00:48:13.079 align:start position:0%
Senators my question about the
 
00:48:13.079 --> 00:48:17.430 align:start position:0%
Senators my question about the
applicability

00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
to tax so
 
00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:45.640 align:start position:0%
okay good question um when I think about
 
00:48:48.069 --> 00:48:48.079 align:start position:0%
the New England economy specifically uh
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
my starting point is that National
 
00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
economy is the biggest Factor we we are
 
00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
a small part of the national economy uh
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
5 to 7% % depending on how you measure
 
00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
it um and what happens to the United
 
00:49:02.069 --> 00:49:02.079 align:start position:0%
States as a whole will really impact us
 
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
so I always start from there um the
 
00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
things that are more U pertinent or
 
00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
unique to US housing is a big factor uh
 
00:49:13.789 --> 00:49:13.799 align:start position:0%
housing prices uh are appreciating here
 
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
faster they have historically than
 
00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:17.960 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the country and so I watch
 
00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
housing prices carefully and I think
 
00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
they're even as housing prices are
 
00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
decreasing in some parts of the country
 
00:49:25.789 --> 00:49:25.799 align:start position:0%
now uh that's not what's happening here
 
00:49:28.549 --> 00:49:28.559 align:start position:0%
I don't think so so the housing market
 
00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
um continues to be strong and uh will
 
00:49:34.789 --> 00:49:34.799 align:start position:0%
contribute I think if you were to kind
 
00:49:37.069 --> 00:49:37.079 align:start position:0%
of isolate inflation to our area that'll
 
00:49:38.589 --> 00:49:38.599 align:start position:0%
be that's an important factor for the
 
00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
whole country but probably more
 
00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
important for us just given how uh
 
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
strongly how house prices have increased
 
00:49:47.349 --> 00:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh as you noted there
 
00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
um and then in terms of uh indust
 
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
specific industry impacts um that's a
 
00:49:56.109 --> 00:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
horror question and I think I my
 
00:49:58.510 --> 00:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
starting point again is that we are
 
00:49:59.710 --> 00:49:59.720 align:start position:0%
going to be very sensitive to the
 
00:50:01.789 --> 00:50:01.799 align:start position:0%
National economy how it does so I I I
 
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
start there and then uh I think we'll be
 
00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:07.280 align:start position:0%
impacted by so overall rates of economic
 
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
expansion okay Senator Rosal did you
 
00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:14.079 align:start position:0%
have a follow thank you um question very
 
00:50:16.789 --> 00:50:16.799 align:start position:0%
good thank you Mr CH thanks for taking
 
00:50:19.109 --> 00:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
my question so uh when we're talking
 
00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
about you're talking about the
 
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
automobile and services and so I just
 
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
put new tires on uh my Subaru and I was
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
shocked at what the tire prices were so
 
00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
might we see a big correction as you
 
00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:35.240 align:start position:0%
know we're I'm noticing fuel prices are
 
00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:38.200 align:start position:0%
dropping uh I know during the pandemic
 
00:50:40.109 --> 00:50:40.119 align:start position:0%
like the heat your home fuel oil prices
 
00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:42.599 align:start position:0%
are up around five and a half close to
 
00:50:45.750 --> 00:50:45.760 align:start position:0%
$6 a gallon price of gas I think got
 
00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:47.720 align:start position:0%
close to five here as well over seven
 
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
out west and uh the other day like at
 
00:50:53.589 --> 00:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
Sam's was like 270 something so it's
 
00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
really come down so do you do you see
 
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
that helping us correct in these
 
00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
situations or yes I I I think so so
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
Energy prices are actually a category
 
00:51:05.549 --> 00:51:05.559 align:start position:0%
that exactly fits uh Mr Vice chair's uh
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
sort of question earlier which is are
 
00:51:09.069 --> 00:51:09.079 align:start position:0%
there categories where prices actually
 
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
are not just moderating in terms of
 
00:51:12.789 --> 00:51:12.799 align:start position:0%
inflation rates year-over-year changes
 
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
but actually go back to where they were
 
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
uh and energy might be one place where
 
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
that could potentially happen where uh
 
00:51:22.030 --> 00:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
because Energy prices reflect sort of
 
00:51:25.309 --> 00:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
global supply and demand and uh oil
 
00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
prices um not quite as low as as we've
 
00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:32.680 align:start position:0%
seen during the very low uh uh price
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
periods of in Energy prices but they
 
00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:37.720 align:start position:0%
have they have come down um and so that
 
00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
that's an area where we've seen
 
00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
improvements in gas prices as as you
 
00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:44.680 align:start position:0%
noted uh and other industries that use
 
00:51:47.349 --> 00:51:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh you know energy as an input will will
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
will reflect that in in their pricing
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
decisions as well so I think that's a
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
that's another area where uh it's a
 
00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
favorable factor uh in uh the inflation
 
00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:10.109 --> 00:52:10.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:21.270 align:start position:0%
 
Hampshire

00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
yes demographic trend that's going to
 
00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:27.030 align:start position:0%
yes demographic trend that's going to
make

00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:52:31.549 --> 00:52:31.559 align:start position:0%
risk of needing Health
 
00:52:36.589 --> 00:52:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:45.710 --> 00:52:45.720 align:start position:0%
really yeah what what the question is
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
getting at is that different
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
consumers uh have different consumption
 
00:52:53.069 --> 00:52:53.079 align:start position:0%
baskets depending on uh where you live
 
00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:55.720 align:start position:0%
depending on how old you are uh and I
 
00:52:58.750 --> 00:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
think the Cent question is for the older
 
00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
demographic you you what you what your
 
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
consumption basket looks like may have
 
00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
different weights it could be a higher
 
00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:05.960 align:start position:0%
weight on medical services for example
 
00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
and so if there's an inflation there
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
it'll impact you disproportionately
 
00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
compared to sort of the average US
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
household may maybe the you know the
 
00:53:16.069 --> 00:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
weight there on average is 7% uh but it
 
00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
might be a lot higher than that for uh
 
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
an older household and they'll
 
00:53:23.630 --> 00:53:23.640 align:start position:0%
experience the impact of that uh uh much
 
00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
more so good point um I don't have the
 
00:53:28.589 --> 00:53:28.599 align:start position:0%
specific data on specific areas within
 
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but economists do look at
 
00:53:33.069 --> 00:53:33.079 align:start position:0%
this that the distributional impacts of
 
00:53:35.109 --> 00:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
inflation differ depending on who you
 
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
are and what the household looks like um
 
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
and obviously if your consumption is
 
00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
concentrated in areas that have high
 
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
rates of inflation and if your income if
 
00:53:47.589 --> 00:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
you live on fixed income for example
 
00:53:49.589 --> 00:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
you'll experience that much more acutely
 
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
than than someone else might so that's
 
00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:54.440 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a good point yes thank
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
you very much I think we should probably
 
00:53:59.270 --> 00:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
move on to the next yes and uh if we
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
could hold our questions until the
 
00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
entire presentation on employment okay
 
00:54:07.109 --> 00:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
so Mr Vice CH just doing a a time check
 
00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
here uh perhaps I could shorten the rest
 
00:54:10.870 --> 00:54:10.880 align:start position:0%
of my remarks and I I'll try to finish
 
00:54:13.150 --> 00:54:13.160 align:start position:0%
by uh 10
 
00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
o'clock okay sounds great um so I'm I'm
 
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
going to uh keep the rest of this
 
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
relatively brief here and maybe get us
 
00:54:24.549 --> 00:54:24.559 align:start position:0%
to projections um that you might be
 
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
interested in um I have a number of data
 
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
on related to employment in the labor
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
market I think you heard a very good
 
00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
presentation on this yesterday from uh
 
00:54:36.789 --> 00:54:36.799 align:start position:0%
the state uh economists so I think I can
 
00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
keep my remarks brief there and I I
 
00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
think what I noticed there is two
 
00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
things uh that the levels and the trends
 
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
tell us a different story unemployment
 
00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:48.760 align:start position:0%
the levels look great if you look at
 
00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:50.230 align:start position:0%
the levels look great if you look at
unemployment

00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
rates if you look at some other data
 
00:54:56.829 --> 00:54:56.839 align:start position:0%
that's shown in uh my presentation here
 
00:54:59.589 --> 00:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
the levels look fine we we're still at
 
00:55:01.549 --> 00:55:01.559 align:start position:0%
very low unemployment rates maybe I'll
 
00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
just kind of take us to a slide here so
 
00:55:06.190 --> 00:55:06.200 align:start position:0%
this a slide showing unemployment rates
 
00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:08.440 align:start position:0%
for the us as a whole and for each of
 
00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
the New England states a year ago and
 
00:55:15.309 --> 00:55:15.319 align:start position:0%
what it is now and what it shows is that
 
00:55:18.589 --> 00:55:18.599 align:start position:0%
um the levels look good New Hampshire
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
has an unemployment rate of 2.5% very
 
00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
low um and new hampsh Vermont have had
 
00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
very low unemployment rates
 
00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:31.839 align:start position:0%
um and uh we look good compared to the
 
00:55:33.309 --> 00:55:33.319 align:start position:0%
rest of the country rest of the country
 
00:55:36.549 --> 00:55:36.559 align:start position:0%
has a 4.1% unemployment rate uh on
 
00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
average we lower than that so the levels
 
00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:42.680 align:start position:0%
tell generally a positive story here but
 
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
if you look at Trends there are some
 
00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
trends that are worth watching for
 
00:55:48.349 --> 00:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
example the biggest economy in New
 
00:55:50.430 --> 00:55:50.440 align:start position:0%
England Massachusetts we've seen
 
00:55:53.789 --> 00:55:53.799 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate go up from 3.3 a very
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
low unemployment rate to 4.0 4.0 is a
 
00:55:59.390 --> 00:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
good unemployment rate I would say is
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
still low compared to historical um
 
00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
experiences but we've seen an uptick so
 
00:56:08.349 --> 00:56:08.359 align:start position:0%
that does make you wonder okay what is
 
00:56:09.789 --> 00:56:09.799 align:start position:0%
the trend here and is there anything to
 
00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:11.240 align:start position:0%
kind of worry about and that's the kind
 
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
of discussion that happens at the uh uh
 
00:56:15.789 --> 00:56:15.799 align:start position:0%
when the Federal Reserve meets to decide
 
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160 align:start position:0%
their uh monetary policy is that the
 
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
levels look favorable but are there kind
 
00:56:23.029 --> 00:56:23.039 align:start position:0%
of signs that uh we should watch and
 
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:24.200 align:start position:0%
that could potentially be a source for
 
00:56:26.829 --> 00:56:26.839 align:start position:0%
concern Let Me Maybe show one chart that
 
00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
kind of captures that um here here's one
 
00:56:32.910 --> 00:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
chart here it's on job postings so
 
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
there's a website called indeed.com this
 
00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
is one of many sort of job posting
 
00:56:39.069 --> 00:56:39.079 align:start position:0%
websites and you go there and look for
 
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh what what jobs available and they
 
00:56:43.630 --> 00:56:43.640 align:start position:0%
have constructed this index uh this
 
00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
index is is a the Baseline is 100 and
 
00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
that's where that's based on how many
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
job postings there were in the US uh
 
00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:54.559 align:start position:0%
that's the blue line and um
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is in the red line and New
 
00:56:59.109 --> 00:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is in the green line and so if
 
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
you're at 100 that means uh 100 is here
 
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
this is the horizontal line I'm sorry
 
00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:05.240 align:start position:0%
this is really hard to see if you're
 
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
there that's a starting point you're at
 
00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
the same level as job postings there
 
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
were before the pandemic in February
 
00:57:18.029 --> 00:57:18.039 align:start position:0%
2020 and if you're above that 100 line
 
00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
then uh you have more job postings that
 
00:57:22.109 --> 00:57:22.119 align:start position:0%
than there were right before the
 
00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic and if you fall below then uh
 
00:57:27.630 --> 00:57:27.640 align:start position:0%
you have fewer job postings and what
 
00:57:31.390 --> 00:57:31.400 align:start position:0%
this shows is that in 2022 remember when
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
when the labor market was extremely hot
 
00:57:36.829 --> 00:57:36.839 align:start position:0%
everybody was looking for workers we had
 
00:57:40.789 --> 00:57:40.799 align:start position:0%
something like 50 to 60% higher job
 
00:57:43.789 --> 00:57:43.799 align:start position:0%
postings in the US compared to what we
 
00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
had before the pandemic that's what this
 
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
shows here now what about now so what
 
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
you see here is that we've seen since
 
00:57:51.789 --> 00:57:51.799 align:start position:0%
that peak in 20122 we've seen a downward
 
00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:53.799 align:start position:0%
Trend the number of job
 
00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
postings has been declining even though
 
00:57:58.150 --> 00:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
the level of it looks good if the level
 
00:58:00.789 --> 00:58:00.799 align:start position:0%
is above uh where we were before the
 
00:58:03.470 --> 00:58:03.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic the 100 line here so as long as
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
you're above that you still have more
 
00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:07.640 align:start position:0%
jobs more companies looking for workers
 
00:58:09.670 --> 00:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
than we had before the pandemic when we
 
00:58:11.230 --> 00:58:11.240 align:start position:0%
thought the labor market is really good
 
00:58:14.349 --> 00:58:14.359 align:start position:0%
you know in right January of 2020 we
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
thought that was a good economy people
 
00:58:19.309 --> 00:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
looking for workers uh and what you see
 
00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
here is that the levels look okay for
 
00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:24.440 align:start position:0%
the US in the BL line New Hampshire
 
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
looks better uh more job postings now
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
than we had before the pandemic but what
 
00:58:32.670 --> 00:58:32.680 align:start position:0%
about the trend the trend here is what
 
00:58:34.589 --> 00:58:34.599 align:start position:0%
is starting to worry some people here is
 
00:58:36.349 --> 00:58:36.359 align:start position:0%
that this is a downward Trend companies
 
00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:39.160 align:start position:0%
are recruiting fewel workers even though
 
00:58:42.190 --> 00:58:42.200 align:start position:0%
the level is relatively high it's not
 
00:58:44.789 --> 00:58:44.799 align:start position:0%
where we were a year ago or two years
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
ago in terms of recruiting efforts being
 
00:58:48.510 --> 00:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
made and number of job vacancies being
 
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
filled um Massachusetts is interesting
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
because Massachusetts represented by the
 
00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
red line here were below the 100
 
00:58:58.990 --> 00:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
uh Baseline which is this horizontal
 
00:59:00.510 --> 00:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
line here and we're below that New
 
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's above massach below meaning
 
00:59:04.829 --> 00:59:04.839 align:start position:0%
we have fewer job postings in
 
00:59:06.910 --> 00:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts now than we did right
 
00:59:09.069 --> 00:59:09.079 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic okay so that makes
 
00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
me as a as a massachusett resident here
 
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
thinking about our local economy that is
 
00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:14.480 align:start position:0%
definitely something that I would want
 
00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
to watch here um are we starting to see
 
00:59:19.549 --> 00:59:19.559 align:start position:0%
some weakening in the label Market uh
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
reflected in this in this trend so the
 
00:59:24.549 --> 00:59:24.559 align:start position:0%
the story there uh the way I summarize
 
00:59:26.589 --> 00:59:26.599 align:start position:0%
it is the levels look good we still have
 
00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
a strong labor market which is why uh
 
00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:32.510 align:start position:0%
a strong labor market which is why uh
the

00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:36.799 align:start position:0%
um uh strong labor market but the trends
 
00:59:38.829 --> 00:59:38.839 align:start position:0%
what's happening over the past year and
 
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
and if if we extrapolate into the next
 
00:59:42.190 --> 00:59:42.200 align:start position:0%
year that's where there's a little bit
 
00:59:44.349 --> 00:59:44.359 align:start position:0%
of a concern uh and that's reflected in
 
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
the fact that you know the FED has this
 
00:59:48.069 --> 00:59:48.079 align:start position:0%
active debate you know should we keep
 
00:59:49.870 --> 00:59:49.880 align:start position:0%
lowering rates because there are some
 
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
softening signs in the label market and
 
00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
so we should preemptively uh try and try
 
00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
and make sure that there there's 's not
 
00:59:57.910 --> 00:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
too much tightening in the in in mon
 
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
policy so lower rates or on the other
 
01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
hand the other side people who are more
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
hawkish might say look inflation is not
 
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
all the way down to two and we're seeing
 
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
some persistence in Services sectors and
 
01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
therefore rates should stay a higher a
 
01:00:13.829 --> 01:00:13.839 align:start position:0%
little longer so that's kind of the
 
01:00:15.549 --> 01:00:15.559 align:start position:0%
debate that you see playing out uh at
 
01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:19.640 align:start position:0%
the FED one more minute on projections
 
01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
and then I'll conclude here and these
 
01:00:24.589 --> 01:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
are my final uh
 
01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
slides uh
 
01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
these are kind of the most recent
 
01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:32.240 align:start position:0%
forecasts that I was able to uh access
 
01:00:34.349 --> 01:00:34.359 align:start position:0%
so this is now a little bit dated from
 
01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
November 2024 here but survey of
 
01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:37.630 align:start position:0%
November 2024 here but survey of
professional

01:00:37.630 --> 01:00:37.640 align:start position:0%
professional
 
01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
forecasters uh telling us what they
 
01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
think inflation will be and unemployment
 
01:00:45.789 --> 01:00:45.799 align:start position:0%
rate and GP growth will be in 2025 and
 
01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:49.240 align:start position:0%
2026 a quick remark here uh people use
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
the word soft Landing uh to talk about a
 
01:00:54.430 --> 01:00:54.440 align:start position:0%
scenario where we bring inflation rate
 
01:00:56.349 --> 01:00:56.359 align:start position:0%
all the way down to the fetch Target
 
01:00:58.029 --> 01:00:58.039 align:start position:0%
without triggering a recession so the
 
01:00:59.910 --> 01:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
economy stays robust employ employment
 
01:01:02.349 --> 01:01:02.359 align:start position:0%
stays strong and yet inflation comes all
 
01:01:05.190 --> 01:01:05.200 align:start position:0%
the way back down to the fetch Target
 
01:01:06.990 --> 01:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
which would be I think if if we're able
 
01:01:09.150 --> 01:01:09.160 align:start position:0%
to achieve that it would be remarkable
 
01:01:11.829 --> 01:01:11.839 align:start position:0%
um we that we bring inflation down from
 
01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
9% to 2% with no without paying an
 
01:01:17.589 --> 01:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
economic price without causing an
 
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
adverse outcome would be uh I think um
 
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
an achieve achievement and most most
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
economists think well that's what'll
 
01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
happen like look at this we're we're
 
01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:33.680 align:start position:0%
going to have 2% inflation maybe 2.2
 
01:01:35.829 --> 01:01:35.839 align:start position:0%
2.1 uh and unemployment rate is going to
 
01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
stay in low 4% range and GDP is going to
 
01:01:42.670 --> 01:01:42.680 align:start position:0%
keep growing at above 2% this is a soft
 
01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
Landing scenario and I think this just
 
01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
tells you how close we are to getting
 
01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
inflation back down to 2% the fed's
 
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
Target and and the unemployment rate the
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
employment picture as we just discussed
 
01:01:57.069 --> 01:01:57.079 align:start position:0%
looks good are there some trends that
 
01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
are potentially a cause for concern yes
 
01:02:00.309 --> 01:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
there are we talked about some of that
 
01:02:03.150 --> 01:02:03.160 align:start position:0%
just now but the levels are still good
 
01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:05.720 align:start position:0%
unemployment is still low and so
 
01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
projecting this out to this year and
 
01:02:11.029 --> 01:02:11.039 align:start position:0%
next year General consensus is that
 
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a soloft landing
 
01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
scenario I certainly hope this this is
 
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
what happens here uh and uh that seems
 
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
to be sort of the where the consensus is
 
01:02:24.430 --> 01:02:24.440 align:start position:0%
uh the risk is the the trends identified
 
01:02:26.269 --> 01:02:26.279 align:start position:0%
are there going to be some worse Trends
 
01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
in the label Market that we should watch
 
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh as as this fight against inflation
 
01:02:31.390 --> 01:02:31.400 align:start position:0%
continues so that's where the kind of
 
01:02:32.549 --> 01:02:32.559 align:start position:0%
the risk
 
01:02:35.029 --> 01:02:35.039 align:start position:0%
is thank you very much I've got two
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
quick questions
 
01:02:40.109 --> 01:02:40.119 align:start position:0%
on on what you just presented yes the
 
01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:44.680 align:start position:0%
first is on the um quit rate which seems
 
01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
to indicate that the gig economy is
 
01:02:52.029 --> 01:02:52.039 align:start position:0%
decreasing and job stability is in
 
01:02:55.150 --> 01:02:55.160 align:start position:0%
increasing is that an accurate analysis
 
01:02:56.950 --> 01:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
actually that that that is a little bit
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
different than how economists would
 
01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
interpret this data so quick word here
 
01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
quit rate is a number of people who are
 
01:03:05.630 --> 01:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
voluntarily departing from their
 
01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
employment as a fraction of total
 
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
employment so and and the higher this
 
01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
number is we think the stronger the
 
01:03:15.549 --> 01:03:15.559 align:start position:0%
labor market is this is voluntary
 
01:03:18.430 --> 01:03:18.440 align:start position:0%
departure from employment and so the
 
01:03:20.069 --> 01:03:20.079 align:start position:0%
stronger the labor market the better the
 
01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:21.880 align:start position:0%
job prospects and the more people are
 
01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
willing to switch I'm going to leave my
 
01:03:24.309 --> 01:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
current work here because I'm going to
 
01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
get a better offer 20% raise I'm going
 
01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
to take that job and people are willing
 
01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
to do that more when the job prospects
 
01:03:32.069 --> 01:03:32.079 align:start position:0%
are better and the economy is doing
 
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
better the fact that this is decreasing
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
in fact it's decreased quite a bit we're
 
01:03:38.309 --> 01:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
below the quit rate we had before the
 
01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:40.400 align:start position:0%
pandemic it's a source of concern that
 
01:03:42.430 --> 01:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
people are less willing to leave their
 
01:03:46.309 --> 01:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
jobs why what are they worried about are
 
01:03:48.990 --> 01:03:49.000 align:start position:0%
are their prospects not as good as they
 
01:03:51.230 --> 01:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
used to be that that's that's the uh
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
that the economist think about this this
 
01:03:56.029 --> 01:03:56.039 align:start position:0%
data the other question I had before
 
01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative uh um Edwards has a
 
01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:00.829 align:start position:0%
representative uh um Edwards has a
question

01:04:00.829 --> 01:04:00.839 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:04:03.269 --> 01:04:03.279 align:start position:0%
um when you you're talk about the tax
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
rate in
 
01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:07.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and the U profitability of
 
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
their businesses with New Hampshire
 
01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
beating Massachusetts and that is that
 
01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
related to the tax rate or is there any
 
01:04:19.069 --> 01:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
analysis on the the business tax uh
 
01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:21.160 align:start position:0%
environment and the two competiting uh
 
01:04:24.190 --> 01:04:24.200 align:start position:0%
competing states uh okay so so the the
 
01:04:26.069 --> 01:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
quick reference that I didn't cover here
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
to business taxes I was talking about
 
01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
the federal legislation I was talking
 
01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:32.279 align:start position:0%
about what might happen with the
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
incoming Administration I think there
 
01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:35.839 align:start position:0%
high priority is to extend the tax cuts
 
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:38.680 align:start position:0%
that were uh in the 2017 tax cups and
 
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
jobs act I think their high priority is
 
01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:42.760 align:start position:0%
to extend that going forward uh so that
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
that's an important factor as we think
 
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
about economic Outlook and inflation
 
01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:49.000 align:start position:0%
even so that that's what I focused on on
 
01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
there and one more question from
 
01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:52.990 align:start position:0%
there and one more question from
representative

01:04:52.990 --> 01:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
Ed thank thank you representative uh um
 
01:05:00.910 --> 01:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
I my committee often is confronted with
 
01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
the challenge of um folks coming in
 
01:05:06.510 --> 01:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
saying they have program issues due to
 
01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
the lack of Workforce
 
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
availability and and and we have some
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
very dull tools that we can apply uh
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
from government's perspective uh the key
 
01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
tool is to suggest that we are able to
 
01:05:24.069 --> 01:05:24.079 align:start position:0%
um add more money to their budget so
 
01:05:25.950 --> 01:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
that they can increase their wages in
 
01:05:28.390 --> 01:05:28.400 align:start position:0%
the hope of pulling out the employment
 
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
they need but uh as we do that I I I I'm
 
01:05:35.309 --> 01:05:35.319 align:start position:0%
always conflicted by the idea that our
 
01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortages are across the board
 
01:05:41.269 --> 01:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
you know we don't have uh in my
 
01:05:44.349 --> 01:05:44.359 align:start position:0%
perception some pool of laborers that
 
01:05:47.870 --> 01:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
can be changed over to go fit another
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
part of the economy and so I worry when
 
01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
we put more money into the wage bucket
 
01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
really we're not pulling out more labor
 
01:05:59.069 --> 01:05:59.079 align:start position:0%
we're really just creating a more
 
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:03.039 align:start position:0%
inflationary situation so so all of that
 
01:06:06.109 --> 01:06:06.119 align:start position:0%
is a very long way to to around to my
 
01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
question which is I I I really could use
 
01:06:12.910 --> 01:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
some more uh data around these kinds of
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
Workforce decisions and and I'm just
 
01:06:18.269 --> 01:06:18.279 align:start position:0%
curious in your experience do you think
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
data would exist that would help us make
 
01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:25.640 align:start position:0%
those decisions on yes or no will more
 
01:06:28.349 --> 01:06:28.359 align:start position:0%
money for higher salaries have a
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
positive influence in this
 
01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
micro sector of the economy and what
 
01:06:36.670 --> 01:06:36.680 align:start position:0%
kind of implications does it have for
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
the macro if we're just pulling Peter to
 
01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:41.720 align:start position:0%
go do another
 
01:06:45.150 --> 01:06:45.160 align:start position:0%
job okay so uh good good question there
 
01:06:49.309 --> 01:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
I think that is is a long-standing issue
 
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
in much of New England especially New
 
01:06:54.990 --> 01:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire perhaps uh my my starting
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
point in in that thought is yes as you
 
01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
were saying you might be able to do
 
01:07:02.029 --> 01:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
something targeting one industry but
 
01:07:03.390 --> 01:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
there there's a sort of deeper issue
 
01:07:05.269 --> 01:07:05.279 align:start position:0%
here which which is number of people in
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
the state um and that has to do with
 
01:07:10.029 --> 01:07:10.039 align:start position:0%
sort of deeper issues like immigration
 
01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
rates which I think you discussed
 
01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
yesterday uh birth rates in the State uh
 
01:07:17.630 --> 01:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
you know people staying after college
 
01:07:21.309 --> 01:07:21.319 align:start position:0%
and so on so those are the the basic
 
01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
issues in my mind that'll determine sort
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
of how uh employers are able to attract
 
01:07:29.950 --> 01:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
workers over the long term what specific
 
01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
policies will do um I don't have data on
 
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
that whe whether targeting specific
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
Industries with subsidies or or wage
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
support will uh what that will do and
 
01:07:39.630 --> 01:07:39.640 align:start position:0%
and how that might impact other
 
01:07:41.549 --> 01:07:41.559 align:start position:0%
industries that lose workers that's an
 
01:07:43.269 --> 01:07:43.279 align:start position:0%
interesting question that uh I I present
 
01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
One update on one last question
 
01:07:48.190 --> 01:07:48.200 align:start position:0%
representative and please give your name
 
01:07:49.829 --> 01:07:49.839 align:start position:0%
and use the
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
microphone thank you Mr chair and uh
 
01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um what
 
01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
do you see the impact be of the proposed
 
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
tariffs on the indicators and inflation
 
01:08:04.829 --> 01:08:04.839 align:start position:0%
that you presented okay so
 
01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
um short-term impacts and medium impacts
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
I I would think that if the tariffs were
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
to go into effect as have been mentioned
 
01:08:16.669 --> 01:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
for example something like 60% uh on
 
01:08:20.110 --> 01:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
everything from China uh 25% on
 
01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
everything from Canada and Mexico and
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
then 10 to 15% on everything else from
 
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
all other countries
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
um I so again so so with the comment
 
01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
that there are a lot of considerations
 
01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
going into tariff policy not purely
 
01:08:37.590 --> 01:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
economic I think geopolitical and other
 
01:08:38.749 --> 01:08:38.759 align:start position:0%
things are also part of the story there
 
01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
as well but I would expect them to be
 
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
inflationary I I would expect that uh
 
01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
some of the tariffs will have to be
 
01:08:48.030 --> 01:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
passed on to consumers in the form of
 
01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:51.759 align:start position:0%
higher prices uh and now
 
01:08:54.149 --> 01:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
the other side supporting TPS might say
 
01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
well we're going to raise all these
 
01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
revenues and we got all these revenues
 
01:08:58.990 --> 01:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
and they might uh be able to do things
 
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
with the revenues that could offset some
 
01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
of the impact perhaps that's true um I
 
01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
don't expect that offset to be full I
 
01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
think the impact of higher prices will
 
01:09:09.390 --> 01:09:09.400 align:start position:0%
be felt by consumers to what degree
 
01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:11.400 align:start position:0%
exactly depends a little bit on how much
 
01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
revenue is raised and what you do with
 
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
it but I would expect that on that it'll
 
01:09:17.309 --> 01:09:17.319 align:start position:0%
be a a positive factor on inflation
 
01:09:18.990 --> 01:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
which is uh something that the FED uh
 
01:09:20.749 --> 01:09:20.759 align:start position:0%
the FC is watching the FED is watching
 
01:09:23.309 --> 01:09:23.319 align:start position:0%
this because if this does go into effect
 
01:09:24.829 --> 01:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
uh it could complicate their inflation
 
01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
picture quite a bit so we'll see kind of
 
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
01:09:30.910 --> 01:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
there all right do you have anything
 
01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
else sir that is all I have thank you
 
01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:34.799 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair no thank you for your
 
01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
presentation it was clear and a reminder
 
01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
that uh the members of the committee can
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
get the oh I got one more question yes
 
01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
sir than you could you use the
 
01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
microphone over here sir and identify
 
01:09:48.789 --> 01:09:48.799 align:start position:0%
yourself hi representative Rich Neno
 
01:09:51.269 --> 01:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
from elstead one of the things that has
 
01:09:53.829 --> 01:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
bothered me with all of the economic
 
01:09:56.149 --> 01:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
projections that we've seen is how does
 
01:09:59.830 --> 01:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
the impact of uh immigration illegal and
 
01:10:02.149 --> 01:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
otherwise which numbers that range
 
01:10:04.669 --> 01:10:04.679 align:start position:0%
anywhere from you know 5 million to 12
 
01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
million some spectacular numbers impact
 
01:10:10.110 --> 01:10:10.120 align:start position:0%
all of these uh projections and I look
 
01:10:12.030 --> 01:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
at Massachusetts and some of the numbers
 
01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
there and say it's got to be some some
 
01:10:15.830 --> 01:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
impacts in what we're looking at in the
 
01:10:19.030 --> 01:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
numbers how are they factored in to all
 
01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
of these
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
projections um thank you yeah
 
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
immigration certainly impacts number of
 
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
workers we have and that that's the
 
01:10:29.669 --> 01:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
primary channel in which I think
 
01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:38.590 --> 01:10:38.600 align:start position:0%
um in terms of things like u in
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
inflation I think there are uh places
 
01:10:43.669 --> 01:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
where if there's a dramatic increase in
 
01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
the number of uh you know population uh
 
01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
growth that happens in a localized area
 
01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
how that impacts housing prices for
 
01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
example and other things could be
 
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
something that uh people look at I think
 
01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
in places outside the US for example
 
01:10:58.030 --> 01:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
Canada in some places in Canada certain
 
01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
cities have seen big inflow inflows of
 
01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
immigration that that have uh led to
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
dramatic uh changes in housing prices
 
01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
for example uh you know some major
 
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
cities in Canada I think have
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
experienced that uh I'm not sure about
 
01:11:11.950 --> 01:11:11.960 align:start position:0%
sort of how big that impact is in some
 
01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
of the numbers that are baked in here
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
this is at a sort of national level uh
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
and so um I think uh it's a hard sort of
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
tease out what the what the impact is
 
01:11:23.470 --> 01:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
from immigration versus other factors
 
01:11:25.790 --> 01:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
but I'll just leave it at kind of the
 
01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
higher level comment there again thank

come in speak with you at these
 
01:13:05.310 --> 01:13:05.320 align:start position:0%
briefings over the past several years as
 
01:13:07.149 --> 01:13:07.159 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for us to share what
 
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
we're hearing from our members across
 
01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
the state by way of background uh the
 
01:13:15.189 --> 01:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
Bia serves as New Hampshire's Statewide
 
01:13:16.990 --> 01:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
Chamber of Commerce and state
 
01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturing association we represent
 
01:13:22.669 --> 01:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
more than 400 employer members across
 
01:13:24.750 --> 01:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
the state from all industry sectors of
 
01:13:26.669 --> 01:13:26.679 align:start position:0%
all business business sizes those
 
01:13:28.950 --> 01:13:28.960 align:start position:0%
members collectively employ more than
 
01:13:31.390 --> 01:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
100,000 uh individuals and contribute
 
01:13:33.149 --> 01:13:33.159 align:start position:0%
more than 5 billion to our state's
 
01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
economy we also work very closely with a
 
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
network of more than 40 local and
 
01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
Regional Chambers of Commerce and dozens
 
01:13:43.709 --> 01:13:43.719 align:start position:0%
of Industry trade associations
 
01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
representing uh all facets of our
 
01:13:50.629 --> 01:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
economy um so we hear a lot from our
 
01:13:53.070 --> 01:13:53.080 align:start position:0%
members and stakeholders about economic
 
01:13:56.030 --> 01:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
conditions and we work hard to translate
 
01:13:58.070 --> 01:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
and provide you with input and insight
 
01:13:59.950 --> 01:13:59.960 align:start position:0%
into what that means and how we can make
 
01:14:02.830 --> 01:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
policy gains to support the growth of
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
our economy um I don't want to get into
 
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
too much detail I've been known to steal
 
01:14:08.590 --> 01:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
the Thunder of people that I'm
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
introducing so I don't want to do that
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
to n because I know he's got a lot of
 
01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
compelling information to share but I'll
 
01:14:16.189 --> 01:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
just say I think the the trends that
 
01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
we've spoken about in the last few years
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
remain uh very similar to what you're
 
01:14:23.950 --> 01:14:23.960 align:start position:0%
going to hear today overall New
 
01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's economy is performing quite
 
01:14:27.870 --> 01:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
well and quite strong especially
 
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
compared to our neighbors in the
 
01:14:32.430 --> 01:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
Northeast we do have some significant
 
01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
challenges however and I think what
 
01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
you'll hear from n and what you've
 
01:14:37.950 --> 01:14:37.960 align:start position:0%
already heard from other speakers and
 
01:14:40.430 --> 01:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
will hear from others that pain points
 
01:14:42.990 --> 01:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
around Workforce availability housing
 
01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
Supply child care and our regulatory
 
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
environment are all issues that are
 
01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
important for us to keep an eye on to
 
01:14:53.830 --> 01:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
work on and to ensure that New Hampshire
 
01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
uh remains economically
 
01:14:57.950 --> 01:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
competitive and I did want to preview
 
01:14:59.669 --> 01:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
that some of the data that's being
 
01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
shared today is being pulled from a new
 
01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
report that the Bia will be issuing over
 
01:15:06.990 --> 01:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
the next month called blueprint New
 
01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:09.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 2030 it's an economic
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
competitiveness report that the Bia
 
01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
commissioned uh utilizing a consultant
 
01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
that works with our peer organizations
 
01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
other state Chambers around the country
 
01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:21.560 align:start position:0%
and provides us with a overview of
 
01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
economic competitiveness of New
 
01:15:24.590 --> 01:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire compared to every other state
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
in the country so a really objective
 
01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
datadriven view of how we're competing
 
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
as a business climate compared to every
 
01:15:32.430 --> 01:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
other state in the country so you'll get
 
01:15:35.149 --> 01:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
a snapshot of that today um but we have
 
01:15:37.709 --> 01:15:37.719 align:start position:0%
more detail coming soon and we would
 
01:15:39.550 --> 01:15:39.560 align:start position:0%
pause it as an organization that that
 
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
comparison of State to- State business
 
01:15:44.189 --> 01:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
climate in terms of competitiveness is
 
01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:46.719 align:start position:0%
really the best way for us to approach
 
01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
these important issues and challenges
 
01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
how can we compete compared to not only
 
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
the states around us but states around
 
01:15:55.470 --> 01:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
the country on these important business
 
01:15:58.189 --> 01:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
climate metrics so with that thank you
 
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
again for the opportunity and invitation
 
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080 align:start position:0%

01:16:05.709 --> 01:16:05.719 align:start position:0%

you thank you Mike and uh thank you
 
01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
committee members for uh having us here
 
01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
today we really appreciate the
 
01:16:24.270 --> 01:16:24.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to give our perspective on
 
01:16:26.629 --> 01:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
uh new hampsh economy both now and kind
 
01:16:28.910 --> 01:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
of what we see over the next bium and
 
01:16:29.910 --> 01:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
into the
 
01:16:33.629 --> 01:16:33.639 align:start position:0%
future um as Mike mentioned we represent
 
01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:36.280 align:start position:0%
uh 400 plus uh member companies who
 
01:16:38.189 --> 01:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
employ over 100,000 people across the
 
01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire contributing more
 
01:16:41.629 --> 01:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
than 5 billion to the New Hampshire
 
01:16:45.510 --> 01:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
economy um and really one of our focuses
 
01:16:48.149 --> 01:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
our Prime focuses is uh the economic
 
01:16:50.870 --> 01:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
competitiveness of New Hampshire we look
 
01:16:52.629 --> 01:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
not only at a lot of the data that
 
01:16:54.669 --> 01:16:54.679 align:start position:0%
you've already seen um you'll see some
 
01:16:57.709 --> 01:16:57.719 align:start position:0%
of that in my presentation again today
 
01:17:01.229 --> 01:17:01.239 align:start position:0%
um but we also are very interested in um
 
01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
in looking at five and 10 years down the
 
01:17:04.189 --> 01:17:04.199 align:start position:0%
road and what's the economy going to
 
01:17:06.390 --> 01:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
look at what are our members saying are
 
01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
pain points for them and I don't think
 
01:17:09.709 --> 01:17:09.719 align:start position:0%
anything that I'm going to cover today
 
01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
is going to be surprising to you you're
 
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
going to hear uh Workforce availability
 
01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:14.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to hear about how that's
 
01:17:16.350 --> 01:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
connected to housing uh you're going to
 
01:17:18.149 --> 01:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
hear how that's connected to child care
 
01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
uh and and an aging um
 
01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
Workforce um so I do want to begin with
 
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh a uh survey of Business Leaders that
 
01:17:29.790 --> 01:17:29.800 align:start position:0%
we did uh back in I believe it was
 
01:17:33.709 --> 01:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
September or St A's did on behalf of us
 
01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
um we uh this was prior to the general
 
01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:39.350 align:start position:0%
um we uh this was prior to the general
election

01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
um obviously some of the focus has
 
01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
changed based on uh changes in
 
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
administration changes in uh federal
 
01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
policy you've heard that from uh number
 
01:17:52.830 --> 01:17:52.840 align:start position:0%
of speakers already um but as Mike said
 
01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
we we do expect and our in employers
 
01:17:58.189 --> 01:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
across the state expect to uh to grow
 
01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
business or business to remain stable
 
01:18:03.310 --> 01:18:03.320 align:start position:0%
throughout this coming year um they plan
 
01:18:06.629 --> 01:18:06.639 align:start position:0%
on hiring more employees over 59% said
 
01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
they were planning on some sort of
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
growth and when we ask them to identify
 
01:18:13.149 --> 01:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
their top priorities 86% identified
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
housing as a top priority um 68%
 
01:18:18.750 --> 01:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
identified child care as the next uh
 
01:18:20.510 --> 01:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
difficulty there are obviously ongoing
 
01:18:22.229 --> 01:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
concerns you've heard from us over the
 
01:18:24.110 --> 01:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
years on things like energy costs
 
01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
Healthcare cost C and other costs that
 
01:18:29.790 --> 01:18:29.800 align:start position:0%
um that businesses have
 
01:18:34.870 --> 01:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
faced uh overall uh we are According to
 
01:18:37.110 --> 01:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
some rankings sixth in the overall
 
01:18:39.149 --> 01:18:39.159 align:start position:0%
business tax climate uh that's an
 
01:18:41.709 --> 01:18:41.719 align:start position:0%
improvement from 2014 when we were at
 
01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
8th um you see that uh reflected in
 
01:18:48.709 --> 01:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
terms of you know how we end up in our
 
01:18:52.030 --> 01:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
competitiveness um and uh what ends up
 
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
happening or our hope is that New
 
01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire becomes more attractive for
 
01:18:57.390 --> 01:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
businesses to relocate especially from
 
01:18:59.110 --> 01:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
the surrounding New England um we've
 
01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
seen that in the news over the past
 
01:19:03.390 --> 01:19:03.400 align:start position:0%
couple weeks um uh at least one large
 
01:19:05.550 --> 01:19:05.560 align:start position:0%
business has has relocated and we're
 
01:19:08.709 --> 01:19:08.719 align:start position:0%
certainly hopeful to continue that Trend
 
01:19:11.790 --> 01:19:11.800 align:start position:0%
um and make uh or keep New Hampshire as
 
01:19:14.430 --> 01:19:14.440 align:start position:0%
competitive as it is uh and make it more
 
01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:15.990 align:start position:0%
competitive as it is uh and make it more
competitive

01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
01:19:18.870 --> 01:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
um we also uh you know I think it's
 
01:19:21.070 --> 01:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
really important to look at um
 
01:19:24.390 --> 01:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
population growth uh both across the
 
01:19:25.870 --> 01:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
United United States as well as the New
 
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
England area um we've seen a higher
 
01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
population growth in New Hampshire since
 
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
2020 other than in Maine Maine has
 
01:19:38.430 --> 01:19:38.440 align:start position:0%
attracted uh a large uh number of uh new
 
01:19:41.669 --> 01:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
um people from across the United States
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
internationally um and uh what we've
 
01:19:48.510 --> 01:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
seen is that's different than
 
01:19:50.830 --> 01:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts we've seen a lot of
 
01:19:52.750 --> 01:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
migration out of Massachusetts to New
 
01:19:55.110 --> 01:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's pretty traditional
 
01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
um but we've also been attractive to
 
01:20:00.390 --> 01:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
people from other states that have shed
 
01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
uh shed uh residents as well places like
 
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
California um uh places like uh the
 
01:20:10.590 --> 01:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
Midwest a lot of them have looked at New
 
01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire relocated to us over the past
 
01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh few years um and we we've seen a
 
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
little bit of a shift in where those
 
01:20:22.709 --> 01:20:22.719 align:start position:0%
imig immigrants are coming from
 
01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
traditionally we've been attractive to
 
01:20:26.430 --> 01:20:26.440 align:start position:0%
other New England states more populous
 
01:20:28.430 --> 01:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
New England states um but we've seen
 
01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
that shift to more of a national Focus
 
01:20:35.070 --> 01:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
uh over the past um half a decade or so
 
01:20:37.790 --> 01:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
um proportionately we've seen more
 
01:20:42.030 --> 01:20:42.040 align:start position:0%
people in the 30 to 44 uh year age uh as
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
well as 60 plus um uh since
 
01:20:51.390 --> 01:20:51.400 align:start position:0%
2020 um we uh obviously one of the
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
focuses of businesses is to attract the
 
01:20:54.990 --> 01:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
prime working age so we're we're we're
 
01:20:58.590 --> 01:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
talking here really 20 to 55 um so we're
 
01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:01.000 align:start position:0%
happy to see the shift um we're seeing
 
01:21:04.350 --> 01:21:04.360 align:start position:0%
more people in that 30 to 44 uh age
 
01:21:06.550 --> 01:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
group um and
 
01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
that additional availability of prime
 
01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
working age has made it possible for
 
01:21:16.510 --> 01:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
businesses to hire more people um and
 
01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:18.639 align:start position:0%
hire more people within that that age
 
01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
rank so we are currently 13th on prime
 
01:21:25.310 --> 01:21:25.320 align:start position:0%
age population um
 
01:21:27.790 --> 01:21:27.800 align:start position:0%
uh by state that's higher than uh the
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
average which is 1.4 uh% ours uh our
 
01:21:35.149 --> 01:21:35.159 align:start position:0%
change was 3.2% so we are attracting a
 
01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
higher proportion of prime age worker or
 
01:21:40.590 --> 01:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
prime age individuals working age
 
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
individuals than um most other states at
 
01:21:47.310 --> 01:21:47.320 align:start position:0%
this point in time um we have looked at
 
01:21:49.149 --> 01:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
some of the projected distribution of
 
01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
populations to 2050 um one of the
 
01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
interesting things here uh that we've
 
01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:55.070 align:start position:0%
interesting things here uh that we've
seen

01:21:55.070 --> 01:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
seen
 
01:21:57.870 --> 01:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
is that sort of unsurprisingly uh
 
01:21:59.750 --> 01:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
Southeastern New Hampshire is likely to
 
01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
see the largest population growth um
 
01:22:04.750 --> 01:22:04.760 align:start position:0%
with 240 expected to be the peak
 
01:22:06.830 --> 01:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
population numbers with a sort of uneven
 
01:22:10.629 --> 01:22:10.639 align:start position:0%
loss following um in traditionally rural
 
01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
counties we're talking about Coos County
 
01:22:15.310 --> 01:22:15.320 align:start position:0%
uh Sullivan County uh we're likely to
 
01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
see uh continued population uh loss
 
01:22:21.790 --> 01:22:21.800 align:start position:0%
based on what uh we've seen
 
01:22:23.950 --> 01:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
traditionally um and we've seen growth
 
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh in Hills bro Rockingham and marac in
 
01:22:30.189 --> 01:22:30.199 align:start position:0%
particular um although uh up to sort of
 
01:22:32.510 --> 01:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
the Conway area um we have some good
 
01:22:34.430 --> 01:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
data that that's attracting a number of
 
01:22:38.910 --> 01:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
new migrants as well um we've already I
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
think you've already seen from others uh
 
01:22:43.709 --> 01:22:43.719 align:start position:0%
so I won't really I won't go into it but
 
01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
you've seen from others that um we do
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
have a a declining uh birth rate here so
 
01:22:50.669 --> 01:22:50.679 align:start position:0%
our population growth is really
 
01:22:53.430 --> 01:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
dependent on uh migration from
 
01:22:55.550 --> 01:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in terms of business
 
01:22:58.830 --> 01:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
formations uh since 2020 um we are
 
01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
ranking 18th uh we've had uh six
 
01:23:06.629 --> 01:23:06.639 align:start position:0%
62.6% increase in building uh uh in
 
01:23:09.709 --> 01:23:09.719 align:start position:0%
business formations now I want to note
 
01:23:12.030 --> 01:23:12.040 align:start position:0%
uh just for the record here that there
 
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
are some states like Delaware that have
 
01:23:16.870 --> 01:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
traditionally been the source of
 
01:23:18.350 --> 01:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
business formations but they don't
 
01:23:20.590 --> 01:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
actually have workers off in the
 
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
headquarters of Delaware but um
 
01:23:25.430 --> 01:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
realistically all the workers are in
 
01:23:29.189 --> 01:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
other states um so uh that's just
 
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
something I want to flag here because
 
01:23:33.229 --> 01:23:33.239 align:start position:0%
what we see in New Hampshire is that
 
01:23:35.470 --> 01:23:35.480 align:start position:0%
often when businesses are formed here we
 
01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
actually have employees here we have
 
01:23:38.629 --> 01:23:38.639 align:start position:0%
people running those
 
01:23:41.629 --> 01:23:41.639 align:start position:0%
companies um and that's that just speaks
 
01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
workability in terms of uh Advanced
 
01:23:50.310 --> 01:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
industry jobs uh we've seen a pretty
 
01:23:53.350 --> 01:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
significant growth um that has occurred
 
01:23:57.149 --> 01:23:57.159 align:start position:0%
uh in uh various States um throughout
 
01:24:01.629 --> 01:24:01.639 align:start position:0%
the nation um we've seen a 10.3% gain in
 
01:24:04.270 --> 01:24:04.280 align:start position:0%
advanced industry jobs uh compared to an
 
01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
average of 9.4% uh
 
01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
Nationwide only Maine and Rhode Island
 
01:24:12.910 --> 01:24:12.920 align:start position:0%
outrank Us in the New England area um so
 
01:24:15.790 --> 01:24:15.800 align:start position:0%
as industry is looking at places to come
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
um one of the things we see as a trend
 
01:24:21.310 --> 01:24:21.320 align:start position:0%
generally is if you have um uh industry
 
01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
startups uh new ideas coming out of uh
 
01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
one state um you get Innovative
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
individuals coming here they think of
 
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
their own ideas they form their own
 
01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
companies um and Branch out um so we're
 
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
really focused on keeping that um
 
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
competitive Advantage as well uh we are
 
01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
we are 15th in the tech industry growth
 
01:24:46.149 --> 01:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
since 2018 and we've seen a 14.5%
 
01:24:49.390 --> 01:24:49.400 align:start position:0%
increase in jobs uh as compared to a
 
01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
12.88% um average Nationwide um
 
01:24:55.390 --> 01:24:55.400 align:start position:0%
unsurprisingly you'll see the
 
01:24:58.950 --> 01:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
traditional Tech heavy States um as well
 
01:25:01.189 --> 01:25:01.199 align:start position:0%
as uh some of their surrounding states
 
01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:04.360 align:start position:0%
have attracted a higher uh percentage of
 
01:25:08.109 --> 01:25:08.119 align:start position:0%
growth than we have uh so um you know
 
01:25:10.990 --> 01:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
Nevada uh is one of the ones that is
 
01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
really um seen a lot of migration from
 
01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
California for instance um and so we're
 
01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
really focused on uh New England growth
 
01:25:23.790 --> 01:25:23.800 align:start position:0%
uh we're happy to happy to see that we
 
01:25:27.030 --> 01:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
are among the most competitive in New
 
01:25:29.790 --> 01:25:29.800 align:start position:0%
England for that um certainly we have a
 
01:25:34.189 --> 01:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
number of sort of feeder uh universities
 
01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
uh to the south of us um that really
 
01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
promote a lot of that we're happy that
 
01:25:41.189 --> 01:25:41.199 align:start position:0%
the uh graduates from those universities
 
01:25:43.109 --> 01:25:43.119 align:start position:0%
want to stay in the New England area and
 
01:25:44.830 --> 01:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
that they chose choose New Hampshire to
 
01:25:48.590 --> 01:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
come and and uh and support our burining
 
01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:49.790 align:start position:0%
come and and uh and support our burining
tech

01:25:49.790 --> 01:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
tech
 
01:25:52.750 --> 01:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
industry in terms of innovation scores
 
01:25:55.149 --> 01:25:55.159 align:start position:0%
uh we are 11th best
 
01:25:58.070 --> 01:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
um uh but uh much of New England as well
 
01:25:59.870 --> 01:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
as New York are also in the highest
 
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
third um so I just want to point that
 
01:26:03.790 --> 01:26:03.800 align:start position:0%
out as
 
01:26:08.149 --> 01:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
well um one of the things that is of a
 
01:26:10.830 --> 01:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
bit of a concern is our GDP per capita
 
01:26:12.990 --> 01:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
is below the national average of
 
01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.870 align:start position:0%
is below the national average of
$66,872

01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:21.719 align:start position:0%
uh 86 um so we're not far behind the
 
01:26:23.669 --> 01:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
national average um but that is
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
something of concern um that we just
 
01:26:28.669 --> 01:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
01:26:31.390 --> 01:26:31.400 align:start position:0%
note um and I just wanted to give you a
 
01:26:33.950 --> 01:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
little bit more detail here of US versus
 
01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh Nationwide uh and that change of uh
 
01:26:39.390 --> 01:26:39.400 align:start position:0%
per capita growth um United States
 
01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
overall 88.7% New Hampshire 8% uh since
 
01:26:48.229 --> 01:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
2018 um obviously with the
 
01:26:52.030 --> 01:26:52.040 align:start position:0%
um recession that occurred briefly in uh
 
01:26:55.109 --> 01:26:55.119 align:start position:0%
2020 uh our hope is that uh the economy
 
01:26:57.790 --> 01:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
would accelerate a bit more than it has
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
um but that being said we are in a
 
01:27:02.229 --> 01:27:02.239 align:start position:0%
strong economic position um we
 
01:27:04.390 --> 01:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
anticipate continued growth uh we
 
01:27:07.109 --> 01:27:07.119 align:start position:0%
anticipate that New Hampshire has
 
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
advantages that other states do not have
 
01:27:13.390 --> 01:27:13.400 align:start position:0%
uh and just to mention uh or give you I
 
01:27:15.109 --> 01:27:15.119 align:start position:0%
guess kind of an overall picture of our
 
01:27:16.990 --> 01:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
economy we have a very Diversified
 
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
economy um so manufacturing is about 10%
 
01:27:23.550 --> 01:27:23.560 align:start position:0%
uh that's the small uh kind of red
 
01:27:26.590 --> 01:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
sliver the top right hand uh that's 10%
 
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
of our employment in the state and you
 
01:27:30.990 --> 01:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
can see we have a pretty Diversified
 
01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
economy we're not focused overly in one
 
01:27:38.109 --> 01:27:38.119 align:start position:0%
area um that being said we do have some
 
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
um some areas of State support that
 
01:27:45.189 --> 01:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
really um focus a lot of our economy so
 
01:27:47.109 --> 01:27:47.119 align:start position:0%
for example travel and tourism is very
 
01:27:49.830 --> 01:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
important uh to both our our members as
 
01:27:51.990 --> 01:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
well as uh providing revenues for the
 
01:27:54.910 --> 01:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
state um support a lot of things within
 
01:27:58.590 --> 01:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
the retail uh and Food Service uh you
 
01:28:02.350 --> 01:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
know hotels Etc um in terms of what
 
01:28:06.310 --> 01:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
we've seen growing over the past uh few
 
01:28:08.510 --> 01:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
years um we've seen construction
 
01:28:10.830 --> 01:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
increase that's shouldn't be surprising
 
01:28:12.510 --> 01:28:12.520 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of focus particularly
 
01:28:15.550 --> 01:28:15.560 align:start position:0%
in the legislature on changing some of
 
01:28:18.669 --> 01:28:18.679 align:start position:0%
the uh land use rules land use statutes
 
01:28:20.590 --> 01:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
that have propelled some additional
 
01:28:22.350 --> 01:28:22.360 align:start position:0%
Construction in the state we've also
 
01:28:24.750 --> 01:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
seen just natural demand and for more
 
01:28:27.030 --> 01:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
housing result and more construction
 
01:28:30.030 --> 01:28:30.040 align:start position:0%
naturally that leads to uh more people
 
01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
in the construction industry more jobs
 
01:28:33.910 --> 01:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
being posted there we've also seen
 
01:28:36.030 --> 01:28:36.040 align:start position:0%
professional Technical Services increase
 
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh significantly as well um one of the
 
01:28:42.149 --> 01:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
uh interesting statistics that I saw um
 
01:28:46.070 --> 01:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
coming out of the really shift to remote
 
01:28:48.070 --> 01:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
work is not only are a number of
 
01:28:49.790 --> 01:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
companies now offering remote work as
 
01:28:51.750 --> 01:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
compared to prior to
 
01:28:55.229 --> 01:28:55.239 align:start position:0%
2020 um at least in and many of them are
 
01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
offering part-time hybrid at the very
 
01:29:00.910 --> 01:29:00.920 align:start position:0%
least um and that has had some um knock
 
01:29:03.790 --> 01:29:03.800 align:start position:0%
on effects but it's also meant that
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
um companies that have have been able to
 
01:29:08.270 --> 01:29:08.280 align:start position:0%
expand their Workforce without also
 
01:29:10.270 --> 01:29:10.280 align:start position:0%
expanding their footprint um so they've
 
01:29:12.629 --> 01:29:12.639 align:start position:0%
done things like um having people come
 
01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
in uh one week and then have one week
 
01:29:16.629 --> 01:29:16.639 align:start position:0%
remote and then they've been able to
 
01:29:18.109 --> 01:29:18.119 align:start position:0%
expand and kind of shift that so they
 
01:29:21.229 --> 01:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
have a second shift coming in week two
 
01:29:23.550 --> 01:29:23.560 align:start position:0%
um and then week uh the next week they
 
01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
are uh off so there's been some cost
 
01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
savings there uh for businesses as
 
01:29:32.189 --> 01:29:32.199 align:start position:0%
they've looked at expanding their
 
01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
Workforce just a quick uh snapshot of of
 
01:29:37.709 --> 01:29:37.719 align:start position:0%
jobs um and I believe you've already
 
01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
seen this from New Hampshire employment
 
01:29:41.669 --> 01:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
uh security
 
01:29:46.030 --> 01:29:46.040 align:start position:0%
um uh where I just wanted to show you um
 
01:29:49.390 --> 01:29:49.400 align:start position:0%
that we've increased uh total non-farm
 
01:29:54.790 --> 01:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
payroll jobs um by 9,300 or 1.3%
 
01:29:59.590 --> 01:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh from last year uh June to June that
 
01:30:02.790 --> 01:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
is a that is a drop um from the prior
 
01:30:05.830 --> 01:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
year 2.6% increase um so that's
 
01:30:07.950 --> 01:30:07.960 align:start position:0%
something uh that I know a number of of
 
01:30:09.750 --> 01:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
presenters already have indicated that
 
01:30:11.750 --> 01:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
we want to keep an eye on we've seen
 
01:30:13.990 --> 01:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
private education Health Services really
 
01:30:17.350 --> 01:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
lead in terms of the uh overall number
 
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
of jobs that have been added to New
 
01:30:22.709 --> 01:30:22.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's economy um so we want to
 
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind now one of the things
 
01:30:26.750 --> 01:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
that we're keeping a close eye on is
 
01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
labor force participation rate uh we are
 
01:30:29.440 --> 01:30:30.790 align:start position:0%
labor force participation rate uh we are
currently

01:30:30.790 --> 01:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:30:35.910 --> 01:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
13th uh we have uh 6 65.1% participation
 
01:30:38.990 --> 01:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
rate compared to a a uh
 
01:30:43.270 --> 01:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
62.6% uh average rate um and
 
01:30:43.280 --> 01:30:44.830 align:start position:0%
62.6% uh average rate um and
that's

01:30:44.830 --> 01:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:30:48.950 --> 01:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
not entirely surprising um we do have as
 
01:30:52.470 --> 01:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
has been mentioned previously a higher
 
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
uh percentage of retirement age
 
01:30:57.149 --> 01:30:57.159 align:start position:0%
individuals in the state um than many
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
other states so um the fact that we are
 
01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
not uh we don't have as large a
 
01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
percentage of our population in the
 
01:31:08.430 --> 01:31:08.440 align:start position:0%
workforce is not
 
01:31:11.189 --> 01:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
surprising um but that said it is
 
01:31:13.709 --> 01:31:13.719 align:start position:0%
important to look at the decrease in
 
01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
Workforce participation since 2020 to
 
01:31:20.030 --> 01:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
see what we can find out uh so National
 
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
us chamber uh statistics show that
 
01:31:25.109 --> 01:31:25.119 align:start position:0%
they're 1.7 million fewer Americans in
 
01:31:28.350 --> 01:31:28.360 align:start position:0%
the workforce compared to February 20 uh
 
01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
20 um and in New Hampshire even though
 
01:31:34.430 --> 01:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
our population increased by about 17,700
 
01:31:38.590 --> 01:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
people we saw a total decline of 7,800
 
01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
people in the
 
01:31:43.229 --> 01:31:43.239 align:start position:0%
workforce digging into that data um
 
01:31:44.910 --> 01:31:44.920 align:start position:0%
we've seen a Workforce population
 
01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
decline uh within the prime working age
 
01:31:49.790 --> 01:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
is really one one of the major things
 
01:31:52.229 --> 01:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
and that's certainly a concern um to
 
01:31:54.510 --> 01:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
employers across the state
 
01:31:58.149 --> 01:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
um we and one of the the area in
 
01:32:02.189 --> 01:32:02.199 align:start position:0%
particular that we've seen increase in
 
01:32:07.350 --> 01:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
um decline of popula and decline of
 
01:32:09.870 --> 01:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
participation is the people who are
 
01:32:11.229 --> 01:32:11.239 align:start position:0%
saying they're taking care of the house
 
01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:14.239 align:start position:0%
or family um it's the largest and it's a
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
growing block of of individuals not
 
01:32:19.950 --> 01:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
participating in the workforce um to the
 
01:32:21.669 --> 01:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
best of our ability digging down into
 
01:32:23.950 --> 01:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
that data we've really seen that this is
 
01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
is due to child care Avail availability
 
01:32:28.830 --> 01:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
well certainly some of those individuals
 
01:32:31.390 --> 01:32:31.400 align:start position:0%
you know have uh new children they
 
01:32:34.109 --> 01:32:34.119 align:start position:0%
voluntarily stay out of the workforce um
 
01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
what we've heard both anecdotally and in
 
01:32:39.629 --> 01:32:39.639 align:start position:0%
the data from Members is that um just
 
01:32:41.629 --> 01:32:41.639 align:start position:0%
the availability of options for child
 
01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
care has kept people out of the
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
workforce um so um just quickly
 
01:32:49.149 --> 01:32:49.159 align:start position:0%
anecdotally um you know we've heard from
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
some members who have said they've had
 
01:32:55.310 --> 01:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
anyone from new hires to to Executives
 
01:32:58.229 --> 01:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
um who have had their first child um
 
01:33:00.030 --> 01:33:00.040 align:start position:0%
they and their spouse have been put on
 
01:33:03.669 --> 01:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
waiting lists for child care um baby
 
01:33:06.550 --> 01:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
comes 9 months later and they never get
 
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
off the the uh the weight list there's
 
01:33:13.070 --> 01:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
no option uh for them to you know do
 
01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
something else with the baby um so
 
01:33:18.189 --> 01:33:18.199 align:start position:0%
ultimately one of those uh parents has
 
01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
to stay home uh you know that's
 
01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
obviously a family choice for who that
 
01:33:25.709 --> 01:33:25.719 align:start position:0%
is but we've heard from again anyone
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
from entry level to Executives so you're
 
01:33:30.109 --> 01:33:30.119 align:start position:0%
taking you know highly skilled workers
 
01:33:32.590 --> 01:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
out of the workforce um to care for a
 
01:33:36.189 --> 01:33:36.199 align:start position:0%
child um simply because there is not uh
 
01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
availability um what we've seen in terms
 
01:33:41.669 --> 01:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
of child care providers across the state
 
01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
is there's been a closure uh an
 
01:33:47.189 --> 01:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
increased closure rate since 2019 that's
 
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
increased distances um so there are
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
fewer options for parents um they have
 
01:33:53.870 --> 01:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
to drive further um which really
 
01:33:55.310 --> 01:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
istically means we're taking more people
 
01:33:57.709 --> 01:33:57.719 align:start position:0%
out of the workforce because further
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
isn't necessary an option um because New
 
01:34:03.070 --> 01:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is such a small state we don't
 
01:34:05.109 --> 01:34:05.119 align:start position:0%
have any good data New Hampshire
 
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
specific data on what the effect is on
 
01:34:09.470 --> 01:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
the economy as far as we've been able to
 
01:34:12.830 --> 01:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
find um but we do have data from the US
 
01:34:15.070 --> 01:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
Chamber of Commerce Foundation um that
 
01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
looked at some larger states that say
 
01:34:18.910 --> 01:34:18.920 align:start position:0%
you know this is this is a billion
 
01:34:22.109 --> 01:34:22.119 align:start position:0%
dollar problem uh Across the Nation we
 
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
can imagine um you know scaling that
 
01:34:27.950 --> 01:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
down to New Hampshire that uh that it's
 
01:34:31.590 --> 01:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
a problem here as well
 
01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
um what we also want to point out is um
 
01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
there have been some legislative changes
 
01:34:39.709 --> 01:34:39.719 align:start position:0%
over the past couple years um in
 
01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
particular last year homebased child
 
01:34:46.109 --> 01:34:46.119 align:start position:0%
care providers uh the statutes related
 
01:34:50.790 --> 01:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
to them um changed so that they the
 
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
number of children they can care for is
 
01:34:57.709 --> 01:34:57.719 align:start position:0%
now regulated by DHHS rather than by
 
01:35:01.149 --> 01:35:01.159 align:start position:0%
um necessarily by uh
 
01:35:03.629 --> 01:35:03.639 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh generally speaking
 
01:35:05.709 --> 01:35:05.719 align:start position:0%
that has allowed one additional child to
 
01:35:09.350 --> 01:35:09.360 align:start position:0%
be cared for um per provider um so we
 
01:35:12.189 --> 01:35:12.199 align:start position:0%
have seen some increase because of
 
01:35:16.350 --> 01:35:16.360 align:start position:0%
policy changes uh at the state level um
 
01:35:20.350 --> 01:35:20.360 align:start position:0%
we've also seen uh a shift in the market
 
01:35:24.149 --> 01:35:24.159 align:start position:0%
um as other policies have changed uh
 
01:35:27.910 --> 01:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
to change how uh eligibility for the
 
01:35:30.669 --> 01:35:30.679 align:start position:0%
child care uh scholarship fund as well
 
01:35:33.990 --> 01:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
as changes uh on a not an attendance
 
01:35:36.790 --> 01:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
basis but an enrol e basis so that um
 
01:35:39.870 --> 01:35:39.880 align:start position:0%
providers uh can rely on what their
 
01:35:41.950 --> 01:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
income is and then base their business
 
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
model based on that so we have we've
 
01:35:46.390 --> 01:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
made childcare more attractive for new
 
01:35:48.590 --> 01:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
providers and for existing
 
01:35:50.709 --> 01:35:50.719 align:start position:0%
providers um but there are certainly
 
01:35:52.830 --> 01:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
still uh policy changes that could be
 
01:35:56.270 --> 01:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
made that would increase um those
 
01:35:58.229 --> 01:35:58.239 align:start position:0%
numbers I hope none of you ask me
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
questions about what those policy
 
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
changes could be because at this time
 
01:36:02.669 --> 01:36:02.679 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite sure but I will do some
 
01:36:06.669 --> 01:36:06.679 align:start position:0%
research to get back to you
 
01:36:09.510 --> 01:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
um the uh in terms of a cost of Business
 
01:36:11.830 --> 01:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
ranking um this is from
 
01:36:15.750 --> 01:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
2023 uh New Hampshire has uh increased
 
01:36:20.229 --> 01:36:20.239 align:start position:0%
our cost of of doing business um and the
 
01:36:24.189 --> 01:36:24.199 align:start position:0%
cost uh for employers to uh to actually
 
01:36:26.550 --> 01:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
engage in business um I'm going to talk
 
01:36:29.189 --> 01:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
about some of those cost specifically um
 
01:36:30.310 --> 01:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
some of that's going to relate to what
 
01:36:34.109 --> 01:36:34.119 align:start position:0%
I've already said um some of those
 
01:36:36.990 --> 01:36:37.000 align:start position:0%
include uh you know things like uh as
 
01:36:39.229 --> 01:36:39.239 align:start position:0%
employers look at the availability of
 
01:36:41.189 --> 01:36:41.199 align:start position:0%
child care and look at the cost of child
 
01:36:43.149 --> 01:36:43.159 align:start position:0%
care I think the statistic came out I
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
think it was last month that in New
 
01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for a family that has a
 
01:36:47.870 --> 01:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
one-year-old and a four-year-old in
 
01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
child care was something like3 or
 
01:36:52.750 --> 01:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
$35,000 a year for that for that child
 
01:36:55.750 --> 01:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
care that's obviously going to affect um
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
employees decisions about where to work
 
01:37:01.310 --> 01:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
um as well as their their requests for
 
01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
compensation um and when we dig into the
 
01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
data at even the county level we see um
 
01:37:09.189 --> 01:37:09.199 align:start position:0%
that we have a uh higher cost for
 
01:37:11.590 --> 01:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
employers per hour worked for wages and
 
01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
benefits than elsewhere in New England
 
01:37:17.629 --> 01:37:17.639 align:start position:0%
and um elsewhere in the United States um
 
01:37:20.790 --> 01:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
and we have some good uh breakdown of
 
01:37:23.669 --> 01:37:23.679 align:start position:0%
that um obviously one of the big factors
 
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
is wages and one of those big wage
 
01:37:28.629 --> 01:37:28.639 align:start position:0%
factors goes into it is the cost of
 
01:37:30.910 --> 01:37:30.920 align:start position:0%
shelter um that's something I know
 
01:37:32.310 --> 01:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
you've already heard about but I do want
 
01:37:33.990 --> 01:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
to go into that a little bit today
 
01:37:37.189 --> 01:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
because it is um it is a contributing
 
01:37:39.629 --> 01:37:39.639 align:start position:0%
factor for people who are already secure
 
01:37:41.149 --> 01:37:41.159 align:start position:0%
in their housing they already own their
 
01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
house they have a fixed uh mortgage rate
 
01:37:45.390 --> 01:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
this doesn't affect them if they're
 
01:37:47.470 --> 01:37:47.480 align:start position:0%
working within kind of the reasonable
 
01:37:50.109 --> 01:37:50.119 align:start position:0%
driving distance um but for people who
 
01:37:54.149 --> 01:37:54.159 align:start position:0%
are uh you know looking for uh to Mo to
 
01:37:58.030 --> 01:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
move in order to um fill a job that is
 
01:38:00.790 --> 01:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
having a serious effect on both their
 
01:38:02.229 --> 01:38:02.239 align:start position:0%
ability to do that because of the
 
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
availability of housing as well as
 
01:38:05.950 --> 01:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
discussion with employers about what
 
01:38:08.229 --> 01:38:08.239 align:start position:0%
wages are are
 
01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate um you know wages obviously
 
01:38:13.950 --> 01:38:13.960 align:start position:0%
have to have to approximate the cost of
 
01:38:15.709 --> 01:38:15.719 align:start position:0%
living for employees otherwise people
 
01:38:16.990 --> 01:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
aren't going to take the
 
01:38:21.470 --> 01:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
jobs um and we see that many of the same
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh costs are going to affect both
 
01:38:25.750 --> 01:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
business and employees so energy costs
 
01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:28.679 align:start position:0%
for example um health care costs those
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
those have a pretty clear effect across
 
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
the board um one thing that I think
 
01:38:34.750 --> 01:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
people are becoming more aware of is
 
01:38:37.589 --> 01:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
that housing costs are as
 
01:38:41.149 --> 01:38:41.159 align:start position:0%
well um so we've seen a 59% increase in
 
01:38:43.790 --> 01:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire since quarter 1 of 2020 to
 
01:38:45.109 --> 01:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
quarter 4 of
 
01:38:50.830 --> 01:38:50.840 align:start position:0%
2023 that's higher now um and uh you
 
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
know the uh National Association of
 
01:38:56.109 --> 01:38:56.119 align:start position:0%
Realtors came out with some good data
 
01:38:59.830 --> 01:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
yesterday um and I do want to um just
 
01:39:03.310 --> 01:39:03.320 align:start position:0%
read this to you um because I think it's
 
01:39:05.709 --> 01:39:05.719 align:start position:0%
important uh monthly home payments on
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
starter homes have risen the most in New
 
01:39:10.030 --> 01:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire of all states um they've
 
01:39:12.750 --> 01:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
surged 164% since
 
01:39:15.470 --> 01:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
2019 that's as of the most recent data
 
01:39:17.030 --> 01:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
from the National Association of
 
01:39:19.109 --> 01:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
Realtors typical monthly mortgage
 
01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
payments for a starter home in New
 
01:39:23.589 --> 01:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is now $2,600 assuming a 10%
 
01:39:25.589 --> 01:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
down payment which is the most common uh
 
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
down payment size uh that would require
 
01:39:30.350 --> 01:39:30.360 align:start position:0%
an income of
 
01:39:34.030 --> 01:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
$13,900 $85 to be considered affordable
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
that's for the lowest quarter lowest uh
 
01:39:39.709 --> 01:39:39.719 align:start position:0%
quarter priced of houses so I I backed
 
01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
into the numbers last night um because
 
01:39:44.830 --> 01:39:44.840 align:start position:0%
one of the slides you'll see from the
 
01:39:47.790 --> 01:39:47.800 align:start position:0%
Realtors um or have seen from the
 
01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:50.719 align:start position:0%
Realtors is the average home price uh
 
01:39:53.550 --> 01:39:53.560 align:start position:0%
which is about $563,000
 
01:39:57.790 --> 01:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
now um average interest rates are
 
01:40:00.149 --> 01:40:00.159 align:start position:0%
6.93% um one of the important things
 
01:40:01.709 --> 01:40:01.719 align:start position:0%
because we are in New Hampshire to talk
 
01:40:03.790 --> 01:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
about is the average property tax which
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
is a little bit over
 
01:40:08.109 --> 01:40:08.119 align:start position:0%
$7,000 um I got that from the fiscal
 
01:40:10.629 --> 01:40:10.639 align:start position:0%
policy Institute as well as um the
 
01:40:12.589 --> 01:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
average homeowners insurance uh being
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
about $11,000 a year um so when I
 
01:40:20.229 --> 01:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
computed this out uh I came up with the
 
01:40:24.030 --> 01:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
average home uh you would need to make
 
01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
$73,000 per year in order to make that
 
01:40:29.510 --> 01:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh affordable to you meaning you're not
 
01:40:31.870 --> 01:40:31.880 align:start position:0%
cost birden you're not paying more than
 
01:40:35.950 --> 01:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
30% of your income uh for that uh that
 
01:40:39.149 --> 01:40:39.159 align:start position:0%
shelter obviously rental costs are uh
 
01:40:41.189 --> 01:40:41.199 align:start position:0%
similar on par I didn't do the math for
 
01:40:43.709 --> 01:40:43.719 align:start position:0%
that um and just so the committee is
 
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
aware um the most recent data I could
 
01:40:53.669 --> 01:40:53.679 align:start position:0%
pull said that uh 28% of uh employees in
 
01:40:55.629 --> 01:40:55.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire make more than
 
01:40:58.189 --> 01:40:58.199 align:start position:0%
$150,000 so when we're talking about
 
01:41:01.350 --> 01:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
173,000 we're probably talking about 20%
 
01:41:03.189 --> 01:41:03.199 align:start position:0%
or less of people who can afford the
 
01:41:04.669 --> 01:41:04.679 align:start position:0%
average home in New Hampshire at this
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
point in
 
01:41:09.709 --> 01:41:09.719 align:start position:0%
time um and we've seen a significant
 
01:41:12.669 --> 01:41:12.679 align:start position:0%
decrease in home Inventory um and it's
 
01:41:15.709 --> 01:41:15.719 align:start position:0%
our our opinion that really housing
 
01:41:20.229 --> 01:41:20.239 align:start position:0%
costs are a supply and demand problem um
 
01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
a healthy Supply available inventory
 
01:41:23.790 --> 01:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
according to the real
 
01:41:25.629 --> 01:41:25.639 align:start position:0%
is about 6 months of supply and we're
 
01:41:28.229 --> 01:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
just shy of 2% at this point in time
 
01:41:30.390 --> 01:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
that's up from what it was uh a couple
 
01:41:33.109 --> 01:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
years ago um we've seen an increase in
 
01:41:35.470 --> 01:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
building we've also seen National
 
01:41:38.430 --> 01:41:38.440 align:start position:0%
interest rates which which correlate
 
01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
with uh mortgage rates come down I think
 
01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
the highest mortgage rates we saw were
 
01:41:45.629 --> 01:41:45.639 align:start position:0%
above 7% um we're now down to slightly
 
01:41:48.229 --> 01:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
less than uh
 
01:41:51.950 --> 01:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
7% um but what we've one of the things
 
01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
that I really want to focus on is the
 
01:41:57.790 --> 01:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
decrease in supply of new housing um we
 
01:41:59.830 --> 01:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen a decrease in Supply
 
01:42:01.470 --> 01:42:01.480 align:start position:0%
because of demolition or natural
 
01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
disasters like some other states have
 
01:42:07.709 --> 01:42:07.719 align:start position:0%
seen um we've certainly seen an interest
 
01:42:10.550 --> 01:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
rate increase um and that has caused a
 
01:42:12.350 --> 01:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
mortgage rate locking effect so the
 
01:42:14.750 --> 01:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
people who don't need to move um aren't
 
01:42:17.270 --> 01:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
moving because they would uh they would
 
01:42:20.229 --> 01:42:20.239 align:start position:0%
lose some of the um profits they would
 
01:42:23.589 --> 01:42:23.599 align:start position:0%
have gained in their houses um but but
 
01:42:26.589 --> 01:42:26.599 align:start position:0%
what we have seen uh since uh the Great
 
01:42:29.109 --> 01:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
Recession is really a decrease in the
 
01:42:31.229 --> 01:42:31.239 align:start position:0%
number of newly built housing units
 
01:42:32.830 --> 01:42:32.840 align:start position:0%
which is a critical component of the
 
01:42:37.709 --> 01:42:37.719 align:start position:0%
housing Supply um basically in 2011 we
 
01:42:41.070 --> 01:42:41.080 align:start position:0%
saw very few houses built um we're
 
01:42:43.790 --> 01:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
talking about you know maybe a couple
 
01:42:46.350 --> 01:42:46.360 align:start position:0%
thousand in New Hampshire um that's down
 
01:42:49.790 --> 01:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
from a high of over 9,000 at the peak of
 
01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
the building boom in uh 20052 2006 six
 
01:42:56.430 --> 01:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
um we've seen an increase since that
 
01:43:00.189 --> 01:43:00.199 align:start position:0%
time um but we're nowhere close to that
 
01:43:03.149 --> 01:43:03.159 align:start position:0%
Peak Peak uh building and we're actually
 
01:43:05.310 --> 01:43:05.320 align:start position:0%
still under the historical average which
 
01:43:09.030 --> 01:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
was just about uh 6,000 a year between
 
01:43:11.550 --> 01:43:11.560 align:start position:0%
that 6 and 7,000 uh marks we've been
 
01:43:13.950 --> 01:43:13.960 align:start position:0%
building fewer houses over the last
 
01:43:16.950 --> 01:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
really decade and a half um than we have
 
01:43:19.589 --> 01:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
traditionally um and while we saw
 
01:43:22.189 --> 01:43:22.199 align:start position:0%
because of because of that building boom
 
01:43:28.109 --> 01:43:28.119 align:start position:0%
in the uh mid 2000s some uh overs Supply
 
01:43:30.229 --> 01:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
uh initially that was pretty quickly
 
01:43:34.430 --> 01:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
eaten up by by if you look at it um by
 
01:43:36.550 --> 01:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
2016 to
 
01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
2018 that over Supply was was completely
 
01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:43.430 align:start position:0%
2018 that over Supply was was completely
gone

01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
gone
 
01:43:46.910 --> 01:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
um uh and what we're seeing is that lack
 
01:43:50.070 --> 01:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
of Supply is really driving uh housing
 
01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
costs um you know as there are fewer uh
 
01:43:57.310 --> 01:43:57.320 align:start position:0%
and fewer houses on the market um and
 
01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire grows in population grows
 
01:44:02.629 --> 01:44:02.639 align:start position:0%
um you know just in in people wanting to
 
01:44:07.510 --> 01:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh to uh purchase homes um as family uh
 
01:44:10.189 --> 01:44:10.199 align:start position:0%
Dynamics have have shifted um we've seen
 
01:44:13.270 --> 01:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
that um that demand has has increased
 
01:44:16.830 --> 01:44:16.840 align:start position:0%
and we've seen a decrease in um really
 
01:44:21.589 --> 01:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
the ability of um the average uh median
 
01:44:26.390 --> 01:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
income uh family to purchase homes um
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
really I want to talk about the
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
differential here between can I
 
01:44:30.310 --> 01:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
interrupt you for a second we have a
 
01:44:31.990 --> 01:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
question representative ORS thank you Mr
 
01:44:33.990 --> 01:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question so
 
01:44:35.709 --> 01:44:35.719 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at this you you know if I go
 
01:44:38.350 --> 01:44:38.360 align:start position:0%
back here a chart and we're talking
 
01:44:42.149 --> 01:44:42.159 align:start position:0%
around uh 2004 5 and six you said about
 
01:44:46.350 --> 01:44:46.360 align:start position:0%
9,000 units a year yep uh versus where
 
01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
we're at today what is what shifted all
 
01:44:51.709 --> 01:44:51.719 align:start position:0%
this so quickly I mean it seems to me
 
01:44:54.430 --> 01:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
like it's not the Co obviously if we
 
01:44:57.790 --> 01:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
dipped in 2011 to be in where were at
 
01:44:59.229 --> 01:44:59.239 align:start position:0%
what was it
 
01:45:02.550 --> 01:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
the a lot less units but so what's
 
01:45:04.470 --> 01:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
driving this change from all this
 
01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
housing availability to none yes or I
 
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
should say a small amount so the Great
 
01:45:15.229 --> 01:45:15.239 align:start position:0%
Recession was uh caused in in large part
 
01:45:19.550 --> 01:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
by a um crisis in of mortgage lending
 
01:45:21.550 --> 01:45:21.560 align:start position:0%
and there were significant changes made
 
01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
at the federal level for um who
 
01:45:26.229 --> 01:45:26.239 align:start position:0%
qualified for mortgages as well as the
 
01:45:29.109 --> 01:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
type of mortgages issued um so we saw a
 
01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
shift in uh people who qualified and
 
01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:36.960 align:start position:0%
that had an effect on on um demand at
 
01:45:39.430 --> 01:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
that point in time but what we also saw
 
01:45:41.109 --> 01:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
is because the Great Recession was so
 
01:45:43.350 --> 01:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
long uh particularly in the construction
 
01:45:46.109 --> 01:45:46.119 align:start position:0%
industry about in New Hampshire uh I
 
01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:48.719 align:start position:0%
believe the data somewhere around 30% of
 
01:45:50.070 --> 01:45:50.080 align:start position:0%
workers in the construction industry
 
01:45:53.470 --> 01:45:53.480 align:start position:0%
lost their their jobs um and
 
01:45:56.149 --> 01:45:56.159 align:start position:0%
and basically hiring and construction
 
01:45:59.550 --> 01:45:59.560 align:start position:0%
did not occur again for 3 years so most
 
01:46:02.430 --> 01:46:02.440 align:start position:0%
of that 30% moved on um they didn't go
 
01:46:04.109 --> 01:46:04.119 align:start position:0%
back to the construction
 
01:46:07.229 --> 01:46:07.239 align:start position:0%
industry um so you saw a decrease in
 
01:46:12.350 --> 01:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
workers um you also saw um some shifts a
 
01:46:17.149 --> 01:46:17.159 align:start position:0%
lot of the focus at the height of um I
 
01:46:18.629 --> 01:46:18.639 align:start position:0%
guess I should back up a minute because
 
01:46:20.310 --> 01:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
what you don't see in this chart is
 
01:46:23.589 --> 01:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
really the historical um building prior
 
01:46:27.990 --> 01:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
to uh 2001 so in the 1980s we had a big
 
01:46:30.430 --> 01:46:30.440 align:start position:0%
building boom that happened uh usually
 
01:46:32.790 --> 01:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
for easily accessible land land in New
 
01:46:33.950 --> 01:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was a lot cheaper than
 
01:46:35.870 --> 01:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
surrounding states particularly uh
 
01:46:38.910 --> 01:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh and we saw a number of
 
01:46:40.510 --> 01:46:40.520 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods built at that point in
 
01:46:44.350 --> 01:46:44.360 align:start position:0%
time uh the reaction to that was at both
 
01:46:45.870 --> 01:46:45.880 align:start position:0%
the state and local level was to put
 
01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
into place a number of policies that
 
01:46:51.510 --> 01:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
would slow growth um and through the 90s
 
01:46:53.790 --> 01:46:53.800 align:start position:0%
we had
 
01:46:56.149 --> 01:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
uh we didn't
 
01:46:59.950 --> 01:46:59.960 align:start position:0%
have we had slightly lower uh
 
01:47:02.870 --> 01:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
construction numbers um but because of
 
01:47:06.229 --> 01:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
that large amount of of growth in the
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
late 80s early 90s it's what the um New
 
01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Finance Authority
 
01:47:14.310 --> 01:47:14.320 align:start position:0%
called in 2002 kind of speculative
 
01:47:16.470 --> 01:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
overgrowth um so we actually had enough
 
01:47:17.950 --> 01:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
Supply at that point in time so you
 
01:47:21.189 --> 01:47:21.199 align:start position:0%
didn't it kind of masked the effects of
 
01:47:23.870 --> 01:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
the changes uh in the regulatory process
 
01:47:26.430 --> 01:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
to prohibit that growth um and then you
 
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
saw with
 
01:47:33.030 --> 01:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
um in the 2000s um you saw growth Across
 
01:47:34.990 --> 01:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
the Nation in the number of houses being
 
01:47:39.229 --> 01:47:39.239 align:start position:0%
built um because really uh the whole
 
01:47:42.030 --> 01:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
industry was was so focused on this
 
01:47:44.629 --> 01:47:44.639 align:start position:0%
growth um you saw that in New Hampshire
 
01:47:48.950 --> 01:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
as well um you saw very clear uh you
 
01:47:51.109 --> 01:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
know availability of materials there was
 
01:47:55.149 --> 01:47:55.159 align:start position:0%
planning for that um and then um once
 
01:47:58.310 --> 01:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
that hit and you lost a number of of
 
01:48:01.030 --> 01:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
employees across the board um once you
 
01:48:04.189 --> 01:48:04.199 align:start position:0%
lost that demand um it just simply
 
01:48:07.109 --> 01:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
wasn't profitable to build anymore um
 
01:48:09.390 --> 01:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
and you also had seen a lot of
 
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
development occur in um land that didn't
 
01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
require a lot of site work it didn't
 
01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
require a lot of effort to to build
 
01:48:20.189 --> 01:48:20.199 align:start position:0%
there um and it was still relatively
 
01:48:22.990 --> 01:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
cheap um since that time we've seen land
 
01:48:25.870 --> 01:48:25.880 align:start position:0%
values increase significantly um
 
01:48:27.750 --> 01:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
particularly in the Southeast where
 
01:48:31.030 --> 01:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
we've seen a lot of the demand for um
 
01:48:33.229 --> 01:48:33.239 align:start position:0%
not only workers in New Hampshire but
 
01:48:34.870 --> 01:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
also servicing like the Boston and
 
01:48:40.229 --> 01:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
Portland metro areas um we've seen uh so
 
01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
we've seen those increase um we've seen
 
01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh materials increase in cost
 
01:48:48.750 --> 01:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
particularly post uh 2020 um I don't
 
01:48:50.030 --> 01:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
remember off the top of my head the
 
01:48:53.030 --> 01:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
exact statistic um but what we saw in
 
01:48:55.310 --> 01:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
building materials inflation was
 
01:48:58.589 --> 01:48:58.599 align:start position:0%
something like a 30 to 40% um there was
 
01:49:02.990 --> 01:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
some pullback over 2002 2003 but it was
 
01:49:07.350 --> 01:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
still about 30% I think it was above the
 
01:49:10.510 --> 01:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
cost of those materials in 2019 um so
 
01:49:12.990 --> 01:49:13.000 align:start position:0%
for Builders who are typically ordering
 
01:49:16.510 --> 01:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
those materials as they need them um
 
01:49:18.790 --> 01:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
it's really hard to price things because
 
01:49:21.229 --> 01:49:21.239 align:start position:0%
you don't know um what that price is
 
01:49:22.709 --> 01:49:22.719 align:start position:0%
going to be in two months when you get
 
01:49:25.589 --> 01:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
to that particular uh house for example
 
01:49:27.589 --> 01:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
so you saw a lot of contracts that had
 
01:49:30.109 --> 01:49:30.119 align:start position:0%
in there Provisions for significant
 
01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
increases above what had previously
 
01:49:37.589 --> 01:49:37.599 align:start position:0%
occurred um and uh so overall it got
 
01:49:39.070 --> 01:49:39.080 align:start position:0%
more expensive and of course at the same
 
01:49:41.229 --> 01:49:41.239 align:start position:0%
time as this is getting more expensive
 
01:49:44.229 --> 01:49:44.239 align:start position:0%
and workers are becoming more and more
 
01:49:47.149 --> 01:49:47.159 align:start position:0%
scarce in this industry um they're
 
01:49:49.350 --> 01:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
getting higher wages you're also having
 
01:49:52.030 --> 01:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
them go on projects frankly that are
 
01:49:53.470 --> 01:49:53.480 align:start position:0%
more profitable
 
01:49:56.229 --> 01:49:56.239 align:start position:0%
um so you're not and and on the
 
01:49:59.550 --> 01:49:59.560 align:start position:0%
regulatory side um you know some of the
 
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
shifts that occurred also occurred as
 
01:50:03.910 --> 01:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
early as the 1970s where you saw really
 
01:50:08.030 --> 01:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
a decrease in Nationwide in focus on
 
01:50:10.189 --> 01:50:10.199 align:start position:0%
building what has been term starter
 
01:50:12.629 --> 01:50:12.639 align:start position:0%
homes um but really what we're talking
 
01:50:14.750 --> 01:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
about is like, 1400 foot homes the kind
 
01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
of the modest homes that are you know
 
01:50:19.870 --> 01:50:19.880 align:start position:0%
large two bedrooms one bath or uh you
 
01:50:22.750 --> 01:50:22.760 align:start position:0%
know a small three-bedroom one one one
 
01:50:24.589 --> 01:50:24.599 align:start position:0%
and a half bath type things and you
 
01:50:27.510 --> 01:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
really saw a shift from uh the early
 
01:50:30.669 --> 01:50:30.679 align:start position:0%
1980s of those being about a quarter of
 
01:50:34.669 --> 01:50:34.679 align:start position:0%
the housing units built to by the time
 
01:50:38.790 --> 01:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
we're hitting 2005 um you know just
 
01:50:40.350 --> 01:50:40.360 align:start position:0%
regulatory changes across the board
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
those are less than 20% of of the
 
01:50:44.350 --> 01:50:44.360 align:start position:0%
housing units being built so from 40 to
 
01:50:47.470 --> 01:50:47.480 align:start position:0%
20% significant shift and as people are
 
01:50:51.709 --> 01:50:51.719 align:start position:0%
looking at um you know affordability now
 
01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
what I think a lot of the conversation
 
01:50:54.629 --> 01:50:54.639 align:start position:0%
you're probably hearing is well let's
 
01:50:56.709 --> 01:50:56.719 align:start position:0%
build more of those houses um because
 
01:50:58.510 --> 01:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
simply there isn't there aren't many of
 
01:50:59.950 --> 01:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
them and we've seen a significant
 
01:51:01.550 --> 01:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
population growth across the United
 
01:51:03.430 --> 01:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
States yes very good thank you I I've
 
01:51:05.229 --> 01:51:05.239 align:start position:0%
seen where they've had these micro home
 
01:51:07.990 --> 01:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
Villages they're building they're really
 
01:51:10.510 --> 01:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
tiny homes and they twist and turn them
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
so they have some privacy and but I I
 
01:51:15.629 --> 01:51:15.639 align:start position:0%
saw myself price of a 2x4 go from like
 
01:51:20.270 --> 01:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
$2 to $9 so y thank you represent
 
01:51:22.390 --> 01:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:51:24.950 --> 01:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I represent
 
01:51:27.910 --> 01:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
the city of NASA mhm or part of the city
 
01:51:32.189 --> 01:51:32.199 align:start position:0%
of NASA and NASA is a border Community
 
01:51:34.229 --> 01:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
we are just over the line from
 
01:51:37.149 --> 01:51:37.159 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I have a fair number of
 
01:51:40.629 --> 01:51:40.639 align:start position:0%
constituents who work in Massachusetts
 
01:51:42.910 --> 01:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
because their salaries are significantly
 
01:51:45.229 --> 01:51:45.239 align:start position:0%
higher I'm thinking in particular of
 
01:51:47.870 --> 01:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
teachers and police officers who can
 
01:51:51.470 --> 01:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
earn $220,000 a year more in
 
01:51:51.480 --> 01:51:53.030 align:start position:0%
earn $220,000 a year more in
Massachusetts

01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
01:51:55.149 --> 01:51:55.159 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the chart uh the slide
 
01:51:58.149 --> 01:51:58.159 align:start position:0%
number 25 the housing price increase
 
01:52:00.149 --> 01:52:00.159 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is the only state in New
 
01:52:02.669 --> 01:52:02.679 align:start position:0%
England where there was under a 50%
 
01:52:05.709 --> 01:52:05.719 align:start position:0%
increase in housing prices their
 
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
salaries are
 
01:52:11.629 --> 01:52:11.639 align:start position:0%
higher I'm wondering what the impact of
 
01:52:14.550 --> 01:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
salaries are and the fact that salaries
 
01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire are often significantly
 
01:52:20.109 --> 01:52:20.119 align:start position:0%
lower than those in
 
01:52:22.589 --> 01:52:22.599 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and how do we deal with
 
01:52:25.589 --> 01:52:25.599 align:start position:0%
the impact of those lower salaries on
 
01:52:28.709 --> 01:52:28.719 align:start position:0%
the fact that our housing prices have
 
01:52:30.390 --> 01:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
increased so much that people can't
 
01:52:32.870 --> 01:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
afford to buy or live
 
01:52:35.950 --> 01:52:35.960 align:start position:0%
here uh thank you for the question
 
01:52:40.229 --> 01:52:40.239 align:start position:0%
so I don't know that I have a good
 
01:52:43.629 --> 01:52:43.639 align:start position:0%
answer for you um on that uh obviously
 
01:52:47.149 --> 01:52:47.159 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about um teachers uh
 
01:52:52.109 --> 01:52:52.119 align:start position:0%
Etc um those wages are set um by Town
 
01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
media here in New Hampshire um I'm not
 
01:52:57.709 --> 01:52:57.719 align:start position:0%
sure exactly how they're set in
 
01:53:02.950 --> 01:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:05.750 --> 01:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
the I think
 
01:53:09.790 --> 01:53:09.800 align:start position:0%
um one of the important things to look
 
01:53:12.109 --> 01:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
at I think is
 
01:53:14.910 --> 01:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
probably that differential between home
 
01:53:17.589 --> 01:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
values and household income I'm not
 
01:53:19.350 --> 01:53:19.360 align:start position:0%
familiar with Massachusetts but I can
 
01:53:21.229 --> 01:53:21.239 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about Texas if that's
 
01:53:23.870 --> 01:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
helpful um because I looked into that
 
01:53:27.510 --> 01:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
last year um Texas overall has lower
 
01:53:30.109 --> 01:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
salaries than we have in New England and
 
01:53:32.350 --> 01:53:32.360 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for the same jobs um
 
01:53:34.910 --> 01:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
they also have lower home values but one
 
01:53:38.270 --> 01:53:38.280 align:start position:0%
of the things that you've seen in in
 
01:53:40.390 --> 01:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
Texas and I'm talking about Houston in
 
01:53:45.030 --> 01:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
particular is um that if you were to map
 
01:53:49.350 --> 01:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
out their increases in the differential
 
01:53:54.270 --> 01:53:54.280 align:start position:0%
change um between their income s and the
 
01:53:58.109 --> 01:53:58.119 align:start position:0%
increase in home uh home prices it
 
01:54:00.149 --> 01:54:00.159 align:start position:0%
basically is the same graph as I'm
 
01:54:03.910 --> 01:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
showing you right now um so I think one
 
01:54:05.229 --> 01:54:05.239 align:start position:0%
of the things that New Hampshire is
 
01:54:07.750 --> 01:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
struggling with along with other states
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
is you know how do we close this Gap um
 
01:54:15.109 --> 01:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
and that's again um a challenge um there
 
01:54:17.310 --> 01:54:17.320 align:start position:0%
are a number of things that we at the
 
01:54:18.629 --> 01:54:18.639 align:start position:0%
state level don't control we don't
 
01:54:21.310 --> 01:54:21.320 align:start position:0%
control interest rates um obviously if
 
01:54:22.910 --> 01:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
interest rates were lower
 
01:54:25.550 --> 01:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
uh people could afford uh higher priced
 
01:54:28.189 --> 01:54:28.199 align:start position:0%
homes um because of the monthly payment
 
01:54:28.199 --> 01:54:29.830 align:start position:0%
homes um because of the monthly payment
difference

01:54:29.830 --> 01:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
difference
 
01:54:32.709 --> 01:54:32.719 align:start position:0%
um there are uh you know one of the
 
01:54:34.189 --> 01:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
things we've seen at the federal level
 
01:54:36.310 --> 01:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
for example is in the
 
01:54:39.149 --> 01:54:39.159 align:start position:0%
1970s uh there was significant Federal
 
01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
investment in water and sewer
 
01:54:44.030 --> 01:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um that uh allows
 
01:54:46.589 --> 01:54:46.599 align:start position:0%
building at higher densities we haven't
 
01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
seen that type of investment uh at the
 
01:54:51.189 --> 01:54:51.199 align:start position:0%
federal level since then but one of the
 
01:54:53.390 --> 01:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
things that that Federal investment did
 
01:54:56.030 --> 01:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
in a lot of places was it allowed the
 
01:54:58.229 --> 01:54:58.239 align:start position:0%
building of uh water treatment
 
01:55:02.189 --> 01:55:02.199 align:start position:0%
facilities that were not only um not
 
01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
only sized for the existing population
 
01:55:06.510 --> 01:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
but also future population growth so
 
01:55:09.550 --> 01:55:09.560 align:start position:0%
that absorbed some of that um some of
 
01:55:12.669 --> 01:55:12.679 align:start position:0%
those costs as well um and what we've
 
01:55:17.109 --> 01:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
also seen is really kind of a uh a shift
 
01:55:20.870 --> 01:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
in that that demand um New Hampshire uh
 
01:55:24.189 --> 01:55:24.199 align:start position:0%
because of you know it's a great place
 
01:55:27.310 --> 01:55:27.320 align:start position:0%
to live um has really attracted a
 
01:55:29.470 --> 01:55:29.480 align:start position:0%
significant number of people as compared
 
01:55:32.950 --> 01:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
to uh you know percentage wise compared
 
01:55:34.910 --> 01:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
to Massachusetts uh more people have
 
01:55:37.470 --> 01:55:37.480 align:start position:0%
left Massachusetts than have moved there
 
01:55:39.109 --> 01:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
um and they've been coming to States
 
01:55:41.790 --> 01:55:41.800 align:start position:0%
like ours which has put an an increased
 
01:55:44.030 --> 01:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh Demand on our our housing prices
 
01:55:46.510 --> 01:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
which or on our housing availability
 
01:55:49.109 --> 01:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
which is increased prices um I don't
 
01:55:50.950 --> 01:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
know that that entirely gets to your
 
01:55:53.390 --> 01:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
question but I hope that's some helpful
 
01:55:56.069 --> 01:55:56.079 align:start position:0%
background data followup followup I'm
 
01:55:57.990 --> 01:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
one of those people by the way I moved
 
01:55:59.550 --> 01:55:59.560 align:start position:0%
here from Massachusetts four years ago
 
01:56:02.189 --> 01:56:02.199 align:start position:0%
five years ago uh but I'm also wondering
 
01:56:04.470 --> 01:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
you talked about the federal investment
 
01:56:06.830 --> 01:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
in infrastructure has there been any
 
01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:07.790 align:start position:0%
in infrastructure has there been any
state

01:56:07.790 --> 01:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:56:11.270 --> 01:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
investment yes so we have uh state aid
 
01:56:14.189 --> 01:56:14.199 align:start position:0%
grants that Dees administers um those
 
01:56:17.109 --> 01:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
are for maintenance not for new water
 
01:56:17.119 --> 01:56:17.910 align:start position:0%
are for maintenance not for new water
and

01:56:17.910 --> 01:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:21.270 --> 01:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure um that has been funded
 
01:56:24.350 --> 01:56:24.360 align:start position:0%
uh traditionally between and $15 million
 
01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
a year um I'm sure Dees could speak more
 
01:56:31.270 --> 01:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
about it than I can um I believe there's
 
01:56:33.910 --> 01:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
legislation this year to make it 15
 
01:56:38.950 --> 01:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
million a year um the other other state
 
01:56:40.870 --> 01:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
investment that we've done recently is
 
01:56:42.750 --> 01:56:42.760 align:start position:0%
the housing Champions program which was
 
01:56:46.270 --> 01:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
started up a couple years ago um it's up
 
01:56:49.109 --> 01:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
for renewal in this budget cycle it was
 
01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
initially um funded with5 million but
 
01:56:54.830 --> 01:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
one of the specific parts of that
 
01:56:58.069 --> 01:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
legislation and then the rules actually
 
01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
uh say that it's for additional monies
 
01:57:04.629 --> 01:57:04.639 align:start position:0%
for new infrastructure so it's not just
 
01:57:09.910 --> 01:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
um not just uh not just maintenance um
 
01:57:15.390 --> 01:57:15.400 align:start position:0%
we have uh traditionally invested um in
 
01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
kind of roads which are also expensive
 
01:57:20.589 --> 01:57:20.599 align:start position:0%
Bridges which are also expensive um as
 
01:57:22.990 --> 01:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
part of the state budgeting process
 
01:57:26.149 --> 01:57:26.159 align:start position:0%
uh we've done that um a lot of that
 
01:57:29.470 --> 01:57:29.480 align:start position:0%
through uh Highway block grants um but
 
01:57:31.550 --> 01:57:31.560 align:start position:0%
if there has been surpluses in the past
 
01:57:33.229 --> 01:57:33.239 align:start position:0%
the legislature has been uh very
 
01:57:36.430 --> 01:57:36.440 align:start position:0%
generous in providing additional Aid
 
01:57:38.870 --> 01:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
particularly to municipalities with uh
 
01:57:41.589 --> 01:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
those Road and Bridge monies thank you
 
01:57:43.950 --> 01:57:43.960 align:start position:0%
representative shamberg thank you Mr
 
01:57:45.470 --> 01:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for
 
01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:49.310 align:start position:0%
taking my
question

01:57:49.310 --> 01:57:49.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:57:52.149 --> 01:57:52.159 align:start position:0%
um since Ways and Means Main respon
 
01:57:54.109 --> 01:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to determine uh
 
01:58:00.069 --> 01:58:00.079 align:start position:0%
Revenue projections mhm uh you indicated
 
01:58:04.109 --> 01:58:04.119 align:start position:0%
that there's been an increase of up 10%
 
01:58:07.149 --> 01:58:07.159 align:start position:0%
I believe you said that has
 
01:58:10.069 --> 01:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
occurred concerning manufacturing here
 
01:58:11.069 --> 01:58:11.079 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:58:17.350 --> 01:58:17.360 align:start position:0%
state yet we seem to be losing U uh
 
01:58:19.910 --> 01:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
employees from the Deputy Commissioner
 
01:58:21.750 --> 01:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
the Department of Employment Security
 
01:58:23.830 --> 01:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
yesterday yesterday and the economic and
 
01:58:28.189 --> 01:58:28.199 align:start position:0%
labor market information Bureau you said
 
01:58:30.870 --> 01:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
lost about, 1300 they seem to have said
 
01:58:33.870 --> 01:58:33.880 align:start position:0%
that we're
 
01:58:33.880 --> 01:58:35.790 align:start position:0%
that we're
1,592

01:58:35.790 --> 01:58:35.800 align:start position:0%
1,592
 
01:58:39.069 --> 01:58:39.079 align:start position:0%
employees or laborers or or
 
01:58:41.709 --> 01:58:41.719 align:start position:0%
workers is there a reason for
 
01:58:46.069 --> 01:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
that um so just so I can clarify about
 
01:58:49.109 --> 01:58:49.119 align:start position:0%
10% of our Workforce uh is employed in
 
01:58:51.550 --> 01:58:51.560 align:start position:0%
manufacturing is what I meant to say in
 
01:58:56.270 --> 01:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
terms of the losses um I believe I have
 
01:58:57.669 --> 01:58:57.679 align:start position:0%
data that's from a different point in
 
01:59:00.109 --> 01:59:00.119 align:start position:0%
time I'm sure theirs is more current
 
01:59:02.589 --> 01:59:02.599 align:start position:0%
than the data that I have um so I would
 
01:59:04.790 --> 01:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
defer to them for those exact numbers
 
01:59:05.629 --> 01:59:05.639 align:start position:0%
and my
 
01:59:09.750 --> 01:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
followup um since you brought up data uh
 
01:59:12.830 --> 01:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
do you have data
 
01:59:16.550 --> 01:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh to show how the uh tax rate
 
01:59:18.310 --> 01:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
reductions initiated by the New
 
01:59:20.470 --> 01:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature have
 
01:59:23.470 --> 01:59:23.480 align:start position:0%
increased uh in migration of the
 
01:59:25.950 --> 01:59:25.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and Industrial Footprints
 
01:59:28.870 --> 01:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire I do not have that
 
01:59:31.910 --> 01:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:36.589 --> 01:59:36.599 align:start position:0%
you okay can oh question represent and
 
01:59:40.189 --> 01:59:40.199 align:start position:0%
you get that data I can try to find that
 
01:59:43.790 --> 01:59:43.800 align:start position:0%
data um I will do my best to find it and
 
01:59:46.229 --> 01:59:46.239 align:start position:0%
provide that to uh the
 
01:59:50.189 --> 01:59:50.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:56.629 --> 01:59:56.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:00:00.629 --> 02:00:00.639 align:start position:0%
uh it how could you possibly get that
 
02:00:03.990 --> 02:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
data given that that there are so many
 
02:00:07.870 --> 02:00:07.880 align:start position:0%
factors that were involved the pandemic
 
02:00:11.430 --> 02:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
the The Great Well the Great Recession
 
02:00:14.350 --> 02:00:14.360 align:start position:0%
was before that but the the Tale on the
 
02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:15.350 align:start position:0%
was before that but the the Tale on the
Great

02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
Great
 
02:00:18.750 --> 02:00:18.760 align:start position:0%
Recession um
 
02:00:22.750 --> 02:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
and and the um everything that is
 
02:00:25.189 --> 02:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
changing in the National
 
02:00:28.550 --> 02:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
economy let me rephrase if that data
 
02:00:30.790 --> 02:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
exists and I can find the person or
 
02:00:33.669 --> 02:00:33.679 align:start position:0%
entity that has it I will provide that
 
02:00:36.550 --> 02:00:36.560 align:start position:0%
to the committee thank
 
02:00:39.510 --> 02:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
you yes represent
 
02:00:41.990 --> 02:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
oling these slides that you have could
 
02:00:45.390 --> 02:00:45.400 align:start position:0%
you uh make them available to the entire
 
02:00:47.750 --> 02:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh committee through I've I've provided
 
02:00:54.870 --> 02:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:58.189 --> 02:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
um so just moving on to uh electricity
 
02:01:00.510 --> 02:01:00.520 align:start position:0%
prices here
 
02:01:04.109 --> 02:01:04.119 align:start position:0%
um uh what you've seen uh and we've
 
02:01:06.589 --> 02:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
talked about previously is over the the
 
02:01:09.589 --> 02:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
past um really decade and a half uh New
 
02:01:11.750 --> 02:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's increased more uh in terms
 
02:01:14.629 --> 02:01:14.639 align:start position:0%
of electricity prices than um any other
 
02:01:18.069 --> 02:01:18.079 align:start position:0%
state uh most other states uh were're
 
02:01:21.430 --> 02:01:21.440 align:start position:0%
60.7% increase um only 11 other states
 
02:01:23.910 --> 02:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
have seen such a high rise in
 
02:01:28.910 --> 02:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
prices um so one of the one of the
 
02:01:31.149 --> 02:01:31.159 align:start position:0%
requests from our members particularly
 
02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
manufacturing which uses a high
 
02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
percentage of electricity is uh for
 
02:01:37.430 --> 02:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
policy options that help them reduce
 
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
those costs um because that makes New
 
02:01:43.030 --> 02:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire more attractive for them um
 
02:01:46.030 --> 02:01:46.040 align:start position:0%
obvious obviously that's an interest and
 
02:01:49.709 --> 02:01:49.719 align:start position:0%
given that the new incoming Federal
 
02:01:53.390 --> 02:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
administration's focus is to increase um
 
02:01:56.189 --> 02:01:56.199 align:start position:0%
State Side manufacturing um certainly
 
02:01:57.709 --> 02:01:57.719 align:start position:0%
anything we can do to make New Hampshire
 
02:02:00.870 --> 02:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
more attractive um would be helpful uh
 
02:02:03.430 --> 02:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
in that
 
02:02:06.629 --> 02:02:06.639 align:start position:0%
Arena um in terms of overall
 
02:02:11.510 --> 02:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure rankings um we uh one of
 
02:02:12.950 --> 02:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
the areas that we actually do really
 
02:02:15.069 --> 02:02:15.079 align:start position:0%
well on that I know commissioner Caswell
 
02:02:18.830 --> 02:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
uh mentioned um we don't actually have
 
02:02:21.229 --> 02:02:21.239 align:start position:0%
uh kind of rolled out in terms of data
 
02:02:22.910 --> 02:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
and ranking at this moment in time but
 
02:02:25.069 --> 02:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
is broadband infrastructure that's in
 
02:02:28.350 --> 02:02:28.360 align:start position:0%
large part to um both federal and state
 
02:02:30.470 --> 02:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
investment in that um and so I know he
 
02:02:31.870 --> 02:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
covered that pretty
 
02:02:35.350 --> 02:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
extensively um but o overall we do have
 
02:02:37.870 --> 02:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
a lower investment in just
 
02:02:39.270 --> 02:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure across the board whether
 
02:02:41.709 --> 02:02:41.719 align:start position:0%
we're talking about roads Bridges um you
 
02:02:45.910 --> 02:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
know anything else um compared to other
 
02:02:48.990 --> 02:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
states um I know I'm pretty much out of
 
02:02:52.669 --> 02:02:52.679 align:start position:0%
time here so I'm happy to uh stop
 
02:02:54.629 --> 02:02:54.639 align:start position:0%
talking if you'd like me to Mr
 
02:02:58.510 --> 02:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
chair well if you would like to just
 
02:03:01.990 --> 02:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
um I guess um get you know finalize it
 
02:03:03.870 --> 02:03:03.880 align:start position:0%
get to your key takeaways uh that would
 
02:03:07.310 --> 02:03:07.320 align:start position:0%
be good yeah I will skip ahead to that
 
02:03:11.270 --> 02:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
um so as I began this presentation with
 
02:03:12.830 --> 02:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire's overall business
 
02:03:15.750 --> 02:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
climate strong in position to compete na
 
02:03:17.910 --> 02:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
nationally um really Workforce
 
02:03:19.669 --> 02:03:19.679 align:start position:0%
availability and housing Supply which
 
02:03:22.390 --> 02:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
are intertwined um are the top risk
 
02:03:24.430 --> 02:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
factors in our business climate followed
 
02:03:26.750 --> 02:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
by the Avail availability of child care
 
02:03:30.030 --> 02:03:30.040 align:start position:0%
energy costs some of those um existing
 
02:03:33.069 --> 02:03:33.079 align:start position:0%
uh cost concerns uh such as health
 
02:03:36.589 --> 02:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
care um and we're hoping that uh the
 
02:03:38.550 --> 02:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
state legislature Embraces Statewide
 
02:03:40.470 --> 02:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
Solutions and promotes Regional
 
02:03:43.470 --> 02:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
Solutions um to help really increase uh
 
02:03:45.910 --> 02:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
economic output throughout the
 
02:03:48.470 --> 02:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
state thank you um I had I have a
 
02:03:50.669 --> 02:03:50.679 align:start position:0%
question about business formation you
 
02:03:52.870 --> 02:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
had I think if I remember correctly New
 
02:03:56.669 --> 02:03:56.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was 14th in business formation
 
02:04:00.069 --> 02:04:00.079 align:start position:0%
and uh our our uh business formation fee
 
02:04:03.069 --> 02:04:03.079 align:start position:0%
I believe is $100 and the ongoing annual
 
02:04:06.069 --> 02:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
report fee is $100 how does that how
 
02:04:09.229 --> 02:04:09.239 align:start position:0%
does that rank do you know fairly low in
 
02:04:12.189 --> 02:04:12.199 align:start position:0%
in the country at $100 I don't I don't
 
02:04:13.910 --> 02:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
know off the top of my head but I could
 
02:04:16.910 --> 02:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
find out in the the states that rank
 
02:04:18.830 --> 02:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
higher what theirs are okay because I
 
02:04:21.709 --> 02:04:21.719 align:start position:0%
know Massachusetts is 500 which is sign
 
02:04:21.719 --> 02:04:30.790 align:start position:0%
know Massachusetts is 500 which is sign
signicantly

02:04:30.790 --> 02:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:33.669 --> 02:04:33.679 align:start position:0%
larger representative
 
02:04:36.950 --> 02:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
opal uh thank you Mr chairman and um
 
02:04:39.229 --> 02:04:39.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Grace for your presentation
 
02:04:42.549 --> 02:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
I I I couldn't help but notice um in
 
02:04:45.189 --> 02:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
your chart uh the state
 
02:04:49.310 --> 02:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
ranks significantly high in terms of
 
02:04:52.030 --> 02:04:52.040 align:start position:0%
um I forget exactly how you call it but
 
02:04:54.149 --> 02:04:54.159 align:start position:0%
we were sixth in terms of our tax
 
02:04:58.390 --> 02:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
climate for business MH um and
 
02:05:01.950 --> 02:05:01.960 align:start position:0%
yet um on another slide the cost of
 
02:05:04.229 --> 02:05:04.239 align:start position:0%
Business ranking in 2023 it looks like
 
02:05:07.030 --> 02:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
we've slipped in the last 10 years
 
02:05:10.470 --> 02:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
despite a series of tax cuts um for
 
02:05:13.149 --> 02:05:13.159 align:start position:0%
business we've slipped 18 places we've
 
02:05:15.629 --> 02:05:15.639 align:start position:0%
gone from 18th to
 
02:05:15.639 --> 02:05:17.549 align:start position:0%
gone from 18th to
36th

02:05:17.549 --> 02:05:17.559 align:start position:0%
36th
 
02:05:21.189 --> 02:05:21.199 align:start position:0%
um every Economist every business person
 
02:05:23.549 --> 02:05:23.559 align:start position:0%
I've ever talked to says that obviously
 
02:05:26.350 --> 02:05:26.360 align:start position:0%
taxes are an important calculation for
 
02:05:27.790 --> 02:05:27.800 align:start position:0%
business but they're certainly not the
 
02:05:29.830 --> 02:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
only calculation in many cases they're
 
02:05:31.390 --> 02:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
not the first
 
02:05:34.470 --> 02:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
calculation um and it it would seem to
 
02:05:35.830 --> 02:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
me your key
 
02:05:40.350 --> 02:05:40.360 align:start position:0%
takeaways um the cost of our business
 
02:05:40.360 --> 02:05:41.870 align:start position:0%
takeaways um the cost of our business
ranking

02:05:41.870 --> 02:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
ranking
 
02:05:44.390 --> 02:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
decline has less to do with cutting
 
02:05:46.910 --> 02:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
taxes and more to do with the fact that
 
02:05:49.990 --> 02:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
child care Workforce housing housing
 
02:05:52.669 --> 02:05:52.679 align:start position:0%
generally energy cost cost as you point
 
02:05:57.390 --> 02:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
out um are are significant impact in
 
02:06:01.109 --> 02:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
terms of the ability to hire and conduct
 
02:06:04.470 --> 02:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
business um so I'm wondering if you
 
02:06:07.350 --> 02:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
think that um while this committee's
 
02:06:09.390 --> 02:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
focus is obviously on revenue for the
 
02:06:13.109 --> 02:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
state I'm wondering if you think that um
 
02:06:16.430 --> 02:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps our focus should be on Revenue
 
02:06:19.109 --> 02:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
to solve some of these problems as it
 
02:06:20.990 --> 02:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
would appear your third bullet point
 
02:06:24.310 --> 02:06:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:26.830 --> 02:06:26.840 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question um you
 
02:06:29.950 --> 02:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
know the focus uh of our economic
 
02:06:32.470 --> 02:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
briefing today was hopefully to
 
02:06:34.229 --> 02:06:34.239 align:start position:0%
highlight some of the emerging
 
02:06:37.950 --> 02:06:37.960 align:start position:0%
challenges that we saw um as I mentioned
 
02:06:38.910 --> 02:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
uh you know when we're looking at
 
02:06:41.069 --> 02:06:41.079 align:start position:0%
workers who need to relocate to take
 
02:06:43.189 --> 02:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
positions we're looking at businesses
 
02:06:44.790 --> 02:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
we're trying to hire qualified
 
02:06:47.109 --> 02:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
candidates from out of a reasonable
 
02:06:49.910 --> 02:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
travel distance um what challenges are
 
02:06:53.030 --> 02:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
they facing and what level can state
 
02:06:57.270 --> 02:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
government pull to make that easier um
 
02:06:59.709 --> 02:06:59.719 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh you know Revenue
 
02:07:01.870 --> 02:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
projections uh how the state takes that
 
02:07:04.270 --> 02:07:04.280 align:start position:0%
in and what you use that for that's
 
02:07:05.950 --> 02:07:05.960 align:start position:0%
really beyond the scope of what I'm
 
02:07:08.229 --> 02:07:08.239 align:start position:0%
prepared to talk about
 
02:07:12.510 --> 02:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
today thank you did you
 
02:07:15.830 --> 02:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
representative thank you on on your
 
02:07:20.589 --> 02:07:20.599 align:start position:0%
points um regarding housing and child
 
02:07:20.599 --> 02:07:22.549 align:start position:0%
points um regarding housing and child
care

02:07:22.549 --> 02:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
care
 
02:07:26.870 --> 02:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
do you have any data or access to data
 
02:07:29.910 --> 02:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
that would indicate the type of local
 
02:07:31.750 --> 02:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
and state
 
02:07:31.760 --> 02:07:33.390 align:start position:0%
and state
regulations

02:07:33.390 --> 02:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
02:07:37.830 --> 02:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
that complicate the availability of
 
02:07:41.750 --> 02:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:41.760 --> 02:07:43.990 align:start position:0%
 
housing

02:07:43.990 --> 02:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
housing
 
02:07:48.069 --> 02:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
so both of these topics are incredibly
 
02:07:51.870 --> 02:07:51.880 align:start position:0%
complicated which I can base
 
02:07:53.470 --> 02:07:53.480 align:start position:0%
not only in my knowledge of that but
 
02:07:55.109 --> 02:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that there seem to be
 
02:07:58.069 --> 02:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
somewhere upwards of 50 bills filed on
 
02:08:00.870 --> 02:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
different Housing Solutions this session
 
02:08:03.350 --> 02:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
um all of which propose uh various
 
02:08:07.229 --> 02:08:07.239 align:start position:0%
things that that may help uh ease the
 
02:08:11.510 --> 02:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
supply crunch here um I think it's
 
02:08:14.470 --> 02:08:14.480 align:start position:0%
important to
 
02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh keep in mind um that because of the
 
02:08:20.669 --> 02:08:20.679 align:start position:0%
complicated nature of this I don't have
 
02:08:23.669 --> 02:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
a a sing Le solution I can certainly
 
02:08:26.750 --> 02:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
provide you some data on different
 
02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
options uh for example um you know I am
 
02:08:33.510 --> 02:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
aware of the fact that there's something
 
02:08:36.510 --> 02:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
like a 500 page book on parking and how
 
02:08:38.069 --> 02:08:38.079 align:start position:0%
that affects the
 
02:08:42.350 --> 02:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
availability of of building um which is
 
02:08:45.830 --> 02:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
more than I would ever care to read um
 
02:08:48.069 --> 02:08:48.079 align:start position:0%
um but there are a lot of factors that
 
02:08:50.310 --> 02:08:50.320 align:start position:0%
go into that and help developers pencil
 
02:08:51.990 --> 02:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
these things out so I think there are a
 
02:08:54.350 --> 02:08:54.360 align:start position:0%
number of options um depending on what
 
02:08:56.069 --> 02:08:56.079 align:start position:0%
we want the state to look like in 5
 
02:08:59.470 --> 02:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
years for uh what what availability is
 
02:09:01.709 --> 02:09:01.719 align:start position:0%
there uh
 
02:09:04.790 --> 02:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
followup yeah parking traffic studies
 
02:09:09.589 --> 02:09:09.599 align:start position:0%
I'm on a local planning board don't go
 
02:09:16.549 --> 02:09:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:19.629 --> 02:09:19.639 align:start position:0%
strategies watching the the the effect
 
02:09:22.709 --> 02:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
of regulation in
 
02:09:26.709 --> 02:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
ibit uh good utilization not maximum
 
02:09:28.549 --> 02:09:28.559 align:start position:0%
utilization because you know person has
 
02:09:30.470 --> 02:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
a right to their own property and to
 
02:09:32.390 --> 02:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
develop it in the way they want but to
 
02:09:36.830 --> 02:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
utilize and come up with a uh permissive
 
02:09:39.390 --> 02:09:39.400 align:start position:0%
uh not permissive an environment in
 
02:09:41.629 --> 02:09:41.639 align:start position:0%
which a person can develop property to
 
02:09:45.189 --> 02:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
increase the housing right
 
02:09:45.199 --> 02:09:47.350 align:start position:0%
increase the housing right
plus

02:09:47.350 --> 02:09:47.360 align:start position:0%
plus
 
02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
um lowering the cost of electricity when
 
02:09:54.870 --> 02:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
we can't even get inexpensive hydr power
 
02:09:57.750 --> 02:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
to come down to New
 
02:09:59.990 --> 02:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire how does the state come up
 
02:10:03.390 --> 02:10:03.400 align:start position:0%
with Statewide strategies when a lot of
 
02:10:06.069 --> 02:10:06.079 align:start position:0%
other stuff interferes that makes it
 
02:10:08.270 --> 02:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
more difficult and more expensive for me
 
02:10:12.310 --> 02:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:15.470 --> 02:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
home well I think that's a significant
 
02:10:18.629 --> 02:10:18.639 align:start position:0%
challenge representative bery um uh you
 
02:10:22.229 --> 02:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
know and uh I think it's
 
02:10:26.390 --> 02:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately a policy by policy
 
02:10:29.910 --> 02:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
basis um so if there are things that can
 
02:10:34.069 --> 02:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
be done that uh sort
 
02:10:39.549 --> 02:10:39.559 align:start position:0%
of have an effect uh that that
 
02:10:44.229 --> 02:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
um that are supported um broadly and
 
02:10:44.239 --> 02:10:45.589 align:start position:0%
um that are supported um broadly and
also

02:10:45.589 --> 02:10:45.599 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
um you know look at saving um taxpayer
 
02:10:55.870 --> 02:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
funds so for example um in many
 
02:10:59.470 --> 02:10:59.480 align:start position:0%
downtowns across the state um you know
 
02:11:01.149 --> 02:11:01.159 align:start position:0%
you can go to the downtown see what it
 
02:11:03.750 --> 02:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
looks like and many of them have a
 
02:11:06.549 --> 02:11:06.559 align:start position:0%
vacant lot nearby that's in kind of a
 
02:11:10.189 --> 02:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
residential area um but if you were to
 
02:11:13.069 --> 02:11:13.079 align:start position:0%
propose the type of building that exists
 
02:11:15.549 --> 02:11:15.559 align:start position:0%
in the surrounding lots that may not be
 
02:11:18.310 --> 02:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
allowed under the local zoning code so
 
02:11:21.510 --> 02:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
figuring out what policy levers to pull
 
02:11:24.430 --> 02:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
in order to enable that type of uh that
 
02:11:26.549 --> 02:11:26.559 align:start position:0%
type of development which is what
 
02:11:29.549 --> 02:11:29.559 align:start position:0%
historically has been there um might be
 
02:11:34.149 --> 02:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
helpful so to give you a good example um
 
02:11:36.990 --> 02:11:37.000 align:start position:0%
doing a simple zoning change bringing
 
02:11:39.270 --> 02:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
that to as I'm sure you know better than
 
02:11:41.510 --> 02:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
I do bringing that to the local
 
02:11:43.990 --> 02:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
legislative body to vote on costs
 
02:11:46.470 --> 02:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
between $5 and $110,000 because you have
 
02:11:47.990 --> 02:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
to have someone draft it you have to put
 
02:11:49.950 --> 02:11:49.960 align:start position:0%
all those notices out you have to have
 
02:11:52.189 --> 02:11:52.199 align:start position:0%
the hearing you have to have staff there
 
02:11:54.109 --> 02:11:54.119 align:start position:0%
to take all the minutes you have to do
 
02:11:56.629 --> 02:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
all of these administrative processes
 
02:11:59.229 --> 02:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
just to have that vote um when we're
 
02:12:02.510 --> 02:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
talking about um you know trying to make
 
02:12:04.430 --> 02:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
significant changes at the local level
 
02:12:06.950 --> 02:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
those dollars add up um one of the
 
02:12:10.189 --> 02:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
programs that is administered out of uh
 
02:12:13.549 --> 02:12:13.559 align:start position:0%
invest inh and and now housing Champions
 
02:12:16.430 --> 02:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
um that Bea administers um provides
 
02:12:17.669 --> 02:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
Housing Opportunity what are called
 
02:12:19.149 --> 02:12:19.159 align:start position:0%
Housing Opportunity grants that help
 
02:12:21.669 --> 02:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
fund or kick start funding some of those
 
02:12:23.990 --> 02:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
rewrites at the local level of
 
02:12:26.870 --> 02:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
zoning um but you also have some
 
02:12:28.790 --> 02:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
probably some pretty good data from
 
02:12:31.510 --> 02:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
collected by agencies like Bea about you
 
02:12:33.750 --> 02:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
know what do people think about when
 
02:12:35.709 --> 02:12:35.719 align:start position:0%
they go and actually vote on this stuff
 
02:12:37.310 --> 02:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
what do they actually think about things
 
02:12:39.910 --> 02:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
like adus for example and and what do
 
02:12:43.030 --> 02:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
people say and then I think as policy
 
02:12:44.430 --> 02:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
makers you have to make the decision
 
02:12:47.830 --> 02:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
about you know is it worth costing uh
 
02:12:49.750 --> 02:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
you know letting letting this process
 
02:12:51.430 --> 02:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
play out or is it the case that we have
 
02:12:53.229 --> 02:12:53.239 align:start position:0%
good data that that's something that's
 
02:12:53.239 --> 02:12:54.510 align:start position:0%
good data that that's something that's
broadly

02:12:54.510 --> 02:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
broadly
 
02:12:58.669 --> 02:12:58.679 align:start position:0%
supported thank you representative
 
02:13:00.870 --> 02:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
M and I'm going to take one more
 
02:13:02.830 --> 02:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
question after this and then we'll
 
02:13:04.629 --> 02:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
because we're getting late thank you Mr
 
02:13:06.669 --> 02:13:06.679 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thanks for taking my
 
02:13:10.189 --> 02:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
question um given some of the the the
 
02:13:12.629 --> 02:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
ongoing challenges that businesses face
 
02:13:15.390 --> 02:13:15.400 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned housing Child Care
 
02:13:18.629 --> 02:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
electricity costs is there any data
 
02:13:22.229 --> 02:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
available that that shows how many of
 
02:13:25.549 --> 02:13:25.559 align:start position:0%
the new companies that are formed
 
02:13:28.830 --> 02:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
survive through you know a period of
 
02:13:31.709 --> 02:13:31.719 align:start position:0%
time three five years so that you kind
 
02:13:33.950 --> 02:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
of have a an we have an idea of kind of
 
02:13:39.069 --> 02:13:39.079 align:start position:0%
the net the net um uh company creation
 
02:13:41.910 --> 02:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
if if you if you know what I mean I
 
02:13:44.629 --> 02:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
understand your question so I'll as I
 
02:13:47.470 --> 02:13:47.480 align:start position:0%
said earlier if such data exists and I
 
02:13:49.390 --> 02:13:49.400 align:start position:0%
can find the person who has it I will
 
02:13:51.189 --> 02:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
find it and provide it to the committee
 
02:13:52.669 --> 02:13:52.679 align:start position:0%
great thank you very
 
02:13:55.629 --> 02:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
much representative ORS thank you Mr
 
02:13:57.669 --> 02:13:57.679 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks again for taking my
 
02:14:00.470 --> 02:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
question uh I'm gonna alter my question
 
02:14:02.549 --> 02:14:02.559 align:start position:0%
just a little bit based on what the rep
 
02:14:05.870 --> 02:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
asked but so if we uh our energy costs
 
02:14:08.109 --> 02:14:08.119 align:start position:0%
are so high we know that blue States
 
02:14:10.270 --> 02:14:10.280 align:start position:0%
continue to block the pipelines where we
 
02:14:12.470 --> 02:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
could increase the flow of natural gas
 
02:14:15.350 --> 02:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
and reduce our electricity costs in
 
02:14:17.270 --> 02:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
order to put more money back in the
 
02:14:19.270 --> 02:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
pockets of parents that need child care
 
02:14:22.470 --> 02:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
and so on are is the B a pushing to
 
02:14:25.830 --> 02:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
increase the nuclear energy Supply in
 
02:14:28.109 --> 02:14:28.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so that we can reduce our
 
02:14:30.510 --> 02:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
costs and maybe sell that extra Supply
 
02:14:33.470 --> 02:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
off to other states thank you thank you
 
02:14:35.229 --> 02:14:35.239 align:start position:0%
for the question representative I
 
02:14:38.430 --> 02:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
actually have a copy of our 2025 policy
 
02:14:39.790 --> 02:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
priorities that I can provide to you
 
02:14:44.229 --> 02:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
after the hearing um I as I recall it I
 
02:14:46.310 --> 02:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
don't believe we specifically have a
 
02:14:48.510 --> 02:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
policy on nuclear energy uh I know our
 
02:14:51.229 --> 02:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
general policy is in all of the the
 
02:14:55.830 --> 02:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
above policy uh to support policies that
 
02:14:58.790 --> 02:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
would according to the our knowledge of
 
02:15:02.709 --> 02:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
it support uh decreased energy costs as
 
02:15:04.430 --> 02:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
far as that specific question goes I
 
02:15:05.830 --> 02:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to that that's
 
02:15:07.149 --> 02:15:07.159 align:start position:0%
something I would have to bring to our
 
02:15:09.470 --> 02:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
board of directors to uh decide what
 
02:15:12.229 --> 02:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
they would like to do would love to get
 
02:15:14.910 --> 02:15:14.920 align:start position:0%
an answer on that thank
 
02:15:21.390 --> 02:15:21.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:23.149 --> 02:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
we'll now hear from the New Hampshire
 
02:15:52.470 --> 02:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:52.480 --> 02:16:47.469 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:16:47.469 --> 02:16:47.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:47.479 --> 02:16:53.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:16:53.190 --> 02:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:55.309 --> 02:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
yes maybe we could because we do we do
 
02:16:57.950 --> 02:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
all have a handout and uh so if we could
 
02:17:04.349 --> 02:17:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:06.669 --> 02:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
yourselves my name is Bob Quinn I am the

Hampshire Association Realtors and I am
 
02:17:18.030 --> 02:17:18.040 align:start position:0%
primarily a residential
 
02:17:20.270 --> 02:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
broker good morning my name is Chris
 
02:17:23.270 --> 02:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
Norwood I am the vice chair for the New
 
02:17:24.910 --> 02:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of Realtors public
 
02:17:27.629 --> 02:17:27.639 align:start position:0%
policy committee and my background is in
 
02:17:29.349 --> 02:17:29.359 align:start position:0%
commercial real estate brokerage so
 
02:17:31.349 --> 02:17:31.359 align:start position:0%
trying to talk about that intersection
 
02:17:32.990 --> 02:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
between the the presentation you just
 
02:17:35.230 --> 02:17:35.240 align:start position:0%
heard and uh in the real estate
 
02:17:38.669 --> 02:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:40.429 --> 02:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
well I think we're gonna have some
 
02:17:41.669 --> 02:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
slides up in a
 
02:17:45.429 --> 02:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
moment um so I know that uh you've
 
02:17:46.750 --> 02:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
already had everyone wants to talk about
 
02:17:49.150 --> 02:17:49.160 align:start position:0%
housing both Jason and N already
 
02:17:50.830 --> 02:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
provided uh a number of data points
 
02:17:53.589 --> 02:17:53.599 align:start position:0%
points on that so I will do my best not
 
02:17:56.150 --> 02:17:56.160 align:start position:0%
to repeat what they say but I didn't see
 
02:17:58.030 --> 02:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
all of nature so I apologize if that's
 
02:18:02.549 --> 02:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
the case so we have ended 2024 the
 
02:18:04.750 --> 02:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
median sale price in New Hampshire for
 
02:18:08.709 --> 02:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
single family home ended at
 
02:18:11.150 --> 02:18:11.160 align:start position:0%
$514,000 so as you can see that's the
 
02:18:12.750 --> 02:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
first time we've ever crossed the
 
02:18:15.669 --> 02:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
$500,000 Mark in fact uh this past
 
02:18:17.910 --> 02:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
summer we topped off at median sale
 
02:18:21.790 --> 02:18:21.800 align:start position:0%
price of $540,000
 
02:18:24.790 --> 02:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
so you can see that there has been a um
 
02:18:27.629 --> 02:18:27.639 align:start position:0%
this is goes back to 2005 a study
 
02:18:30.910 --> 02:18:30.920 align:start position:0%
increase in median sale
 
02:18:33.429 --> 02:18:33.439 align:start position:0%
price it's maybe hard for folks to see
 
02:18:36.349 --> 02:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
but um this these are the median sale
 
02:18:39.030 --> 02:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
price of every year going back to
 
02:18:42.750 --> 02:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
1998 um so in 2016 median sale price was
 
02:18:42.760 --> 02:18:44.030 align:start position:0%
1998 um so in 2016 median sale price was
about

02:18:44.030 --> 02:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:18:48.110 --> 02:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
$250,000 Statewide so since 2016 we are
 
02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:49.190 align:start position:0%
$250,000 Statewide so since 2016 we are
up

02:18:49.190 --> 02:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:18:53.709 --> 02:18:53.719 align:start position:0%
105% in in terms of uh sale price um
 
02:18:57.790 --> 02:18:57.800 align:start position:0%
while median income has risen by 50% so
 
02:19:00.629 --> 02:19:00.639 align:start position:0%
median income at 50 housing prices since
 
02:19:04.230 --> 02:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:08.309 --> 02:19:08.319 align:start position:0%
105% and you can see that during um we
 
02:19:11.270 --> 02:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
have seen increases uh in median sale
 
02:19:14.070 --> 02:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
price every year going
 
02:19:17.070 --> 02:19:17.080 align:start position:0%
back oh sorry well I was just going to
 
02:19:20.509 --> 02:19:20.519 align:start position:0%
point out that um the median sale price
 
02:19:24.910 --> 02:19:24.920 align:start position:0%
uh has gone up every year um since
 
02:19:27.910 --> 02:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
2011 I believe it is uh and in most
 
02:19:31.790 --> 02:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:34.669 --> 02:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
inflation so uh this next slide is sort
 
02:19:37.910 --> 02:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
of the homes for sale uh every month
 
02:19:41.910 --> 02:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
over since um January 1st of 2021 so you
 
02:19:45.070 --> 02:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
can see that 2024 we did have an
 
02:19:47.830 --> 02:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
increase in inventory over
 
02:19:51.510 --> 02:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
2023 um not by a lot but we did
 
02:19:55.790 --> 02:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
if you compare 2024 to both 2022 and
 
02:19:59.150 --> 02:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
2021 you'll see it looks awfully similar
 
02:20:01.550 --> 02:20:01.560 align:start position:0%
all right so yes you're going to see in
 
02:20:04.990 --> 02:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
um reports of increase in total number
 
02:20:06.550 --> 02:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
of homes for sale but I think it's
 
02:20:09.150 --> 02:20:09.160 align:start position:0%
important to look at that's generally
 
02:20:12.510 --> 02:20:12.520 align:start position:0%
compared to the previous year if you
 
02:20:15.950 --> 02:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
kind of take a longer view on that this
 
02:20:18.990 --> 02:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
is same information but there goes back
 
02:20:20.950 --> 02:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
to 2025
 
02:20:22.870 --> 02:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
so you can see that starting really
 
02:20:25.950 --> 02:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
about 2014 2015 we start to see a
 
02:20:28.910 --> 02:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
decrease in homes for sale in New
 
02:20:33.070 --> 02:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um the we get to the covid
 
02:20:36.190 --> 02:20:36.200 align:start position:0%
2020 and you see a dip um but I think
 
02:20:38.750 --> 02:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
it's fair to say that if the rate of
 
02:20:41.670 --> 02:20:41.680 align:start position:0%
decrease continued on from 2019 until
 
02:20:43.670 --> 02:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
today we kind of would have gotten to
 
02:20:45.990 --> 02:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
the same point uh Co kind of made us
 
02:20:47.790 --> 02:20:47.800 align:start position:0%
Sprint there along that path but we were
 
02:20:50.349 --> 02:20:50.359 align:start position:0%
headed that way anyway I'd also want to
 
02:20:51.630 --> 02:20:51.640 align:start position:0%
point out just you'll see a little red
 
02:20:55.070 --> 02:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
dot there uh in 2016 uh I'll get to that
 
02:20:58.309 --> 02:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
a little bit but that is um the last
 
02:21:00.670 --> 02:21:00.680 align:start position:0%
time that what we determine is a
 
02:21:02.270 --> 02:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
balanced housing market a balanced
 
02:21:03.910 --> 02:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
housing market means the buyers and
 
02:21:06.510 --> 02:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
sellers are an equal footing during
 
02:21:08.630 --> 02:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
negotiations right so the last time that
 
02:21:12.670 --> 02:21:12.680 align:start position:0%
was um we can see there were about 7500
 
02:21:16.630 --> 02:21:16.640 align:start position:0%
homes for sale Statewide um we barely
 
02:21:19.150 --> 02:21:19.160 align:start position:0%
are topping out on a monthly basis at
 
02:21:22.070 --> 02:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
2500 this year so we're about a third
 
02:21:24.950 --> 02:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
the number of homes for
 
02:21:28.030 --> 02:21:28.040 align:start position:0%
sale so when we talk about a balanced
 
02:21:29.550 --> 02:21:29.560 align:start position:0%
supply of
 
02:21:33.270 --> 02:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
housing uh it's every if you took all
 
02:21:35.870 --> 02:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
the homes that are on the market today
 
02:21:38.070 --> 02:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
at the current absorption rate the
 
02:21:40.070 --> 02:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
demand for housing how long would it
 
02:21:42.030 --> 02:21:42.040 align:start position:0%
take to eliminate all of the housing
 
02:21:44.590 --> 02:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
that was available today you want that
 
02:21:47.790 --> 02:21:47.800 align:start position:0%
to be 6 months we want six months of
 
02:21:50.190 --> 02:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
housing inventory that's a balance
 
02:21:52.230 --> 02:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
Market buyers and sellers on equal
 
02:21:55.790 --> 02:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
footing five might be the low range um
 
02:21:59.750 --> 02:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
but you really want six so in December
 
02:22:03.230 --> 02:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
we had 1.9 months all right so and you
 
02:22:05.429 --> 02:22:05.439 align:start position:0%
can see that it has been a steady
 
02:22:10.950 --> 02:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
decline uh over the past 10 12 years of
 
02:22:13.870 --> 02:22:13.880 align:start position:0%
housing inventory in the state and again
 
02:22:15.910 --> 02:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
that red line that red marker is the
 
02:22:20.790 --> 02:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:22.870 --> 02:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
the next chart here is what we call our
 
02:22:26.510 --> 02:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
affordability index so this charts three
 
02:22:29.070 --> 02:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
different factors what is the median
 
02:22:31.830 --> 02:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
sale price in any given month what is
 
02:22:34.950 --> 02:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
the median income family income in the
 
02:22:38.070 --> 02:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and that and what
 
02:22:41.590 --> 02:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
are the Prevailing mortgage rates so it
 
02:22:43.910 --> 02:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
sort of tracks what could a median
 
02:22:46.030 --> 02:22:46.040 align:start position:0%
family a family earning the median
 
02:22:46.040 --> 02:22:47.150 align:start position:0%
family a family earning the median
income

02:22:47.150 --> 02:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
income
 
02:22:50.990 --> 02:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
afford so that means if the the that
 
02:22:53.990 --> 02:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
index is at 100 that means the median
 
02:22:56.270 --> 02:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
income in the state can afford the
 
02:22:58.110 --> 02:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
median sale
 
02:23:00.270 --> 02:23:00.280 align:start position:0%
price you really want to see that number
 
02:23:04.150 --> 02:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
at 120 130 that means a majority of New
 
02:23:05.950 --> 02:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents can afford the
 
02:23:08.030 --> 02:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
median sale price home and you can see
 
02:23:11.710 --> 02:23:11.720 align:start position:0%
if you go back to 20 even 2018 and by
 
02:23:13.910 --> 02:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
the way this the gold is single family
 
02:23:17.070 --> 02:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
the blue is condo um so if you go back
 
02:23:18.469 --> 02:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
to you know
 
02:23:22.670 --> 02:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
2017 um we saw number is in the 150
 
02:23:27.630 --> 02:23:27.640 align:start position:0%
range the 2024 ended up with an index of
 
02:23:30.110 --> 02:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
58 that means the median income in the
 
02:23:32.790 --> 02:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire is only 58% of
 
02:23:35.750 --> 02:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
what it takes to buy that
 
02:23:38.950 --> 02:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
$514,000 home um that means an awful lot
 
02:23:40.590 --> 02:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
of people in New Hampshire are simply
 
02:23:43.670 --> 02:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
priced out they cannot afford uh housing
 
02:23:45.950 --> 02:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
in the state so keep in mind there are
 
02:23:47.670 --> 02:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
three factors to that if we're going to
 
02:23:50.030 --> 02:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
increase that number back up to where it
 
02:23:51.349 --> 02:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
should be
 
02:23:55.110 --> 02:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
you can either increase um median
 
02:23:57.510 --> 02:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
income which is going to be I would
 
02:23:59.150 --> 02:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
argue at least from our perspective a
 
02:24:02.269 --> 02:24:02.279 align:start position:0%
challenge to do as what n just mentioned
 
02:24:05.150 --> 02:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
how do businesses grow uh if they cannot
 
02:24:06.550 --> 02:24:06.560 align:start position:0%
find the workers because they don't have
 
02:24:07.990 --> 02:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
the housing to supply that for the
 
02:24:10.710 --> 02:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
workers um the other issue is um we see
 
02:24:13.070 --> 02:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
a change in mortgage rates um mortgage
 
02:24:15.790 --> 02:24:15.800 align:start position:0%
rates right now hovering varies and you
 
02:24:17.190 --> 02:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
can get different rates but let's call
 
02:24:20.429 --> 02:24:20.439 align:start position:0%
it 7% now um but keep in mind as
 
02:24:23.950 --> 02:24:23.960 align:start position:0%
inventory was dropping in 15 16 17 18 in
 
02:24:26.269 --> 02:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um mortgage rates were
 
02:24:29.550 --> 02:24:29.560 align:start position:0%
between 3 and 5% um most of the
 
02:24:31.510 --> 02:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
economist that we've seen nationally
 
02:24:32.750 --> 02:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's our own National
 
02:24:34.309 --> 02:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
Association of Realtors the home
 
02:24:36.790 --> 02:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
builders um I haven't seen anybody who
 
02:24:38.110 --> 02:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
have suggested that in the next year
 
02:24:39.750 --> 02:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
mortgage rates are going to drop below
 
02:24:41.750 --> 02:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
6% most of them are predicting they're
 
02:24:43.630 --> 02:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
going to be somewhere in the vicinity of
 
02:24:48.309 --> 02:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
6.5 um and by the way interest rates I
 
02:24:50.030 --> 02:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
think we've had three reductions in the
 
02:24:52.269 --> 02:24:52.279 align:start position:0%
interest rates um since Labor Day
 
02:24:53.830 --> 02:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
mortgage rates have gone up since that
 
02:24:55.830 --> 02:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
point mortgage rates don't track
 
02:24:58.630 --> 02:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
interest rates mortgage rates track um
 
02:25:02.269 --> 02:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
the 10-year treasury uh so um that's a
 
02:25:04.150 --> 02:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
better indicator of where mortgage rates
 
02:25:08.150 --> 02:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:11.309 --> 02:25:11.319 align:start position:0%
go so U again just sort of the same
 
02:25:12.950 --> 02:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
information but this is now looking over
 
02:25:14.550 --> 02:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
the past three years we're just seeing a
 
02:25:17.670 --> 02:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
steady decline in affordability in the
 
02:25:20.790 --> 02:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
state um and the ability of people in
 
02:25:22.950 --> 02:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to buy a
 
02:25:26.309 --> 02:25:26.319 align:start position:0%
home is it a and I think n may have
 
02:25:29.030 --> 02:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
brought up something similar is this a
 
02:25:31.510 --> 02:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire issue or is this just
 
02:25:33.670 --> 02:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
we're part of a national Trend so these
 
02:25:35.830 --> 02:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
are County medium sale prices in every
 
02:25:39.110 --> 02:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
County in the country um the blue are
 
02:25:41.830 --> 02:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
the less expensive um and as you see the
 
02:25:43.990 --> 02:25:44.000 align:start position:0%
red and the orange those are the most
 
02:25:46.070 --> 02:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
expensive Rockingham County is in the
 
02:25:49.630 --> 02:25:49.640 align:start position:0%
top 2 and a half% of median sale price
 
02:25:51.510 --> 02:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
homes in the entire country so of all
 
02:25:52.910 --> 02:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
the counties it's in the top 2 and a
 
02:25:55.790 --> 02:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
half% every County except Sullivan and
 
02:25:58.750 --> 02:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
Coos in New Hampshire is in the top
 
02:26:02.150 --> 02:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
10% um so you can see that there is a in
 
02:26:04.750 --> 02:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
the Northeast part of the the country
 
02:26:07.750 --> 02:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
there is um prices have are are higher
 
02:26:11.230 --> 02:26:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:13.550 --> 02:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and again I think Nate had a
 
02:26:16.269 --> 02:26:16.279 align:start position:0%
similar slide on home price appreciation
 
02:26:18.950 --> 02:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
since the arrival of covid um so New
 
02:26:23.070 --> 02:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's since um this is 2020
 
02:26:27.910 --> 02:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
quarter 1 to 2024 quarter 3 um so New
 
02:26:29.309 --> 02:26:29.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire median sale price has
 
02:26:29.319 --> 02:26:31.429 align:start position:0%
Hampshire median sale price has
increased

02:26:31.429 --> 02:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
increased
 
02:26:31.439 --> 02:26:33.070 align:start position:0%
increased
68.3%

02:26:33.070 --> 02:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
68.3%
 
02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:34.630 align:start position:0%
68.3%
um

02:26:34.630 --> 02:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:38.309 --> 02:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
the and we are fourth in the country uh
 
02:26:41.550 --> 02:26:41.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of increase in housing prices
 
02:26:43.870 --> 02:26:43.880 align:start position:0%
um I will point out that of those four
 
02:26:45.710 --> 02:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
states you see in front of front of you
 
02:26:47.550 --> 02:26:47.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's current median sale
 
02:26:52.790 --> 02:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
price is about 50 to 75 ,000 higher so
 
02:26:54.269 --> 02:26:54.279 align:start position:0%
we were at a higher point and we're
 
02:26:56.349 --> 02:26:56.359 align:start position:0%
increasing at pretty much the same rate
 
02:26:57.870 --> 02:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
than our neighboring states as well as
 
02:27:01.389 --> 02:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
Florida I think Florida is about 420 430
 
02:27:02.990 --> 02:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
right now in terms of their median sale
 
02:27:06.830 --> 02:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
price while we're at 4 514
 
02:27:10.590 --> 02:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
so we are a little bit unique I would
 
02:27:14.550 --> 02:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
argue so um part of uh I think as you
 
02:27:17.429 --> 02:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
look at where real estate transfer taxes
 
02:27:19.389 --> 02:27:19.399 align:start position:0%
might go other taxes it's going to be a
 
02:27:21.990 --> 02:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
lot of it how was is part of it is sort
 
02:27:24.269 --> 02:27:24.279 align:start position:0%
of the psychology of you know what is
 
02:27:26.590 --> 02:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
going to prompt and motivate people to
 
02:27:29.190 --> 02:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
move um there is a lot of discussion
 
02:27:31.950 --> 02:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
about sort of the mortgage lock concern
 
02:27:33.550 --> 02:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of folks in New Hampshire have
 
02:27:37.150 --> 02:27:37.160 align:start position:0%
mortgages at 3% 4% they look at a
 
02:27:38.670 --> 02:27:38.680 align:start position:0%
mortgage at s and they say they don't
 
02:27:40.190 --> 02:27:40.200 align:start position:0%
want to buy they don't want to sell they
 
02:27:42.990 --> 02:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
want to keep their 3 to 4 per. so there
 
02:27:46.110 --> 02:27:46.120 align:start position:0%
there is a factor um that plays into the
 
02:27:48.790 --> 02:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
lower mortgage rates getting closer um
 
02:27:50.950 --> 02:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
the but each year move forward there are
 
02:27:53.110 --> 02:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
fewer percentage of folks who have those
 
02:27:56.389 --> 02:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
mortgages under 6% we did do a a poll
 
02:27:57.710 --> 02:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
though we asked sort of trying to get to
 
02:27:59.150 --> 02:27:59.160 align:start position:0%
the psychology of what's going to have
 
02:28:02.030 --> 02:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
folks move uh in the upcoming year so we
 
02:28:04.510 --> 02:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
did a Statewide poll of residents in
 
02:28:04.520 --> 02:28:05.710 align:start position:0%
did a Statewide poll of residents in
early

02:28:05.710 --> 02:28:05.720 align:start position:0%
early
 
02:28:08.750 --> 02:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
December and we asked them first of all
 
02:28:10.790 --> 02:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
do you see a lack of housing inventory
 
02:28:13.030 --> 02:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
in your own home in your own Community
 
02:28:16.630 --> 02:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
excuse me um and you can see 60% say the
 
02:28:19.710 --> 02:28:19.720 align:start position:0%
availability of housing is a big problem
 
02:28:23.830 --> 02:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
only 18% said it is not a problem um
 
02:28:25.870 --> 02:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
similar numbers a little higher uh when
 
02:28:27.950 --> 02:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
we ask the question do you think there's
 
02:28:31.110 --> 02:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
enough housing types um so you have
 
02:28:33.590 --> 02:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
single family condos and and most people
 
02:28:37.910 --> 02:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:41.269 --> 02:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
not almost half of the
 
02:28:44.269 --> 02:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
residents say that uh their rent or
 
02:28:46.550 --> 02:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
mortgage puts a significant strain on
 
02:28:50.110 --> 02:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
their budget um and that is up with
 
02:28:53.630 --> 02:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
asked the exact same question in 2019 so
 
02:28:55.670 --> 02:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
as you saw that affordability index
 
02:28:59.230 --> 02:28:59.240 align:start position:0%
dropping um it's pretty obvious that
 
02:29:01.429 --> 02:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
this corresponds to that they're they're
 
02:29:03.150 --> 02:29:03.160 align:start position:0%
they're feeling the you can look at the
 
02:29:06.190 --> 02:29:06.200 align:start position:0%
numbers the showing that incomes are not
 
02:29:08.110 --> 02:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
keeping up with housing and now you see
 
02:29:10.070 --> 02:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
corresponding that it they're they're
 
02:29:12.429 --> 02:29:12.439 align:start position:0%
they're recognizing that and indicating
 
02:29:14.429 --> 02:29:14.439 align:start position:0%
that it's a a greater
 
02:29:18.110 --> 02:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
strain and shelter costs rent mortgages
 
02:29:20.870 --> 02:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
usually are for most of us uh the
 
02:29:23.110 --> 02:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
largest line item in your monthly budget
 
02:29:24.950 --> 02:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
so when that you feel the strain in that
 
02:29:27.429 --> 02:29:27.439 align:start position:0%
you feel uh problems with with your
 
02:29:29.750 --> 02:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
current situation
 
02:29:34.630 --> 02:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
economically um so and I think this is
 
02:29:38.590 --> 02:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
um a real concern is most folks in New
 
02:29:40.750 --> 02:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a large about half of folks in
 
02:29:43.830 --> 02:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um currently are not
 
02:29:46.070 --> 02:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
confident that the types of housing in
 
02:29:48.230 --> 02:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
their own Community would meet their
 
02:29:52.190 --> 02:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
needs um so if if they had to move about
 
02:29:53.750 --> 02:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
half of the folks in the state of New
 
02:29:56.349 --> 02:29:56.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now say I'm not sure I could
 
02:29:59.790 --> 02:29:59.800 align:start position:0%
afford to live uh in my own Community if
 
02:30:02.269 --> 02:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
I have to move um so that's a real
 
02:30:05.750 --> 02:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
concern uh as well and maybe kind of
 
02:30:07.790 --> 02:30:07.800 align:start position:0%
inhibiting folks from moving and we
 
02:30:09.870 --> 02:30:09.880 align:start position:0%
asked the same question in 2019 and it's
 
02:30:14.469 --> 02:30:14.479 align:start position:0%
up significantly it went from 27% up to
 
02:30:17.710 --> 02:30:17.720 align:start position:0%
48% so to try and make a pitch here in
 
02:30:20.429 --> 02:30:20.439 align:start position:0%
terms of you know maybe represent R's
 
02:30:23.469 --> 02:30:23.479 align:start position:0%
question about what can be done um
 
02:30:26.710 --> 02:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
imagine you're a young couple or you're
 
02:30:28.469 --> 02:30:28.479 align:start position:0%
older young couple starting a family or
 
02:30:30.590 --> 02:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
an older couple looking to downsize you
 
02:30:33.630 --> 02:30:33.640 align:start position:0%
want to build a nice 2,000t home um have
 
02:30:35.429 --> 02:30:35.439 align:start position:0%
a nice little backyard you can do on a
 
02:30:37.550 --> 02:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
quarter acre you go out you can find a
 
02:30:38.950 --> 02:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
quarter an acre let's just say and it
 
02:30:40.950 --> 02:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
varies very greatly depending on where
 
02:30:42.190 --> 02:30:42.200 align:start position:0%
you are in the state but let's just say
 
02:30:42.200 --> 02:30:43.550 align:start position:0%
you are in the state but let's just say
it's

02:30:43.550 --> 02:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:30:46.389 --> 02:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
$40,000 you can do that the town
 
02:30:47.830 --> 02:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
government comes back and says sorry
 
02:30:50.190 --> 02:30:50.200 align:start position:0%
that's illegal you can't build that home
 
02:30:52.990 --> 02:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
on a quarter acre you need an a full
 
02:30:55.710 --> 02:30:55.720 align:start position:0%
acre know in some areas that might mean
 
02:30:57.950 --> 02:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
your $40,000 now that you're ready to
 
02:31:01.870 --> 02:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
put down for land it could be 160
 
02:31:03.830 --> 02:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
probably not you can probably figure out
 
02:31:05.389 --> 02:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
a way but it's going to increase it by
 
02:31:09.030 --> 02:31:09.040 align:start position:0%
at least 50% if not more so the
 
02:31:12.269 --> 02:31:12.279 align:start position:0%
government regulations on that are in
 
02:31:13.910 --> 02:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
playing an important role and
 
02:31:16.429 --> 02:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
exacerbating the affordability crisis in
 
02:31:18.630 --> 02:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
the state so I think that there are
 
02:31:21.710 --> 02:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
options um that this legislature be
 
02:31:23.670 --> 02:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
looking at in the upcoming year to sort
 
02:31:27.230 --> 02:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
of help um resolve some of those issues
 
02:31:29.349 --> 02:31:29.359 align:start position:0%
and with that I think I'm done in moment
 
02:31:31.389 --> 02:31:31.399 align:start position:0%
me switch to I'm going to turn this over
 
02:31:31.399 --> 02:31:33.830 align:start position:0%
me switch to I'm going to turn this over
to

02:31:33.830 --> 02:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:31:36.830 --> 02:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
Sarah thank you again for having us um
 
02:31:39.429 --> 02:31:39.439 align:start position:0%
so I I want to put um you know kind of
 
02:31:41.469 --> 02:31:41.479 align:start position:0%
some a human perspective on this a
 
02:31:45.070 --> 02:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
little bit relative to keeping folks in
 
02:31:46.910 --> 02:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
their communities to be able to grow
 
02:31:49.269 --> 02:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
those roots sustain those roots um
 
02:31:52.110 --> 02:31:52.120 align:start position:0%
create that Legacy and to build that
 
02:31:53.910 --> 02:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
Workforce that we're all looking for for
 
02:31:55.710 --> 02:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
all those Industries and businesses that
 
02:31:58.030 --> 02:31:58.040 align:start position:0%
are looking to come in so this slide was
 
02:32:01.990 --> 02:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
utilized in a business and economy um uh
 
02:32:03.990 --> 02:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
conference a number of years ago and it
 
02:32:05.950 --> 02:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
really illustrates the different types
 
02:32:08.150 --> 02:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
of housing that may be needed by an
 
02:32:11.309 --> 02:32:11.319 align:start position:0%
individual person over their lifetime
 
02:32:14.389 --> 02:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
and right now with our lack of available
 
02:32:16.710 --> 02:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
types of housing within individual
 
02:32:20.070 --> 02:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
communities anyone that is experiencing
 
02:32:24.670 --> 02:32:24.680 align:start position:0%
um a temporary transition um uh looking
 
02:32:26.830 --> 02:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
for a rental maybe they're up they're
 
02:32:28.230 --> 02:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
having a child and they need a little
 
02:32:31.510 --> 02:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
bit more space any one of these Life
 
02:32:34.269 --> 02:32:34.279 align:start position:0%
Changes may have them moving outside of
 
02:32:36.429 --> 02:32:36.439 align:start position:0%
the community or outside of the state
 
02:32:38.750 --> 02:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
because there's not enough housing
 
02:32:40.910 --> 02:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
options within their Community to keep
 
02:32:43.510 --> 02:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
them where they are and there's an
 
02:32:45.790 --> 02:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
argument to be made and and history
 
02:32:48.670 --> 02:32:48.680 align:start position:0%
shows us that communities that have
 
02:32:52.150 --> 02:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
really strong bonds that are healthy
 
02:32:54.269 --> 02:32:54.279 align:start position:0%
have all different types of Housing and
 
02:32:56.550 --> 02:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
that are able to retain their community
 
02:32:58.710 --> 02:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
members for long periods of time and
 
02:33:01.269 --> 02:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
including Generations so if we don't
 
02:33:03.550 --> 02:33:03.560 align:start position:0%
have that available housing stock to
 
02:33:05.070 --> 02:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
keep people in the communities that
 
02:33:06.750 --> 02:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
they're at then they're going to leave
 
02:33:09.389 --> 02:33:09.399 align:start position:0%
so the the folks that are exiting our
 
02:33:11.950 --> 02:33:11.960 align:start position:0%
our state and our towns um are going to
 
02:33:14.070 --> 02:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
other places seeking something more
 
02:33:15.630 --> 02:33:15.640 align:start position:0%
affordable where they can put down roots
 
02:33:17.150 --> 02:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
and we're seeing folks coming in to do
 
02:33:19.910 --> 02:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
the same here but there's no place for
 
02:33:23.550 --> 02:33:23.560 align:start position:0%
to go they're often um leaving very
 
02:33:25.550 --> 02:33:25.560 align:start position:0%
shortly thereafter some of the data that
 
02:33:28.269 --> 02:33:28.279 align:start position:0%
we've looked at um those numbers are
 
02:33:30.510 --> 02:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
quick turnaround folks purchased homes
 
02:33:32.630 --> 02:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
to come here during covid and they're
 
02:33:35.230 --> 02:33:35.240 align:start position:0%
like this isn't for me and they sold and
 
02:33:37.030 --> 02:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
they left and now we have new faces in
 
02:33:40.510 --> 02:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
our community so one of the one of the
 
02:33:45.510 --> 02:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
um arguments that we see a lot about
 
02:33:48.230 --> 02:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
um changing some rules and regulations
 
02:33:50.349 --> 02:33:50.359 align:start position:0%
to allow more Housing and Community
 
02:33:53.790 --> 02:33:53.800 align:start position:0%
is that rural character and I don't want
 
02:33:55.590 --> 02:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
to say I cracked the code on Rural
 
02:33:56.990 --> 02:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
character and what it means because it's
 
02:33:59.269 --> 02:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
really difficult to qu quantify but I
 
02:34:01.510 --> 02:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
think it's that feeling of community
 
02:34:03.670 --> 02:34:03.680 align:start position:0%
when you walk into your grocery store
 
02:34:06.349 --> 02:34:06.359 align:start position:0%
your doctor's office um when you go to
 
02:34:08.190 --> 02:34:08.200 align:start position:0%
the town office you're seeing the same
 
02:34:12.030 --> 02:34:12.040 align:start position:0%
faces over and over and over again which
 
02:34:15.870 --> 02:34:15.880 align:start position:0%
is an economic Plus for our communities
 
02:34:17.950 --> 02:34:17.960 align:start position:0%
because we don't have that change over
 
02:34:20.150 --> 02:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
over and over again we create those
 
02:34:22.790 --> 02:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
bonds we get people to stay here longer
 
02:34:25.269 --> 02:34:25.279 align:start position:0%
who stay at their jobs um my husband's
 
02:34:28.750 --> 02:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
been at his position for over 30 years
 
02:34:32.429 --> 02:34:32.439 align:start position:0%
that is very difficult to find nowadays
 
02:34:34.429 --> 02:34:34.439 align:start position:0%
um but he was fortunate to grw up in the
 
02:34:37.030 --> 02:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
community in which he now still stays in
 
02:34:38.990 --> 02:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
we can't leave because there's no place
 
02:34:41.309 --> 02:34:41.319 align:start position:0%
for us to really go so I think it's
 
02:34:44.830 --> 02:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
important that we put um a personal uh
 
02:34:46.990 --> 02:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
like a human face to some of these
 
02:34:48.910 --> 02:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
statistics these are real people that
 
02:34:50.309 --> 02:34:50.319 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
02:34:53.429 --> 02:34:53.439 align:start position:0%
um and if you think about your own lives
 
02:34:55.309 --> 02:34:55.319 align:start position:0%
and what it is that you have encountered
 
02:34:56.990 --> 02:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
throughout your lifetime and what your
 
02:34:58.510 --> 02:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
children and your grandchildren are
 
02:35:01.349 --> 02:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
about to encounter that you want them to
 
02:35:02.950 --> 02:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
stay close you want them to stay in New
 
02:35:04.389 --> 02:35:04.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you want them to stay in their
 
02:35:06.230 --> 02:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
communities and love where they live
 
02:35:08.070 --> 02:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
because they're going to talk about it
 
02:35:10.630 --> 02:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
and attract more business more other
 
02:35:13.389 --> 02:35:13.399 align:start position:0%
more Workforce to come and stay here um
 
02:35:15.750 --> 02:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
and be able to keep those businesses and
 
02:35:17.870 --> 02:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
that our economy
 
02:35:20.309 --> 02:35:20.319 align:start position:0%
thriving um and with that maybe I'm
 
02:35:22.190 --> 02:35:22.200 align:start position:0%
going to hand it over to Chris so we got
 
02:35:23.269 --> 02:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
we can
 
02:35:26.070 --> 02:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh move you along Sarah and I handled
 
02:35:27.510 --> 02:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
the residential side and Chris is going
 
02:35:30.030 --> 02:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
to talk about commercial real estate um
 
02:35:31.710 --> 02:35:31.720 align:start position:0%
if I can May interrupt for a minute we
 
02:35:34.110 --> 02:35:34.120 align:start position:0%
have a question from represent elme
 
02:35:36.910 --> 02:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
thank you uh that slide in particular
 
02:35:40.510 --> 02:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
leads me to ask are you going to send us
 
02:35:42.349 --> 02:35:42.359 align:start position:0%
the digital
 
02:35:48.110 --> 02:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:50.110 --> 02:35:50.120 align:start position:0%
you uh could you jump jump to the next
 
02:35:50.120 --> 02:35:51.670 align:start position:0%
you uh could you jump jump to the next
slide

02:35:51.670 --> 02:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
slide
 
02:35:54.990 --> 02:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
there so uh what you see in front of you
 
02:35:57.710 --> 02:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
is uh specific to the commercial side of
 
02:36:00.590 --> 02:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
the real estate transfer tax so again my
 
02:36:02.790 --> 02:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
background is in commercial real estate
 
02:36:05.750 --> 02:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
and what I'm uh trying to ground the
 
02:36:09.710 --> 02:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
conversation here is the amount of real
 
02:36:12.389 --> 02:36:12.399 align:start position:0%
estate transfer tax that's generated by
 
02:36:14.590 --> 02:36:14.600 align:start position:0%
the residential transfers that Bob and
 
02:36:16.830 --> 02:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
Sarah have been talking about versus the
 
02:36:19.590 --> 02:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
commercial transfers so uh I probably
 
02:36:21.269 --> 02:36:21.279 align:start position:0%
should have put an interim slide in here
 
02:36:22.830 --> 02:36:22.840 align:start position:0%
but just to put it in kind of gross
 
02:36:25.550 --> 02:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
dollar amounts um uh
 
02:36:28.309 --> 02:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
2022 our transfer stamps in the state of
 
02:36:29.550 --> 02:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire according to the
 
02:36:32.750 --> 02:36:32.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue were around uh
 
02:36:34.910 --> 02:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
$232 uh
 
02:36:37.230 --> 02:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
million um as you can see on my
 
02:36:42.030 --> 02:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
calculation there um of that 232 around
 
02:36:44.349 --> 02:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
38 million of that were commercial
 
02:36:47.110 --> 02:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
transactions so you're talking uh you
 
02:36:49.790 --> 02:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
know quick math is probably around uh
 
02:36:53.870 --> 02:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
15% give or take um in
 
02:36:57.710 --> 02:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
2023 you can see the uh the volume of
 
02:36:59.590 --> 02:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
commercial real estate transfer tax
 
02:37:03.230 --> 02:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
declined down to 15 million uh and then
 
02:37:07.110 --> 02:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
um a slight uptick based upon um my
 
02:37:11.190 --> 02:37:11.200 align:start position:0%
projections of $19 million so what this
 
02:37:13.870 --> 02:37:13.880 align:start position:0%
slide is is hoping to try and capture
 
02:37:16.670 --> 02:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
for you is that when you look at the
 
02:37:19.550 --> 02:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer stamps which um is
 
02:37:21.389 --> 02:37:21.399 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
02:37:24.190 --> 02:37:24.200 align:start position:0%
$150 per every hundred thou for every
 
02:37:27.269 --> 02:37:27.279 align:start position:0%
,000 transferred paid by the buyer and
 
02:37:30.309 --> 02:37:30.319 align:start position:0%
the seller we're looking at somewhere
 
02:37:34.269 --> 02:37:34.279 align:start position:0%
around 80% of that being generated by
 
02:37:36.990 --> 02:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
the single family condominium
 
02:37:39.590 --> 02:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
residentials and land sales that Bob and
 
02:37:42.190 --> 02:37:42.200 align:start position:0%
Sarah were talking about and somewhere
 
02:37:45.550 --> 02:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
between 10 and 20% commercial i' I'd
 
02:37:48.389 --> 02:37:48.399 align:start position:0%
like to also note that there is around a
 
02:37:51.469 --> 02:37:51.479 align:start position:0%
5 or a 10% Gap if you were to add up all
 
02:37:53.190 --> 02:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
of Bob and Sarah's numbers and my
 
02:37:55.070 --> 02:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
numbers and that's due to the fact that
 
02:37:56.910 --> 02:37:56.920 align:start position:0%
there are off-market transfers there's
 
02:37:59.670 --> 02:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
also transfers that are not necessarily
 
02:38:02.630 --> 02:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
cleanly uh single family or commercial
 
02:38:04.950 --> 02:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
it could be a mixed use development uh
 
02:38:06.590 --> 02:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
those types of things so when we're
 
02:38:08.269 --> 02:38:08.279 align:start position:0%
talking about the real estate transfer
 
02:38:12.830 --> 02:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
stamps um solely just transfer stamps uh
 
02:38:14.750 --> 02:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
the residential sales are clearly the
 
02:38:18.510 --> 02:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
economic engine to bring in that 200 I
 
02:38:21.550 --> 02:38:21.560 align:start position:0%
think 2020 4 numbers were estimated to
 
02:38:24.830 --> 02:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
be around 183 million my reading of the
 
02:38:27.750 --> 02:38:27.760 align:start position:0%

02:38:31.230 --> 02:38:31.240 align:start position:0%
so um happy to answer any questions on
 
02:38:33.389 --> 02:38:33.399 align:start position:0%
this or anything else relating to that
 
02:38:35.830 --> 02:38:35.840 align:start position:0%

do you include commercial residential
 
02:38:48.230 --> 02:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
that is the apartment buildings that are
 
02:38:50.590 --> 02:38:50.600 align:start position:0%
built solely to ramp
 
02:38:52.269 --> 02:38:52.279 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh representative for the
 
02:38:54.990 --> 02:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
question uh yes this data is provided
 
02:38:56.790 --> 02:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
the commercial portion of this data is
 
02:38:59.790 --> 02:38:59.800 align:start position:0%
provided by an aggregator called co-star
 
02:39:01.510 --> 02:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
um and you may be familiar with some of
 
02:39:02.790 --> 02:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
their products
 
02:39:06.030 --> 02:39:06.040 align:start position:0%
apartments.com uh loopnet co-star But to
 
02:39:07.990 --> 02:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
answer your question yes that includes
 
02:39:10.030 --> 02:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
the transfer of uh multif family
 
02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:11.150 align:start position:0%
the transfer of uh multif family
investment

02:39:11.150 --> 02:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
investment
 
02:39:15.190 --> 02:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
property thank you and do you do you
 
02:39:20.990 --> 02:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
look at uh the effect of property taxes
 
02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:22.150 align:start position:0%
look at uh the effect of property taxes
as

02:39:22.150 --> 02:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:39:24.590 --> 02:39:24.600 align:start position:0%
well uh thank you representative for the
 
02:39:26.990 --> 02:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
question I was looking solely at the
 
02:39:30.030 --> 02:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
transfer stamps uh I have not looked at
 
02:39:32.670 --> 02:39:32.680 align:start position:0%
the valuation component and the revenue
 
02:39:36.070 --> 02:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:39.349 --> 02:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh representa
 
02:39:43.630 --> 02:39:43.640 align:start position:0%
M yeah I have a question on the uh uh
 
02:39:46.469 --> 02:39:46.479 align:start position:0%
commercial properties you've said that
 
02:39:48.870 --> 02:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
the some of the commercial properties
 
02:39:52.389 --> 02:39:52.399 align:start position:0%
are up of the investors investing in
 
02:39:55.630 --> 02:39:55.640 align:start position:0%
residential property I'm curious about
 
02:39:57.670 --> 02:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
just straight business property what do
 
02:40:00.550 --> 02:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
you see the trends in business property
 
02:40:02.349 --> 02:40:02.359 align:start position:0%
transactions thank you representative
 
02:40:04.870 --> 02:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
for the question so keeping this slide
 
02:40:08.110 --> 02:40:08.120 align:start position:0%
on the on the screen what you can see
 
02:40:11.309 --> 02:40:11.319 align:start position:0%
here this is anecdotal I don't have
 
02:40:13.110 --> 02:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
straight concrete evidence but what I
 
02:40:15.910 --> 02:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
believe was happening in 2020
 
02:40:19.349 --> 02:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
2021 into this peak of 2022 where we had
 
02:40:21.630 --> 02:40:21.640 align:start position:0%
had 2 and A2 billion worth of commercial
 
02:40:24.950 --> 02:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
transfers and it has since declined you
 
02:40:27.510 --> 02:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
had a lot of money on the sidelines in
 
02:40:29.389 --> 02:40:29.399 align:start position:0%
2020 and
 
02:40:32.630 --> 02:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
2021 when people really were unsure of
 
02:40:33.990 --> 02:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
themselves and unsure of where they
 
02:40:36.710 --> 02:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to be deploying their Capital uh
 
02:40:38.070 --> 02:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
and then you had
 
02:40:40.670 --> 02:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
simultaneously um a lot of federal
 
02:40:42.550 --> 02:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
stimulus funds right we can talk about
 
02:40:44.510 --> 02:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
the arpa or any other acronyms that I'm
 
02:40:46.110 --> 02:40:46.120 align:start position:0%
not going to be able to remember but
 
02:40:47.830 --> 02:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of federal stimulus coming
 
02:40:51.429 --> 02:40:51.439 align:start position:0%
through and so I I think that the uh the
 
02:40:54.110 --> 02:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
increase of commercial transactions
 
02:40:57.190 --> 02:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
going from about 10% of the overall real
 
02:41:02.469 --> 02:41:02.479 align:start position:0%
estate transfer tax up to um 15% was
 
02:41:04.990 --> 02:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
partially on interest partially on or
 
02:41:06.790 --> 02:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
interest rates partially on Lower
 
02:41:09.349 --> 02:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
construction costs and partially just a
 
02:41:12.070 --> 02:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
ton of capital that was completely
 
02:41:14.910 --> 02:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
paused for 20120 and
 
02:41:17.230 --> 02:41:17.240 align:start position:0%
2021 so I I hope that answers the
 
02:41:17.240 --> 02:41:20.469 align:start position:0%
2021 so I I hope that answers the
question

02:41:20.469 --> 02:41:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:22.349 --> 02:41:22.359 align:start position:0%
if I could follow up so what do you
 
02:41:24.150 --> 02:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
project for the trends going forward in
 
02:41:26.790 --> 02:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
the next two years for commercial real
 
02:41:28.429 --> 02:41:28.439 align:start position:0%
estate you think that's going to be
 
02:41:31.070 --> 02:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
holding study in terms of Supply demand
 
02:41:32.950 --> 02:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
is that someone in balance or is it way
 
02:41:34.190 --> 02:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
out of balance like we see in the
 
02:41:36.269 --> 02:41:36.279 align:start position:0%
residential side thank you
 
02:41:38.150 --> 02:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
representative for the question I I do
 
02:41:41.190 --> 02:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
think that it is uh out of balance but
 
02:41:43.590 --> 02:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
you have to talk in specifics to
 
02:41:45.790 --> 02:41:45.800 align:start position:0%
property classes so when I think of
 
02:41:47.230 --> 02:41:47.240 align:start position:0%
things that are out of balance I'm
 
02:41:48.790 --> 02:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
thinking specifically industrial
 
02:41:48.800 --> 02:41:49.910 align:start position:0%
thinking specifically industrial
property

02:41:49.910 --> 02:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
property
 
02:41:53.110 --> 02:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
um what coming out of the pandemic many
 
02:41:55.110 --> 02:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
businesses basically said I don't want
 
02:41:57.070 --> 02:41:57.080 align:start position:0%
to be caught in the supply chain bind
 
02:41:58.750 --> 02:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
again so I'm going to bring all my
 
02:42:00.710 --> 02:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
warehousing inh house I'm going to bring
 
02:42:02.710 --> 02:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
extra production in house I'm going to
 
02:42:05.349 --> 02:42:05.359 align:start position:0%
get that extra 10,000 square fet 50,000
 
02:42:07.349 --> 02:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
square feet so as a result our
 
02:42:10.910 --> 02:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
industrial Market has increased steadily
 
02:42:13.710 --> 02:42:13.720 align:start position:0%
not necessarily pertinent to today but
 
02:42:16.550 --> 02:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
for my entire 20-year career interest uh
 
02:42:18.150 --> 02:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
sorry rental rates for industrial
 
02:42:19.830 --> 02:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
property have always been like six bucks
 
02:42:23.309 --> 02:42:23.319 align:start position:0%
a foot I could set my watch to it now
 
02:42:25.309 --> 02:42:25.319 align:start position:0%
rental rates in the southern part of our
 
02:42:26.990 --> 02:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
state are in double digits per square
 
02:42:29.150 --> 02:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
foot you know you're it's not uncommon
 
02:42:31.910 --> 02:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
to see $1 11 122 a square foot which is
 
02:42:34.309 --> 02:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
very very uncommon so representative to
 
02:42:36.309 --> 02:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
your question I think it's very asset
 
02:42:39.110 --> 02:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
class specific I think industrial is
 
02:42:42.630 --> 02:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
very very tight retail is moderately an
 
02:42:44.590 --> 02:42:44.600 align:start position:0%
office despite the headlines that you
 
02:42:47.510 --> 02:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
read that office is uh on its behind I
 
02:42:50.269 --> 02:42:50.279 align:start position:0%
think that that's more um specific to
 
02:42:52.790 --> 02:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
Boston and the New Yorks of the world
 
02:42:54.870 --> 02:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in general uh has been
 
02:42:57.710 --> 02:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
very fortunate in our office supply uh
 
02:43:00.349 --> 02:43:00.359 align:start position:0%
we did not overbuild and also you see
 
02:43:02.150 --> 02:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
some of the Office Inventory being
 
02:43:05.030 --> 02:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
converted to residential uses so you see
 
02:43:07.590 --> 02:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
the the denominator decreasing for some
 
02:43:09.950 --> 02:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
of the office
 
02:43:12.389 --> 02:43:12.399 align:start position:0%
classes okay I have multiple questions
 
02:43:13.830 --> 02:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
from people so I'm going to try to go in
 
02:43:15.670 --> 02:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
the order that I saw the hands raised so
 
02:43:20.510 --> 02:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:21.910 --> 02:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking my
 
02:43:24.190 --> 02:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
question um I'm representative wrong I'm
 
02:43:26.910 --> 02:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
on the finance committee but um I'm
 
02:43:30.269 --> 02:43:30.279 align:start position:0%
looking at your slide 11 regarding the
 
02:43:32.150 --> 02:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
um almost half people say their rent or
 
02:43:34.230 --> 02:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
mortgage puts a significant or slight
 
02:43:37.030 --> 02:43:37.040 align:start position:0%
strain on their budget um have you been
 
02:43:39.070 --> 02:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
looking at the dynamic that's been
 
02:43:41.550 --> 02:43:41.560 align:start position:0%
occurring at least in my town of miramac
 
02:43:45.150 --> 02:43:45.160 align:start position:0%
where the increased house values and the
 
02:43:47.269 --> 02:43:47.279 align:start position:0%
increase is driving an increase in
 
02:43:49.990 --> 02:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
residential assessment at a much greater
 
02:43:51.190 --> 02:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
rate than what we're seeing in
 
02:43:54.389 --> 02:43:54.399 align:start position:0%
commercial and Industrial and so the the
 
02:43:57.070 --> 02:43:57.080 align:start position:0%
T the local property taxes are going up
 
02:43:58.990 --> 02:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
for residents even without an increase
 
02:44:00.990 --> 02:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
in spending because they're taking more
 
02:44:04.510 --> 02:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
of the burden of the the townwide
 
02:44:07.269 --> 02:44:07.279 align:start position:0%
assessment has that has that been a
 
02:44:10.309 --> 02:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
factor at all in any of the the data
 
02:44:11.670 --> 02:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
you've been looking at or is it
 
02:44:13.670 --> 02:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
something you're tracking because
 
02:44:15.550 --> 02:44:15.560 align:start position:0%
commercial Industrials now paying lower
 
02:44:17.349 --> 02:44:17.359 align:start position:0%
taxes than they would otherwise because
 
02:44:20.150 --> 02:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
of the assessment shift
 
02:44:24.230 --> 02:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:27.190 --> 02:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
yeah um so thank you representative for
 
02:44:29.950 --> 02:44:29.960 align:start position:0%
the question I um I'd have to give it a
 
02:44:31.590 --> 02:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
little bit more thought I think from
 
02:44:34.550 --> 02:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
just a high level um commercial taxes I
 
02:44:37.309 --> 02:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
mean for towns unlike Massachusetts
 
02:44:39.670 --> 02:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
which has an equalization ratio for New
 
02:44:41.590 --> 02:44:41.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire sorry for commercial versus
 
02:44:43.910 --> 02:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
residential property in the state of New
 
02:44:46.710 --> 02:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we do not have that same um
 
02:44:48.230 --> 02:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
Equalization ratio that you would
 
02:44:50.670 --> 02:44:50.680 align:start position:0%
otherwise have in Massachusetts so in
 
02:44:53.030 --> 02:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
theory there should be a uh an even
 
02:44:55.750 --> 02:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
playing field I I would have to really
 
02:45:00.510 --> 02:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
look into the increase burden of of
 
02:45:03.309 --> 02:45:03.319 align:start position:0%
uh valuations I think is your question
 
02:45:05.230 --> 02:45:05.240 align:start position:0%
representative because uh you know
 
02:45:08.110 --> 02:45:08.120 align:start position:0%
commercial values have gone up as well
 
02:45:10.750 --> 02:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
um not quite as dramatically as
 
02:45:13.710 --> 02:45:13.720 align:start position:0%
residential valuations but yes all all
 
02:45:17.190 --> 02:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
valuations are going up okay thank
 
02:45:20.230 --> 02:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
you and I think that it's also important
 
02:45:21.349 --> 02:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
to note
 
02:45:23.870 --> 02:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
that there are a number of factors that
 
02:45:26.510 --> 02:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
are associated with the increase in in
 
02:45:30.349 --> 02:45:30.359 align:start position:0%
one's tax bill right so um current use
 
02:45:32.349 --> 02:45:32.359 align:start position:0%
is a is a factor in reducing that
 
02:45:34.590 --> 02:45:34.600 align:start position:0%
taxation for larger tracks of land lots
 
02:45:37.150 --> 02:45:37.160 align:start position:0%
of municipalities are putting land in um
 
02:45:40.110 --> 02:45:40.120 align:start position:0%
into conservation in order to um to
 
02:45:42.750 --> 02:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
preserve that open space and none of
 
02:45:44.870 --> 02:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
these things are right or wrong they
 
02:45:47.429 --> 02:45:47.439 align:start position:0%
just are and they're kind of part of of
 
02:45:49.230 --> 02:45:49.240 align:start position:0%
the the web that we have to kind of
 
02:45:53.150 --> 02:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
navigate here but the property taxes are
 
02:45:55.349 --> 02:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
are a huge burden for folks we everybody
 
02:45:57.389 --> 02:45:57.399 align:start position:0%
just got their their newest uh
 
02:46:00.349 --> 02:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
assessment and Bill and I know in my my
 
02:46:02.349 --> 02:46:02.359 align:start position:0%
municipality folks are really struggling
 
02:46:04.070 --> 02:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
which makes me very nervous about what
 
02:46:07.630 --> 02:46:07.640 align:start position:0%
is to happen um when folks are not able
 
02:46:10.309 --> 02:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
to to pay that tax bill and the burden
 
02:46:11.750 --> 02:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
on the municipalities and then
 
02:46:13.750 --> 02:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
eventually the state on taking those
 
02:46:15.389 --> 02:46:15.399 align:start position:0%
properties back who is going to be
 
02:46:17.230 --> 02:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
purchasing them those folks that are
 
02:46:19.670 --> 02:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
displaced where do they go um and that's
 
02:46:21.389 --> 02:46:21.399 align:start position:0%
a that's a real concern that folks are
 
02:46:24.790 --> 02:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
talking about on the local level yeah
 
02:46:24.800 --> 02:46:26.670 align:start position:0%
talking about on the local level yeah
representative

02:46:26.670 --> 02:46:26.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:46:29.510 --> 02:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
ulery thank you we've had some rather
 
02:46:32.469 --> 02:46:32.479 align:start position:0%
large commercial
 
02:46:35.269 --> 02:46:35.279 align:start position:0%
industrial warehousing spaces built
 
02:46:36.670 --> 02:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
particularly in my
 
02:46:40.870 --> 02:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
town well over a million square feet uh
 
02:46:45.429 --> 02:46:45.439 align:start position:0%
London der has had a bunch Salems had
 
02:46:48.910 --> 02:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
some um there was even one up off root
 
02:46:50.590 --> 02:46:50.600 align:start position:0%
102 I saw the other day I think it was
 
02:46:53.269 --> 02:46:53.279 align:start position:0%
in Candia or one of I'm not sure one of
 
02:46:59.110 --> 02:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:01.309 --> 02:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
facility you would mention that there
 
02:47:02.750 --> 02:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
were some corporations that were
 
02:47:04.590 --> 02:47:04.600 align:start position:0%
concerned about the supply chain and
 
02:47:07.590 --> 02:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
decided to put the remote uh
 
02:47:07.600 --> 02:47:09.190 align:start position:0%
decided to put the remote uh
warehousing

02:47:09.190 --> 02:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
warehousing
 
02:47:12.670 --> 02:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
distributed State side as opposed to on
 
02:47:16.710 --> 02:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
time shipping from China or France or
 
02:47:19.750 --> 02:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
wherever um
 
02:47:23.349 --> 02:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
the question is those large
 
02:47:26.670 --> 02:47:26.680 align:start position:0%
facilities have added to the tax base of
 
02:47:26.680 --> 02:47:27.910 align:start position:0%
facilities have added to the tax base of
the

02:47:27.910 --> 02:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:47:31.790 --> 02:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
communities which have resulted
 
02:47:36.990 --> 02:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
in more capital or more Revenue to the
 
02:47:39.110 --> 02:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
communities what happened to the tax
 
02:47:41.110 --> 02:47:41.120 align:start position:0%
rate on the property that should have
 
02:47:43.269 --> 02:47:43.279 align:start position:0%
been offset on that do you have any data
 
02:47:43.279 --> 02:47:44.190 align:start position:0%
been offset on that do you have any data
on

02:47:44.190 --> 02:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:47:46.429 --> 02:47:46.439 align:start position:0%
that uh thank you representative for the
 
02:47:48.830 --> 02:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
question um no I I don't have any value
 
02:47:50.790 --> 02:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
valuation is similar to representative
 
02:47:53.349 --> 02:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
Run's question um I I think I would have
 
02:47:55.790 --> 02:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
to you know on a property by propy basis
 
02:47:58.910 --> 02:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
what was that land doing prior to was it
 
02:48:00.910 --> 02:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
as Sarah suggested sitting in current
 
02:48:03.190 --> 02:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
use whereby it wasn't being taxed and
 
02:48:04.950 --> 02:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
now it's being taken out of current use
 
02:48:07.110 --> 02:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
there's a penalty associated with that
 
02:48:10.309 --> 02:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
and now you have a 30 foot clear High
 
02:48:12.510 --> 02:48:12.520 align:start position:0%
100,000 foot industrial building being
 
02:48:15.230 --> 02:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
taxed at x 50 foot
 
02:48:18.990 --> 02:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
500,000 square foot and two of them but
 
02:48:20.790 --> 02:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
I think representative to your point
 
02:48:23.389 --> 02:48:23.399 align:start position:0%
about the the clear height there is a
 
02:48:25.670 --> 02:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
question of obsolescence meaning that we
 
02:48:27.710 --> 02:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
have a lot of industrial inventory that
 
02:48:30.710 --> 02:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
was built in the 80s um
 
02:48:32.870 --> 02:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
24,200 ft buildings there were a ton of
 
02:48:34.429 --> 02:48:34.439 align:start position:0%
them built up around the airport in in
 
02:48:37.070 --> 02:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
nashwa and we needed a revitalization of
 
02:48:39.590 --> 02:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
our industrial stock so part of this was
 
02:48:42.150 --> 02:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of pent up demand that you had
 
02:48:45.510 --> 02:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
been needing for about two
 
02:48:47.309 --> 02:48:47.319 align:start position:0%
decades thank
 
02:48:58.630 --> 02:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:02.269 --> 02:49:02.279 align:start position:0%
Maguire so um there were there going to
 
02:49:04.550 --> 02:49:04.560 align:start position:0%
be there were about 12,000 single family
 
02:49:06.870 --> 02:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
home sales uh in
 
02:49:11.389 --> 02:49:11.399 align:start position:0%
2024 we have seen that number 17 18,000
 
02:49:13.309 --> 02:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
in previous years and I have some
 
02:49:15.150 --> 02:49:15.160 align:start position:0%
figures I can distribute to afterwards
 
02:49:17.469 --> 02:49:17.479 align:start position:0%
that uh have that those
 
02:49:21.269 --> 02:49:21.279 align:start position:0%
numbers so so so we said I heard earlier
 
02:49:23.870 --> 02:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
that the goal was to have 8,000 building
 
02:49:27.630 --> 02:49:27.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:27.640 --> 02:49:30.469 align:start position:0%
 
significant

02:49:30.469 --> 02:49:30.479 align:start position:0%
significant
 
02:49:33.190 --> 02:49:33.200 align:start position:0%
imp yeah so the housing shortage that we
 
02:49:35.030 --> 02:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
have currently in this moment is over
 
02:49:37.830 --> 02:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
20,000 and by 2040 we're looking at a
 
02:49:38.950 --> 02:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
shortage of
 
02:49:43.030 --> 02:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
990,000 so um adding yes it will make a
 
02:49:45.830 --> 02:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
small a small dent um but we really need
 
02:49:48.070 --> 02:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
to reduce as many barriers as possible
 
02:49:50.830 --> 02:49:50.840 align:start position:0%
to be able to add um housing
 
02:49:53.710 --> 02:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
opportunities of all types um and
 
02:49:56.510 --> 02:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
especially in in the infill um using
 
02:49:58.349 --> 02:49:58.359 align:start position:0%
existing infrastructure so we don't
 
02:50:00.269 --> 02:50:00.279 align:start position:0%
increase those costs so that would look
 
02:50:00.279 --> 02:50:00.990 align:start position:0%
increase those costs so that would look
like

02:50:00.990 --> 02:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:50:04.269 --> 02:50:04.279 align:start position:0%
adus um and and filling out communities
 
02:50:06.710 --> 02:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
Cottage courts those types of things um
 
02:50:08.750 --> 02:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
which will also take that tax burden in
 
02:50:10.870 --> 02:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
a community and spread it amongst more
 
02:50:14.110 --> 02:50:14.120 align:start position:0%
Property Owners which in theory is going
 
02:50:17.349 --> 02:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
to reduce the overall um tax bill for
 
02:50:20.150 --> 02:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
each one of those community
 
02:50:42.990 --> 02:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:46.670 --> 02:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
Stringham yeah so um first to the number
 
02:50:49.950 --> 02:50:49.960 align:start position:0%
of um the the number of homes that were
 
02:50:52.269 --> 02:50:52.279 align:start position:0%
were needed currently those numbers the
 
02:50:55.229 --> 02:50:55.239 align:start position:0%
20,000 today and the 990,000 by 2040
 
02:50:57.630 --> 02:50:57.640 align:start position:0%
also includes shortterm some short-term
 
02:50:59.590 --> 02:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
rental stock because that is in our
 
02:51:01.349 --> 02:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
history in New Hampshire as a tourist
 
02:51:03.510 --> 02:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
destination so we shouldn't think that
 
02:51:05.510 --> 02:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
those are going to go away we just need
 
02:51:07.790 --> 02:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
to account for them um we did have some
 
02:51:10.269 --> 02:51:10.279 align:start position:0%
numbers and maybe Bob can speak to that
 
02:51:12.030 --> 02:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
um but when we're looking at short-term
 
02:51:15.070 --> 02:51:15.080 align:start position:0%
rentals there is a subset that is um for
 
02:51:17.389 --> 02:51:17.399 align:start position:0%
investment only so non-owner occupied
 
02:51:19.070 --> 02:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
but there are a number of folks who are
 
02:51:21.590 --> 02:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
utilizing short-term rentals to be able
 
02:51:23.670 --> 02:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
to pay their tax bill right so if they
 
02:51:26.990 --> 02:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
do have an Adu um and it's it's usually
 
02:51:29.670 --> 02:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
just a short-term solution for most to
 
02:51:32.469 --> 02:51:32.479 align:start position:0%
kind of get over the hump um me as an
 
02:51:34.349 --> 02:51:34.359 align:start position:0%
investor I purchased a property in
 
02:51:36.110 --> 02:51:36.120 align:start position:0%
Northern New Hampshire as a vacation
 
02:51:38.030 --> 02:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
home I did the short-term rental thing
 
02:51:40.190 --> 02:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
for a very short period of time it was
 
02:51:42.190 --> 02:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
not for me and there are a lot of folks
 
02:51:44.309 --> 02:51:44.319 align:start position:0%
that are like me that are and and I did
 
02:51:46.070 --> 02:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
sell it to somebody who now lives there
 
02:51:48.070 --> 02:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
full-time as a primary residents where
 
02:51:51.590 --> 02:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
it was not that prior to my ownership so
 
02:51:53.950 --> 02:51:53.960 align:start position:0%
I think the it's a very small subset
 
02:51:56.190 --> 02:51:56.200 align:start position:0%
that are doing short-term rentals purely
 
02:51:56.200 --> 02:51:57.150 align:start position:0%
that are doing short-term rentals purely
as

02:51:57.150 --> 02:51:57.160 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:51:58.990 --> 02:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
investment yeah if you want to dig into
 
02:52:00.030 --> 02:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
that a little deeper both the New
 
02:52:01.750 --> 02:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Finance Authority as
 
02:52:04.269 --> 02:52:04.279 align:start position:0%
well as the main Finance Authority um
 
02:52:06.030 --> 02:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
looked into that issue and study the
 
02:52:08.750 --> 02:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
impact on inventory as well as rental
 
02:52:11.429 --> 02:52:11.439 align:start position:0%
prices and I think I can summarize both
 
02:52:13.070 --> 02:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
of them saying that it didn't have an
 
02:52:15.150 --> 02:52:15.160 align:start position:0%
impact on either one and if you think
 
02:52:16.990 --> 02:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
about it it kind of makes sense a lot of
 
02:52:18.950 --> 02:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
what's used for short-term rentals if
 
02:52:22.269 --> 02:52:22.279 align:start position:0%
they are the ski condos up by Waterville
 
02:52:26.229 --> 02:52:26.239 align:start position:0%
or loon um and uh and and New Hampshire
 
02:52:29.110 --> 02:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
has always had uh a large number of
 
02:52:32.590 --> 02:52:32.600 align:start position:0%
second Homes New Hampshire Vermont and
 
02:52:34.910 --> 02:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
Maine rank one two and three in terms of
 
02:52:37.469 --> 02:52:37.479 align:start position:0%
the percentage of homes which are used
 
02:52:39.870 --> 02:52:39.880 align:start position:0%
as secondary homes uh and that's been
 
02:52:43.910 --> 02:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:46.190 --> 02:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
years representative elberger followed
 
02:52:46.200 --> 02:52:46.990 align:start position:0%
years representative elberger followed
by

02:52:46.990 --> 02:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:52:49.910 --> 02:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
shamberg thank you Mr Mr chair um you
 
02:52:51.309 --> 02:52:51.319 align:start position:0%
answered the first question I was going
 
02:52:53.750 --> 02:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
to ask you just now about secondary
 
02:52:56.710 --> 02:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
second homes but the other question that
 
02:53:00.110 --> 02:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
I have has to do with I will speak again
 
02:53:03.910 --> 02:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
for nasua the number of storefronts uh
 
02:53:07.070 --> 02:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
commercial properties that are empty has
 
02:53:09.190 --> 02:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
been increasing over the last several
 
02:53:13.469 --> 02:53:13.479 align:start position:0%
years uh given the rise in online
 
02:53:16.670 --> 02:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
commercial activity it seems unlikely
 
02:53:19.870 --> 02:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
that those properties are going to be
 
02:53:22.830 --> 02:53:22.840 align:start position:0%
utilized as new commercial
 
02:53:27.110 --> 02:53:27.120 align:start position:0%
properties what what are you seeing or
 
02:53:29.990 --> 02:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
might you be seeing in terms of
 
02:53:32.309 --> 02:53:32.319 align:start position:0%
potentially uh redesigning those
 
02:53:34.269 --> 02:53:34.279 align:start position:0%
properties as Residential
 
02:53:36.229 --> 02:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
Properties uh thank you representative
 
02:53:39.309 --> 02:53:39.319 align:start position:0%
for the question I think for uh you know
 
02:53:41.269 --> 02:53:41.279 align:start position:0%
particularly downtown environments well
 
02:53:42.790 --> 02:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
let's just talk retail in general I
 
02:53:45.110 --> 02:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
think retail in general over the last 20
 
02:53:46.950 --> 02:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
years has really become more
 
02:53:46.960 --> 02:53:48.389 align:start position:0%
years has really become more
experience-based

02:53:48.389 --> 02:53:48.399 align:start position:0%
experience-based
 
02:53:51.150 --> 02:53:51.160 align:start position:0%
so you think about uh a gym you know you
 
02:54:03.349 --> 02:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:05.630 --> 02:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
boxingsport by a grocery store or
 
02:54:08.349 --> 02:54:08.359 align:start position:0%
anchored by a CVS or something so I I
 
02:54:10.670 --> 02:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
label it as more experience-based and I
 
02:54:11.870 --> 02:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
do think that that's something our
 
02:54:14.269 --> 02:54:14.279 align:start position:0%
municipalities need to lean into because
 
02:54:16.710 --> 02:54:16.720 align:start position:0%
I know a lot of towns when they have uh
 
02:54:18.710 --> 02:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
you know downtown Urban environment or
 
02:54:20.630 --> 02:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
semi-urban environment they're
 
02:54:23.429 --> 02:54:23.439 align:start position:0%
accommodating to mixed use uh but they
 
02:54:25.750 --> 02:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
tend to want to preserve some retail on
 
02:54:27.910 --> 02:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
the ground floor and I do think that
 
02:54:30.349 --> 02:54:30.359 align:start position:0%
there is a retail aspect we just have to
 
02:54:32.910 --> 02:54:32.920 align:start position:0%
slightly change our thought of retail it
 
02:54:34.590 --> 02:54:34.600 align:start position:0%
could be a financial advisor that
 
02:54:37.110 --> 02:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
invites members of the public in or
 
02:54:39.990 --> 02:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
invites um you know an insurance agent
 
02:54:42.349 --> 02:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
but we have to just think about parking
 
02:54:44.910 --> 02:54:44.920 align:start position:0%
for those uh transient type uses where
 
02:54:46.790 --> 02:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
I'm just dropping in to meet with my Tax
 
02:54:49.710 --> 02:54:49.720 align:start position:0%
Advisor for a half hour heading out uh
 
02:54:51.309 --> 02:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
so I hope that that answers the question
 
02:54:53.830 --> 02:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
representative thank you representative
 
02:54:56.389 --> 02:54:56.399 align:start position:0%
shamberg thank you Mr chairman and this
 
02:54:59.309 --> 02:54:59.319 align:start position:0%
is a little bit different question uh
 
02:55:01.670 --> 02:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
what impact on sales or opportunities
 
02:55:04.349 --> 02:55:04.359 align:start position:0%
for sales would be affected if an
 
02:55:07.070 --> 02:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
additional El chip increase were
 
02:55:08.910 --> 02:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
included to save New Hampshire's
 
02:55:08.920 --> 02:55:16.030 align:start position:0%
included to save New Hampshire's
historical

02:55:16.030 --> 02:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:20.550 --> 02:55:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:23.469 --> 02:55:23.479 align:start position:0%
um so as far as inventory we need the
 
02:55:25.269 --> 02:55:25.279 align:start position:0%
inventory in order to be able to make
 
02:55:27.190 --> 02:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
those transfers to be able to have those
 
02:55:29.630 --> 02:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
funds um so I think that's the bigger
 
02:55:34.750 --> 02:55:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:37.550 --> 02:55:37.560 align:start position:0%
inventory anybody yeses
 
02:55:40.870 --> 02:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
op I don't want to um I don't want to in
 
02:55:43.910 --> 02:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
any way dismiss the idea that regulation
 
02:55:46.630 --> 02:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
in in many cases exclusionary zoning
 
02:55:48.750 --> 02:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things are are not an
 
02:55:50.389 --> 02:55:50.399 align:start position:0%
important aspect that need to be looked
 
02:55:52.990 --> 02:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
at I will say I represent a community
 
02:55:55.670 --> 02:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
and sit on the planning board we have no
 
02:55:55.680 --> 02:55:56.870 align:start position:0%
and sit on the planning board we have no
comprehensive

02:55:56.870 --> 02:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
 
02:56:00.830 --> 02:56:00.840 align:start position:0%
zoning um the only requirements we have
 
02:56:04.469 --> 02:56:04.479 align:start position:0%
are 50ft Road Frontage and a sufficient
 
02:56:06.990 --> 02:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
lot size to accommodate a well and a
 
02:56:09.830 --> 02:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
septic system unless you're on Town
 
02:56:13.670 --> 02:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
Water and Sewer um I I I'm not sure we
 
02:56:16.110 --> 02:56:16.120 align:start position:0%
could get any less restrictive than we
 
02:56:19.630 --> 02:56:19.640 align:start position:0%
are we still have a very very serious
 
02:56:23.469 --> 02:56:23.479 align:start position:0%
housing crisis in my town people are
 
02:56:26.389 --> 02:56:26.399 align:start position:0%
fearing um you
 
02:56:29.070 --> 02:56:29.080 align:start position:0%
know we had the conversation yesterday
 
02:56:30.990 --> 02:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
and a lot of folks don't understand how
 
02:56:32.790 --> 02:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
revaluation and the impact on their
 
02:56:35.950 --> 02:56:35.960 align:start position:0%
property taxes works but they're scared
 
02:56:35.960 --> 02:56:36.710 align:start position:0%
property taxes works but they're scared
about

02:56:36.710 --> 02:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:56:40.870 --> 02:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
it and I just want to I just want to ask
 
02:56:42.710 --> 02:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
you made the pitch for
 
02:56:45.510 --> 02:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
regulation appreciate it um I appreciate
 
02:56:47.429 --> 02:56:47.439 align:start position:0%
the study I heard two years ago when you
 
02:56:50.190 --> 02:56:50.200 align:start position:0%
talked about the impact of Housing and
 
02:56:53.190 --> 02:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
its impact on school costs and and that
 
02:56:55.710 --> 02:56:55.720 align:start position:0%
they're not necessarily the boogeyman
 
02:56:58.229 --> 02:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
that some folks think but I'm wondering
 
02:57:00.389 --> 02:57:00.399 align:start position:0%
if there are other things you're looking
 
02:57:02.830 --> 02:57:02.840 align:start position:0%
at one of the things in my community
 
02:57:05.469 --> 02:57:05.479 align:start position:0%
we're concerned about and again it's a
 
02:57:07.670 --> 02:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
function obviously of of housing costs
 
02:57:11.269 --> 02:57:11.279 align:start position:0%
and people looking for shelter we have
 
02:57:16.469 --> 02:57:16.479 align:start position:0%
probably three dozen or more um uh
 
02:57:19.670 --> 02:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
individuals or families living in
 
02:57:21.030 --> 02:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
um mobile
 
02:57:23.469 --> 02:57:23.479 align:start position:0%
homes um whether they have sufficient
 
02:57:26.630 --> 02:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
septic or not is
 
02:57:28.710 --> 02:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
questionable um and we had a
 
02:57:30.830 --> 02:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
conversation the other night about well
 
02:57:32.429 --> 02:57:32.439 align:start position:0%
you know maybe we should start enforcing
 
02:57:34.229 --> 02:57:34.239 align:start position:0%
the law which is only going to
 
02:57:36.389 --> 02:57:36.399 align:start position:0%
exacerbate a situation where people
 
02:57:38.030 --> 02:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
either end up
 
02:57:41.510 --> 02:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
homeless uh or on the town W welfare
 
02:57:41.520 --> 02:57:43.190 align:start position:0%
homeless uh or on the town W welfare
roles

02:57:43.190 --> 02:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
roles
 
02:57:46.550 --> 02:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
or God knows what um so I'm I'm just
 
02:57:49.830 --> 02:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
wondering if Beyond just
 
02:57:54.670 --> 02:57:54.680 align:start position:0%
you know the lot size and and other U
 
02:57:55.910 --> 02:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
easing of
 
02:57:57.670 --> 02:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
regulations are there other
 
02:57:59.790 --> 02:57:59.800 align:start position:0%
recommendations that that your
 
02:58:02.710 --> 02:58:02.720 align:start position:0%
Association can come up with for example
 
02:58:05.110 --> 02:58:05.120 align:start position:0%
in my community and I know my community
 
02:58:09.670 --> 02:58:09.680 align:start position:0%
is not alone not not a unicorn in in the
 
02:58:12.429 --> 02:58:12.439 align:start position:0%
state thank
 
02:58:12.439 --> 02:58:13.950 align:start position:0%
state thank
you

02:58:13.950 --> 02:58:13.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:58:16.670 --> 02:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
do well certainly we were supportive of
 
02:58:18.790 --> 02:58:18.800 align:start position:0%
um and I think that you had presentation
 
02:58:20.429 --> 02:58:20.439 align:start position:0%
yesterday with the invest New Hampshire
 
02:58:23.269 --> 02:58:23.279 align:start position:0%
funds and providing assistance um they
 
02:58:24.710 --> 02:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
have some great stories in terms of
 
02:58:25.910 --> 02:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
developments that were able to take
 
02:58:28.510 --> 02:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
place by adding that sort of financing
 
02:58:31.910 --> 02:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh in the stack so um certainly we're
 
02:58:35.590 --> 02:58:35.600 align:start position:0%
that would be an opportunity um and in
 
02:58:37.630 --> 02:58:37.640 align:start position:0%
terms of construction costs I know it's
 
02:58:39.190 --> 02:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
challenging for anyone in this room to
 
02:58:41.190 --> 02:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
have any impact but obviously higher
 
02:58:43.550 --> 02:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
interest rates makes construction more
 
02:58:45.750 --> 02:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
expensive um supplies become more
 
02:58:47.349 --> 02:58:47.359 align:start position:0%
expensive and prohibitive sometimes for
 
02:58:51.269 --> 02:58:51.279 align:start position:0%
folks who are looking to build um so
 
02:58:53.510 --> 02:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's there's not a I think we've always
 
02:58:55.229 --> 02:58:55.239 align:start position:0%
said there is not a silver bullet to
 
02:58:57.349 --> 02:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
this it's going to take um a
 
02:59:01.070 --> 02:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
multi-pronged approach in order to um in
 
02:59:02.670 --> 02:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
start to increase inventory and bring
 
02:59:04.070 --> 02:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
down those
 
02:59:06.670 --> 02:59:06.680 align:start position:0%
prices and uh representative I just want
 
02:59:08.630 --> 02:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
to also state I'm on the uh the board of
 
02:59:10.070 --> 02:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Housing Finance Authority
 
02:59:12.190 --> 02:59:12.200 align:start position:0%
one of the other volunteer hats and one
 
02:59:14.229 --> 02:59:14.239 align:start position:0%
of the things that I I've wrestled with
 
02:59:15.870 --> 02:59:15.880 align:start position:0%
our staff and board have wrestled with
 
02:59:19.150 --> 02:59:19.160 align:start position:0%
is how do you um how do you accommodate
 
02:59:23.110 --> 02:59:23.120 align:start position:0%
a smaller scale project that may not
 
02:59:24.950 --> 02:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
have the same economies of scale if
 
02:59:27.190 --> 02:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
you're going to build a so-called litech
 
02:59:29.150 --> 02:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
project low-income housing tax credit
 
02:59:31.590 --> 02:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
project you need a scale of 40 plus
 
02:59:34.070 --> 02:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
units to to build one on on you know
 
02:59:36.670 --> 02:59:36.680 align:start position:0%
green dirt not a renovation project but
 
02:59:38.469 --> 02:59:38.479 align:start position:0%
how can we make that barrier whether
 
02:59:41.110 --> 02:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
it's litech or some other affordable
 
02:59:44.990 --> 02:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
housing at a scale of 10 units or even
 
02:59:48.670 --> 02:59:48.680 align:start position:0%
six right something that may be uh some
 
02:59:51.150 --> 02:59:51.160 align:start position:0%
communities may not find as aggressive
 
02:59:53.990 --> 02:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
but also um something that is still
 
02:59:56.510 --> 02:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
economically viable for the developer
 
02:59:57.710 --> 02:59:57.720 align:start position:0%
and I could just tell you you know
 
02:59:59.269 --> 02:59:59.279 align:start position:0%
construction prices have remained a
 
03:00:01.190 --> 03:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
challenge and so I think as Bob
 
03:00:02.830 --> 03:00:02.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned any sort of stimulus as it
 
03:00:05.710 --> 03:00:05.720 align:start position:0%
relates to invest NH or the affordable
 
03:00:08.830 --> 03:00:08.840 align:start position:0%
housing fund um I can just say New
 
03:00:10.950 --> 03:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing is a is a great
 
03:00:13.309 --> 03:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
Steward of those funds
 
03:00:16.469 --> 03:00:16.479 align:start position:0%
follow um to that point Mr Norwood I'm
 
03:00:18.710 --> 03:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering um
 
03:00:21.590 --> 03:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
and scale is obviously an issue for for
 
03:00:24.269 --> 03:00:24.279 align:start position:0%
a smaller Community like mine uh I'm
 
03:00:27.229 --> 03:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
wondering are there uh Regional
 
03:00:29.790 --> 03:00:29.800 align:start position:0%
approaches to that that might help solve
 
03:00:31.389 --> 03:00:31.399 align:start position:0%
that problem are there examples of that
 
03:00:34.389 --> 03:00:34.399 align:start position:0%
or is that a consideration yes I think
 
03:00:37.990 --> 03:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
so Sarah you had a comment oh there are
 
03:00:41.229 --> 03:00:41.239 align:start position:0%
um there are Regional uh outlets for
 
03:00:43.429 --> 03:00:43.439 align:start position:0%
that so if you look at uh the the
 
03:00:46.349 --> 03:00:46.359 align:start position:0%
patchwork of uh community action
 
03:00:48.309 --> 03:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
programs that we have as as well as
 
03:00:50.910 --> 03:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
for-profit and nonprofit developers yes
 
03:00:53.429 --> 03:00:53.439 align:start position:0%
there are tools that we have uh but I
 
03:00:56.910 --> 03:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
still think it's that um it's the riddle
 
03:00:59.389 --> 03:00:59.399 align:start position:0%
of trying to get the economies a scale
 
03:01:01.990 --> 03:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
on a 10 to 15 unit project how can we do
 
03:01:05.670 --> 03:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:09.110 --> 03:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
chairman okay I think uh do we have any
 
03:01:12.510 --> 03:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
other questions if not we will proceed
 
03:01:12.520 --> 03:01:13.870 align:start position:0%
other questions if not we will proceed
to

03:01:13.870 --> 03:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:01:15.990 --> 03:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
lunch thank you very much thank you very
 
03:01:19.870 --> 03:01:19.880 align:start position:0%
much thank you st time
 
03:01:21.429 --> 03:01:21.439 align:start position:0%
all right so I'll see everybody back
 
03:01:24.790 --> 03:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
here at 1 pm and we'll we have two more
 
03:01:46.830 --> 03:01:46.840 align:start position:0%

04:06:02.469 --> 04:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
what we analyze as well and I know
 
04:06:04.070 --> 04:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
certainly of interest to the ways and
 
04:06:06.349 --> 04:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
means committees um at the discretion of
 
04:06:08.510 --> 04:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
the chair we're happy to take questions
 
04:06:10.830 --> 04:06:10.840 align:start position:0%
throughout we if we were to just run
 
04:06:12.149 --> 04:06:12.159 align:start position:0%
through this presentation together it
 
04:06:13.750 --> 04:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
would probably be about 40 minutes
 
04:06:15.670 --> 04:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
without questions so we have a little
 
04:06:17.830 --> 04:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
bit of time baked in for questions um so
 
04:06:19.550 --> 04:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
folks have them especially if you have a
 
04:06:21.550 --> 04:06:21.560 align:start position:0%
technical question about a a slide
 
04:06:23.510 --> 04:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
please at the discretion of the chair we
 
04:06:25.349 --> 04:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
don't mind being interrupted uh to
 
04:06:27.510 --> 04:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
especially to explain a slide okay great
 
04:06:29.429 --> 04:06:29.439 align:start position:0%
that sounds good thank you thank you
 
04:06:31.710 --> 04:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
again for the opportunity um so we'll
 
04:06:34.429 --> 04:06:34.439 align:start position:0%
start with a little bit about the
 
04:06:36.510 --> 04:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
economy and while we focus on the New
 
04:06:38.189 --> 04:06:38.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire economy I did want to put up
 
04:06:40.269 --> 04:06:40.279 align:start position:0%
one slide about the national economy you
 
04:06:41.790 --> 04:06:41.800 align:start position:0%
already heard some this morning and some
 
04:06:43.630 --> 04:06:43.640 align:start position:0%
yesterday about the state of the
 
04:06:45.870 --> 04:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
National economy and it's broadly strong
 
04:06:47.149 --> 04:06:47.159 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I think is pretty
 
04:06:49.189 --> 04:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
remarkable is we've gone from a period
 
04:06:51.149 --> 04:06:51.159 align:start position:0%
of high inflation following a period of
 
04:06:53.149 --> 04:06:53.159 align:start position:0%
high job growth rebounding from after
 
04:06:55.349 --> 04:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
the losses associated with the covid-19
 
04:06:57.990 --> 04:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic to a lower level of inflation
 
04:07:00.030 --> 04:07:00.040 align:start position:0%
while sustaining job growth throughout
 
04:07:01.990 --> 04:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
this is the so-called soft Landing it's
 
04:07:03.910 --> 04:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
pretty remarkable that this has happened
 
04:07:05.990 --> 04:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
and in a way that has been um where we
 
04:07:07.990 --> 04:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
still had economic growth sustained
 
04:07:10.950 --> 04:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
through most of this period um and uh
 
04:07:12.710 --> 04:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
the most recent data the December data
 
04:07:14.550 --> 04:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
aren't on this graph but also we're
 
04:07:16.950 --> 04:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
pretty substantial job growth inflation
 
04:07:18.469 --> 04:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
is still a little bit higher though than
 
04:07:20.389 --> 04:07:20.399 align:start position:0%
those Target rates we'll see where it
 
04:07:21.870 --> 04:07:21.880 align:start position:0%
ends up in
 
04:07:24.469 --> 04:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
20125 now moving on to the New Hampshire
 
04:07:27.510 --> 04:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
economy this shows median household
 
04:07:29.990 --> 04:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
income uh for so this is the middle
 
04:07:31.349 --> 04:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
household in the middle of the income
 
04:07:33.349 --> 04:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
distribution in New Hampshire adjusted
 
04:07:34.950 --> 04:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
for inflation and note that the graph
 
04:07:37.229 --> 04:07:37.239 align:start position:0%
starts at $50,000 so we've zoomed in so
 
04:07:39.149 --> 04:07:39.159 align:start position:0%
you can see some of the variation over
 
04:07:41.349 --> 04:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
time this is going back to 2005 so
 
04:07:43.189 --> 04:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
before the Great Recession you can see
 
04:07:44.830 --> 04:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
the pre Great Recession Peak if you
 
04:07:47.149 --> 04:07:47.159 align:start position:0%
adjust for inflation was 2007 then it
 
04:07:50.030 --> 04:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
took a long time for the losses
 
04:07:52.030 --> 04:07:52.040 align:start position:0%
associated with the Great Recession the
 
04:07:54.309 --> 04:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
losses in real income and spending power
 
04:07:57.070 --> 04:07:57.080 align:start position:0%
to recover that was about a decade of of
 
04:07:58.590 --> 04:07:58.600 align:start position:0%
time where spending power was either
 
04:08:00.830 --> 04:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
lower or right about the same level for
 
04:08:03.910 --> 04:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
the median household and then we we
 
04:08:05.630 --> 04:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
didn't have data in 2020 unfortunately a
 
04:08:07.030 --> 04:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
lot of people weren't answering surveys
 
04:08:08.429 --> 04:08:08.439 align:start position:0%
and the Census Bureau was busy with
 
04:08:11.149 --> 04:08:11.159 align:start position:0%
other things in 2020 um but we see a
 
04:08:12.469 --> 04:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
much different recovery from the
 
04:08:14.030 --> 04:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
covid-19 crisis which was a much
 
04:08:15.389 --> 04:08:15.399 align:start position:0%
different recession right a much
 
04:08:17.349 --> 04:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
different economic situation than we saw
 
04:08:19.109 --> 04:08:19.119 align:start position:0%
in the Great Recession um but we saw
 
04:08:21.149 --> 04:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
median household income actually go up
 
04:08:22.670 --> 04:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
substantially relative to where it had
 
04:08:25.349 --> 04:08:25.359 align:start position:0%
been prior to the covid-19 crisis then
 
04:08:28.149 --> 04:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
it slipped in 2022 relative to inflation
 
04:08:30.269 --> 04:08:30.279 align:start position:0%
right so median household income dropped
 
04:08:32.189 --> 04:08:32.199 align:start position:0%
if you adjust for inflation between 2021
 
04:08:35.149 --> 04:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
and 2022 and then went back up in 2023
 
04:08:37.510 --> 04:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
to about where it was not quite if you
 
04:08:40.309 --> 04:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
are pursing hairs but about where it was
 
04:08:42.670 --> 04:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
in 2021 so that's a good sign right
 
04:08:44.349 --> 04:08:44.359 align:start position:0%
that's that shows that unfortunately the
 
04:08:45.750 --> 04:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
most recent data we have in this data
 
04:08:47.790 --> 04:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
set is 2023 but that shows that the
 
04:08:49.389 --> 04:08:49.399 align:start position:0%
spending power of households did
 
04:08:52.590 --> 04:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
increase after being eroded by inflation
 
04:08:54.349 --> 04:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
now that's the median household which
 
04:08:57.309 --> 04:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
had about $997,000 in 2023 and that's
 
04:09:00.830 --> 04:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
for all household sizes uh now um and by
 
04:09:02.349 --> 04:09:02.359 align:start position:0%
the way the average household size in
 
04:09:05.309 --> 04:09:05.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is was in 2023 about 2.4
 
04:09:07.309 --> 04:09:07.319 align:start position:0%
people um and that's a little lower than
 
04:09:09.229 --> 04:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
the national household size the national
 
04:09:11.030 --> 04:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
average for household size what about
 
04:09:13.389 --> 04:09:13.399 align:start position:0%
the distribution of incomes around that
 
04:09:15.269 --> 04:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
median so you can see on the pie chart
 
04:09:16.670 --> 04:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
here that there's a pretty broad
 
04:09:18.710 --> 04:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
distribution these are the um categories
 
04:09:20.309 --> 04:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
of incomes that the Census Bureau gives
 
04:09:22.750 --> 04:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
us with some uh combined to simplify the
 
04:09:25.309 --> 04:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
graph but you can see almost 16% of
 
04:09:27.429 --> 04:09:27.439 align:start position:0%
households had incomes at or above
 
04:09:30.830 --> 04:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
$200,000 in 2023 about one in four New
 
04:09:32.710 --> 04:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire households had incomes below
 
04:09:36.349 --> 04:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
$50,000 in those 2023 data and about 11%
 
04:09:37.349 --> 04:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
had below
 
04:09:41.109 --> 04:09:41.119 align:start position:0%
$25,000 in annual income in 2023 now
 
04:09:42.469 --> 04:09:42.479 align:start position:0%
some of those households were probably
 
04:09:43.990 --> 04:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
in poverty but just just give you a
 
04:09:45.469 --> 04:09:45.479 align:start position:0%
sense of the poverty thresholds we'll
 
04:09:47.309 --> 04:09:47.319 align:start position:0%
talk about poverty rates a little more
 
04:09:49.670 --> 04:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
in this later in this presentation uh
 
04:09:51.750 --> 04:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
the poverty threshold in 2023 for a
 
04:09:54.429 --> 04:09:54.439 align:start position:0%
single person under 65 years old was a
 
04:09:55.469 --> 04:09:55.479 align:start position:0%
little under
 
04:09:58.269 --> 04:09:58.279 align:start position:0%
$166,000 in that year so um and that's
 
04:09:59.870 --> 04:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
by the way that's a National Standard so
 
04:10:01.790 --> 04:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
that's that poverty threshold is true
 
04:10:04.910 --> 04:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
for all the contiguous 48 states right
 
04:10:06.349 --> 04:10:06.359 align:start position:0%
that the official measure of poverty
 
04:10:08.469 --> 04:10:08.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't adjust for regional variation
 
04:10:11.269 --> 04:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
except for Alaska and Hawaii and for a
 
04:10:12.750 --> 04:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
three person household with one child it
 
04:10:14.990 --> 04:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
was a little under $225,000 so when we
 
04:10:16.750 --> 04:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
think about the household compositions
 
04:10:18.309 --> 04:10:18.319 align:start position:0%
for those households in that sort of
 
04:10:21.630 --> 04:10:21.640 align:start position:0%
bottom 11% of incomes you know that
 
04:10:22.950 --> 04:10:22.960 align:start position:0%
composition matters as to whether they
 
04:10:26.030 --> 04:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
qualify as being in poverty or not now
 
04:10:27.870 --> 04:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
what about personal income if we measure
 
04:10:29.750 --> 04:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
personal income per capita so how much
 
04:10:32.070 --> 04:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
household in individual income was there
 
04:10:33.790 --> 04:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire divided by the number
 
04:10:36.269 --> 04:10:36.279 align:start position:0%
of people and adjusted for inflation um
 
04:10:38.070 --> 04:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
so you can see on the graph here on the
 
04:10:41.229 --> 04:10:41.239 align:start position:0%
right if we compare 2019 to 2022 which
 
04:10:44.309 --> 04:10:44.319 align:start position:0%
is green or uh cross thatched uh the bar
 
04:10:47.070 --> 04:10:47.080 align:start position:0%
or the and the solid bar is 2019 to 2023
 
04:10:48.189 --> 04:10:48.199 align:start position:0%
and you can see here where the years
 
04:10:50.510 --> 04:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
matter quite a bit right we saw in New
 
04:10:52.550 --> 04:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire more personal income growth
 
04:10:55.630 --> 04:10:55.640 align:start position:0%
between 2022 and 2023 than some of our
 
04:10:58.229 --> 04:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
neighboring states but overall relative
 
04:11:00.830 --> 04:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
to 2019 personal income was behind in
 
04:11:02.670 --> 04:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
terms of its growth rate this is not the
 
04:11:05.510 --> 04:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
level this is the growth rate um uh from
 
04:11:07.790 --> 04:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
2019 to 2023 so this shows you that the
 
04:11:09.269 --> 04:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
years matter right the years definitely
 
04:11:10.550 --> 04:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
matter where you're benchmarking where
 
04:11:12.550 --> 04:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
you're starting but that we may have had
 
04:11:14.149 --> 04:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
a little bit less income growth in New
 
04:11:16.990 --> 04:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um uh across the pandemic than
 
04:11:19.630 --> 04:11:19.640 align:start position:0%
we saw in some of our neighboring states
 
04:11:21.870 --> 04:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
now expanding beyond the data that you
 
04:11:24.070 --> 04:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
see in that graph if we look at some of
 
04:11:25.590 --> 04:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
the patterns around New England because
 
04:11:27.229 --> 04:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
I I want to unpack this a little bit
 
04:11:29.710 --> 04:11:29.720 align:start position:0%
more for you uh New Hampshire in New
 
04:11:31.590 --> 04:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
England had some pretty similar patterns
 
04:11:33.149 --> 04:11:33.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of income growth if you look
 
04:11:35.870 --> 04:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
back to 2018 and look through 2023 and
 
04:11:37.910 --> 04:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
we don't have a full year data for 20124
 
04:11:39.389 --> 04:11:39.399 align:start position:0%
yet but if you look at the first three
 
04:11:42.109 --> 04:11:42.119 align:start position:0%
quarters of 2024 then our income growth
 
04:11:43.510 --> 04:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
is pretty similar to what you see in New
 
04:11:45.389 --> 04:11:45.399 align:start position:0%
England so we're not diverging
 
04:11:47.109 --> 04:11:47.119 align:start position:0%
dramatically at least based on the
 
04:11:50.870 --> 04:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
preliminary data we have thus far in
 
04:11:53.670 --> 04:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
2024 now uh I've mentioned some of the
 
04:11:55.149 --> 04:11:55.159 align:start position:0%
data limitations about what do we have
 
04:11:57.510 --> 04:11:57.520 align:start position:0%
yet for 2024 or not some of the early
 
04:11:59.830 --> 04:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
data that we do have for 2024 for the
 
04:12:02.510 --> 04:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
first 11 months of it is about wages so
 
04:12:04.950 --> 04:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
what you're seeing here is inflation
 
04:12:08.429 --> 04:12:08.439 align:start position:0%
adjusted change in uh the average
 
04:12:10.149 --> 04:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
private sector wage this is an average
 
04:12:12.870 --> 04:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
not a median and uh this is preliminary
 
04:12:16.630 --> 04:12:16.640 align:start position:0%
data for the first 11 months of 2024 and
 
04:12:17.990 --> 04:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
you can see some patterns here that may
 
04:12:19.990 --> 04:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
be similar to or may remind you of what
 
04:12:21.670 --> 04:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
you saw in the median household income
 
04:12:24.030 --> 04:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
graph where we saw that there were you
 
04:12:26.469 --> 04:12:26.479 align:start position:0%
know some years um in in the last decade
 
04:12:30.149 --> 04:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
where inflation uh did outpace uh the
 
04:12:32.149 --> 04:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
average wage some years where it did not
 
04:12:34.429 --> 04:12:34.439 align:start position:0%
outpace the average wage in 2020 you see
 
04:12:37.710 --> 04:12:37.720 align:start position:0%
that big increase remember uh if you a
 
04:12:40.229 --> 04:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
lot of individuals who had lower incomes
 
04:12:42.229 --> 04:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
lost employment right so that means they
 
04:12:43.990 --> 04:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
don't get calculated in their average in
 
04:12:46.030 --> 04:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
the average wage uh for private sector
 
04:12:47.630 --> 04:12:47.640 align:start position:0%
wages anymore so that's part of why we
 
04:12:50.269 --> 04:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
see that substantial increase 2021
 
04:12:52.790 --> 04:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
though we saw another increase 2022 we
 
04:12:55.790 --> 04:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
saw average wages slip behind inflation
 
04:12:57.950 --> 04:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
2023 again like the median household
 
04:13:00.109 --> 04:13:00.119 align:start position:0%
income we saw more of a positive number
 
04:13:02.349 --> 04:13:02.359 align:start position:0%
2024 we don't know yet because these are
 
04:13:03.790 --> 04:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
still preliminary but it looks like we
 
04:13:06.070 --> 04:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
might be slipping behind inflation again
 
04:13:08.389 --> 04:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
um now I do want to note that um uh
 
04:13:11.070 --> 04:13:11.080 align:start position:0%
director Golab did have a if I may
 
04:13:13.830 --> 04:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
interrup representative thank you Mr
 
04:13:16.710 --> 04:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
chair um one quick question how closely
 
04:13:19.790 --> 04:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
does this slide track with
 
04:13:22.269 --> 04:13:22.279 align:start position:0%
national so very good question I was
 
04:13:23.710 --> 04:13:23.720 align:start position:0%
actually just where I was going so thank
 
04:13:25.870 --> 04:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
you um the National Data that director
 
04:13:28.070 --> 04:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
golob showed you yesterday um it was
 
04:13:30.950 --> 04:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
interesting to see how much more wages
 
04:13:33.429 --> 04:13:33.439 align:start position:0%
were appeared to be outpacing inflation
 
04:13:34.790 --> 04:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
at the national level than at least
 
04:13:36.670 --> 04:13:36.680 align:start position:0%
these preliminary New Hampshire data so
 
04:13:37.750 --> 04:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know the reason for the
 
04:13:39.950 --> 04:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
discrepancy these data could be revised
 
04:13:40.950 --> 04:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
right you know the New Hampshire data
 
04:13:42.630 --> 04:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
are based on fewer surveys right or
 
04:13:42.640 --> 04:13:43.590 align:start position:0%
are based on fewer surveys right or
fewer

04:13:43.590 --> 04:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
fewer
 
04:13:45.349 --> 04:13:45.359 align:start position:0%
um data collection a smaller amount of
 
04:13:46.870 --> 04:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
data collection from businesses right
 
04:13:48.710 --> 04:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
because these are effectively um this is
 
04:13:50.269 --> 04:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
from the current employment survey so
 
04:13:52.229 --> 04:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
this is collected from businesses
 
04:13:54.590 --> 04:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
themselves these could be revised when
 
04:13:56.469 --> 04:13:56.479 align:start position:0%
the benchmarking process happens early
 
04:13:58.229 --> 04:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
next year and that may bring us more in
 
04:13:59.429 --> 04:13:59.439 align:start position:0%
line with what we see at the national
 
04:14:01.269 --> 04:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
level but I was surprised to see that
 
04:14:02.750 --> 04:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
difference between what we see
 
04:14:03.670 --> 04:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
nationally and what we see in New
 
04:14:04.710 --> 04:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is particularly given our
 
04:14:06.870 --> 04:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
labor force constraint here thank you y
 
04:14:06.880 --> 04:14:08.149 align:start position:0%
labor force constraint here thank you y
you're

04:14:08.149 --> 04:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
you're
 
04:14:12.229 --> 04:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
welcome great um so let's look at the
 
04:14:14.710 --> 04:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
distribution of wages across income
 
04:14:16.349 --> 04:14:16.359 align:start position:0%
groups and again here we don't have data
 
04:14:19.870 --> 04:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
for 2024 and because we're facing you
 
04:14:21.269 --> 04:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
know limited data in some of these
 
04:14:23.910 --> 04:14:23.920 align:start position:0%
surveys these are threeyear averages and
 
04:14:26.109 --> 04:14:26.119 align:start position:0%
this is over a very long time Horizon so
 
04:14:28.429 --> 04:14:28.439 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here is comparing the
 
04:14:33.109 --> 04:14:33.119 align:start position:0%
2024 to 2026 average wage by percentile
 
04:14:36.630 --> 04:14:36.640 align:start position:0%
to just before the pandemic 2017 to 2019
 
04:14:38.309 --> 04:14:38.319 align:start position:0%
and the most recent data we have which
 
04:14:41.990 --> 04:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
is 2021 to 2023 and the the value of
 
04:14:44.550 --> 04:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
these data is it show shows you at a
 
04:14:46.429 --> 04:14:46.439 align:start position:0%
more granular level what's happening
 
04:14:48.469 --> 04:14:48.479 align:start position:0%
with wage growth at different parts of
 
04:14:51.510 --> 04:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
the income scale so that 10th bar that
 
04:14:53.349 --> 04:14:53.359 align:start position:0%
you see that 10th percentile that means
 
04:14:55.630 --> 04:14:55.640 align:start position:0%
10% of wages hourly wages and this
 
04:14:57.750 --> 04:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
includes all income from work were lower
 
04:15:00.229 --> 04:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
than that 90% were higher and that's you
 
04:15:01.750 --> 04:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
know you can track that across the scale
 
04:15:04.630 --> 04:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
the 50th is the medium and interestingly
 
04:15:08.309 --> 04:15:08.319 align:start position:0%
if you look at the uh green solid bars
 
04:15:10.269 --> 04:15:10.279 align:start position:0%
which is comparing just before the Great
 
04:15:12.149 --> 04:15:12.159 align:start position:0%
Recession to just before the covid-19
 
04:15:14.830 --> 04:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
crisis we see that there was not really
 
04:15:17.149 --> 04:15:17.159 align:start position:0%
wage growth across that time period
 
04:15:19.710 --> 04:15:19.720 align:start position:0%
relative to inflation for the bottom
 
04:15:21.269 --> 04:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
half of the income scale for median
 
04:15:23.469 --> 04:15:23.479 align:start position:0%
income earners and Below however there
 
04:15:24.830 --> 04:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
was wage growth at the higher end of the
 
04:15:27.109 --> 04:15:27.119 align:start position:0%
income scale but then look at 2021 to
 
04:15:29.189 --> 04:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
2023 and we can see where some of our
 
04:15:30.550 --> 04:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
labor force constraint in the state
 
04:15:32.710 --> 04:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
starts to play in because we saw much
 
04:15:35.670 --> 04:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
faster wage growth in this recovery not
 
04:15:37.469 --> 04:15:37.479 align:start position:0%
relative to the Great Recession recovery
 
04:15:39.030 --> 04:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
we saw much faster wage growth at the
 
04:15:40.990 --> 04:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
low end of the income scale and this is
 
04:15:43.469 --> 04:15:43.479 align:start position:0%
real wages relative to inflation
 
04:15:44.910 --> 04:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
right I do want to note this is a
 
04:15:46.990 --> 04:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
three-year average so a lot of inflation
 
04:15:50.309 --> 04:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
happened in 2022 so that's captured here
 
04:15:52.550 --> 04:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
but a more granular breakdown if you
 
04:15:55.030 --> 04:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
were to look at each individual Year may
 
04:15:57.429 --> 04:15:57.439 align:start position:0%
tell a different story but on the on the
 
04:15:58.990 --> 04:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
total scale on the overall scale where
 
04:16:00.269 --> 04:16:00.279 align:start position:0%
we take these threeyear averages and
 
04:16:01.870 --> 04:16:01.880 align:start position:0%
compare them which again gives us more
 
04:16:03.950 --> 04:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
data stability this suggests that this
 
04:16:05.790 --> 04:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
recovery has been stronger for
 
04:16:07.710 --> 04:16:07.720 align:start position:0%
individuals with lower
 
04:16:10.670 --> 04:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
incomes now what about across
 
04:16:13.030 --> 04:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
geographies in New Hampshire here are
 
04:16:15.950 --> 04:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
are 10 counties in the state arranged by
 
04:16:18.269 --> 04:16:18.279 align:start position:0%
the highest inflation adjusted median
 
04:16:21.870 --> 04:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
wage growth from 2019 to 2023 to the
 
04:16:23.790 --> 04:16:23.800 align:start position:0%
lowest inflation adjusted median wage
 
04:16:25.349 --> 04:16:25.359 align:start position:0%
growth and this is these are percentage
 
04:16:28.229 --> 04:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
terms um so interestingly if you look
 
04:16:30.030 --> 04:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
all the way over on the left the solid
 
04:16:31.910 --> 04:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
bars show that wage change and that's
 
04:16:34.229 --> 04:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
Coos Carrol chesher and bnap counties
 
04:16:35.590 --> 04:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
right so some of our more rural counties
 
04:16:37.550 --> 04:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
in the state um saw that higher
 
04:16:39.830 --> 04:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
percentage growth in wages if you look
 
04:16:41.990 --> 04:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
at the bars that are on uh also on the
 
04:16:44.149 --> 04:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
graph with it with the um with the cross
 
04:16:47.030 --> 04:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
thatch through them that shows the
 
04:16:49.469 --> 04:16:49.479 align:start position:0%
change in the size of the labor force
 
04:16:50.469 --> 04:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
now I want to be clear when we're
 
04:16:52.830 --> 04:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
talking about these survey these data
 
04:16:55.229 --> 04:16:55.239 align:start position:0%
we're talking about surveying households
 
04:16:58.630 --> 04:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
and asking are you working or actively
 
04:17:01.030 --> 04:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
looking for work right so this is people
 
04:17:02.790 --> 04:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
who are unemployed but actively seeking
 
04:17:04.950 --> 04:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
work or people who are employed could be
 
04:17:06.550 --> 04:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
part-time could be full-time but they
 
04:17:09.870 --> 04:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
have a job um and we can see that the
 
04:17:11.950 --> 04:17:11.960 align:start position:0%
size of the labor force based on these
 
04:17:15.349 --> 04:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
data went down across all 10 10 counties
 
04:17:18.710 --> 04:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
if you compare 2019 to 2023 um but went
 
04:17:21.670 --> 04:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
down faster in Coos Carol and chesher
 
04:17:23.269 --> 04:17:23.279 align:start position:0%
County where we saw the faster wage
 
04:17:25.149 --> 04:17:25.159 align:start position:0%
growth right so that has implications
 
04:17:27.269 --> 04:17:27.279 align:start position:0%
for the economy in those counties and it
 
04:17:29.510 --> 04:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
also is a function somewhat of supply
 
04:17:31.189 --> 04:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
and demand right if you have a smaller
 
04:17:33.109 --> 04:17:33.119 align:start position:0%
labor force fewer people in your
 
04:17:34.950 --> 04:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
available pool of workers then you might
 
04:17:37.189 --> 04:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
be seeing wages grow faster so that may
 
04:17:38.750 --> 04:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
be what we're seeing
 
04:17:40.990 --> 04:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
here now I know New Hampshire employment
 
04:17:43.670 --> 04:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
security already covered some of these
 
04:17:44.990 --> 04:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
data so I'm not going to spend very much
 
04:17:46.750 --> 04:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
time on them I did try to put it in
 
04:17:48.510 --> 04:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
graphical form for you and my apologies
 
04:17:51.229 --> 04:17:51.239 align:start position:0%
for scrunching it all together here um
 
04:17:53.910 --> 04:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
but uh I wanted to show where the way
 
04:17:57.349 --> 04:17:57.359 align:start position:0%
where um job growth was between 2019 and
 
04:18:00.349 --> 04:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
2023 by employment sector you can see
 
04:18:01.389 --> 04:18:01.399 align:start position:0%
all the way over on the left
 
04:18:02.910 --> 04:18:02.920 align:start position:0%
professional scientific and Technical
 
04:18:05.070 --> 04:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
Services as you've already heard those
 
04:18:06.870 --> 04:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
did quite well during the pandemic and
 
04:18:08.790 --> 04:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
associated with the pandemic and then
 
04:18:10.710 --> 04:18:10.720 align:start position:0%
Administration administrative support in
 
04:18:12.750 --> 04:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
Waste Services construction and
 
04:18:14.790 --> 04:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
wholesale trade we see increases in
 
04:18:16.950 --> 04:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
those sectors on the other end we see
 
04:18:18.269 --> 04:18:18.279 align:start position:0%
accommodation and Food Services
 
04:18:19.710 --> 04:18:19.720 align:start position:0%
manufacturing total government and
 
04:18:22.269 --> 04:18:22.279 align:start position:0%
Retail trade those have declined in
 
04:18:25.030 --> 04:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
terms of their employment um I think I
 
04:18:26.349 --> 04:18:26.359 align:start position:0%
think each one of these has a story
 
04:18:27.550 --> 04:18:27.560 align:start position:0%
behind them and I don't know all the
 
04:18:30.429 --> 04:18:30.439 align:start position:0%
stories behind them um but I would uh
 
04:18:33.189 --> 04:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
venture to say that retail trade uh is
 
04:18:34.790 --> 04:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
you know we see some of that being
 
04:18:36.429 --> 04:18:36.439 align:start position:0%
affected by more people doing online
 
04:18:39.870 --> 04:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
shopping more uh more Automation in the
 
04:18:42.790 --> 04:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
retail experience and um and total
 
04:18:45.229 --> 04:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
government uh there was an increase in
 
04:18:47.990 --> 04:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
federal um but if I recall correctly
 
04:18:50.870 --> 04:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
local was a a sign substantial negative
 
04:18:52.870 --> 04:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh over this time
 
04:18:56.189 --> 04:18:56.199 align:start position:0%
period now if we look broadly again
 
04:18:58.309 --> 04:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
using those survey data asking people
 
04:19:00.990 --> 04:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
are you employed and a resident of New
 
04:19:02.870 --> 04:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and working or actively
 
04:19:04.790 --> 04:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
seeking work this is where we can
 
04:19:07.070 --> 04:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
measure how many people are are uh
 
04:19:08.870 --> 04:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
comprising that unemployment rate in New
 
04:19:10.030 --> 04:19:10.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right how many people are
 
04:19:11.870 --> 04:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
unemployed and actively seeking work
 
04:19:13.070 --> 04:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
this is going all the way back back to
 
04:19:15.870 --> 04:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
2005 so we can see here the top line
 
04:19:17.469 --> 04:19:17.479 align:start position:0%
with the triangles is the number of
 
04:19:18.670 --> 04:19:18.680 align:start position:0%
people who say they're participating in
 
04:19:19.990 --> 04:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
the labor force they're employed or
 
04:19:21.990 --> 04:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
actively looking for work and then the
 
04:19:25.389 --> 04:19:25.399 align:start position:0%
bottom line with the squares that is the
 
04:19:26.990 --> 04:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
number of people who say I'm employed
 
04:19:28.389 --> 04:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
they could be part-time and looking for
 
04:19:30.510 --> 04:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
other work too but they are at least
 
04:19:32.590 --> 04:19:32.600 align:start position:0%
employed in some fashion and you could
 
04:19:34.309 --> 04:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
see the impacts of the Great Recession
 
04:19:36.389 --> 04:19:36.399 align:start position:0%
and a period where we had a fair bit of
 
04:19:38.990 --> 04:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
Labor Surplus in the state and then the
 
04:19:40.910 --> 04:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
labor market became more constrained as
 
04:19:43.469 --> 04:19:43.479 align:start position:0%
we approached the covid-19 pandemic 2020
 
04:19:44.990 --> 04:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
is pretty clear on this graph as you can
 
04:19:47.630 --> 04:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
see but since then one of the things
 
04:19:50.189 --> 04:19:50.199 align:start position:0%
that gives me more optimism going into
 
04:19:52.389 --> 04:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
2025 is that we have seen at least in
 
04:19:54.750 --> 04:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
the preliminary data year to date in
 
04:19:57.269 --> 04:19:57.279 align:start position:0%
2024 both in in this survey both
 
04:19:58.990 --> 04:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
employment and the size of the labor
 
04:20:02.469 --> 04:20:02.479 align:start position:0%
force increase whereas it hadn't in 2023
 
04:20:04.469 --> 04:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
right so that's I I think a positive
 
04:20:07.109 --> 04:20:07.119 align:start position:0%
sign going into 2025 if those data hold
 
04:20:10.189 --> 04:20:10.199 align:start position:0%
through the benchmarking process uh the
 
04:20:12.109 --> 04:20:12.119 align:start position:0%
um one thing I do want to note as well
 
04:20:13.229 --> 04:20:13.239 align:start position:0%
if you ask
 
04:20:15.830 --> 04:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
employers what how many jobs they've
 
04:20:18.189 --> 04:20:18.199 align:start position:0%
filled in the state you actually get a
 
04:20:19.389 --> 04:20:19.399 align:start position:0%
little bit of a different pattern right
 
04:20:21.389 --> 04:20:21.399 align:start position:0%
now we're still below where we were pre
 
04:20:23.910 --> 04:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic in 2019 and these data and this
 
04:20:26.710 --> 04:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
is people who live in New Hampshire uh
 
04:20:28.710 --> 04:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
and you're asking them are you working
 
04:20:30.269 --> 04:20:30.279 align:start position:0%
so this could in include people who are
 
04:20:31.950 --> 04:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
working out of state or who are working
 
04:20:34.070 --> 04:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
for non- New Hampshire Employers in some
 
04:20:37.950 --> 04:20:37.960 align:start position:0%
capacity right here uh we see that we
 
04:20:40.109 --> 04:20:40.119 align:start position:0%
haven't quite recovered relative to
 
04:20:41.790 --> 04:20:41.800 align:start position:0%
those pre-pandemic levels but if you ask
 
04:20:43.910 --> 04:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
employers how many jobs do you have
 
04:20:46.189 --> 04:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
filled then we have recovered right
 
04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
which suggests there may be more
 
04:20:49.510 --> 04:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
part-time jobs or more people who are
 
04:20:51.149 --> 04:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
working in state as opposed to out of
 
04:20:53.109 --> 04:20:53.119 align:start position:0%
state right so those are some of the
 
04:20:54.510 --> 04:20:54.520 align:start position:0%
variables that it's important to
 
04:20:55.590 --> 04:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
consider when you're looking at these
 
04:20:57.469 --> 04:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
data because there are some U things
 
04:20:59.269 --> 04:20:59.279 align:start position:0%
that may appear to be discrepancies but
 
04:21:01.469 --> 04:21:01.479 align:start position:0%
they may have some explanation as
 
04:21:04.389 --> 04:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
well if we look at the unemployment rate
 
04:21:05.990 --> 04:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
one thing I should note too that shaded
 
04:21:07.670 --> 04:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
area that's the number of people who are
 
04:21:09.750 --> 04:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
unemployed right so that's about 20,000
 
04:21:12.189 --> 04:21:12.199 align:start position:0%
people in the state currently who
 
04:21:14.990 --> 04:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
comprise the unemployment rate what does
 
04:21:16.469 --> 04:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
that unemployment rate look like if we
 
04:21:19.189 --> 04:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
compare it on a macro scale the most
 
04:21:21.590 --> 04:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
recent uh 12 month data that we have
 
04:21:23.030 --> 04:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
both these measures for which ends in
 
04:21:25.870 --> 04:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
June 2024 how does that compare to 2019
 
04:21:26.990 --> 04:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
you can see in the solid bar the
 
04:21:28.429 --> 04:21:28.439 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate is exactly the same
 
04:21:31.990 --> 04:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
it's 2.6% right which is quite low um
 
04:21:34.790 --> 04:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
and the other bar the Shaded one the
 
04:21:38.309 --> 04:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
Shaded one um that has uh that is a
 
04:21:39.990 --> 04:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
broader measure of unemployment so these
 
04:21:42.670 --> 04:21:42.680 align:start position:0%
are folks who have looked for work and
 
04:21:43.990 --> 04:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
in the last four weeks but look for work
 
04:21:46.630 --> 04:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
in the last year um people who have been
 
04:21:48.030 --> 04:21:48.040 align:start position:0%
are working parttime for economic
 
04:21:49.429 --> 04:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
reasons and would prefer to be working
 
04:21:51.590 --> 04:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
full-time um people who are available
 
04:21:54.149 --> 04:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
for work but not actively seeking it we
 
04:21:55.710 --> 04:21:55.720 align:start position:0%
can see that that unemployment rate is
 
04:21:57.429 --> 04:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
higher right so that includes everyone
 
04:21:59.870 --> 04:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
who's in the 2.6% that unemployment rate
 
04:22:02.189 --> 04:22:02.199 align:start position:0%
is higher was higher in 2019 maybe a
 
04:22:03.790 --> 04:22:03.800 align:start position:0%
little lower in the most recent data
 
04:22:05.950 --> 04:22:05.960 align:start position:0%
that we have but you know still still
 
04:22:08.630 --> 04:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
elevated but about 5% so that gives us
 
04:22:10.630 --> 04:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
some sense of where there may be slack
 
04:22:14.670 --> 04:22:14.680 align:start position:0%
in the labor force and this is the best
 
04:22:17.870 --> 04:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
single number that I know of to
 
04:22:20.189 --> 04:22:20.199 align:start position:0%
characterize the labor force constraint
 
04:22:22.429 --> 04:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
in the state um the labor force shortage
 
04:22:24.429 --> 04:22:24.439 align:start position:0%
in the state it is not a perfect number
 
04:22:27.189 --> 04:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
um but what it measures is the number of
 
04:22:29.750 --> 04:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
open positions in the state divided by
 
04:22:31.389 --> 04:22:31.399 align:start position:0%
the number of unemployed workers meaning
 
04:22:33.189 --> 04:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
the number of people who are actively
 
04:22:35.550 --> 04:22:35.560 align:start position:0%
seeking work and have actively SE work
 
04:22:37.790 --> 04:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
uh sought work in the last four weeks
 
04:22:39.750 --> 04:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
you can see here that in the runup and
 
04:22:42.189 --> 04:22:42.199 align:start position:0%
this goes back 25 years almost the state
 
04:22:42.199 --> 04:22:43.109 align:start position:0%
this goes back 25 years almost the state
a

04:22:43.109 --> 04:22:43.119 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:22:45.389 --> 04:22:45.399 align:start position:0%
um you can see uh in the runup to the
 
04:22:47.910 --> 04:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
Great Recession there was about one job
 
04:22:49.910 --> 04:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
opening for every unemployed worker that
 
04:22:51.670 --> 04:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
dropped following the Great Recession in
 
04:22:53.469 --> 04:22:53.479 align:start position:0%
the runup to the covid-19 crisis it was
 
04:22:54.950 --> 04:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
almost two job openings for every
 
04:22:56.990 --> 04:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
unemployed worker suggesting that a lot
 
04:22:58.990 --> 04:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
of these jobs weren't being filled and
 
04:23:00.950 --> 04:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
then we see a drop associated with the
 
04:23:03.750 --> 04:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic and after that in uh especially
 
04:23:07.109 --> 04:23:07.119 align:start position:0%
in early 2022 and early 2023 we see
 
04:23:08.550 --> 04:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
three to three and a half job openings
 
04:23:10.910 --> 04:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
for unemployed worker the at least
 
04:23:12.229 --> 04:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
according to these data that's dropped
 
04:23:14.389 --> 04:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
back back down to about two job openings
 
04:23:16.630 --> 04:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
for every unemployed worker um so that
 
04:23:18.149 --> 04:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
suggests that there's been some easing
 
04:23:21.550 --> 04:23:21.560 align:start position:0%
in labor force constraint um I do
 
04:23:23.550 --> 04:23:23.560 align:start position:0%
somewhat expect that to be temporary for
 
04:23:25.389 --> 04:23:25.399 align:start position:0%
some of the reasons that Jess is going
 
04:23:28.269 --> 04:23:28.279 align:start position:0%
to talk about in the next portion of the
 
04:23:28.279 --> 04:23:30.830 align:start position:0%
to talk about in the next portion of the
presentation

04:23:30.830 --> 04:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
04:23:33.469 --> 04:23:33.479 align:start position:0%
great thank you um so I'll just be
 
04:23:35.790 --> 04:23:35.800 align:start position:0%
talking a little bit about demographics
 
04:23:38.229 --> 04:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
in the State uh as well as household
 
04:23:41.189 --> 04:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
costs for families uh across New
 
04:23:44.309 --> 04:23:44.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and how this imp impacts the
 
04:23:46.710 --> 04:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
economy uh so while the state's
 
04:23:49.229 --> 04:23:49.239 align:start position:0%
population has grown we know that growth
 
04:23:50.990 --> 04:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
has been much smaller compared to
 
04:23:55.030 --> 04:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
previous decades uh so from 2010 to 2024
 
04:23:58.469 --> 04:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
the state's population grew by about 7%
 
04:24:01.389 --> 04:24:01.399 align:start position:0%
comparatively we know that from 1980 to
 
04:24:04.910 --> 04:24:04.920 align:start position:0%
1990 the population grew by about
 
04:24:07.189 --> 04:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
25% uh the growth in the graph that you
 
04:24:11.030 --> 04:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
see spanning from about 1960 to 2000 is
 
04:24:13.309 --> 04:24:13.319 align:start position:0%
a period where the number of births uh
 
04:24:15.510 --> 04:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
in the state tended to outpace the
 
04:24:17.950 --> 04:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
number of deaths this was also a time
 
04:24:19.309 --> 04:24:19.319 align:start position:0%
where a large number of people were
 
04:24:21.630 --> 04:24:21.640 align:start position:0%
moving into the state due to the growing
 
04:24:24.790 --> 04:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
Metropolitan Boston
 
04:24:27.510 --> 04:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
area while the state's population has
 
04:24:29.510 --> 04:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
grown uh we know that a greater number
 
04:24:31.590 --> 04:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
of people have reached or will be
 
04:24:33.670 --> 04:24:33.680 align:start position:0%
reaching traditional retirement age in
 
04:24:37.229 --> 04:24:37.239 align:start position:0%
the coming decades as of July of 20123
 
04:24:40.229 --> 04:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
about 20% of the state's population was
 
04:24:44.229 --> 04:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
over the age of 65 um about 15% were
 
04:24:48.750 --> 04:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
between the ages of 55 to 64 represented
 
04:24:51.309 --> 04:24:51.319 align:start position:0%
in the orange bars on the graph and
 
04:24:53.510 --> 04:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
comparatively uh while children under
 
04:24:56.590 --> 04:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
the age of 18 represented about 18% of
 
04:24:58.950 --> 04:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
the population we know that that number
 
04:25:01.030 --> 04:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
has decreased you can see on the graph
 
04:25:03.670 --> 04:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
that children under age 5 represent a
 
04:25:07.189 --> 04:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
much smaller bar uh compared to that of
 
04:25:09.269 --> 04:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
young adults as well as the working age
 
04:25:14.389 --> 04:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:17.030 --> 04:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire has historically relied
 
04:25:19.990 --> 04:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
on immigration to grow its population
 
04:25:21.550 --> 04:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about immigration
 
04:25:23.070 --> 04:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
we're referring to both domestic
 
04:25:25.269 --> 04:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
migration so people moving into New
 
04:25:27.030 --> 04:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from other states across the
 
04:25:29.070 --> 04:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
country as well as international
 
04:25:31.109 --> 04:25:31.119 align:start position:0%
migration meaning people moving into New
 
04:25:33.630 --> 04:25:33.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh from other countries across
 
04:25:36.309 --> 04:25:36.319 align:start position:0%
the globe you can see on the uh graph
 
04:25:38.269 --> 04:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
that beginning in the couple of years uh
 
04:25:40.750 --> 04:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
leading up to the pandemic population
 
04:25:43.229 --> 04:25:43.239 align:start position:0%
growth became equally influenced by
 
04:25:45.630 --> 04:25:45.640 align:start position:0%
domestic migration most notably in the
 
04:25:48.590 --> 04:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
last couple of years in 2023 and
 
04:25:51.429 --> 04:25:51.439 align:start position:0%
2024 represented in the green bars on
 
04:25:53.429 --> 04:25:53.439 align:start position:0%
the graph um you can see that the number
 
04:25:55.790 --> 04:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
of deaths in the state has consistently
 
04:25:57.790 --> 04:25:57.800 align:start position:0%
outpaced the number of births at least
 
04:26:00.990 --> 04:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
since 2017 so more simply put the
 
04:26:03.269 --> 04:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
state's population would be declining
 
04:26:06.229 --> 04:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
without this immigration to the
 
04:26:08.830 --> 04:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
state uh so while New Hampshire has
 
04:26:11.189 --> 04:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
relied on immigration we know that net
 
04:26:14.149 --> 04:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
migration to the state has slowed um
 
04:26:15.910 --> 04:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
when we think about people moving into
 
04:26:17.910 --> 04:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
the state New Hampshire has consistently
 
04:26:20.469 --> 04:26:20.479 align:start position:0%
gained population from other New England
 
04:26:22.469 --> 04:26:22.479 align:start position:0%
states most predominantly from
 
04:26:25.030 --> 04:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
neighboring Massachusetts uh we can see
 
04:26:27.710 --> 04:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
that immigration from Massachusetts did
 
04:26:31.550 --> 04:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
increase in 2021 and 2022 compared to
 
04:26:34.189 --> 04:26:34.199 align:start position:0%
the two years prior to the pandemic this
 
04:26:36.590 --> 04:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
is largely due to increases in remote
 
04:26:38.950 --> 04:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
work as well as the possibility of more
 
04:26:40.830 --> 04:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
people having the opportunity to move
 
04:26:43.070 --> 04:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
into their second homes uh because of
 
04:26:45.309 --> 04:26:45.319 align:start position:0%
that remote work when we think about
 
04:26:47.189 --> 04:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
those moving out of the state we see
 
04:26:49.389 --> 04:26:49.399 align:start position:0%
sort of the opposite effect occurring
 
04:26:51.510 --> 04:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
with Maine uh you can see that more
 
04:26:53.750 --> 04:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
people moved out to Maine during the
 
04:26:56.630 --> 04:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
pandemic compared to the two years prior
 
04:26:59.030 --> 04:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh during this time New Hampshire also
 
04:27:01.269 --> 04:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
lost a net population to the South
 
04:27:03.910 --> 04:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
Atlantic region being Florida and the
 
04:27:06.910 --> 04:27:06.920 align:start position:0%
Carolinas um this is largely due to the
 
04:27:08.630 --> 04:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
number of retirees who moved to the
 
04:27:11.750 --> 04:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
region both um for warmer weather and
 
04:27:11.760 --> 04:27:14.870 align:start position:0%
region both um for warmer weather and
per

04:27:14.870 --> 04:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:17.030 --> 04:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
amenities uh so when we think about the
 
04:27:18.990 --> 04:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
state's changing population in
 
04:27:20.990 --> 04:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
constraints on the workforce we of
 
04:27:23.189 --> 04:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
course have to consider uh the financial
 
04:27:25.590 --> 04:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
constraints facing families across the
 
04:27:28.189 --> 04:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
state so according to the Massachusetts
 
04:27:30.309 --> 04:27:30.319 align:start position:0%
Institute of Technology's living wage
 
04:27:32.910 --> 04:27:32.920 align:start position:0%
calculator the Statewide cost of living
 
04:27:34.990 --> 04:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
for a family of three being two working
 
04:27:38.510 --> 04:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
adults and one child was close to
 
04:27:42.349 --> 04:27:42.359 align:start position:0%
$98,000 uh as of 2024 when we combine
 
04:27:44.550 --> 04:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
housing and child care costs these two
 
04:27:46.830 --> 04:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
expenses together make up nearly
 
04:27:49.910 --> 04:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
onethird of household budgets across the
 
04:27:51.870 --> 04:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
state you can also see that cost of
 
04:27:54.229 --> 04:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
living varies quite a bit uh based on
 
04:27:57.590 --> 04:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
location from about 105,000 in
 
04:28:00.630 --> 04:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County to about 880,000 in
 
04:28:03.229 --> 04:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
Coos County uh in addition to housing
 
04:28:05.070 --> 04:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
and child's care included in these
 
04:28:07.750 --> 04:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
estimates also include Transportation
 
04:28:11.070 --> 04:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
medical costs food internet mobile uh
 
04:28:13.630 --> 04:28:13.640 align:start position:0%
taxes and what they refer to as Civic
 
04:28:15.990 --> 04:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
expenses this includes things like going
 
04:28:18.670 --> 04:28:18.680 align:start position:0%
to museums uh participating in cultural
 
04:28:20.830 --> 04:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
activities and other activities that
 
04:28:23.750 --> 04:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
help stimulate the state's economy um
 
04:28:26.109 --> 04:28:26.119 align:start position:0%
they also include the other bracket this
 
04:28:30.109 --> 04:28:30.119 align:start position:0%
includes um purchasing households uh you
 
04:28:33.349 --> 04:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
know Necessities clothing uh among other
 
04:28:36.149 --> 04:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
things um needed for the household it's
 
04:28:38.429 --> 04:28:38.439 align:start position:0%
important to note that not included in
 
04:28:40.510 --> 04:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
these estimates are things like student
 
04:28:43.070 --> 04:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
loan debt credit card debt as well as
 
04:28:45.750 --> 04:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
any other emergency expenses that may
 
04:28:49.309 --> 04:28:49.319 align:start position:0%
further constrain a household's
 
04:28:51.990 --> 04:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
budget separate researchers at the
 
04:28:54.429 --> 04:28:54.439 align:start position:0%
economic policy Institute found similar
 
04:28:56.950 --> 04:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
costs of living for the state um
 
04:28:59.590 --> 04:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
although the researchers use slightly
 
04:29:01.429 --> 04:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
different criteria you can see that
 
04:29:04.109 --> 04:29:04.119 align:start position:0%
housing child's care and transportation
 
04:29:06.950 --> 04:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
make up the largest slices of the pie um
 
04:29:08.830 --> 04:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
comparatively we can also see that
 
04:29:11.429 --> 04:29:11.439 align:start position:0%
housing in Rockingham County is almost
 
04:29:14.590 --> 04:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
double what it is in coas County uh for
 
04:29:17.429 --> 04:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
both MIT and Epi estimates it's
 
04:29:20.070 --> 04:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
important to note that these estimates
 
04:29:22.710 --> 04:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
fall well above uh the federal poverty
 
04:29:25.349 --> 04:29:25.359 align:start position:0%
guidelines as well as the actual incomes
 
04:29:27.790 --> 04:29:27.800 align:start position:0%
of many Granite Staters in the state as
 
04:29:31.550 --> 04:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
fell mentioned on the previous uh few
 
04:29:34.109 --> 04:29:34.119 align:start position:0%
slides um I mentioned that housing is
 
04:29:36.750 --> 04:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
one of the highest costs for families in
 
04:29:40.710 --> 04:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
the state um as of June of 2024 the
 
04:29:42.710 --> 04:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
median cost for purchase ing a single
 
04:29:45.910 --> 04:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
family house in New Hampshire uh Rose to
 
04:29:50.269 --> 04:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
a record high of $540,000 uh this was an
 
04:29:54.429 --> 04:29:54.439 align:start position:0%
increase of about 71% from June 2019
 
04:29:57.510 --> 04:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic prices do tend to
 
04:29:59.149 --> 04:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
peak in the summer months so they have
 
04:30:01.349 --> 04:30:01.359 align:start position:0%
come down a bit however when we look at
 
04:30:03.349 --> 04:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
the median cost for purchasing a home
 
04:30:04.870 --> 04:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
for all of
 
04:30:08.149 --> 04:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
2024 uh that cost still fell above half
 
04:30:10.590 --> 04:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
a million dollars um we know that
 
04:30:13.030 --> 04:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
housing costs have also increased at a
 
04:30:14.870 --> 04:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
faster rate compared to incomes and
 
04:30:17.550 --> 04:30:17.560 align:start position:0%
wages in the state Based on data that we
 
04:30:19.229 --> 04:30:19.239 align:start position:0%
have from New Hampshire employment
 
04:30:22.149 --> 04:30:22.159 align:start position:0%
security the average hourly wage for New
 
04:30:25.229 --> 04:30:25.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire increased by about 41% from
 
04:30:29.149 --> 04:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
2015 to 2024 uh comparatively you can
 
04:30:33.030 --> 04:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
see that um the increase in housing cost
 
04:30:35.229 --> 04:30:35.239 align:start position:0%
incre for purchasing a single family
 
04:30:37.469 --> 04:30:37.479 align:start position:0%
house increased by about
 
04:30:42.590 --> 04:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:45.030 --> 04:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
and while prices have remained higher in
 
04:30:47.750 --> 04:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
the Southeastern part of the state um
 
04:30:50.550 --> 04:30:50.560 align:start position:0%
prices have risen risen much faster in
 
04:30:54.910 --> 04:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
rural areas uh so from 2018 to 2024 the
 
04:30:57.109 --> 04:30:57.119 align:start position:0%
median cost for purchasing a single
 
04:30:59.429 --> 04:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
family house in the state increased by
 
04:30:59.439 --> 04:31:00.309 align:start position:0%
family house in the state increased by
about

04:31:00.309 --> 04:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:31:03.309 --> 04:31:03.319 align:start position:0%
82% uh you can see that the Southeastern
 
04:31:05.710 --> 04:31:05.720 align:start position:0%
uh four counties all had percentages
 
04:31:08.710 --> 04:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
around that state median however uh when
 
04:31:11.309 --> 04:31:11.319 align:start position:0%
you look at the rest of the state all
 
04:31:13.990 --> 04:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
counties experien price changes higher
 
04:31:14.000 --> 04:31:14.830 align:start position:0%
counties experien price changes higher
than

04:31:14.830 --> 04:31:14.840 align:start position:0%
than
 
04:31:17.830 --> 04:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
90% um during this time the median price
 
04:31:19.710 --> 04:31:19.720 align:start position:0%
of purchasing a single family house in
 
04:31:22.950 --> 04:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
the State uh doubled or nearly doubled
 
04:31:26.550 --> 04:31:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:29.710 --> 04:31:29.720 align:start position:0%
counties um prices have also increased
 
04:31:33.710 --> 04:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
for renters in the state so as of 2024
 
04:31:35.469 --> 04:31:35.479 align:start position:0%
the median monthly price for a two
 
04:31:37.469 --> 04:31:37.479 align:start position:0%
bedroom unit in New Hampshire uh
 
04:31:39.950 --> 04:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
including both rent and utilities was
 
04:31:41.950 --> 04:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
close to $1,800
 
04:31:45.750 --> 04:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh an increase of about 36% from 2019
 
04:31:48.830 --> 04:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
before the pandemic um housing prices in
 
04:31:51.149 --> 04:31:51.159 align:start position:0%
the state are largely influenced by the
 
04:31:53.670 --> 04:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
lack of housing inventory across New
 
04:31:56.389 --> 04:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um according to New Hampshire
 
04:31:59.670 --> 04:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh housing a 5% vacancy rate is
 
04:32:02.030 --> 04:32:02.040 align:start position:0%
considered a balanced rental market for
 
04:32:04.189 --> 04:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
the state um however you can see in the
 
04:32:06.670 --> 04:32:06.680 align:start position:0%
graph that the state's vacancy rate has
 
04:32:09.469 --> 04:32:09.479 align:start position:0%
consistently Fallen below that 5%
 
04:32:13.309 --> 04:32:13.319 align:start position:0%
reaching record lows from 2020 1 to
 
04:32:15.870 --> 04:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
2023 um it's also important to note that
 
04:32:17.950 --> 04:32:17.960 align:start position:0%
Rising housing costs have likely
 
04:32:20.550 --> 04:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
disproportionately impacted renters who
 
04:32:23.630 --> 04:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
tend to make median incomes uh far below
 
04:32:26.229 --> 04:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
that of a homeowner according to the US
 
04:32:28.269 --> 04:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
Department of Housing and Urban
 
04:32:30.349 --> 04:32:30.359 align:start position:0%
Development uh households paying more
 
04:32:32.950 --> 04:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
than 30% of their incomes towards
 
04:32:35.109 --> 04:32:35.119 align:start position:0%
housing costs are defined as cost
 
04:32:38.830 --> 04:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
burdened um as of 2023 data more than
 
04:32:41.109 --> 04:32:41.119 align:start position:0%
half of renters in the state met this
 
04:32:44.590 --> 04:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:46.790 --> 04:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
burdened uh in addition to Rising
 
04:32:49.070 --> 04:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
housing costs the high price of child's
 
04:32:51.590 --> 04:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
care has also impacted Granite State
 
04:32:54.950 --> 04:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
families uh as of 2023 which is the most
 
04:32:56.630 --> 04:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
recent set of data that we have
 
04:32:59.229 --> 04:32:59.239 align:start position:0%
available the cost for an infant and
 
04:33:01.070 --> 04:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
four-year-old and Center based care in
 
04:33:03.269 --> 04:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
the state was nearly
 
04:33:05.789 --> 04:33:05.799 align:start position:0%
$32,000 uh this was an increase from the
 
04:33:09.670 --> 04:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:12.470 --> 04:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
2022 according to the IAL poverty
 
04:33:16.189 --> 04:33:16.199 align:start position:0%
measure around 98,000 Granite Staters uh
 
04:33:18.269 --> 04:33:18.279 align:start position:0%
had incomes below the federal poverty
 
04:33:21.470 --> 04:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
guidelines in 2023 as Phil mentioned
 
04:33:23.150 --> 04:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
this was about
 
04:33:27.990 --> 04:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
$25,000 um in 2023 for a family of three
 
04:33:30.150 --> 04:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
while the state's overall poverty rate
 
04:33:32.551 --> 04:33:32.561 align:start position:0%
has remained uh relatively the same at
 
04:33:36.429 --> 04:33:36.439 align:start position:0%
about 7% we can see that um poverty
 
04:33:38.750 --> 04:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
among older adults has been on a rise at
 
04:33:39.990 --> 04:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
least since
 
04:33:42.390 --> 04:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
2019 uh according to the official
 
04:33:44.349 --> 04:33:44.359 align:start position:0%
measure poverty among children has
 
04:33:46.789 --> 04:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
fluctuated every couple of years from
 
04:33:49.390 --> 04:33:49.400 align:start position:0%
its um increase in
 
04:33:53.551 --> 04:33:53.561 align:start position:0%
2012 however as of 2023 uh the state's
 
04:33:55.590 --> 04:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
child poverty rate fell at around the
 
04:33:59.551 --> 04:33:59.561 align:start position:0%
same as the state's overall poverty
 
04:34:02.670 --> 04:34:02.680 align:start position:0%
rate while it is not a official
 
04:34:04.269 --> 04:34:04.279 align:start position:0%
replacement for the official poverty
 
04:34:06.709 --> 04:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
measure the supplemental poverty measure
 
04:34:08.551 --> 04:34:08.561 align:start position:0%
can provide some more insights into
 
04:34:10.629 --> 04:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
economic constraints for families in the
 
04:34:13.109 --> 04:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
granite state uh unlike the official
 
04:34:15.150 --> 04:34:15.160 align:start position:0%
measure the supplemental poverty measure
 
04:34:18.029 --> 04:34:18.039 align:start position:0%
takes into account things like Regional
 
04:34:20.310 --> 04:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh differences in costs of housing
 
04:34:23.109 --> 04:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
child's care as well as factors in taxes
 
04:34:25.830 --> 04:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
and tax credits you can see that based
 
04:34:27.990 --> 04:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
on the supplemental poverty measure
 
04:34:30.670 --> 04:34:30.680 align:start position:0%
poverty among children in the state was
 
04:34:34.109 --> 04:34:34.119 align:start position:0%
was cut in half from 2019 to
 
04:34:37.429 --> 04:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
2021 this is largely due to the increase
 
04:34:39.510 --> 04:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh in federal aid to families during the
 
04:34:42.269 --> 04:34:42.279 align:start position:0%
covid-19 pandemic most notably
 
04:34:45.269 --> 04:34:45.279 align:start position:0%
expansions to the child tax credit in
 
04:34:48.429 --> 04:34:48.439 align:start position:0%
2021 that expired uh in
 
04:34:51.990 --> 04:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
2022 while both uh child's and older
 
04:34:55.070 --> 04:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
adult poverty did increase in 2022 based
 
04:34:57.390 --> 04:34:57.400 align:start position:0%
on this measure you can see that there
 
04:35:00.029 --> 04:35:00.039 align:start position:0%
was a much more substantial increase
 
04:35:03.150 --> 04:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
among poverty among older adults age 65
 
04:35:03.160 --> 04:35:05.349 align:start position:0%
among poverty among older adults age 65
and

04:35:05.349 --> 04:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:35:09.109 --> 04:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
over and finally according to US Census
 
04:35:11.789 --> 04:35:11.799 align:start position:0%
Bureau data uh from the first 9 months
 
04:35:11.799 --> 04:35:12.670 align:start position:0%
Bureau data uh from the first 9 months
of

04:35:12.670 --> 04:35:12.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:35:15.470 --> 04:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
2024 you can see that nearly one in
 
04:35:18.070 --> 04:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
three New Hampshire adults reported a
 
04:35:20.269 --> 04:35:20.279 align:start position:0%
difficulty affording usual household
 
04:35:22.869 --> 04:35:22.879 align:start position:0%
expenses this was an increase from about
 
04:35:27.990 --> 04:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
1 in4 uh adults in 2020 and 2021 again
 
04:35:30.590 --> 04:35:30.600 align:start position:0%
largely due to the influx of Federal Aid
 
04:35:32.869 --> 04:35:32.879 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic as well as lower
 
04:35:36.551 --> 04:35:36.561 align:start position:0%
costs of living uh in 2020
 
04:35:38.949 --> 04:35:38.959 align:start position:0%
2021 and with that I will turn it back
 
04:35:40.390 --> 04:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
over to
 
04:35:44.510 --> 04:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
Phil great thank you Jess um so I want
 
04:35:46.310 --> 04:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
to take an opportunity because you are
 
04:35:47.789 --> 04:35:47.799 align:start position:0%
the ways and means committees and also
 
04:35:49.109 --> 04:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
interested members of the finance
 
04:35:51.470 --> 04:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
committees um to talk a little bit about
 
04:35:52.830 --> 04:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
State revenues and some of the recent
 
04:35:55.189 --> 04:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
trends that we've seen in state revenues
 
04:35:58.189 --> 04:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire um so first I'm going
 
04:36:01.230 --> 04:36:01.240 align:start position:0%
to show you a longtime Horizon this is
 
04:36:02.910 --> 04:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
aggregate Revenue to the general and
 
04:36:05.310 --> 04:36:05.320 align:start position:0%
education trust funds combined um going
 
04:36:06.629 --> 04:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
back all the way to State fiscal year
 
04:36:09.551 --> 04:36:09.561 align:start position:0%
2014 what is the year-over-year change
 
04:36:11.230 --> 04:36:11.240 align:start position:0%
what is the most recent 12 months
 
04:36:12.869 --> 04:36:12.879 align:start position:0%
average that's collected each month
 
04:36:15.230 --> 04:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
compared to the prior 12 months average
 
04:36:16.830 --> 04:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
so that's those are the metrics that
 
04:36:18.750 --> 04:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
you're seeing here and you can see we've
 
04:36:20.709 --> 04:36:20.719 align:start position:0%
actually we've had some variation over
 
04:36:22.310 --> 04:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
this time period some substantial
 
04:36:24.709 --> 04:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
variation first there was faster growth
 
04:36:27.189 --> 04:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
uh following a pretty long slow recovery
 
04:36:28.949 --> 04:36:28.959 align:start position:0%
from the Great Recession it took New
 
04:36:30.629 --> 04:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a long time to sort of get the
 
04:36:32.590 --> 04:36:32.600 align:start position:0%
economy back into gear so to speak after
 
04:36:34.390 --> 04:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
the Great Recession and we saw that
 
04:36:37.349 --> 04:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
economic activity really pick up in 2014
 
04:36:39.029 --> 04:36:39.039 align:start position:0%
where we saw a faster growth rate in the
 
04:36:41.230 --> 04:36:41.240 align:start position:0%
state's grow State product and that is
 
04:36:44.070 --> 04:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
something that then we uh see in the tax
 
04:36:46.470 --> 04:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
revenues in 2015 and 2016 and that was a
 
04:36:48.189 --> 04:36:48.199 align:start position:0%
pretty broad-based increase in tax
 
04:36:50.990 --> 04:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
revenues um then we see a much more
 
04:36:52.990 --> 04:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
specific increase in tax revenues
 
04:36:55.750 --> 04:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
following the um the federal tax cuts
 
04:36:57.670 --> 04:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
and jobs act that passed in December
 
04:37:00.709 --> 04:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
2017 we saw the repatriation of profits
 
04:37:02.510 --> 04:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
from overseas really affecting the
 
04:37:04.789 --> 04:37:04.799 align:start position:0%
business profits tax base and that is
 
04:37:06.070 --> 04:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
that was a phenomenon where if you look
 
04:37:09.150 --> 04:37:09.160 align:start position:0%
at how tax revenues grew broadly that
 
04:37:11.230 --> 04:37:11.240 align:start position:0%
was very focused in the business taxes
 
04:37:12.990 --> 04:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
particular Al as we'll see a little bit
 
04:37:15.670 --> 04:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
later in the business profits tax um
 
04:37:17.990 --> 04:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
specifically then you see a decline that
 
04:37:19.750 --> 04:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
is some of those onetime revenues
 
04:37:21.510 --> 04:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
associated with the tax cuts and jobs
 
04:37:24.510 --> 04:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
act going away and the initial impacts
 
04:37:27.510 --> 04:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
of the covid-19 pandemic which in the uh
 
04:37:29.551 --> 04:37:29.561 align:start position:0%
fourth quarter of 2020 were pretty
 
04:37:31.070 --> 04:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
profound in terms of how they impacted
 
04:37:33.789 --> 04:37:33.799 align:start position:0%
Revenue how fourth quarter fiscal 2020 I
 
04:37:35.629 --> 04:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
should say however then we see a really
 
04:37:38.310 --> 04:37:38.320 align:start position:0%
significant increase in tax revenues
 
04:37:40.230 --> 04:37:40.240 align:start position:0%
very as you can see historically very
 
04:37:42.470 --> 04:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
significant that was driven largely by
 
04:37:44.349 --> 04:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax but also by the
 
04:37:46.390 --> 04:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer tax in a latent
 
04:37:48.150 --> 04:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
fashion the meals and rentals tax a lot
 
04:37:50.150 --> 04:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
of revenues did behave in ways that if
 
04:37:52.949 --> 04:37:52.959 align:start position:0%
you had asked in April 2020 we wouldn't
 
04:37:56.269 --> 04:37:56.279 align:start position:0%
have expected right um but since then
 
04:37:58.551 --> 04:37:58.561 align:start position:0%
we've seen a decline and that decline
 
04:38:00.551 --> 04:38:00.561 align:start position:0%
means that now we actually don't have
 
04:38:02.070 --> 04:38:02.080 align:start position:0%
year-over-year growth we have a
 
04:38:03.551 --> 04:38:03.561 align:start position:0%
year-over-year decline if you compare
 
04:38:05.470 --> 04:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
the most recent 12 months to the prior
 
04:38:07.551 --> 04:38:07.561 align:start position:0%
12 months what does that look like if
 
04:38:09.750 --> 04:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
you aggregate over the course of years
 
04:38:11.029 --> 04:38:11.039 align:start position:0%
go a little bit further back this goes
 
04:38:13.830 --> 04:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
back to 2006 again General and education
 
04:38:15.789 --> 04:38:15.799 align:start position:0%
trust fund revenues combined and
 
04:38:18.390 --> 04:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
adjusted for inflation right so this is
 
04:38:20.269 --> 04:38:20.279 align:start position:0%
based on inflation that consumers see in
 
04:38:21.789 --> 04:38:21.799 align:start position:0%
the economy in the northeastern United
 
04:38:23.830 --> 04:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
States how did revenues compare over
 
04:38:25.029 --> 04:38:25.039 align:start position:0%
this time period you can see they do
 
04:38:26.990 --> 04:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
bounce around this is not adjusting for
 
04:38:28.510 --> 04:38:28.520 align:start position:0%
policy changes either right these are
 
04:38:30.510 --> 04:38:30.520 align:start position:0%
just the revenues that were collected
 
04:38:32.189 --> 04:38:32.199 align:start position:0%
and you know there were some years where
 
04:38:33.629 --> 04:38:33.639 align:start position:0%
you saw in the Great Recession there was
 
04:38:36.310 --> 04:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
an 8% drop in fiscal 2009 there was an
 
04:38:38.910 --> 04:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
8% increase in fiscal 2016 again that
 
04:38:41.150 --> 04:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
was that uh economy getting back into
 
04:38:43.470 --> 04:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
gear after the Great Recession and you
 
04:38:46.789 --> 04:38:46.799 align:start position:0%
see in 2021 a 16% increase relative to
 
04:38:49.789 --> 04:38:49.799 align:start position:0%
fiscal 2020 uh then another increase in
 
04:38:52.869 --> 04:38:52.879 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22 but since then we saw Revenue
 
04:38:55.551 --> 04:38:55.561 align:start position:0%
slip and then essentially be flat at
 
04:38:56.949 --> 04:38:56.959 align:start position:0%
least in the preliminary data that we
 
04:38:59.470 --> 04:38:59.480 align:start position:0%
have so far for fiscal 24 because again
 
04:39:02.070 --> 04:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
we don't have those un audited data as
 
04:39:03.470 --> 04:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
my former boss at the office of
 
04:39:04.869 --> 04:39:04.879 align:start position:0%
legislative budget assistant Mike Kane
 
04:39:06.590 --> 04:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
told you very at the very beginning of
 
04:39:09.910 --> 04:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
these uh of these briefings so when
 
04:39:11.590 --> 04:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
we're looking tax revenue sourced by tax
 
04:39:13.830 --> 04:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
revenue source and here are the uh here
 
04:39:16.510 --> 04:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
are the top 10 with the with the two
 
04:39:18.310 --> 04:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
business taxes combined into one line
 
04:39:19.990 --> 04:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
the top 10 tax revenue sources in the
 
04:39:23.109 --> 04:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
state if we compare the unaudited data
 
04:39:25.230 --> 04:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
for State fiscal year 2024 to what we
 
04:39:28.830 --> 04:39:28.840 align:start position:0%
have uh what we've SE saw in fiscal 23
 
04:39:30.990 --> 04:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
combined business tax revenues were down
 
04:39:33.269 --> 04:39:33.279 align:start position:0%
3.3% if you were to split these out
 
04:39:35.670 --> 04:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
again as as uh commissioner step noted
 
04:39:37.029 --> 04:39:37.039 align:start position:0%
we don't have the data yet to be able to
 
04:39:39.110 --> 04:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
split these out cleanly those data are
 
04:39:41.628 --> 04:39:41.638 align:start position:0%
quite delayed um and they because they
 
04:39:43.310 --> 04:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
depend on those final tax returns being
 
04:39:45.230 --> 04:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
filed and we don't know that yet for
 
04:39:49.070 --> 04:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal 24 or all of fiscal 23 but if you
 
04:39:50.270 --> 04:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
were to split them out the business
 
04:39:51.430 --> 04:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax would probably be about
 
04:39:53.788 --> 04:39:53.798 align:start position:0%
fifth on this list um combined business
 
04:39:56.868 --> 04:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
tax revenues were 3.3% down meals and
 
04:39:58.670 --> 04:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
rentals tax revenues this is a sort of a
 
04:40:00.628 --> 04:40:00.638 align:start position:0%
Workhorse Revenue source for the state
 
04:40:00.638 --> 04:40:01.590 align:start position:0%
Workhorse Revenue source for the state
up

04:40:01.590 --> 04:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:40:04.550 --> 04:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
3.8% Statewide education property tax
 
04:40:07.390 --> 04:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
this is set to raise $363 million in
 
04:40:09.830 --> 04:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
statute every year except for fiscal 23
 
04:40:12.510 --> 04:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
when it was set to raise 2 63 million so
 
04:40:14.590 --> 04:40:14.600 align:start position:0%
this 38% increase that is all because of
 
04:40:16.350 --> 04:40:16.360 align:start position:0%
statutory change right so that's not an
 
04:40:18.190 --> 04:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
increase that is because of underlying
 
04:40:19.868 --> 04:40:19.878 align:start position:0%
economic conditions this is a revenue
 
04:40:21.310 --> 04:40:21.320 align:start position:0%
Source that's set to raise a certain
 
04:40:23.390 --> 04:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
amount and that amount changed between
 
04:40:26.470 --> 04:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal 23 and fiscal 24 the Medicaid
 
04:40:29.270 --> 04:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
enhancement tax which is a tax that you
 
04:40:30.350 --> 04:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
on the ways and means committees you
 
04:40:32.990 --> 04:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
don't think about as much but it has a
 
04:40:35.150 --> 04:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
very substantial role in offsetting
 
04:40:36.910 --> 04:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
general fund expenditures so folks on
 
04:40:38.788 --> 04:40:38.798 align:start position:0%
the finance committees will see the
 
04:40:40.788 --> 04:40:40.798 align:start position:0%
effects of the Medicaid enhancement tax
 
04:40:42.470 --> 04:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
funding more of the non-federal share of
 
04:40:45.430 --> 04:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
Medicaid that was up about 6% um and
 
04:40:46.750 --> 04:40:46.760 align:start position:0%
it's a really again was the fourth
 
04:40:48.190 --> 04:40:48.200 align:start position:0%
largest tax revenue source that the
 
04:40:50.670 --> 04:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
state had tobacco tax revenues were down
 
04:40:52.868 --> 04:40:52.878 align:start position:0%
about 133% real estate transfer tax
 
04:40:55.310 --> 04:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
revenues are down about 14% And that put
 
04:40:57.030 --> 04:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
it below the interest in dividends tax
 
04:41:00.030 --> 04:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
which was up actually 25% between fiscal
 
04:41:03.510 --> 04:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
23 and fiscal 24 uh and that um is
 
04:41:05.470 --> 04:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
likely due in large part to behavior in
 
04:41:07.270 --> 04:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
the stock market dividends payments as
 
04:41:09.510 --> 04:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
well as interest rates being higher
 
04:41:11.270 --> 04:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
right with higher interest rates more
 
04:41:13.868 --> 04:41:13.878 align:start position:0%
interest income is earned and then uh
 
04:41:16.190 --> 04:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
motor fuels tax and insurance premium
 
04:41:20.470 --> 04:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
tax we saw some slight growth now in
 
04:41:22.510 --> 04:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
when we're thinking about surpluses and
 
04:41:23.788 --> 04:41:23.798 align:start position:0%
deficits when we're thinking about state
 
04:41:25.230 --> 04:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
revenue relative to the state revenue
 
04:41:28.590 --> 04:41:28.600 align:start position:0%
plan state fiscal year 2023 ended with
 
04:41:30.708 --> 04:41:30.718 align:start position:0%
what may be I think a record Surplus
 
04:41:31.750 --> 04:41:31.760 align:start position:0%
right we were talking about more than
 
04:41:34.868 --> 04:41:34.878 align:start position:0%
$500 million in Surplus where did that
 
04:41:37.230 --> 04:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
come from and here you can see in this
 
04:41:39.030 --> 04:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
pie chart the breakdown and composition
 
04:41:41.230 --> 04:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
of the largest sources of state revenue
 
04:41:43.628 --> 04:41:43.638 align:start position:0%
Rue Surplus in state fiscal year 2023
 
04:41:45.150 --> 04:41:45.160 align:start position:0%
the combined business taxes meals and
 
04:41:46.868 --> 04:41:46.878 align:start position:0%
rentals tax Lottery Commission revenues
 
04:41:48.708 --> 04:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
which have been doing quite well um real
 
04:41:50.670 --> 04:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
estate transfer tax insurance premium
 
04:41:52.390 --> 04:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
tax interest and dividends and then all
 
04:41:54.910 --> 04:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
other combined was still a $44 million
 
04:41:58.270 --> 04:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
net positive okay fiscal 24 new state
 
04:41:59.708 --> 04:41:59.718 align:start position:0%
revenue plan right so when we're talking
 
04:42:01.310 --> 04:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
about Surplus and deficits that state
 
04:42:02.910 --> 04:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
revenue plan matters what were the
 
04:42:05.830 --> 04:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
largest sources of revenue Surplus same
 
04:42:08.190 --> 04:42:08.200 align:start position:0%
colors but we have a much smaller
 
04:42:09.708 --> 04:42:09.718 align:start position:0%
variety and a much smaller Surplus
 
04:42:11.948 --> 04:42:11.958 align:start position:0%
overall right 126 million
 
04:42:14.190 --> 04:42:14.200 align:start position:0%
and not more than 500 million the
 
04:42:16.948 --> 04:42:16.958 align:start position:0%
interest in dividends tax brought in 48%
 
04:42:19.868 --> 04:42:19.878 align:start position:0%
of that Surplus at about 615 million
 
04:42:21.990 --> 04:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
over plan interest on state cash
 
04:42:24.030 --> 04:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
Holdings brought in $64 million of that
 
04:42:26.390 --> 04:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
Surplus these are both inherently
 
04:42:29.270 --> 04:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
temporary Revenue sources because the
 
04:42:31.030 --> 04:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
interest on state cash Holdings desend
 
04:42:32.590 --> 04:42:32.600 align:start position:0%
depends on the state holding cash and
 
04:42:33.990 --> 04:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
some of that cash is onetime federal
 
04:42:36.350 --> 04:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
funds also depends on interest rates
 
04:42:38.310 --> 04:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
which since fiscal year 24 have gone
 
04:42:39.590 --> 04:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
down I don't know exactly what's going
 
04:42:41.868 --> 04:42:41.878 align:start position:0%
to happen in fiscal 25 but or pardon me
 
04:42:44.990 --> 04:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 26 and 27 but fiscal year 24
 
04:42:47.190 --> 04:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
uh to now they've gone down and the
 
04:42:48.750 --> 04:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends tax was repealed
 
04:42:50.310 --> 04:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
as of January 1st you'll still get
 
04:42:52.390 --> 04:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
revenue from it in in April you'll get
 
04:42:54.030 --> 04:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
the tax returns and there'll probably be
 
04:42:56.990 --> 04:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
some windup associated with it um but uh
 
04:42:59.390 --> 04:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
the tax returns from 24 I should say but
 
04:43:01.150 --> 04:43:01.160 align:start position:0%
this these are both inherently temporary
 
04:43:02.628 --> 04:43:02.638 align:start position:0%
Revenue sources which means without
 
04:43:04.190 --> 04:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
those there essentially wouldn't have
 
04:43:05.628 --> 04:43:05.638 align:start position:0%
been a surplus in
 
04:43:08.430 --> 04:43:08.440 align:start position:0%
24 so where are we now right where are
 
04:43:10.270 --> 04:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
we as of the end of December um and
 
04:43:11.830 --> 04:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
you'll see in your full fers we have
 
04:43:14.070 --> 04:43:14.080 align:start position:0%
some deeper analysis of where December
 
04:43:16.470 --> 04:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
revenues came in and if you look all the
 
04:43:17.830 --> 04:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
way over on the left these are General
 
04:43:19.590 --> 04:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
and education trust fund sources broken
 
04:43:21.670 --> 04:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
out in more detail interest on surplus
 
04:43:23.070 --> 04:43:23.080 align:start position:0%
funds and interest in dividends tax
 
04:43:25.030 --> 04:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
revenue are still the leading
 
04:43:27.470 --> 04:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
contributors to the revenue Surplus but
 
04:43:29.390 --> 04:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
they are both lower as you can see in
 
04:43:31.070 --> 04:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
the blue bars or the ones that have the
 
04:43:33.070 --> 04:43:33.080 align:start position:0%
cross thatches on them they are both
 
04:43:35.470 --> 04:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
lower than they were uh last state
 
04:43:37.310 --> 04:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal year at this time so if you
 
04:43:39.030 --> 04:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
compare this December to last December
 
04:43:41.670 --> 04:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
year end and if you look it's a mixed
 
04:43:43.310 --> 04:43:43.320 align:start position:0%
picture otherwise except for all the way
 
04:43:44.948 --> 04:43:44.958 align:start position:0%
over toward the right I did put the
 
04:43:46.590 --> 04:43:46.600 align:start position:0%
motor fuels tax on here as well even
 
04:43:48.270 --> 04:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
though it's not a general and education
 
04:43:49.628 --> 04:43:49.638 align:start position:0%
trust fund Revenue Source who wanted to
 
04:43:51.470 --> 04:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
give you context towards the right you
 
04:43:53.110 --> 04:43:53.120 align:start position:0%
can see combined business profits and
 
04:43:55.868 --> 04:43:55.878 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax revenue is about
 
04:43:59.670 --> 04:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
83 to 84 million below where it was last
 
04:44:01.550 --> 04:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
year at this time and where it was
 
04:44:03.230 --> 04:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
relative to plan right so both those
 
04:44:04.470 --> 04:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
measures it's sort of coincidence that
 
04:44:05.510 --> 04:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
they're that close to each other in
 
04:44:07.948 --> 04:44:07.958 align:start position:0%
number but both those measures show that
 
04:44:09.550 --> 04:44:09.560 align:start position:0%
we're not collecting as much business
 
04:44:12.628 --> 04:44:12.638 align:start position:0%
tax revenue um as we did last year or as
 
04:44:14.990 --> 04:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
we expected to do when the legislature
 
04:44:17.030 --> 04:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
set forth the state revenue plan amounts
 
04:44:18.230 --> 04:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
in June of
 
04:44:21.150 --> 04:44:21.160 align:start position:0%
23 now a lot of the revenue growth that
 
04:44:23.190 --> 04:44:23.200 align:start position:0%
we've seen over the last eight years in
 
04:44:25.270 --> 04:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
particular has been because of business
 
04:44:26.708 --> 04:44:26.718 align:start position:0%
tax revenues particularly business
 
04:44:28.628 --> 04:44:28.638 align:start position:0%
profits tax revenues remember how I
 
04:44:30.070 --> 04:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
talked about it was difficult to break
 
04:44:33.070 --> 04:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
out the BPT from the BET revenues well
 
04:44:34.430 --> 04:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
the Department of Revenue Administration
 
04:44:36.390 --> 04:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
Endeavors to do it every year in their
 
04:44:38.070 --> 04:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
annual reports and provide us with those
 
04:44:41.310 --> 04:44:41.320 align:start position:0%
draft data um however it's you know it
 
04:44:42.868 --> 04:44:42.878 align:start position:0%
we we just got the data from tax year
 
04:44:45.150 --> 04:44:45.160 align:start position:0%
2022 right in the in the uh annual
 
04:44:46.390 --> 04:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
report that was released a few months
 
04:44:49.070 --> 04:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
ago so here's the breakdown from 2008 to
 
04:44:52.390 --> 04:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
2022 you can see that Top Line in uh
 
04:44:54.430 --> 04:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
with the diamonds in blue that's the
 
04:44:55.948 --> 04:44:55.958 align:start position:0%
business profits tax revenue so that's
 
04:44:58.230 --> 04:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
gone up much more substantially um and
 
04:44:59.788 --> 04:44:59.798 align:start position:0%
that is uh we'll talk about some of the
 
04:45:01.350 --> 04:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
factors for that business Enterprise tax
 
04:45:04.550 --> 04:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
revenue has been much more tepid much
 
04:45:05.830 --> 04:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
there has been growth but it's been
 
04:45:09.190 --> 04:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
flatter that's in part because of the uh
 
04:45:11.070 --> 04:45:11.080 align:start position:0%
difference in the tax base you know it's
 
04:45:13.708 --> 04:45:13.718 align:start position:0%
largely compensation um and it tracks
 
04:45:15.310 --> 04:45:15.320 align:start position:0%
quite well to compensation paid in the
 
04:45:16.430 --> 04:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
state which we know through the state's
 
04:45:18.510 --> 04:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation system but the
 
04:45:20.230 --> 04:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
rate reductions have been as a
 
04:45:22.910 --> 04:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
percentage of the original rate in 2015
 
04:45:24.868 --> 04:45:24.878 align:start position:0%
much more aggressive for the business
 
04:45:26.310 --> 04:45:26.320 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax than they have been for
 
04:45:28.070 --> 04:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax and that has
 
04:45:29.670 --> 04:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
cost revenue and that is something that
 
04:45:31.150 --> 04:45:31.160 align:start position:0%
we see in each one of these years that
 
04:45:33.708 --> 04:45:33.718 align:start position:0%
Revenue breaks from the trend of the tax
 
04:45:36.470 --> 04:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
base um in each of the uh in each of the
 
04:45:38.868 --> 04:45:38.878 align:start position:0%
years where there's a tax rate reduction
 
04:45:40.270 --> 04:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
but what about the business profits tax
 
04:45:42.470 --> 04:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
why do we see that increase we see that
 
04:45:44.150 --> 04:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
National corporate profits have
 
04:45:45.868 --> 04:45:45.878 align:start position:0%
increased substantially particularly
 
04:45:48.110 --> 04:45:48.120 align:start position:0%
since the start of the covid-19 pandemic
 
04:45:50.190 --> 04:45:50.200 align:start position:0%
from 2016 to 2019 they were growing
 
04:45:52.030 --> 04:45:52.040 align:start position:0%
pretty well you see the pandemic
 
04:45:53.628 --> 04:45:53.638 align:start position:0%
interrupted it but then there was a very
 
04:45:55.788 --> 04:45:55.798 align:start position:0%
substantial growth particularly in 2021
 
04:45:57.990 --> 04:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
and 2022 which matches some of those
 
04:46:00.150 --> 04:46:00.160 align:start position:0%
Revenue increases that we see and
 
04:46:01.830 --> 04:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
National corporate profits do matter for
 
04:46:03.590 --> 04:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
the corporate tax base in New Hampshire
 
04:46:05.390 --> 04:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
because if we look at the breakdown of
 
04:46:08.910 --> 04:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
filers and how much each filer pays
 
04:46:12.270 --> 04:46:12.280 align:start position:0%
about 19 well filers in the draft data
 
04:46:14.628 --> 04:46:14.638 align:start position:0%
that we have so far for tax year 2022
 
04:46:17.030 --> 04:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
paid 40% of the business profits tax
 
04:46:18.628 --> 04:46:18.638 align:start position:0%
right this is not including the business
 
04:46:20.830 --> 04:46:20.840 align:start position:0%
Enterprise tax that's a more distributed
 
04:46:22.510 --> 04:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
picture and the business Enterprise tax
 
04:46:24.190 --> 04:46:24.200 align:start position:0%
is used as a credit against the business
 
04:46:26.868 --> 04:46:26.878 align:start position:0%
profits tax but we can see that those
 
04:46:30.270 --> 04:46:30.280 align:start position:0%
top nearly 120 filers combined with the
 
04:46:32.230 --> 04:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
next thousand or so filers so think
 
04:46:34.110 --> 04:46:34.120 align:start position:0%
about the top a little less than 1200
 
04:46:36.750 --> 04:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
filers paid 3/4 of the state's largest
 
04:46:38.670 --> 04:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
tax revenue Source right and and
 
04:46:40.270 --> 04:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
corporate tax revenues if you look at
 
04:46:42.190 --> 04:46:42.200 align:start position:0%
State corporate taxes Across the Nation
 
04:46:43.948 --> 04:46:43.958 align:start position:0%
tend to be relatively volatile right
 
04:46:45.430 --> 04:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
that is one of the more volatile tax
 
04:46:48.548 --> 04:46:48.558 align:start position:0%
revenue sources so these this is part of
 
04:46:49.868 --> 04:46:49.878 align:start position:0%
the reason why we can look at those
 
04:46:51.070 --> 04:46:51.080 align:start position:0%
National corporate profits and when
 
04:46:52.750 --> 04:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
you're doing Revenue estimates thinking
 
04:46:54.150 --> 04:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
about those National corporate profits
 
04:46:55.750 --> 04:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
May provide you with some additional
 
04:46:57.948 --> 04:46:57.958 align:start position:0%
Insight another way that we can know
 
04:46:59.310 --> 04:46:59.320 align:start position:0%
that those National corporate profits
 
04:47:02.070 --> 04:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
matter is the types of filers what do
 
04:47:04.230 --> 04:47:04.240 align:start position:0%
entities file as What do businesses file
 
04:47:06.150 --> 04:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
as when they're paying their business
 
04:47:08.708 --> 04:47:08.718 align:start position:0%
profits tax um here you can see
 
04:47:10.510 --> 04:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
Proprietors including so Proprietors and
 
04:47:11.788 --> 04:47:11.798 align:start position:0%
corpor ation and those two different
 
04:47:14.190 --> 04:47:14.200 align:start position:0%
shades of blue Partnerships fiduciaries
 
04:47:16.510 --> 04:47:16.520 align:start position:0%
or a small portion and then those Waters
 
04:47:19.350 --> 04:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
Edge combined multicomponent filers what
 
04:47:22.030 --> 04:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
that what that effectively means is that
 
04:47:25.548 --> 04:47:25.558 align:start position:0%
you have a business entity that has at
 
04:47:27.470 --> 04:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
least one at least two different parts
 
04:47:28.990 --> 04:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
to it right it could be a proprietorship
 
04:47:30.708 --> 04:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
and a corporation or it could be two
 
04:47:31.750 --> 04:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
different corporations that are
 
04:47:33.070 --> 04:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
Incorporated in different states for
 
04:47:35.150 --> 04:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
example they're providing a combined
 
04:47:38.150 --> 04:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
report and that combined report would
 
04:47:40.548 --> 04:47:40.558 align:start position:0%
show up as a Water's Edge or combined
 
04:47:44.070 --> 04:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
report rep in Filer and they were 7% of
 
04:47:46.548 --> 04:47:46.558 align:start position:0%
the filers if you look at the revenue
 
04:47:49.948 --> 04:47:49.958 align:start position:0%
from tax year 2022 they were 58% of the
 
04:47:52.390 --> 04:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
revenue collected right so that suggests
 
04:47:54.470 --> 04:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
and commissioner stepp referred to these
 
04:47:57.190 --> 04:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
as multinational entities right um there
 
04:47:58.830 --> 04:47:58.840 align:start position:0%
could be a Waters Edge filer that's
 
04:48:00.270 --> 04:48:00.280 align:start position:0%
Incorporated in New Hampshire right or
 
04:48:01.788 --> 04:48:01.798 align:start position:0%
that's based in New Hampshire there
 
04:48:03.830 --> 04:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
could be a Waters Edge filer elsewhere
 
04:48:05.110 --> 04:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
right there could be a corporation
 
04:48:06.430 --> 04:48:06.440 align:start position:0%
that's based entirely outside New
 
04:48:08.830 --> 04:48:08.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and does business here has
 
04:48:11.150 --> 04:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
sales here and as a result files tax
 
04:48:14.350 --> 04:48:14.360 align:start position:0%
here right so there's a um uh this
 
04:48:16.750 --> 04:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't say where they are headquartered
 
04:48:19.150 --> 04:48:19.160 align:start position:0%
this doesn't say where they're based but
 
04:48:22.628 --> 04:48:22.638 align:start position:0%
it does say that the complex entities
 
04:48:24.788 --> 04:48:24.798 align:start position:0%
that have multiple components make up
 
04:48:26.548 --> 04:48:26.558 align:start position:0%
the majority of the revenue that comes
 
04:48:28.150 --> 04:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
into to the state's largest tax revenue
 
04:48:29.868 --> 04:48:29.878 align:start position:0%
source and largest tax revenue Source by
 
04:48:33.070 --> 04:48:33.080 align:start position:0%
a factor of two and one of the reasons
 
04:48:34.430 --> 04:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
we can look at National corporate
 
04:48:37.190 --> 04:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
profits and S and we have an
 
04:48:38.670 --> 04:48:38.680 align:start position:0%
understanding that that is probably
 
04:48:41.030 --> 04:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
affecting our tax base as well is that
 
04:48:43.270 --> 04:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
if we look at where State corporate tax
 
04:48:45.948 --> 04:48:45.958 align:start position:0%
revenues have trended overall since 2015
 
04:48:48.788 --> 04:48:48.798 align:start position:0%
so between 2015 and 2023 we see that
 
04:48:51.310 --> 04:48:51.320 align:start position:0%
Nationwide they've almost tripled over
 
04:48:53.030 --> 04:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
that time period And if you take New
 
04:48:54.190 --> 04:48:54.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire out of New England they've
 
04:48:57.350 --> 04:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
gone up 172% New Hampshire has went up
 
04:48:59.708 --> 04:48:59.718 align:start position:0%
124% so a little bit lower policy
 
04:49:00.990 --> 04:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
changes were probably part of that we
 
04:49:02.350 --> 04:49:02.360 align:start position:0%
did have a lot of policy changes
 
04:49:04.430 --> 04:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
associated with the business taxes both
 
04:49:06.310 --> 04:49:06.320 align:start position:0%
the rate and the base over this time
 
04:49:09.990 --> 04:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
period um but the growth that we see in
 
04:49:11.910 --> 04:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
corporate tax revenues is a national
 
04:49:13.590 --> 04:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
phenomenon right and this shows that
 
04:49:15.868 --> 04:49:15.878 align:start position:0%
that all states or all states in
 
04:49:17.910 --> 04:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
aggregate I should say have seen
 
04:49:20.750 --> 04:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
increases in their corporate tax
 
04:49:23.628 --> 04:49:23.638 align:start position:0%
receipts so what are some takeaways
 
04:49:25.510 --> 04:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
after we've spoken at you for about 40
 
04:49:27.628 --> 04:49:27.638 align:start position:0%
minutes here um one is that the economy
 
04:49:30.030 --> 04:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
is performing well overall and income
 
04:49:32.628 --> 04:49:32.638 align:start position:0%
growth may be more limited in 2024 uh
 
04:49:34.390 --> 04:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
relative to inflation compared to 2023
 
04:49:36.910 --> 04:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
so we'll have to see uh what that looks
 
04:49:39.868 --> 04:49:39.878 align:start position:0%
like um as we get more finalized data
 
04:49:41.990 --> 04:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
about 98 ,000 Granite Staters have
 
04:49:43.910 --> 04:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
poverty level incomes and poverty may be
 
04:49:45.628 --> 04:49:45.638 align:start position:0%
rising among older adults in the state
 
04:49:46.990 --> 04:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
we have two different sets of poverty
 
04:49:49.830 --> 04:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
related data that point to that nearly
 
04:49:51.628 --> 04:49:51.638 align:start position:0%
one in three adults reported difficulty
 
04:49:53.150 --> 04:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
affording usual household expenses
 
04:49:54.670 --> 04:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
that's that 30% number that Jess
 
04:49:57.628 --> 04:49:57.638 align:start position:0%
referred to and there are the key cost
 
04:50:00.190 --> 04:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
increases that we see in housing in
 
04:50:03.070 --> 04:50:03.080 align:start position:0%
child care um and the accessibility and
 
04:50:05.190 --> 04:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
affordability of those are taking up
 
04:50:06.910 --> 04:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
more of household budgets and that
 
04:50:08.548 --> 04:50:08.558 align:start position:0%
restricts those households abilities to
 
04:50:10.070 --> 04:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
spend money in other parts of the
 
04:50:11.788 --> 04:50:11.798 align:start position:0%
economy right so that has implications
 
04:50:14.628 --> 04:50:14.638 align:start position:0%
for economic growth and prosperity um
 
04:50:16.150 --> 04:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
there are two of the key factors holding
 
04:50:17.868 --> 04:50:17.878 align:start position:0%
back growth in the labor force and the
 
04:50:20.310 --> 04:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
economy um the third being long-term
 
04:50:22.628 --> 04:50:22.638 align:start position:0%
demographic Trends as Jess outlined and
 
04:50:24.910 --> 04:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
as you heard from uh Professor Johnson
 
04:50:26.390 --> 04:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
and you heard from the folks at New
 
04:50:28.628 --> 04:50:28.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employment security it's uh
 
04:50:31.030 --> 04:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
thematically important here um migration
 
04:50:32.750 --> 04:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
has supported population growth and if
 
04:50:33.868 --> 04:50:33.878 align:start position:0%
we're thinking about upskilling the
 
04:50:36.070 --> 04:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
workforce making the most of all the
 
04:50:37.990 --> 04:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
workforce that we have here education is
 
04:50:40.670 --> 04:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
a long-term uh component of that as well
 
04:50:42.190 --> 04:50:42.200 align:start position:0%
well when we think about people who are
 
04:50:43.590 --> 04:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
we need people to be able to move here
 
04:50:45.430 --> 04:50:45.440 align:start position:0%
and we need uh them to have the skills
 
04:50:47.590 --> 04:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
to participate in the uh in the labor
 
04:50:49.990 --> 04:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
force and in the economy State revenues
 
04:50:51.270 --> 04:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
are declining overall both due to
 
04:50:52.628 --> 04:50:52.638 align:start position:0%
external factors such as corporate
 
04:50:54.390 --> 04:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
profits and interest rates and policy
 
04:50:55.788 --> 04:50:55.798 align:start position:0%
choices that have reduced state revenue
 
04:50:57.150 --> 04:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
the repeal of the interest and dividends
 
04:50:59.708 --> 04:50:59.718 align:start position:0%
tax is a pretty significant component of
 
04:51:02.750 --> 04:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
general fund revenues it was 8.8% based
 
04:51:05.230 --> 04:51:05.240 align:start position:0%
on the fiscal year 2024 revenues we have
 
04:51:07.750 --> 04:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
so far of general fund revenues that
 
04:51:10.590 --> 04:51:10.600 align:start position:0%
shows up in the or that will show up in
 
04:51:11.670 --> 04:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
revenues when we're comparing them
 
04:51:15.070 --> 04:51:15.080 align:start position:0%
year-over-year next year for example um
 
04:51:16.830 --> 04:51:16.840 align:start position:0%
and the economy and state revenues are
 
04:51:18.948 --> 04:51:18.958 align:start position:0%
subject to considerable uncertainty over
 
04:51:20.750 --> 04:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
the next two years it's a wide variety
 
04:51:23.788 --> 04:51:23.798 align:start position:0%
of factors National Economic Policy
 
04:51:27.510 --> 04:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
related Geo uh geopolitical factors um
 
04:51:29.150 --> 04:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
Brian went through these on his or some
 
04:51:32.190 --> 04:51:32.200 align:start position:0%
of these on his slide um it's not as
 
04:51:33.390 --> 04:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
difficult a time I don't think to
 
04:51:35.470 --> 04:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
project revenues as for example when you
 
04:51:38.070 --> 04:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
were all sitting here in early 2021 um
 
04:51:39.590 --> 04:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
but I do think there's a lot of
 
04:51:41.390 --> 04:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
uncertainty going into to the next uh
 
04:51:43.230 --> 04:51:43.240 align:start position:0%
two fiscal years um as we look at the
 
04:51:45.430 --> 04:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
time Horizon for the next state budget
 
04:51:46.948 --> 04:51:46.958 align:start position:0%
there are some additional resources that
 
04:51:48.230 --> 04:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
you can find on our website and we're
 
04:51:49.948 --> 04:51:49.958 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions at the
 
04:51:51.590 --> 04:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
discretion of the chair with the balance
 
04:51:53.270 --> 04:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
of the
 
04:52:00.190 --> 04:52:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:03.830 --> 04:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
questions oh we got one representative
 
04:52:06.070 --> 04:52:06.080 align:start position:0%
Daniels the first couple of slides when
 
04:52:07.868 --> 04:52:07.878 align:start position:0%
you talked about personal can you come
 
04:52:09.470 --> 04:52:09.480 align:start position:0%
up uh representative Daniels come up to
 
04:52:12.430 --> 04:52:12.440 align:start position:0%
the microphone on the uh by the
 
04:52:15.190 --> 04:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
door no the he can come over to this
 
04:52:15.200 --> 04:52:17.030 align:start position:0%
door no the he can come over to this
microphone

04:52:17.030 --> 04:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
04:52:19.910 --> 04:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
sure I've been told that people watching
 
04:52:21.788 --> 04:52:21.798 align:start position:0%
online can't hear us if we're not on a
 
04:52:23.110 --> 04:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
mic yes as as someone who's watching
 
04:52:25.270 --> 04:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
online earlier I I appreciate that thank
 
04:52:27.788 --> 04:52:27.798 align:start position:0%
you thank you in regards to the first
 
04:52:29.230 --> 04:52:29.240 align:start position:0%
couple of slides you talked about
 
04:52:31.590 --> 04:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
personal income was that personal income
 
04:52:34.708 --> 04:52:34.718 align:start position:0%
earned income or earned and unearned
 
04:52:36.750 --> 04:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
earned income yeah great question uh
 
04:52:38.868 --> 04:52:38.878 align:start position:0%
this is earn this is earned income and
 
04:52:40.750 --> 04:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
income collected from sources other than
 
04:52:41.910 --> 04:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
right so this is all income that's going
 
04:52:44.430 --> 04:52:44.440 align:start position:0%
to households thank you I guess I have a
 
04:52:47.788 --> 04:52:47.798 align:start position:0%
question um two of the larger uh groups
 
04:52:49.910 --> 04:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
in the state are the um I think I don't
 
04:52:51.310 --> 04:52:51.320 align:start position:0%
know if was your presentation or another
 
04:52:51.320 --> 04:52:53.030 align:start position:0%
know if was your presentation or another
one

04:52:53.030 --> 04:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:52:56.150 --> 04:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
um whatever it was 34 to 55 year olds or
 
04:52:59.548 --> 04:52:59.558 align:start position:0%
whatever and then the 60 plus now have
 
04:53:01.830 --> 04:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
we seen a change in the 60 plus as to
 
04:53:03.430 --> 04:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
the number of them that are continuing
 
04:53:07.390 --> 04:53:07.400 align:start position:0%
to work um as opposed to just retiring
 
04:53:09.910 --> 04:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so a great question um I'd say over
 
04:53:12.708 --> 04:53:12.718 align:start position:0%
multiple decades we see that the 55 Pard
 
04:53:14.868 --> 04:53:14.878 align:start position:0%
me the 65 to 74 age group we've seen an
 
04:53:15.868 --> 04:53:15.878 align:start position:0%
increase in the labor force
 
04:53:18.110 --> 04:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
participation rate it's still much lower
 
04:53:19.868 --> 04:53:19.878 align:start position:0%
than the 55 to 64 age group you're
 
04:53:21.788 --> 04:53:21.798 align:start position:0%
talking about going from you know 75 or
 
04:53:25.830 --> 04:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
80% down to 30% um but it used to be
 
04:53:28.110 --> 04:53:28.120 align:start position:0%
more like 20% so that's a that's you
 
04:53:30.670 --> 04:53:30.680 align:start position:0%
know comparing the early 1990s to now
 
04:53:35.350 --> 04:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
for example um in the post pandemic era
 
04:53:36.830 --> 04:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
um and I haven't seen the latest data
 
04:53:38.070 --> 04:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire employment security
 
04:53:39.708 --> 04:53:39.718 align:start position:0%
they have access to data that is not
 
04:53:41.230 --> 04:53:41.240 align:start position:0%
published as regular ly but in the
 
04:53:44.110 --> 04:53:44.120 align:start position:0%
post-pandemic era um we have seen some
 
04:53:46.750 --> 04:53:46.760 align:start position:0%
swings in the labor force participation
 
04:53:48.670 --> 04:53:48.680 align:start position:0%
among older adults uh there were more
 
04:53:50.510 --> 04:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
older adults who took themselves out of
 
04:53:52.948 --> 04:53:52.958 align:start position:0%
the labor force and some of them have
 
04:53:54.430 --> 04:53:54.440 align:start position:0%
returned I don't know if that return has
 
04:53:58.150 --> 04:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
been complete yet so to speak um and uh
 
04:54:00.350 --> 04:54:00.360 align:start position:0%
and of course as the age profile changes
 
04:54:02.070 --> 04:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking about different numbers of
 
04:54:04.590 --> 04:54:04.600 align:start position:0%
people who are in that uh 65 to 74
 
04:54:06.868 --> 04:54:06.878 align:start position:0%
category but over the long term yes the
 
04:54:09.430 --> 04:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
labor force participation rate um has
 
04:54:12.590 --> 04:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
increased for the 65 to 74 age group and
 
04:54:15.190 --> 04:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
that's something that um I always when
 
04:54:16.590 --> 04:54:16.600 align:start position:0%
we talk about demographics I always try
 
04:54:18.590 --> 04:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
to remind folks is that you know when we
 
04:54:20.788 --> 04:54:20.798 align:start position:0%
hit age 65 not everyone just suddenly
 
04:54:22.270 --> 04:54:22.280 align:start position:0%
retires right there's there's a lot of
 
04:54:24.070 --> 04:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
people who continue to work whether they
 
04:54:25.948 --> 04:54:25.958 align:start position:0%
want to or need to right and whatever
 
04:54:26.948 --> 04:54:26.958 align:start position:0%
the reason for it there are a lot of
 
04:54:29.670 --> 04:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
people who are continuing to work uh and
 
04:54:31.030 --> 04:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh that's something that I expect we'll
 
04:54:34.788 --> 04:54:34.798 align:start position:0%
see more of as more of us reach that 65
 
04:54:37.628 --> 04:54:37.638 align:start position:0%
to 74 age group it's a question of you
 
04:54:39.510 --> 04:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
know does that labor force participation
 
04:54:41.230 --> 04:54:41.240 align:start position:0%
rate move enough
 
04:54:43.910 --> 04:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
that we don't see that the economic
 
04:54:48.350 --> 04:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
impacts are sort of um affected by that
 
04:54:52.110 --> 04:54:52.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:54.430 --> 04:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
muns thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:54:56.948 --> 04:54:56.958 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I'm on one of
 
04:54:58.670 --> 04:54:58.680 align:start position:0%
your slides it was the slide that's
 
04:55:02.110 --> 04:55:02.120 align:start position:0%
titled Revenue growth elusive in uh
 
04:55:03.708 --> 04:55:03.718 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
04:55:09.948 --> 04:55:09.958 align:start position:0%
2025 um the the um the difference in
 
04:55:13.070 --> 04:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
combin business profits and Enterprise
 
04:55:17.110 --> 04:55:17.120 align:start position:0%
tax um versus last year and also versus
 
04:55:19.270 --> 04:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
the plan for last year were almost
 
04:55:22.430 --> 04:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
identical numbers almost identical which
 
04:55:24.150 --> 04:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
to me suggests that maybe there was
 
04:55:26.830 --> 04:55:26.840 align:start position:0%
something that was missed in the in the
 
04:55:30.990 --> 04:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
development of the plan last time do you
 
04:55:32.590 --> 04:55:32.600 align:start position:0%
do you do you have any thoughts on that
 
04:55:34.390 --> 04:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
well if we think about the factors that
 
04:55:37.110 --> 04:55:37.120 align:start position:0%
have probably led to the revenue decline
 
04:55:40.430 --> 04:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
relative to the plan um some of them are
 
04:55:42.230 --> 04:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
quite complex some of them are some of
 
04:55:44.750 --> 04:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
them are that we see different behavior
 
04:55:46.470 --> 04:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
in corporate profits right so that's
 
04:55:47.910 --> 04:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
hard to predict it's inherently hard to
 
04:55:50.948 --> 04:55:50.958 align:start position:0%
predict um some of it is uh something
 
04:55:53.190 --> 04:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
that uh the house ways and me committee
 
04:55:54.590 --> 04:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
and the Senate ways Comm committee have
 
04:55:55.948 --> 04:55:55.958 align:start position:0%
already addressed to a certain extent
 
04:55:59.230 --> 04:55:59.240 align:start position:0%
which is the cap on uh Car Credit carry
 
04:56:01.910 --> 04:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
forward so that credit carryover cap of
 
04:56:04.390 --> 04:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
500% that originally was going to go to
 
04:56:07.470 --> 04:56:07.480 align:start position:0%
250% for tax year 2025 and now has been
 
04:56:10.310 --> 04:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
pushed out to 2029 we saw after the
 
04:56:12.628 --> 04:56:12.638 align:start position:0%
implementation of that and I'll point to
 
04:56:15.030 --> 04:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
in your green folders this is discussed
 
04:56:17.990 --> 04:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
in that analysis of December revenues um
 
04:56:20.110 --> 04:56:20.120 align:start position:0%
we saw an increase in refunds associated
 
04:56:22.830 --> 04:56:22.840 align:start position:0%
with that and I think that I I suspect
 
04:56:24.390 --> 04:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
that that was a hard thing to predict
 
04:56:27.470 --> 04:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
the exact impact of going into this next
 
04:56:29.548 --> 04:56:29.558 align:start position:0%
budget cycle we didn't you know we
 
04:56:31.628 --> 04:56:31.638 align:start position:0%
didn't know exactly what the impacts of
 
04:56:35.150 --> 04:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
that were going to be um because uh I I
 
04:56:36.390 --> 04:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
I'll say frankly I was a little
 
04:56:38.070 --> 04:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
surprised that the impacts were as
 
04:56:40.470 --> 04:56:40.480 align:start position:0%
substantial as they were with that 500%
 
04:56:42.548 --> 04:56:42.558 align:start position:0%
cap right I thought that would be um
 
04:56:44.350 --> 04:56:44.360 align:start position:0%
high enough that not many business
 
04:56:45.548 --> 04:56:45.558 align:start position:0%
entities would have actually been
 
04:56:47.910 --> 04:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
hitting it never mind enough to reduce
 
04:56:49.390 --> 04:56:49.400 align:start position:0%
revenues by as much as they were
 
04:56:51.030 --> 04:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
relative to what we might have expected
 
04:56:53.990 --> 04:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
just with underlying Trends um I I so
 
04:56:55.390 --> 04:56:55.400 align:start position:0%
the business tax rate reduction there
 
04:56:56.628 --> 04:56:56.638 align:start position:0%
was another tax rate reduction in the
 
04:56:58.990 --> 04:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
business profits tax in 2023 that
 
04:57:00.510 --> 04:57:00.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have affected revenues relative
 
04:57:02.470 --> 04:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
to plan might have affect might be
 
04:57:03.788 --> 04:57:03.798 align:start position:0%
affecting revenues relative to the prior
 
04:57:05.910 --> 04:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
year but that's baked into the plan
 
04:57:07.548 --> 04:57:07.558 align:start position:0%
right there's a static Revenue reduction
 
04:57:09.070 --> 04:57:09.080 align:start position:0%
that's baked into the state revenue plan
 
04:57:10.868 --> 04:57:10.878 align:start position:0%
from that um
 
04:57:12.788 --> 04:57:12.798 align:start position:0%
another couple factors that are policy
 
04:57:15.070 --> 04:57:15.080 align:start position:0%
changes that I think are hard to unpack
 
04:57:17.510 --> 04:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
and hard to predict are the shift to
 
04:57:19.190 --> 04:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing and the shift to
 
04:57:21.150 --> 04:57:21.160 align:start position:0%
single sales factor and that shift to
 
04:57:23.670 --> 04:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
single sales factor in particular you
 
04:57:26.190 --> 04:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
know what the extent to which it
 
04:57:28.670 --> 04:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
increases or de decreases revenues I'll
 
04:57:29.948 --> 04:57:29.958 align:start position:0%
leave to the folks at the Department of
 
04:57:31.070 --> 04:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
Revenue Administration to be able to
 
04:57:33.190 --> 04:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
speak to more comprehensively than I can
 
04:57:34.990 --> 04:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
but it likely makes tax revenues more
 
04:57:38.390 --> 04:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
volatile because before T the tax base
 
04:57:40.990 --> 04:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
included Personnel property and sales
 
04:57:42.590 --> 04:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
and the fraction of a multi-states
 
04:57:44.430 --> 04:57:44.440 align:start position:0%
entity person Personnel property and
 
04:57:46.390 --> 04:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
sales that were based in the state
 
04:57:47.990 --> 04:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
shifting to just sales and sales were
 
04:57:49.470 --> 04:57:49.480 align:start position:0%
double weighted before but shifting to
 
04:57:53.030 --> 04:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
just sales means that the tax base may
 
04:57:56.430 --> 04:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
move more rapidly for a business entity
 
04:57:58.868 --> 04:57:58.878 align:start position:0%
then it would have if personnel and
 
04:57:59.990 --> 04:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
property which might move a little bit
 
04:58:03.750 --> 04:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
more slowly than sales changes um uh
 
04:58:05.990 --> 04:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
that you know that change means that
 
04:58:07.030 --> 04:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
there may be a little bit more
 
04:58:09.470 --> 04:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
volatility that's been harder to predict
 
04:58:10.750 --> 04:58:10.760 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
04:58:12.030 --> 04:58:12.040 align:start position:0%
not a simple answer to your question
 
04:58:15.310 --> 04:58:15.320 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to unpack and I think that
 
04:58:17.590 --> 04:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
rather than thinking about did the state
 
04:58:20.390 --> 04:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
revenue plan you know properly capture
 
04:58:22.990 --> 04:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
all of that I think it's was just very
 
04:58:24.510 --> 04:58:24.520 align:start position:0%
difficult to get at what the changes are
 
04:58:27.190 --> 04:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
likely to be um uh when crafting the
 
04:58:28.430 --> 04:58:28.440 align:start position:0%
state revenue plan because so many
 
04:58:30.430 --> 04:58:30.440 align:start position:0%
policy changes have happened at the same
 
04:58:33.150 --> 04:58:33.160 align:start position:0%
time recently um one other piece is just
 
04:58:34.990 --> 04:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
that you know while we're seeing the
 
04:58:37.788 --> 04:58:37.798 align:start position:0%
economy settle out much more now there's
 
04:58:40.110 --> 04:58:40.120 align:start position:0%
still you we still have gone through a
 
04:58:41.350 --> 04:58:41.360 align:start position:0%
period where we've seen quite a bit of
 
04:58:43.310 --> 04:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
economic volatility by a number of key
 
04:58:44.750 --> 04:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
metrics I say metrics cuz we're
 
04:58:46.868 --> 04:58:46.878 align:start position:0%
researchers so that's what we look at um
 
04:58:49.910 --> 04:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
but uh you know I think that saying that
 
04:58:52.110 --> 04:58:52.120 align:start position:0%
the economy is completely settled now at
 
04:58:53.470 --> 04:58:53.480 align:start position:0%
this point and we should expect it to
 
04:58:56.070 --> 04:58:56.080 align:start position:0%
just be you know go forward as it did in
 
04:58:59.270 --> 04:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
2018 and 2019 I we we've it's taken a
 
04:59:00.670 --> 04:59:00.680 align:start position:0%
long time to work a lot of the things
 
04:59:01.830 --> 04:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
out that were associated with the
 
04:59:04.670 --> 04:59:04.680 align:start position:0%
disruptions in 2020 and 2021 so we may
 
04:59:07.830 --> 04:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
still be seeing in the revenue declines
 
04:59:09.548 --> 04:59:09.558 align:start position:0%
some of the effects of that right we may
 
04:59:11.990 --> 04:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
be seeing profits get back to you know
 
04:59:13.868 --> 04:59:13.878 align:start position:0%
something that's more of a normal share
 
04:59:17.230 --> 04:59:17.240 align:start position:0%
of overall revenues or GDP um but I
 
04:59:18.510 --> 04:59:18.520 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know it's a good set of
 
04:59:21.350 --> 04:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
questions to to be asking thank you
 
04:59:23.750 --> 04:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:59:25.948 --> 04:59:25.958 align:start position:0%
M yeah thank you I have a followup
 
04:59:29.868 --> 04:59:29.878 align:start position:0%
question to the 65 plus demographic can
 
04:59:32.628 --> 04:59:32.638 align:start position:0%
you characterize uh how many people in
 
04:59:35.310 --> 04:59:35.320 align:start position:0%
that demographic are Ting the workforce
 
04:59:37.030 --> 04:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
then how long they stay in the workforce
 
04:59:39.270 --> 04:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
before they move on to other things yeah
 
04:59:41.350 --> 04:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
that's a a great question so um just you
 
04:59:42.788 --> 04:59:42.798 align:start position:0%
want me to go ahead and take this one
 
04:59:45.910 --> 04:59:45.920 align:start position:0%
okay um so uh the labor force
 
04:59:48.070 --> 04:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
participation rate for at least for 65
 
04:59:50.510 --> 04:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
to 74 like I said I think I remember it
 
04:59:53.788 --> 04:59:53.798 align:start position:0%
being about 30% um and it may be in the
 
04:59:56.150 --> 04:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
low 30s now maybe in the high 20s now uh
 
04:59:57.430 --> 04:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire employment security does
 
05:00:01.230 --> 05:00:01.240 align:start position:0%
have those data uh and the uh in terms
 
05:00:02.670 --> 05:00:02.680 align:start position:0%
of when you get to
 
05:00:07.150 --> 05:00:07.160 align:start position:0%
75 to 79 and 80 to 84 then you see
 
05:00:08.750 --> 05:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
steeper declines in labor force
 
05:00:11.310 --> 05:00:11.320 align:start position:0%
participation rate they it is measurable
 
05:00:13.110 --> 05:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
right but we're talking more of like
 
05:00:14.990 --> 05:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
single digits or very low double digits
 
05:00:17.350 --> 05:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
at that point um in terms of how long
 
05:00:19.110 --> 05:00:19.120 align:start position:0%
people stay in the labor force you know
 
05:00:21.110 --> 05:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
that those data give you a sense of the
 
05:00:23.310 --> 05:00:23.320 align:start position:0%
sweep of sweep of someone's life but in
 
05:00:25.070 --> 05:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
terms of do people come and go from the
 
05:00:27.948 --> 05:00:27.958 align:start position:0%
labor force you know doing a smaller job
 
05:00:30.430 --> 05:00:30.440 align:start position:0%
or a job more temporarily um maybe they
 
05:00:31.708 --> 05:00:31.718 align:start position:0%
take themselves out of Labor Force
 
05:00:33.070 --> 05:00:33.080 align:start position:0%
because they've you know earned what
 
05:00:34.350 --> 05:00:34.360 align:start position:0%
they're looking to earn in that time
 
05:00:35.868 --> 05:00:35.878 align:start position:0%
period or for a health reason whatever
 
05:00:37.670 --> 05:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
it may be I don't have those data on
 
05:00:39.190 --> 05:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
that churn if that's what you were
 
05:00:41.548 --> 05:00:41.558 align:start position:0%
asking but the labor force participation
 
05:00:43.470 --> 05:00:43.480 align:start position:0%
rate again is you know it's pretty
 
05:00:44.510 --> 05:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
significant especially when we're
 
05:00:45.788 --> 05:00:45.798 align:start position:0%
talking about as a fraction of our
 
05:00:49.230 --> 05:00:49.240 align:start position:0%
population in the state all yes thank
 
05:00:51.150 --> 05:00:51.160 align:start position:0%
you yeah the reason for my question is
 
05:00:52.470 --> 05:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
if we're thinking about young people
 
05:00:53.868 --> 05:00:53.878 align:start position:0%
entering the workforce we assume it's
 
05:00:57.590 --> 05:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
going to be a fairly decades long uh
 
05:01:00.070 --> 05:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
contribution to the economy but we're
 
05:01:02.830 --> 05:01:02.840 align:start position:0%
thinking about retirees entering the
 
05:01:05.030 --> 05:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
workforce uh it looks like we have a
 
05:01:07.110 --> 05:01:07.120 align:start position:0%
much shorter window for that so that's
 
05:01:08.510 --> 05:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
why I'm trying to get a feeling for what
 
05:01:11.910 --> 05:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
that likely contribution would be per
 
05:01:15.270 --> 05:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
retiree compared to a younger
 
05:01:18.430 --> 05:01:18.440 align:start position:0%
person and I I guess I'll say that um
 
05:01:21.390 --> 05:01:21.400 align:start position:0%
you know for businesses and for
 
05:01:24.670 --> 05:01:24.680 align:start position:0%
businesses and the state RIT large um
 
05:01:26.910 --> 05:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
there are ways that work can be
 
05:01:28.350 --> 05:01:28.360 align:start position:0%
structured that may make it more
 
05:01:30.910 --> 05:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
amenable to individuals who are you know
 
05:01:33.030 --> 05:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
in their 60s or in in their late 60s or
 
05:01:36.350 --> 05:01:36.360 align:start position:0%
in their uh throughout their 70s and you
 
05:01:37.868 --> 05:01:37.878 align:start position:0%
know some of those structures you know
 
05:01:39.510 --> 05:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
there may be more more remote work or
 
05:01:41.868 --> 05:01:41.878 align:start position:0%
Flex hours associated with that there
 
05:01:44.628 --> 05:01:44.638 align:start position:0%
may be more you know either either uh
 
05:01:47.708 --> 05:01:47.718 align:start position:0%
consultation or oversight uh roles
 
05:01:49.670 --> 05:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
associated with that for you know for
 
05:01:51.150 --> 05:01:51.160 align:start position:0%
folks who manage businesses I'm sure
 
05:01:52.708 --> 05:01:52.718 align:start position:0%
they're thinking about this i' hope that
 
05:01:53.750 --> 05:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
some of them are thinking about this
 
05:01:56.470 --> 05:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
every day um I think that there are ways
 
05:01:58.788 --> 05:01:58.798 align:start position:0%
that work could be structured and ways
 
05:02:00.510 --> 05:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
that the state might seek to enable work
 
05:02:02.150 --> 05:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
to be structured that would make it more
 
05:02:04.470 --> 05:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
accessible for more folks and that's not
 
05:02:06.390 --> 05:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
just older folks but individuals with
 
05:02:08.990 --> 05:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities individuals who may um be
 
05:02:10.350 --> 05:02:10.360 align:start position:0%
trying to piece together their Child
 
05:02:12.150 --> 05:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
Care Solutions right so it's not just
 
05:02:15.270 --> 05:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
older adults but as the data show older
 
05:02:16.910 --> 05:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
adults are definitely going to become a
 
05:02:19.190 --> 05:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
significant part of uh our labor force
 
05:02:21.628 --> 05:02:21.638 align:start position:0%
consideration as more than 200,000 of us
 
05:02:24.270 --> 05:02:24.280 align:start position:0%
who are between 55 and 64 in the next 10
 
05:02:25.670 --> 05:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
years will be entering those traditional
 
05:02:25.680 --> 05:02:27.430 align:start position:0%
years will be entering those traditional
retirement

05:02:27.430 --> 05:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
05:02:31.868 --> 05:02:31.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:34.990 --> 05:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
Brun thank you very much Mr chair my
 
05:02:37.430 --> 05:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
question uh Phil uh pertains to your
 
05:02:39.990 --> 05:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
slide on wage growth and it's uneven
 
05:02:42.390 --> 05:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
across counties and I notice the two
 
05:02:44.788 --> 05:02:44.798 align:start position:0%
counties with the biggest change uh Coos
 
05:02:47.788 --> 05:02:47.798 align:start position:0%
and Carol are more isolated from other
 
05:02:49.910 --> 05:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
states do you have any breakout on the
 
05:02:53.190 --> 05:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
data by uh if if that growth is by
 
05:02:55.190 --> 05:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
instate employers or out of state
 
05:02:58.030 --> 05:02:58.040 align:start position:0%
employers uh great question so um what
 
05:03:00.310 --> 05:03:00.320 align:start position:0%
you see here the the wage growth that's
 
05:03:04.270 --> 05:03:04.280 align:start position:0%
reported here um this is from o ews so I
 
05:03:07.430 --> 05:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
can check to see uh how I believe this
 
05:03:09.470 --> 05:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
is reported by employers who are based
 
05:03:11.070 --> 05:03:11.080 align:start position:0%
in the counties but I'll I'll confirm
 
05:03:14.110 --> 05:03:14.120 align:start position:0%
that for you um this is not uh this
 
05:03:16.390 --> 05:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
these survey data are not the other
 
05:03:17.750 --> 05:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
survey data that we're asking about
 
05:03:19.470 --> 05:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
Labor Force participation it's a
 
05:03:23.030 --> 05:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
separate survey from that so um this uh
 
05:03:24.750 --> 05:03:24.760 align:start position:0%
this may better reflect what the wages
 
05:03:26.230 --> 05:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
are that are actually paid by Employers
 
05:03:28.590 --> 05:03:28.600 align:start position:0%
in the county um there are other data
 
05:03:30.430 --> 05:03:30.440 align:start position:0%
that will get exactly to that or what
 
05:03:31.910 --> 05:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
what is the average wage and what is the
 
05:03:33.948 --> 05:03:33.958 align:start position:0%
change in the average wage over time of
 
05:03:35.990 --> 05:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
employer of what employers pay who are
 
05:03:37.270 --> 05:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
based in the county which I think is
 
05:03:38.548 --> 05:03:38.558 align:start position:0%
what you're asking as opposed to like
 
05:03:40.708 --> 05:03:40.718 align:start position:0%
remote work and that sort of thing yeah
 
05:03:44.030 --> 05:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
yes followup yeah that's true and I'm
 
05:03:47.270 --> 05:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
also curious to see particularly in the
 
05:03:51.390 --> 05:03:51.400 align:start position:0%
counties that saw lower wage uh increase
 
05:03:54.510 --> 05:03:54.520 align:start position:0%
are they employed out of state uh you
 
05:03:56.830 --> 05:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
know um you know in southern Hillsboro
 
05:03:58.830 --> 05:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
County even well all of Hillsboro County
 
05:04:00.070 --> 05:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of people that commute
 
05:04:01.830 --> 05:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
into Massachusetts I was just wondering
 
05:04:04.628 --> 05:04:04.638 align:start position:0%
if these numbers reflect those those
 
05:04:06.708 --> 05:04:06.718 align:start position:0%
people yeah so if I recall correctly
 
05:04:09.470 --> 05:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
these numbers reflect uh what Employers
 
05:04:11.548 --> 05:04:11.558 align:start position:0%
in the state are paying so it could be
 
05:04:13.628 --> 05:04:13.638 align:start position:0%
some people who are out of state who are
 
05:04:15.270 --> 05:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
working in New Hampshire who may be
 
05:04:17.510 --> 05:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
reflected in these numbers as well um
 
05:04:18.948 --> 05:04:18.958 align:start position:0%
but I'll confirm that for you I want to
 
05:04:21.310 --> 05:04:21.320 align:start position:0%
make sure I'm I'm uh trying to remember
 
05:04:23.750 --> 05:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
the process for the oew data collection
 
05:04:25.750 --> 05:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
and uh whether there should be any
 
05:04:27.150 --> 05:04:27.160 align:start position:0%
caveats that I'm layering in that I'm
 
05:04:28.990 --> 05:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
forgetting so I I I want to check and
 
05:04:31.830 --> 05:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
make sure but uh these these data are
 
05:04:35.070 --> 05:04:35.080 align:start position:0%
not um uh just the surveying of the
 
05:04:36.670 --> 05:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
population like we do for the labor
 
05:04:38.270 --> 05:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
force statistics right like we did for
 
05:04:40.788 --> 05:04:40.798 align:start position:0%
the uh like we do for the blue bars that
 
05:04:42.270 --> 05:04:42.280 align:start position:0%
are on this graph the greenen bars on
 
05:04:44.270 --> 05:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
this graph are a different data source
 
05:04:46.628 --> 05:04:46.638 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much you're welc uh
 
05:04:48.830 --> 05:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
given that we're basically out of time
 
05:04:50.628 --> 05:04:50.638 align:start position:0%
I'll take one more question from
 
05:04:53.070 --> 05:04:53.080 align:start position:0%
representative shamberg thank you Mr
 
05:04:54.868 --> 05:04:54.878 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking this
 
05:04:58.230 --> 05:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
question uh concerning sales factor and
 
05:05:00.708 --> 05:05:00.718 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing
 
05:05:04.390 --> 05:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh was there a complete study done
 
05:05:07.110 --> 05:05:07.120 align:start position:0%
before these were implemented and
 
05:05:09.110 --> 05:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
changing over from what we were doing in
 
05:05:10.548 --> 05:05:10.558 align:start position:0%
the past
 
05:05:13.910 --> 05:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
so I had seen an analysis of at least
 
05:05:15.470 --> 05:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
single sales factor and I'm trying to
 
05:05:16.830 --> 05:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
remember if Market based sourcing was in
 
05:05:18.670 --> 05:05:18.680 align:start position:0%
it um from the Department Revenue
 
05:05:20.628 --> 05:05:20.638 align:start position:0%
Administration and my understanding is
 
05:05:22.230 --> 05:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
that um it's my understanding from
 
05:05:23.948 --> 05:05:23.958 align:start position:0%
someone in this room that there was a
 
05:05:26.110 --> 05:05:26.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up analysis that was done by
 
05:05:27.548 --> 05:05:27.558 align:start position:0%
Department of Revenue Administration I
 
05:05:29.830 --> 05:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
don't have direct access to those now
 
05:05:31.470 --> 05:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
they probably live somewhere on dr's
 
05:05:33.310 --> 05:05:33.320 align:start position:0%
website Dr is a wonderful state agency
 
05:05:35.310 --> 05:05:35.320 align:start position:0%
so I'm sure they're being transparent
 
05:05:38.628 --> 05:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
with uh uh with posting their reports um
 
05:05:40.110 --> 05:05:40.120 align:start position:0%
uh I imagine commissioner step would be
 
05:05:41.310 --> 05:05:41.320 align:start position:0%
able to offer you considerably more
 
05:05:43.390 --> 05:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
insight than I could I know that we
 
05:05:45.510 --> 05:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
didn't do that analysis at nfpi we
 
05:05:47.190 --> 05:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have the data based on what's
 
05:05:49.390 --> 05:05:49.400 align:start position:0%
publicly available to be able to do that
 
05:05:51.590 --> 05:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
analysis thank you Phil and Jessica this
 
05:05:54.030 --> 05:05:54.040 align:start position:0%
is very helpful thank you very much and
 
05:05:55.430 --> 05:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
one more thing I do want to mention is
 
05:05:57.070 --> 05:05:57.080 align:start position:0%
that um all of you who are legislators
 
05:05:58.548 --> 05:05:58.558 align:start position:0%
should have had one of these mailed to
 
05:06:00.430 --> 05:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
you I'm hoping that that arrived uh in
 
05:06:03.070 --> 05:06:03.080 align:start position:0%
the last week um it's our resource that
 
05:06:05.150 --> 05:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
really we try to break down data and
 
05:06:07.150 --> 05:06:07.160 align:start position:0%
information about some of the key issues
 
05:06:08.788 --> 05:06:08.798 align:start position:0%
facing the state including housing
 
05:06:10.270 --> 05:06:10.280 align:start position:0%
including education
 
05:06:12.788 --> 05:06:12.798 align:start position:0%
um and explaining the um the state
 
05:06:15.230 --> 05:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
budget process and there's a chapter
 
05:06:17.270 --> 05:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
towards the end about uh it's called
 
05:06:18.750 --> 05:06:18.760 align:start position:0%
funding Public Services about state
 
05:06:20.150 --> 05:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
revenue collections for those of you on
 
05:06:21.350 --> 05:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
the ways and means committees those
 
05:06:23.470 --> 05:06:23.480 align:start position:0%
might be of particular interest so thank
 
05:06:24.948 --> 05:06:24.958 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chairman for that quick
 
05:06:26.030 --> 05:06:26.040 align:start position:0%

05:07:11.230 --> 05:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:25.350 --> 05:07:25.360 align:start position:0%

right

05:07:27.230 --> 05:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:07:36.310 --> 05:07:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:39.510 --> 05:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
here uh Jen just ref refresh my memory
 
05:07:41.150 --> 05:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
we have two handouts but just the color
 
05:07:46.590 --> 05:07:46.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:52.070 --> 05:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
one okay but it's but it's one packet
 
05:07:52.080 --> 05:08:00.470 align:start position:0%
one okay but it's but it's one packet
yeah

05:08:00.470 --> 05:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:00.480 --> 05:08:02.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:08:02.070 --> 05:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:08:27.590 --> 05:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:29.430 --> 05:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
yes um representative only that should
 
05:08:30.948 --> 05:08:30.958 align:start position:0%
be the entire packet the one you have
 
05:08:34.230 --> 05:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
right there but Jen's got a ones um so I
 
05:08:36.150 --> 05:08:36.160 align:start position:0%
I made an elementary school error I
 
05:08:37.750 --> 05:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
didn't initially bring enough copies for
 
05:08:40.750 --> 05:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
everybody so um I had misunderstood and
 
05:08:42.628 --> 05:08:42.638 align:start position:0%
thought they would be printed out backck
 
05:08:44.430 --> 05:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
not that I would bring them so that my
 
05:08:51.590 --> 05:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:54.990 --> 05:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
done all right well that's mine so you
 
05:08:59.190 --> 05:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
can scrumble it on the top there um all
 
05:09:01.230 --> 05:09:01.240 align:start position:0%
right so I'm Drew Klein I'm president of
 
05:09:02.788 --> 05:09:02.798 align:start position:0%
the Josiah barlot Center for Public
 
05:09:04.270 --> 05:09:04.280 align:start position:0%
Policy we're New Hampshire's free market
 
05:09:08.110 --> 05:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
think tank we are like uh nfpi we're a
 
05:09:11.310 --> 05:09:11.320 align:start position:0%
501c3 um private nonpartisan uh
 
05:09:13.350 --> 05:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
independent research
 
05:09:13.360 --> 05:09:15.070 align:start position:0%
independent research
organization

05:09:15.070 --> 05:09:15.080 align:start position:0%
organization
 
05:09:19.590 --> 05:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:23.110 --> 05:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
slides we do all right apologize for the
 
05:09:25.030 --> 05:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
confusion there uh before we get to the
 
05:09:26.788 --> 05:09:26.798 align:start position:0%
slides though since this is really sort
 
05:09:28.470 --> 05:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
of a a look
 
05:09:30.708 --> 05:09:30.718 align:start position:0%
forward um you know we don't make
 
05:09:33.350 --> 05:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
economic projections but I thought it
 
05:09:35.270 --> 05:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
might be sort of valuable to give you
 
05:09:36.830 --> 05:09:36.840 align:start position:0%
guys a little bit of the barlet center's
 
05:09:41.150 --> 05:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
take on looking at the economic um
 
05:09:43.030 --> 05:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
situation going forward in the next
 
05:09:45.070 --> 05:09:45.080 align:start position:0%
couple of years based on National policy
 
05:09:47.150 --> 05:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
considerations and state policy
 
05:09:48.948 --> 05:09:48.958 align:start position:0%
considerations and I want to start with
 
05:09:50.628 --> 05:09:50.638 align:start position:0%
the national and I think you'll actually
 
05:09:53.830 --> 05:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
find a lot of overlap uh with what we
 
05:09:56.230 --> 05:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
view as either good policies or bad
 
05:09:57.590 --> 05:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
policies that might affect New
 
05:09:59.708 --> 05:09:59.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's revenues going forward with
 
05:10:00.948 --> 05:10:00.958 align:start position:0%
some of the other presenters that have
 
05:10:03.190 --> 05:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
presented over the last couple of days
 
05:10:04.670 --> 05:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
um we look at
 
05:10:07.070 --> 05:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
a B basically four things we're keeping
 
05:10:08.830 --> 05:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
our eye on at the federal level when it
 
05:10:10.868 --> 05:10:10.878 align:start position:0%
comes to policy changes this year and
 
05:10:13.030 --> 05:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
I'll quickly go through them just so you
 
05:10:14.830 --> 05:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
know where we're thinking and how you
 
05:10:16.270 --> 05:10:16.280 align:start position:0%
might think about it if you see these
 
05:10:18.830 --> 05:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
policies happen or not happen um and
 
05:10:20.390 --> 05:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
what you might expect for an economic
 
05:10:22.910 --> 05:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
impact the first is tariffs um our
 
05:10:24.868 --> 05:10:24.878 align:start position:0%
position that high tariffs uh would be
 
05:10:26.830 --> 05:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
very bad for New Hampshire uh
 
05:10:29.470 --> 05:10:29.480 align:start position:0%
particularly a 25% tariff on Canadian
 
05:10:31.190 --> 05:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
Imports would be very bad for New
 
05:10:33.590 --> 05:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's economy um not to mention
 
05:10:35.628 --> 05:10:35.638 align:start position:0%
the national economy I mean just not
 
05:10:37.670 --> 05:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
only is Canada New Hampshire's number
 
05:10:40.190 --> 05:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
one trading partner uh and not only do
 
05:10:42.910 --> 05:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
tariffs raise prices for goods and
 
05:10:45.470 --> 05:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
services that are imported um complete
 
05:10:47.030 --> 05:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
they also tend to raise prices for
 
05:10:49.110 --> 05:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
domestic manufacturers as well because
 
05:10:51.070 --> 05:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
domestic manufacturers import a lot of
 
05:10:53.750 --> 05:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
their components that they then assemble
 
05:10:56.310 --> 05:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
in the United States um also something
 
05:10:58.670 --> 05:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
that I think has gone unremarked a lot
 
05:11:01.510 --> 05:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
on the Tariff situation is that the
 
05:11:03.590 --> 05:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
United States still Imports a lot of
 
05:11:06.708 --> 05:11:06.718 align:start position:0%
crude oil and about 60% of the crude oil
 
05:11:10.110 --> 05:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
that we import comes from Canada so
 
05:11:12.310 --> 05:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
Canadian tariffs would would be quite
 
05:11:14.310 --> 05:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
bad uh for the national economy and then
 
05:11:15.990 --> 05:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire's economy that's the
 
05:11:18.670 --> 05:11:18.680 align:start position:0%
first one the second is immigration um
 
05:11:21.350 --> 05:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
our position is that the United States
 
05:11:23.190 --> 05:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
does need to secure its border get rid
 
05:11:25.670 --> 05:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
of the chaos have an orderly legal
 
05:11:27.270 --> 05:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
immigration process all that stuff is
 
05:11:29.510 --> 05:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
true but as you've seen from other
 
05:11:32.230 --> 05:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
presenters New Hampshire um really
 
05:11:35.868 --> 05:11:35.878 align:start position:0%
benefits a lot from immigration into the
 
05:11:38.868 --> 05:11:38.878 align:start position:0%
state from both immigration from um
 
05:11:40.590 --> 05:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
domestic ically from other states but
 
05:11:44.350 --> 05:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
also immigration from foreign sources so
 
05:11:47.750 --> 05:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
anything that would um again we're not
 
05:11:50.470 --> 05:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
in favor of illegal immigration and that
 
05:11:53.910 --> 05:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
has to be taken care of but depending on
 
05:11:56.030 --> 05:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
how constraining and how severe certain
 
05:12:01.270 --> 05:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
policies are um if it results in a
 
05:12:04.788 --> 05:12:04.798 align:start position:0%
uh decreasing flow of people moving to
 
05:12:07.070 --> 05:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire who have the skills want
 
05:12:10.548 --> 05:12:10.558 align:start position:0%
to work and are capable of working um
 
05:12:13.830 --> 05:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
that could impact our economy so third
 
05:12:15.948 --> 05:12:15.958 align:start position:0%
is tax policy you've heard multiple
 
05:12:18.270 --> 05:12:18.280 align:start position:0%
times over the last two days that New
 
05:12:20.310 --> 05:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's business profits tax
 
05:12:23.030 --> 05:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
revenues saw a big spike around the same
 
05:12:25.390 --> 05:12:25.400 align:start position:0%
time that we uh federal government pass
 
05:12:28.590 --> 05:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
the 2017 tax cuts those are up for
 
05:12:31.868 --> 05:12:31.878 align:start position:0%
extension if they are not extended then
 
05:12:33.910 --> 05:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
we would expect to see a pretty negative
 
05:12:35.310 --> 05:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
impact on New Hampshire corporate
 
05:12:37.350 --> 05:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
revenues if they are that would be a
 
05:12:39.510 --> 05:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
good thing and the fourth is energy
 
05:12:40.788 --> 05:12:40.798 align:start position:0%
policy again this doesn't get talked
 
05:12:46.830 --> 05:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
about a lot but um there is a change in
 
05:12:48.310 --> 05:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
I think attitude and Approach at the
 
05:12:49.350 --> 05:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
very least between the current
 
05:12:50.350 --> 05:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
Administration the incoming
 
05:12:51.628 --> 05:12:51.638 align:start position:0%
Administration and the outgoing
 
05:12:54.470 --> 05:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
Administration on energy policy ISO New
 
05:12:56.910 --> 05:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
England has warned for years that New
 
05:13:00.190 --> 05:13:00.200 align:start position:0%
England has a supply constraint problem
 
05:13:04.030 --> 05:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
for fuel we don't have enough capacity
 
05:13:06.270 --> 05:13:06.280 align:start position:0%
um for fuel particularly for natural gas
 
05:13:08.990 --> 05:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
so energy policy at the federal level
 
05:13:12.628 --> 05:13:12.638 align:start position:0%
that that would be less constraining on
 
05:13:14.310 --> 05:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
transport and the construction of
 
05:13:15.990 --> 05:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
Transportation of natural gas would be
 
05:13:17.470 --> 05:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
very beneficial to New Hampshire that's
 
05:13:20.430 --> 05:13:20.440 align:start position:0%
another thing that we're looking at um
 
05:13:22.390 --> 05:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
not to mention State policies someone I
 
05:13:23.990 --> 05:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
think earlier today mentioned the
 
05:13:25.708 --> 05:13:25.718 align:start position:0%
Mid-Atlantic states that block pipelines
 
05:13:27.590 --> 05:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
and stuff if we don't expect that to
 
05:13:29.430 --> 05:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
change but if something were to change
 
05:13:32.310 --> 05:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
and we could get more access to cheaper
 
05:13:34.030 --> 05:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
fuel sources that would be helpful for
 
05:13:35.628 --> 05:13:35.638 align:start position:0%
ANH economy so those are some things
 
05:13:37.270 --> 05:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
outside of our control that we're just
 
05:13:39.788 --> 05:13:39.798 align:start position:0%
keeping an eye on to sort of see whether
 
05:13:42.310 --> 05:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
we can expect some changes in New
 
05:13:45.270 --> 05:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's economy from those um before
 
05:13:47.070 --> 05:13:47.080 align:start position:0%
we get into what we're looking at
 
05:13:49.390 --> 05:13:49.400 align:start position:0%
policy-wise in New Hampshire I want to
 
05:13:50.788 --> 05:13:50.798 align:start position:0%
share with you and this is where our
 
05:13:54.230 --> 05:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
charts begin sort of how we got here so
 
05:13:57.070 --> 05:13:57.080 align:start position:0%
this first chart is not adjusted for
 
05:14:00.070 --> 05:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
inflation I just want to flag that um
 
05:14:02.628 --> 05:14:02.638 align:start position:0%
but business tax revenue in 2015 versus
 
05:14:06.070 --> 05:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
2023 so you can see the raw numbers it's
 
05:14:08.310 --> 05:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
about 124% increase before you adjust
 
05:14:11.230 --> 05:14:11.240 align:start position:0%
for inflation um if you adjusted that
 
05:14:13.830 --> 05:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
2015 number to 2023 prices I think it'd
 
05:14:14.548 --> 05:14:14.558 align:start position:0%
be about
 
05:14:17.230 --> 05:14:17.240 align:start position:0%
$715 million so you can see it it would
 
05:14:18.868 --> 05:14:18.878 align:start position:0%
be smaller but we'd still have a big
 
05:14:21.030 --> 05:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
increase in business profits tax
 
05:14:22.868 --> 05:14:22.878 align:start position:0%
revenues or business tax revenues that's
 
05:14:25.948 --> 05:14:25.958 align:start position:0%
business taxes in general um our next
 
05:14:28.868 --> 05:14:28.878 align:start position:0%
chart shows business tax revenue as a
 
05:14:30.470 --> 05:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
share of the general education trust
 
05:14:34.190 --> 05:14:34.200 align:start position:0%
fund budget in 2015 business tax revenue
 
05:14:38.110 --> 05:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
was 25% of those funds by 2023 it was
 
05:14:38.120 --> 05:14:39.628 align:start position:0%
was 25% of those funds by 2023 it was
39%

05:14:39.628 --> 05:14:39.638 align:start position:0%
39%
 
05:14:41.830 --> 05:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
it's major
 
05:14:44.548 --> 05:14:44.558 align:start position:0%
increase our next
 
05:14:47.270 --> 05:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
chart the blue is business tax revenue
 
05:14:50.590 --> 05:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
by year and the green is general
 
05:14:50.600 --> 05:14:51.830 align:start position:0%
by year and the green is general
education

05:14:51.830 --> 05:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
education
 
05:14:54.548 --> 05:14:54.558 align:start position:0%
spending so you can see where the
 
05:14:58.310 --> 05:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
revenues kind of track spending until
 
05:14:58.320 --> 05:14:59.830 align:start position:0%
revenues kind of track spending until
they

05:14:59.830 --> 05:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:14:59.840 --> 05:15:01.470 align:start position:0%
they
don't

05:15:01.470 --> 05:15:01.480 align:start position:0%
don't
 
05:15:04.270 --> 05:15:04.280 align:start position:0%
um go to the next chart this is
 
05:15:05.510 --> 05:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
something that would you be willing to
 
05:15:06.990 --> 05:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
take questions yeah of course anybody
 
05:15:09.510 --> 05:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
have questions now I'm represent B me
 
05:15:11.830 --> 05:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I was just wondering when
 
05:15:16.390 --> 05:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
you're looking at you're using
 
05:15:20.510 --> 05:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
2015 yeah that was before we finally
 
05:15:22.868 --> 05:15:22.878 align:start position:0%
grew to the same level that the rest of
 
05:15:25.310 --> 05:15:25.320 align:start position:0%
the country grew in
 
05:15:29.868 --> 05:15:29.878 align:start position:0%
2016 on since the after the Great
 
05:15:33.670 --> 05:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
Recession the the amount
 
05:15:33.680 --> 05:15:35.190 align:start position:0%
Recession the the amount
of

05:15:35.190 --> 05:15:35.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:15:39.510 --> 05:15:39.520 align:start position:0%
um Revenue that we had or rather I'm
 
05:15:44.510 --> 05:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
trying to remember I think it was uh GD
 
05:15:48.310 --> 05:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
um State domestic product the amount of
 
05:15:52.510 --> 05:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
State domestic product we had in
 
05:15:55.948 --> 05:15:55.958 align:start position:0%
2016 reached the same level that it was
 
05:15:59.590 --> 05:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
in every other state that gotcha I see
 
05:16:02.390 --> 05:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
growth that they had that the every
 
05:16:04.390 --> 05:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
other state had reached much earlier
 
05:16:07.230 --> 05:16:07.240 align:start position:0%
because our tax system does that sure
 
05:16:08.310 --> 05:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
well I mean we could have started at
 
05:16:11.310 --> 05:16:11.320 align:start position:0%
2016 um it wouldn't change the numbers
 
05:16:14.030 --> 05:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
that much we did 2015 just to show what
 
05:16:16.150 --> 05:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
it was fairly substantially I don't
 
05:16:17.990 --> 05:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
think it would change it that much uh
 
05:16:19.708 --> 05:16:19.718 align:start position:0%
the growth wouldn't I mean we could do
 
05:16:22.150 --> 05:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
that if we could update them it wouldn't
 
05:16:23.708 --> 05:16:23.718 align:start position:0%
be much for me to go back and change the
 
05:16:25.310 --> 05:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
start year to 2016 the reason we did
 
05:16:27.670 --> 05:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
2015 was just to take a look at starting
 
05:16:30.070 --> 05:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
right before the um business tax cuts
 
05:16:32.430 --> 05:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
took effect so Ian that was the reason
 
05:16:35.070 --> 05:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
to get that number in there well they
 
05:16:37.990 --> 05:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
actually took well yes they took effect
 
05:16:39.430 --> 05:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
for the
 
05:16:41.190 --> 05:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
businesses in
 
05:16:44.350 --> 05:16:44.360 align:start position:0%
2016 but in 2017 is when we saw the
 
05:16:46.270 --> 05:16:46.280 align:start position:0%
money right so we wanted to go back
 
05:16:47.830 --> 05:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
before that and just sort of see what it
 
05:16:47.840 --> 05:16:49.590 align:start position:0%
before that and just sort of see what it
looked

05:16:49.590 --> 05:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
looked
 
05:16:51.830 --> 05:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
like but again we can change the start
 
05:16:54.670 --> 05:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
year it would change the growth a little
 
05:16:58.868 --> 05:16:58.878 align:start position:0%
bit but probably not that much it was a
 
05:17:03.390 --> 05:17:03.400 align:start position:0%
fair bump between 14 and
 
05:17:06.110 --> 05:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
15 I'm in 15 representative
 
05:17:08.868 --> 05:17:08.878 align:start position:0%
WS thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
05:17:12.150 --> 05:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question sure uh am I
 
05:17:14.510 --> 05:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
understanding this that in this very
 
05:17:17.990 --> 05:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
first chart here that uh as New
 
05:17:20.030 --> 05:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has cut their uh business
 
05:17:22.510 --> 05:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
taxes and taxes in general that we've
 
05:17:25.030 --> 05:17:25.040 align:start position:0%
actually grown the revenue uh by quite a
 
05:17:28.230 --> 05:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
lot yes and and that'sjust adjusted for
 
05:17:29.750 --> 05:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
inflation this is not adjusted for
 
05:17:31.110 --> 05:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
inflation as I said in the beginning but
 
05:17:33.548 --> 05:17:33.558 align:start position:0%
if you did it would still be um and I
 
05:17:35.310 --> 05:17:35.320 align:start position:0%
didn't make that adjustment so I could
 
05:17:38.110 --> 05:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
go back and do that but if you did I'd
 
05:17:39.868 --> 05:17:39.878 align:start position:0%
be somewhere in that just under $500
 
05:17:41.628 --> 05:17:41.638 align:start position:0%
million range would be what you would
 
05:17:43.510 --> 05:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
have left over after the inflation
 
05:17:44.670 --> 05:17:44.680 align:start position:0%
adjustment so would still be a
 
05:17:46.548 --> 05:17:46.558 align:start position:0%
substantial increase in Revenue yes I
 
05:17:49.030 --> 05:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
did catch that thank you very
 
05:17:54.910 --> 05:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
much yes represent El me thank you on
 
05:17:58.270 --> 05:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
inflation and a incredible amount of
 
05:17:58.280 --> 05:17:59.470 align:start position:0%
inflation and a incredible amount of
federal

05:17:59.470 --> 05:17:59.480 align:start position:0%
federal
 
05:18:02.190 --> 05:18:02.200 align:start position:0%
subsidy no ma'am these are these are St
 
05:18:04.270 --> 05:18:04.280 align:start position:0%
tax cuts and job these are State
 
05:18:06.910 --> 05:18:06.920 align:start position:0%
business tax revenues not not federal
 
05:18:10.590 --> 05:18:10.600 align:start position:0%
subsidies no but they they went into our
 
05:18:13.708 --> 05:18:13.718 align:start position:0%
businesses and were productively used oh
 
05:18:18.310 --> 05:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:21.708 --> 05:18:21.718 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions on
 
05:18:28.030 --> 05:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
that okay um so the next one
 
05:18:31.230 --> 05:18:31.240 align:start position:0%
is I think it's a mistake um generally
 
05:18:32.990 --> 05:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
to talk about revenues without talking
 
05:18:35.310 --> 05:18:35.320 align:start position:0%
about spending um you've heard a ton
 
05:18:37.470 --> 05:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
about revenues over the last couple of
 
05:18:39.350 --> 05:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
days but not a lot of spending
 
05:18:39.360 --> 05:18:40.670 align:start position:0%
days but not a lot of spending
information

05:18:40.670 --> 05:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:18:44.110 --> 05:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
so we tracked again 2015 to
 
05:18:46.910 --> 05:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
2023 the increase in revenues and
 
05:18:48.868 --> 05:18:48.878 align:start position:0%
spending and you can see total state
 
05:18:50.868 --> 05:18:50.878 align:start position:0%
revenue in the in the blue line spending
 
05:18:53.868 --> 05:18:53.878 align:start position:0%
in the red line they track really really
 
05:18:56.430 --> 05:18:56.440 align:start position:0%
closely if you just do a straight line
 
05:18:58.548 --> 05:18:58.558 align:start position:0%
um inflation is the orange
 
05:19:00.948 --> 05:19:00.958 align:start position:0%
line and then the green just for context
 
05:19:03.390 --> 05:19:03.400 align:start position:0%
is the business tax revenue so that
 
05:19:05.190 --> 05:19:05.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't that we even out the year to
 
05:19:06.590 --> 05:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
year fluctuation just doing the two
 
05:19:08.150 --> 05:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
points so you can see that the growth
 
05:19:09.670 --> 05:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
rate there
 
05:19:11.830 --> 05:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
um now the next
 
05:19:14.110 --> 05:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
chart so I think the big takeaway from
 
05:19:17.590 --> 05:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
this chart is spending and revenue grew
 
05:19:20.110 --> 05:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
a lot higher than the inflation rate
 
05:19:23.270 --> 05:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
did so if you go to the next
 
05:19:25.868 --> 05:19:25.878 align:start position:0%
chart this is spending versus revenue
 
05:19:27.830 --> 05:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
and I like this one because I I want you
 
05:19:30.470 --> 05:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
to pay attention to the diamonds in here
 
05:19:32.230 --> 05:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
so what we see in New Hampshire is
 
05:19:34.030 --> 05:19:34.040 align:start position:0%
pretty typical for a lot of
 
05:19:38.310 --> 05:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
states the spending um the revenue will
 
05:19:40.708 --> 05:19:40.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:42.670 --> 05:19:42.680 align:start position:0%
it's as you've heard and you guys all
 
05:19:43.750 --> 05:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
know the ones who've been around like
 
05:19:46.470 --> 05:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
it's not a constant thing revenues
 
05:19:49.230 --> 05:19:49.240 align:start position:0%
fluctuate um so it'll go up it'll come
 
05:19:51.590 --> 05:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
down it'll go up but when it goes up
 
05:19:55.270 --> 05:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
spending goes up to match it so this
 
05:19:59.190 --> 05:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
is what we see if you if you look every
 
05:20:01.628 --> 05:20:01.638 align:start position:0%
annually and you look at the budgets
 
05:20:03.510 --> 05:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
spending is adjusted upward to match
 
05:20:06.510 --> 05:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
revenues constantly and so that's just
 
05:20:08.708 --> 05:20:08.718 align:start position:0%
the reality that that we live in and B
 
05:20:10.270 --> 05:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
Center we look at both sides of the coin
 
05:20:12.708 --> 05:20:12.718 align:start position:0%
spending and revenues it's not just one
 
05:20:16.708 --> 05:20:16.718 align:start position:0%
side so you can see here the 2022 to
 
05:20:19.350 --> 05:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
2023 um and we're still waiting for the
 
05:20:21.628 --> 05:20:21.638 align:start position:0%
state audited 24 numbers that's why
 
05:20:24.310 --> 05:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
they're on in you can see this Spike of
 
05:20:27.628 --> 05:20:27.638 align:start position:0%
spending surpassing revenues here and
 
05:20:29.990 --> 05:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's how we got to the situation we're
 
05:20:31.948 --> 05:20:31.958 align:start position:0%
in right
 
05:20:35.670 --> 05:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
now yep question question yes
 
05:20:37.910 --> 05:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
representative ORS thank you Mr chair
 
05:20:41.830 --> 05:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
and thank you G um so just backing up to
 
05:20:44.190 --> 05:20:44.200 align:start position:0%
the business taxes where uh it was the
 
05:20:47.750 --> 05:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
second chart yeah as a share so yes
 
05:20:50.350 --> 05:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
share of the uh General and education
 
05:20:53.070 --> 05:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
trust fund Revenue right so am I
 
05:20:54.628 --> 05:20:54.638 align:start position:0%
understanding this right that even
 
05:20:57.030 --> 05:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
though we've cut taxes we've increased
 
05:21:01.548 --> 05:21:01.558 align:start position:0%
the funding from 25% to
 
05:21:05.670 --> 05:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
39% for Education no so as general if
 
05:21:07.510 --> 05:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
you take general education trust fund
 
05:21:09.470 --> 05:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
Revenue entirely
 
05:21:11.350 --> 05:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
businesses now pay a much larger share
 
05:21:14.390 --> 05:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
than they did in 2015 they pay 39% of
 
05:21:18.230 --> 05:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
that pool of money now so so they
 
05:21:19.628 --> 05:21:19.638 align:start position:0%
shoulder a much larger share of that
 
05:21:22.190 --> 05:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
Revenue than they used to
 
05:21:24.948 --> 05:21:24.958 align:start position:0%
followup oh okay thank you so okay I got
 
05:21:27.990 --> 05:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
that so we've increased the revenue for
 
05:21:30.948 --> 05:21:30.958 align:start position:0%
that revenue's gone up correct yes and
 
05:21:35.590 --> 05:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh in the in the previous slide to that
 
05:21:38.670 --> 05:21:38.680 align:start position:0%
it looks like our spending on education
 
05:21:41.628 --> 05:21:41.638 align:start position:0%
in general cost go along with this last
 
05:21:44.190 --> 05:21:44.200 align:start position:0%
chart that we're exceeding our Revenue
 
05:21:48.150 --> 05:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
continuously uh Revenue put it this way
 
05:21:51.030 --> 05:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
spending always adjusts upward to match
 
05:21:53.230 --> 05:21:53.240 align:start position:0%
Revenue that's how I put when you just
 
05:21:56.230 --> 05:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
look at the way it works in this one
 
05:21:59.150 --> 05:21:59.160 align:start position:0%
here that's the pattern you have the
 
05:22:01.628 --> 05:22:01.638 align:start position:0%
revenue go up it kind of levels off but
 
05:22:03.350 --> 05:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
the spending goes up to match the
 
05:22:06.310 --> 05:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
revenue every time Revenue Rises so how
 
05:22:09.390 --> 05:22:09.400 align:start position:0%
do we break the cycle spend less
 
05:22:09.400 --> 05:22:10.510 align:start position:0%
do we break the cycle spend less
thank

05:22:10.510 --> 05:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:22:13.948 --> 05:22:13.958 align:start position:0%
you I mean you can't um you know New
 
05:22:15.750 --> 05:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not have you have to have
 
05:22:18.150 --> 05:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
a balanced budget in New Hampshire but
 
05:22:20.510 --> 05:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
um A legislature cannot bind a future
 
05:22:22.590 --> 05:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
legislature so you can't pass a law to
 
05:22:24.948 --> 05:22:24.958 align:start position:0%
say well the future legislature can only
 
05:22:27.350 --> 05:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
spend at the rate of population growth
 
05:22:29.910 --> 05:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
and in and inflation like that would be
 
05:22:31.750 --> 05:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
a general way to do it but you guys
 
05:22:33.628 --> 05:22:33.638 align:start position:0%
can't do that unless you were to pass a
 
05:22:33.638 --> 05:22:36.948 align:start position:0%
can't do that unless you were to pass a
constitutional

05:22:36.948 --> 05:22:36.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:39.990 --> 05:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
amendment representa elberger thank you
 
05:22:42.270 --> 05:22:42.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yes uh I'm just wondering
 
05:22:44.110 --> 05:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
whether you see this state spending
 
05:22:47.190 --> 05:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
versus Revenue
 
05:22:51.430 --> 05:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh uh behavior on the state part is any
 
05:22:53.548 --> 05:22:53.558 align:start position:0%
different from what most people do in
 
05:22:55.030 --> 05:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
terms of their
 
05:22:57.470 --> 05:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
income typically when people earn more
 
05:23:03.190 --> 05:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:06.750 --> 05:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
you um representative Ford did you have
 
05:23:08.470 --> 05:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
a question your light is your speak
 
05:23:10.788 --> 05:23:10.798 align:start position:0%
speak is on
 
05:23:13.910 --> 05:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
oh represent
 
05:23:16.590 --> 05:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
Aly how do you decide whether the
 
05:23:18.990 --> 05:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
spending went up first or the revenue
 
05:23:21.150 --> 05:23:21.160 align:start position:0%
went up first well the spending can't
 
05:23:22.548 --> 05:23:22.558 align:start position:0%
when did all of this
 
05:23:25.430 --> 05:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
start that's a great question actually
 
05:23:25.440 --> 05:23:26.310 align:start position:0%
start that's a great question actually
um

05:23:26.310 --> 05:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:29.708 --> 05:23:29.718 align:start position:0%
so this is just how the process works
 
05:23:33.190 --> 05:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
right so you guys on this committee are
 
05:23:34.948 --> 05:23:34.958 align:start position:0%
in charge of the revenue and if you go
 
05:23:36.548 --> 05:23:36.558 align:start position:0%
back through the years like the the
 
05:23:38.750 --> 05:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
budget is written starting with the
 
05:23:40.150 --> 05:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
governor and then the house and then the
 
05:23:43.030 --> 05:23:43.040 align:start position:0%
Senate based on the revenues so just in
 
05:23:44.670 --> 05:23:44.680 align:start position:0%
terms of the legislative process and how
 
05:23:46.750 --> 05:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
it works the revenues come in you see
 
05:23:48.310 --> 05:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
what you have and then you base your
 
05:23:50.110 --> 05:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
spending on the revenues that are here
 
05:23:52.590 --> 05:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
plus projections in the future so that's
 
05:23:54.590 --> 05:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
how it works so in that just the way the
 
05:23:57.628 --> 05:23:57.638 align:start position:0%
process works the revenue comes first in
 
05:23:59.990 --> 05:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire typically that's how it
 
05:24:04.788 --> 05:24:04.798 align:start position:0%
works follow up yes but the part of it
 
05:24:07.948 --> 05:24:07.958 align:start position:0%
that is most extreme is when we were
 
05:24:13.670 --> 05:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
using Revenue that came from the
 
05:24:17.990 --> 05:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic uh from the uh arpa and its
 
05:24:21.510 --> 05:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
successors on we had a great deal of
 
05:24:24.030 --> 05:24:24.040 align:start position:0%
money pumped into our economy that was
 
05:24:28.548 --> 05:24:28.558 align:start position:0%
not from us it was from the
 
05:24:32.990 --> 05:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
feds and that increased I presume that's
 
05:24:36.150 --> 05:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
in the our spending numbers so um these
 
05:24:37.990 --> 05:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
are just general and education trust
 
05:24:40.030 --> 05:24:40.040 align:start position:0%
funds number so they do not include any
 
05:24:41.868 --> 05:24:41.878 align:start position:0%
federal grants any arpa money or any of
 
05:24:44.590 --> 05:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
that this is just State money from State
 
05:24:44.600 --> 05:24:46.868 align:start position:0%
that this is just State money from State
revenues

05:24:46.868 --> 05:24:46.878 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
05:24:51.830 --> 05:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
okay okay we can continue okay um let's
 
05:24:53.590 --> 05:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
go on to the next slide
 
05:24:56.750 --> 05:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
so this will start our discussion of uh
 
05:24:58.670 --> 05:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
so that that sort of gets where we are
 
05:25:00.190 --> 05:25:00.200 align:start position:0%
now how we got to where we are now
 
05:25:01.350 --> 05:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
there's a spending side there's a
 
05:25:03.750 --> 05:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
revenue side so as legislators you have
 
05:25:05.470 --> 05:25:05.480 align:start position:0%
to look at
 
05:25:08.628 --> 05:25:08.638 align:start position:0%
both so we look at um for the B Center's
 
05:25:12.230 --> 05:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
point of view we do look at um policies
 
05:25:14.990 --> 05:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that might improve the
 
05:25:18.190 --> 05:25:18.200 align:start position:0%
economy improve revenues um so I'll
 
05:25:19.788 --> 05:25:19.798 align:start position:0%
start with some of the policies that
 
05:25:24.990 --> 05:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:27.230 --> 05:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this year some of the stuff
 
05:25:29.708 --> 05:25:29.718 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about that might have
 
05:25:33.310 --> 05:25:33.320 align:start position:0%
an impact on the economy and on
 
05:25:36.830 --> 05:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
revenues so first which I won't get into
 
05:25:37.990 --> 05:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
too many details because you guys have
 
05:25:39.430 --> 05:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
heard this a lot in the last couple days
 
05:25:42.510 --> 05:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
is housing this is a chart that I made
 
05:25:43.708 --> 05:25:43.718 align:start position:0%
um going back to
 
05:25:46.310 --> 05:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
1994 at the time I made this this is
 
05:25:48.590 --> 05:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
that's the only data I had but
 
05:25:51.788 --> 05:25:51.798 align:start position:0%
I we have others um going back
 
05:25:55.030 --> 05:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
farther this is census data for building
 
05:25:56.590 --> 05:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
permits the state has its own building
 
05:25:58.150 --> 05:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
permit data which is slightly different
 
05:25:59.270 --> 05:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
because the state has access to
 
05:26:01.470 --> 05:26:01.480 align:start position:0%
different numbers than the census does
 
05:26:04.510 --> 05:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
but um I checked with them to see if
 
05:26:05.868 --> 05:26:05.878 align:start position:0%
it's okay to use this and they said yeah
 
05:26:07.548 --> 05:26:07.558 align:start position:0%
it tracks pretty much with ours in terms
 
05:26:08.750 --> 05:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:26:10.708 --> 05:26:10.718 align:start position:0%
pattern over time and what you'll see is
 
05:26:11.948 --> 05:26:11.958 align:start position:0%
if you go back to
 
05:26:14.270 --> 05:26:14.280 align:start position:0%
1994 the green line is single family
 
05:26:16.390 --> 05:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
residential building permits the blue
 
05:26:18.190 --> 05:26:18.200 align:start position:0%
line is multif family residential
 
05:26:19.948 --> 05:26:19.958 align:start position:0%
building permits and you can
 
05:26:21.990 --> 05:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
see they sometimes track with the
 
05:26:24.510 --> 05:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
economy right um but you can look at
 
05:26:27.548 --> 05:26:27.558 align:start position:0%
where we are now the end of
 
05:26:31.030 --> 05:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
23 now again this doesn't include 2024
 
05:26:32.708 --> 05:26:32.718 align:start position:0%
um because the state the publish data is
 
05:26:36.390 --> 05:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
only through 23 now um we're not
 
05:26:39.350 --> 05:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
building anywhere near what we we were
 
05:26:41.030 --> 05:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
20 years
 
05:26:44.150 --> 05:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
ago but it's worse than that so I
 
05:26:45.750 --> 05:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
haven't had time to do that I'm going to
 
05:26:47.430 --> 05:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
expand this chart at some point back to
 
05:26:50.070 --> 05:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
the late 1960s but that just takes a lot
 
05:26:51.548 --> 05:26:51.558 align:start position:0%
of time to do the data entry but I got
 
05:26:51.558 --> 05:26:52.390 align:start position:0%
of time to do the data entry but I got
the

05:26:52.390 --> 05:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:26:54.990 --> 05:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
data and just to give you an example of
 
05:26:57.670 --> 05:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
how out of whack our housing uh
 
05:27:00.310 --> 05:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
construction is in New Hampshire in
 
05:27:04.750 --> 05:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
1973 so we go back 50 years from from
 
05:27:04.760 --> 05:27:06.390 align:start position:0%
1973 so we go back 50 years from from
2023

05:27:06.390 --> 05:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
2023
 
05:27:09.270 --> 05:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire's popular was according
 
05:27:12.270 --> 05:27:12.280 align:start position:0%
to the census 791 th000 in that year
 
05:27:15.310 --> 05:27:15.320 align:start position:0%
developers received building permits for
 
05:27:17.590 --> 05:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
4554 single family
 
05:27:20.030 --> 05:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
homes and
 
05:27:22.270 --> 05:27:22.280 align:start position:0%
3,179 multif family
 
05:27:24.030 --> 05:27:24.040 align:start position:0%
units in
 
05:27:27.310 --> 05:27:27.320 align:start position:0%
2023 New Hampshire's population was 1.4
 
05:27:27.320 --> 05:27:28.948 align:start position:0%
2023 New Hampshire's population was 1.4
billion

05:27:28.948 --> 05:27:28.958 align:start position:0%
billion
 
05:27:33.430 --> 05:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
so yeah million sorry um big increase
 
05:27:38.230 --> 05:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
like a 56% increase um
 
05:27:41.548 --> 05:27:41.558 align:start position:0%
that's 1.4 billion people no I'm
 
05:27:45.708 --> 05:27:45.718 align:start position:0%
kidding um typos are
 
05:27:47.868 --> 05:27:47.878 align:start position:0%
terrible uh so that your developers
 
05:27:51.110 --> 05:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
receive building permits for
 
05:27:53.590 --> 05:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
2,996 single family housing units and,
 
05:27:56.750 --> 05:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
1500 multif family units so in other
 
05:27:59.470 --> 05:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
words in 50
 
05:28:02.750 --> 05:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
years with about 56% of our current
 
05:28:04.708 --> 05:28:04.718 align:start position:0%
population 50 years ago they were
 
05:28:07.830 --> 05:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
building about half about 50% more
 
05:28:09.310 --> 05:28:09.320 align:start position:0%
single SLE family homes and more than
 
05:28:11.110 --> 05:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
double as many multif family units as
 
05:28:12.270 --> 05:28:12.280 align:start position:0%
we're building
 
05:28:16.868 --> 05:28:16.878 align:start position:0%
now and 1973 was the beginning of the
 
05:28:18.990 --> 05:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
end of 73 was the beginning of the oil
 
05:28:22.070 --> 05:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
embargo uh recession so um if you look
 
05:28:25.868 --> 05:28:25.878 align:start position:0%
at 1974 which was full in the recession
 
05:28:28.270 --> 05:28:28.280 align:start position:0%
um they were still building more than we
 
05:28:31.830 --> 05:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
were building in 22 so that's how far
 
05:28:34.350 --> 05:28:34.360 align:start position:0%
behind we are at permitting new
 
05:28:36.590 --> 05:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
residential units and Josiah Barlett
 
05:28:38.390 --> 05:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
Center I'm sure some of you familiar
 
05:28:41.190 --> 05:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
with us we did a study in 2021 trying to
 
05:28:43.628 --> 05:28:43.638 align:start position:0%
determine why New Hampshire was building
 
05:28:47.910 --> 05:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
so many fewer um uh residential units
 
05:28:50.548 --> 05:28:50.558 align:start position:0%
and um our inescapable conclusion was it
 
05:28:53.548 --> 05:28:53.558 align:start position:0%
was local housing regulations so I won't
 
05:28:55.190 --> 05:28:55.200 align:start position:0%
get into all that you guys know pretty
 
05:28:57.990 --> 05:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
much that by this point but um the
 
05:29:00.390 --> 05:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
takeaway for us is
 
05:29:02.670 --> 05:29:02.680 align:start position:0%
that these regulations there are some
 
05:29:04.190 --> 05:29:04.200 align:start position:0%
regulations at the state level too that
 
05:29:06.510 --> 05:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
are getting in the way um Governor A's
 
05:29:08.070 --> 05:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
right to point out that we have some
 
05:29:09.948 --> 05:29:09.958 align:start position:0%
ecomic and environmental regulations
 
05:29:11.110 --> 05:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
that are getting in the way and making
 
05:29:13.470 --> 05:29:13.480 align:start position:0%
it more difficult but um a lot of it's
 
05:29:14.910 --> 05:29:14.920 align:start position:0%
at the local level New Hampshire is an
 
05:29:17.510 --> 05:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
outlier and the rest of the nation uh we
 
05:29:20.590 --> 05:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
are much much much more restrictive on
 
05:29:22.548 --> 05:29:22.558 align:start position:0%
residential construction than most
 
05:29:25.830 --> 05:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
States and the United States is much
 
05:29:27.670 --> 05:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
more restrictive than the rest of the
 
05:29:30.230 --> 05:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
world um for these which makes New
 
05:29:31.868 --> 05:29:31.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire one of the most restrictive
 
05:29:34.868 --> 05:29:34.878 align:start position:0%
places in the world for home building
 
05:29:36.030 --> 05:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
and we're supposed to be the Live Free
 
05:29:39.110 --> 05:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
or Die State the result of this is that
 
05:29:41.110 --> 05:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
we don't actually have a market a
 
05:29:43.670 --> 05:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
functioning um Residential Building
 
05:29:45.628 --> 05:29:45.638 align:start position:0%
Market it's constrained by government
 
05:29:47.510 --> 05:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
imp poos constraints so our position is
 
05:29:48.830 --> 05:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
we need to remove some of those
 
05:29:51.390 --> 05:29:51.400 align:start position:0%
constraints roll them back um to create
 
05:29:53.430 --> 05:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
a functioning market and that would if
 
05:29:55.110 --> 05:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
we can succeed in doing some of that
 
05:29:57.310 --> 05:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
this year that would have a a good
 
05:30:00.750 --> 05:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:06.628 --> 05:30:06.638 align:start position:0%
economy so is there a question represent
 
05:30:08.830 --> 05:30:08.840 align:start position:0%
elmy sure
 
05:30:11.070 --> 05:30:11.080 align:start position:0%
uh I just wanted
 
05:30:15.590 --> 05:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
to um I don't think that the residential
 
05:30:18.590 --> 05:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
permits are ever corrected for the ones
 
05:30:20.030 --> 05:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
that were not
 
05:30:24.310 --> 05:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
used and um about I
 
05:30:28.230 --> 05:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
forget about six years ago now we had
 
05:30:31.310 --> 05:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
2,000 residential permits in
 
05:30:36.350 --> 05:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
Lebanon and um uh units not permits
 
05:30:41.670 --> 05:30:41.680 align:start position:0%
units permitted sure uh and two years
 
05:30:44.110 --> 05:30:44.120 align:start position:0%
two years later there was 1,000 being
 
05:30:44.120 --> 05:30:45.868 align:start position:0%
two years later there was 1,000 being
built

05:30:45.868 --> 05:30:45.878 align:start position:0%
built
 
05:30:48.510 --> 05:30:48.520 align:start position:0%
right well I mean that would I think
 
05:30:50.548 --> 05:30:50.558 align:start position:0%
sort of underscore our point that you
 
05:30:52.390 --> 05:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
know even the ones so we have a problem
 
05:30:53.788 --> 05:30:53.798 align:start position:0%
with getting the permits in the first
 
05:30:56.310 --> 05:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
place and even when you get a permit
 
05:30:57.708 --> 05:30:57.718 align:start position:0%
some Builders don't go through with it
 
05:30:58.990 --> 05:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
because they can't get the financing or
 
05:31:01.030 --> 05:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
they run into other problems so the
 
05:31:02.510 --> 05:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
numbers for homes that are actually be
 
05:31:04.708 --> 05:31:04.718 align:start position:0%
built or even smaller than the permits
 
05:31:08.110 --> 05:31:08.120 align:start position:0%
which is even more alarming
 
05:31:12.230 --> 05:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
but uh yeah follow up I would like to
 
05:31:15.350 --> 05:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
just caution you that some of those
 
05:31:15.360 --> 05:31:17.070 align:start position:0%
just caution you that some of those
environmental

05:31:17.070 --> 05:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
environmental
 
05:31:20.030 --> 05:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
requirements uh we have a lot of land
 
05:31:21.830 --> 05:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
that gets
 
05:31:27.270 --> 05:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
severely uh flooded in Lebanon and we've
 
05:31:30.948 --> 05:31:30.958 align:start position:0%
had the Conservation Commission bought a
 
05:31:34.948 --> 05:31:34.958 align:start position:0%
large portion of one one Hill because
 
05:31:38.350 --> 05:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
developers kept on proposing things for
 
05:31:42.788 --> 05:31:42.798 align:start position:0%
it and we'd already lost a lowincome
 
05:31:45.708 --> 05:31:45.718 align:start position:0%
home uh section that was built at the
 
05:31:48.708 --> 05:31:48.718 align:start position:0%
bottom of it because of the amount the
 
05:31:51.708 --> 05:31:51.718 align:start position:0%
slope and the water and there is a
 
05:31:53.868 --> 05:31:53.878 align:start position:0%
reason for some of these I I don't
 
05:31:55.310 --> 05:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
disagree there's a there's a perfectly
 
05:31:56.310 --> 05:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
valid reason for a lot of these
 
05:31:57.948 --> 05:31:57.958 align:start position:0%
regulations and that's not really I'm
 
05:31:59.590 --> 05:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
not questioning that I'm saying that
 
05:32:01.350 --> 05:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
some of them are so restrictive that it
 
05:32:02.788 --> 05:32:02.798 align:start position:0%
really raises the cost and so it's
 
05:32:04.910 --> 05:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
something for the state to look
 
05:32:07.590 --> 05:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
at and certainly if we're based on what
 
05:32:08.708 --> 05:32:08.718 align:start position:0%
you said said if we're one of the more
 
05:32:10.390 --> 05:32:10.400 align:start position:0%
restrictive in the country we need to
 
05:32:11.750 --> 05:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
look at what are what are the
 
05:32:13.670 --> 05:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
differences what are those restrictions
 
05:32:16.548 --> 05:32:16.558 align:start position:0%
yeah um representative Stringham and
 
05:32:18.230 --> 05:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
then yeah I have I have a question about
 
05:32:21.270 --> 05:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
how you look at uh local property taxes
 
05:32:23.910 --> 05:32:23.920 align:start position:0%
I mean our tax burden property tax
 
05:32:26.628 --> 05:32:26.638 align:start position:0%
burden is about 60% of all taxes that we
 
05:32:29.230 --> 05:32:29.240 align:start position:0%
raise right in the state from all
 
05:32:32.830 --> 05:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
sources and uh that's very unique from
 
05:32:36.070 --> 05:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
any state in the country and generally
 
05:32:37.510 --> 05:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know I think the economist
 
05:32:38.948 --> 05:32:38.958 align:start position:0%
perspective persective is when you tax
 
05:32:40.868 --> 05:32:40.878 align:start position:0%
something you get less of it and we
 
05:32:44.510 --> 05:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
generally tax property in this state uh
 
05:32:46.548 --> 05:32:46.558 align:start position:0%
uniquely to any others and I wonder how
 
05:32:48.830 --> 05:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
that flows through your models and your
 
05:32:51.510 --> 05:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
thinking uh for
 
05:32:54.590 --> 05:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
um takeaways for us yeah so I didn't
 
05:32:56.548 --> 05:32:56.558 align:start position:0%
include property tax stuff in our
 
05:33:00.070 --> 05:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:02.708 --> 05:33:02.718 align:start position:0%
um if you if you were to break down the
 
05:33:05.670 --> 05:33:05.680 align:start position:0%
resources or the type sources of income
 
05:33:07.990 --> 05:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
right that government gets
 
05:33:10.510 --> 05:33:10.520 align:start position:0%
um one of the ways that we look at it is
 
05:33:12.548 --> 05:33:12.558 align:start position:0%
what sources of income what types of
 
05:33:17.070 --> 05:33:17.080 align:start position:0%
Taxation are um less harmful to economic
 
05:33:20.430 --> 05:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
growth um nobody likes paying property
 
05:33:22.948 --> 05:33:22.958 align:start position:0%
taxes I don't like paying property taxes
 
05:33:25.830 --> 05:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
um they are high in New Hampshire partly
 
05:33:28.868 --> 05:33:28.878 align:start position:0%
because um our studies
 
05:33:32.150 --> 05:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
on uh education funding for example show
 
05:33:34.470 --> 05:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
we went through 20 years worth of data
 
05:33:36.910 --> 05:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
on local education spending and State
 
05:33:38.230 --> 05:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
education spending and we found that
 
05:33:40.590 --> 05:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
people will just voters spend more on
 
05:33:42.788 --> 05:33:42.798 align:start position:0%
their Public Schools regardless of
 
05:33:44.948 --> 05:33:44.958 align:start position:0%
enrollment or regardless of anything
 
05:33:46.150 --> 05:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
else they just keep pushing those
 
05:33:47.830 --> 05:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
budgets up and that's driving part of
 
05:33:54.708 --> 05:33:54.718 align:start position:0%
the tax um uh increase but on the
 
05:33:57.430 --> 05:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
whole business taxes are quite harmful
 
05:34:00.548 --> 05:34:00.558 align:start position:0%
to economic growth property taxes are
 
05:34:03.430 --> 05:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
not so when you're looking at just
 
05:34:04.548 --> 05:34:04.558 align:start position:0%
looking at growth which is not the only
 
05:34:06.030 --> 05:34:06.040 align:start position:0%
thing to look at but just kind of one of
 
05:34:08.350 --> 05:34:08.360 align:start position:0%
the ways that we look at things um if
 
05:34:11.230 --> 05:34:11.240 align:start position:0%
you're going to have fund government
 
05:34:13.230 --> 05:34:13.240 align:start position:0%
through some form of Taxation property
 
05:34:15.788 --> 05:34:15.798 align:start position:0%
taxation is highly stable predictable
 
05:34:17.230 --> 05:34:17.240 align:start position:0%
from year to year business taxation is
 
05:34:19.390 --> 05:34:19.400 align:start position:0%
not as you've heard before um and it's
 
05:34:21.670 --> 05:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
highly harmful to economic growth and
 
05:34:21.680 --> 05:34:22.948 align:start position:0%
highly harmful to economic growth and
Innovation

05:34:22.948 --> 05:34:22.958 align:start position:0%
Innovation
 
05:34:25.750 --> 05:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
so you people make trade-offs New
 
05:34:27.708 --> 05:34:27.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has made the trade-off to Bas
 
05:34:28.910 --> 05:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of its government and property
 
05:34:31.350 --> 05:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
taxes that has tended to work out for us
 
05:34:34.470 --> 05:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of um economic growth so but
 
05:34:36.190 --> 05:34:36.200 align:start position:0%
that's one of the trade-offs that that
 
05:34:40.948 --> 05:34:40.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:40.958 --> 05:34:44.510 align:start position:0%
 
wer

05:34:44.510 --> 05:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:47.190 --> 05:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
thank thank you Mr chair I want to make
 
05:34:48.788 --> 05:34:48.798 align:start position:0%
a comment about you're talking about the
 
05:34:51.230 --> 05:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
growth in the 70s I was involved in that
 
05:34:54.230 --> 05:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
I moved up to New Hampshire in 70 the
 
05:34:57.590 --> 05:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
highways were really being built Big
 
05:34:59.190 --> 05:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
Highway building thing so all of a
 
05:35:02.230 --> 05:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
sudden Massachusetts was an easy commute
 
05:35:05.070 --> 05:35:05.080 align:start position:0%
right and I remember being involved for
 
05:35:07.390 --> 05:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
for decades with the town planning board
 
05:35:09.150 --> 05:35:09.160 align:start position:0%
and and just the number of people that
 
05:35:11.670 --> 05:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
realize wow I can get I can get to my
 
05:35:14.190 --> 05:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
job in Boston in an hour and I can live
 
05:35:15.750 --> 05:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and it's nicer I got
 
05:35:18.190 --> 05:35:18.200 align:start position:0%
more room and I got lower costs and so
 
05:35:20.628 --> 05:35:20.638 align:start position:0%
on so so there was a flood of people
 
05:35:22.788 --> 05:35:22.798 align:start position:0%
during that period and the development
 
05:35:26.110 --> 05:35:26.120 align:start position:0%
in this in the towns was abused so we
 
05:35:28.350 --> 05:35:28.360 align:start position:0%
began to clamp down clamp down clamp
 
05:35:30.830 --> 05:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
down through the 70s and 80s to make it
 
05:35:32.708 --> 05:35:32.718 align:start position:0%
more restricted because of abuses that
 
05:35:34.390 --> 05:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
happened during that period And I
 
05:35:36.230 --> 05:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
remember CU I experienced it all so
 
05:35:37.708 --> 05:35:37.718 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons we had this
 
05:35:40.070 --> 05:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
huge growth and then it narrowed down
 
05:35:42.150 --> 05:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
because people were getting tired of the
 
05:35:43.990 --> 05:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
abuses thank you well I I would say
 
05:35:46.150 --> 05:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what our study of um
 
05:35:49.750 --> 05:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
housing restrictions found um
 
05:35:52.430 --> 05:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
the local regulations that severely
 
05:35:54.868 --> 05:35:54.878 align:start position:0%
restricted housing growth came often in
 
05:35:57.788 --> 05:35:57.798 align:start position:0%
the 70s and 80s in response to
 
05:36:00.670 --> 05:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
population growth so I that's I I won't
 
05:36:02.110 --> 05:36:02.120 align:start position:0%
say whether those were abuses or not I
 
05:36:04.230 --> 05:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't here then but that's how the
 
05:36:05.670 --> 05:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
that's how we got where we are in terms
 
05:36:07.868 --> 05:36:07.878 align:start position:0%
of regulations
 
05:36:10.110 --> 05:36:10.120 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
05:36:17.708 --> 05:36:17.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:19.990 --> 05:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
rung thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:36:21.030 --> 05:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
05:36:24.230 --> 05:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
question um half of New Hampshire
 
05:36:27.750 --> 05:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
residences are on private well water and
 
05:36:30.788 --> 05:36:30.798 align:start position:0%
I think because local regulations for
 
05:36:33.510 --> 05:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
properties homes that are on well water
 
05:36:35.830 --> 05:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
have a septic tend to be very
 
05:36:38.310 --> 05:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
restrictive on lot size do you think
 
05:36:40.830 --> 05:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
that if there and I know in the 70s I
 
05:36:42.590 --> 05:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
think there was a lot of federal money
 
05:36:45.070 --> 05:36:45.080 align:start position:0%
maybe excuse me State money that went
 
05:36:48.070 --> 05:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
into help municipalities build
 
05:36:50.510 --> 05:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure either Municipal Water
 
05:36:53.070 --> 05:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
Systems wastewater treatment systems do
 
05:36:56.670 --> 05:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
you think if that was reinstituted that
 
05:36:58.670 --> 05:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
support for communities to have that
 
05:37:01.548 --> 05:37:01.558 align:start position:0%
type of infrastructure it would um allow
 
05:37:03.110 --> 05:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
more housing to be
 
05:37:06.030 --> 05:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
built possibly I think what we found in
 
05:37:08.670 --> 05:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
our study is that um
 
05:37:10.788 --> 05:37:10.798 align:start position:0%
the housing restrictions typically are
 
05:37:14.708 --> 05:37:14.718 align:start position:0%
response to population growth so the
 
05:37:17.030 --> 05:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
um that's why communities want to
 
05:37:19.150 --> 05:37:19.160 align:start position:0%
restrict is they just want to restrict
 
05:37:20.270 --> 05:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
the number of new people who move into
 
05:37:22.470 --> 05:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
their communities uh so they will use
 
05:37:25.310 --> 05:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
and things like that as a justification
 
05:37:26.590 --> 05:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
for passing the
 
05:37:29.548 --> 05:37:29.558 align:start position:0%
restrictions um but I'm not sure if
 
05:37:32.628 --> 05:37:32.638 align:start position:0%
you funded more sewer for example if the
 
05:37:34.230 --> 05:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
state created a pool of money to fund
 
05:37:35.150 --> 05:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
more sewer
 
05:37:37.868 --> 05:37:37.878 align:start position:0%
construction maybe on the margins not
 
05:37:39.230 --> 05:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
convinced that would actually stimulate
 
05:37:41.310 --> 05:37:41.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of lot size restrictions they
 
05:37:43.510 --> 05:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
exist for the purpose of um keeping
 
05:37:46.470 --> 05:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
population down and uh but you know
 
05:37:48.230 --> 05:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
there's a one way to get around
 
05:37:50.470 --> 05:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
something like that is some of the
 
05:37:51.910 --> 05:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
formulas that these communities might
 
05:37:54.230 --> 05:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
use um might be out of date now so for
 
05:37:56.510 --> 05:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
example I think there's a bill in the
 
05:37:59.030 --> 05:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
house to do soil based zoning so it
 
05:38:02.350 --> 05:38:02.360 align:start position:0%
would basically instead of having a
 
05:38:03.868 --> 05:38:03.878 align:start position:0%
something written into the ordinance
 
05:38:06.190 --> 05:38:06.200 align:start position:0%
that says well you can't build uh if you
 
05:38:07.670 --> 05:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
have septics you can't build on a a lot
 
05:38:09.470 --> 05:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
smaller than 2 Acres you would simply
 
05:38:12.750 --> 05:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
have an ordinance that says um you can
 
05:38:14.510 --> 05:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
your lot size has to be comminate with
 
05:38:16.868 --> 05:38:16.878 align:start position:0%
what your septic system
 
05:38:20.030 --> 05:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
can accommodate because we have new
 
05:38:22.708 --> 05:38:22.718 align:start position:0%
higher Tech septic systems that are able
 
05:38:25.190 --> 05:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
to be put on smaller Lots so that's one
 
05:38:27.990 --> 05:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
way to do it okay thank you yeah
 
05:38:30.470 --> 05:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
represent Malloy thank you Mr chair
 
05:38:33.430 --> 05:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr kle for taking my question
 
05:38:36.030 --> 05:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
I want to uh I missed the numbers that
 
05:38:38.708 --> 05:38:38.718 align:start position:0%
you quoted from from housing
 
05:38:42.030 --> 05:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
permits 70 in the 70s to the population
 
05:38:43.868 --> 05:38:43.878 align:start position:0%
yeah could you go through that again
 
05:38:46.350 --> 05:38:46.360 align:start position:0%
yeah just I just picked 1973 because our
 
05:38:48.948 --> 05:38:48.958 align:start position:0%
numbers here stopped at 2023 so I
 
05:38:51.548 --> 05:38:51.558 align:start position:0%
thought it would be a good look back um
 
05:38:53.030 --> 05:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's population according to
 
05:38:57.190 --> 05:38:57.200 align:start position:0%
the census in 1973 was 791 th000 that
 
05:38:59.350 --> 05:38:59.360 align:start position:0%
year developers received build building
 
05:39:00.548 --> 05:39:00.558 align:start position:0%
permits for
 
05:39:04.230 --> 05:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
4554 single family housing units and
 
05:39:08.708 --> 05:39:08.718 align:start position:0%
3,179 multif family units
 
05:39:12.868 --> 05:39:12.878 align:start position:0%
and then the 2023 numbers um so 1.4
 
05:39:15.430 --> 05:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
million people developers receive
 
05:39:17.788 --> 05:39:17.798 align:start position:0%
building permits for
 
05:39:21.468 --> 05:39:21.478 align:start position:0%
2,996 single family housing units and
 
05:39:24.468 --> 05:39:24.478 align:start position:0%
1,516 multif family units thank you
 
05:39:24.478 --> 05:39:26.948 align:start position:0%
1,516 multif family units thank you
you're

05:39:26.948 --> 05:39:26.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:30.468 --> 05:39:30.478 align:start position:0%
welcome yes represented
 
05:39:33.670 --> 05:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
opal uh thank you Mr chairman and and
 
05:39:35.590 --> 05:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Klein I appreciate you're
 
05:39:38.110 --> 05:39:38.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question I I I just want to
 
05:39:41.190 --> 05:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
make sure I I heard you correctly yeah
 
05:39:45.110 --> 05:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
um I I believe as I looked at your your
 
05:39:47.910 --> 05:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
slides you're saying that uh business
 
05:39:51.548 --> 05:39:51.558 align:start position:0%
taxes or revenue from business taxes has
 
05:39:54.070 --> 05:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
increased substantially in state of New
 
05:39:57.270 --> 05:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and you also I believe said
 
05:40:00.150 --> 05:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
that that business taxes are more
 
05:40:02.628 --> 05:40:02.638 align:start position:0%
harmful to economic growth than say
 
05:40:04.868 --> 05:40:04.878 align:start position:0%
property taxes correct I there are some
 
05:40:06.190 --> 05:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
people in my community who might
 
05:40:10.788 --> 05:40:10.798 align:start position:0%
disagree with you but yeah I bet and I I
 
05:40:12.628 --> 05:40:12.638 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm trying to do is reconcile
 
05:40:15.110 --> 05:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
that with the fact that at least based
 
05:40:18.030 --> 05:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
on what I've heard in the last two days
 
05:40:19.628 --> 05:40:19.638 align:start position:0%
uh the Hampshire's economy has
 
05:40:22.350 --> 05:40:22.360 align:start position:0%
apparently strong and has
 
05:40:25.270 --> 05:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
outperformed not only the region but in
 
05:40:28.868 --> 05:40:28.878 align:start position:0%
many cases the country um with with the
 
05:40:31.868 --> 05:40:31.878 align:start position:0%
I think the lowest unemployment rate uh
 
05:40:34.990 --> 05:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
in in the region so I I see where you're
 
05:40:36.910 --> 05:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
going with that and and um yeah just
 
05:40:37.910 --> 05:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
could you
 
05:40:39.708 --> 05:40:39.718 align:start position:0%
yeah sure so I've got some I I address
 
05:40:41.468 --> 05:40:41.478 align:start position:0%
that a little bit in some slides further
 
05:40:43.590 --> 05:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
down um but business taxation is not
 
05:40:44.910 --> 05:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
obviously the only factor in your
 
05:40:47.868 --> 05:40:47.878 align:start position:0%
economy so um it's one factor in
 
05:40:50.830 --> 05:40:50.840 align:start position:0%
economic growth it's not the only Factor
 
05:40:53.110 --> 05:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
so we have pretty high business taxation
 
05:40:57.030 --> 05:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
as a state um compared to other states
 
05:40:59.510 --> 05:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
we've gone down in the last couple years
 
05:41:02.830 --> 05:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
obviously but when you look at other
 
05:41:05.270 --> 05:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
factors aside taxation so taxation is
 
05:41:07.310 --> 05:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
one and this is another thing that b
 
05:41:09.868 --> 05:41:09.878 align:start position:0%
Center tries to look at right so Live
 
05:41:11.990 --> 05:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
Free or Die doesn't just mean low taxes
 
05:41:14.548 --> 05:41:14.558 align:start position:0%
or die right so taxes are just one part
 
05:41:16.708 --> 05:41:16.718 align:start position:0%
of what government does it's just one
 
05:41:19.430 --> 05:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
cost among many costs um for businesses
 
05:41:23.390 --> 05:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
for individuals so it's one factor so
 
05:41:24.948 --> 05:41:24.958 align:start position:0%
all things being equal you want your
 
05:41:27.948 --> 05:41:27.958 align:start position:0%
business tax rates to be low enough to
 
05:41:27.958 --> 05:41:28.830 align:start position:0%
business tax rates to be low enough to
be

05:41:28.830 --> 05:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:41:32.430 --> 05:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
competitive um but you also want your
 
05:41:34.510 --> 05:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
government spending to be low so
 
05:41:36.708 --> 05:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
government spending also imposes a
 
05:41:40.708 --> 05:41:40.718 align:start position:0%
burden on the economy and there's quite
 
05:41:43.868 --> 05:41:43.878 align:start position:0%
a lot of research on developed countries
 
05:41:45.510 --> 05:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
and government spending and I'm going to
 
05:41:47.150 --> 05:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
get to some charts on this in just a
 
05:41:50.030 --> 05:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
second um but just to preempt some of
 
05:41:52.110 --> 05:41:52.120 align:start position:0%
the questions we're we are not
 
05:41:53.628 --> 05:41:53.638 align:start position:0%
advocating getting rid of government
 
05:41:55.110 --> 05:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
just want to make that very clear
 
05:41:56.548 --> 05:41:56.558 align:start position:0%
government does a lot of essential
 
05:41:59.070 --> 05:41:59.080 align:start position:0%
things um but when in the developed
 
05:42:01.350 --> 05:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
world when it comes to um economic
 
05:42:03.468 --> 05:42:03.478 align:start position:0%
growth there a lot of studies that we've
 
05:42:04.590 --> 05:42:04.600 align:start position:0%
looked at including from the
 
05:42:06.310 --> 05:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
international monetary fund and the
 
05:42:08.190 --> 05:42:08.200 align:start position:0%
organization Organization for economic
 
05:42:09.510 --> 05:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
cooperation and development that have
 
05:42:11.468 --> 05:42:11.478 align:start position:0%
looked at countries around the world and
 
05:42:15.030 --> 05:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
found um what you call an upside down U
 
05:42:18.590 --> 05:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
so once um when you start basic
 
05:42:20.548 --> 05:42:20.558 align:start position:0%
government provision of services that is
 
05:42:23.270 --> 05:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
a boom to the economy right if you have
 
05:42:25.190 --> 05:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
transportation networks if you have
 
05:42:27.430 --> 05:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
communication networks if you have basic
 
05:42:29.390 --> 05:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
government services courts that kind of
 
05:42:31.230 --> 05:42:31.240 align:start position:0%
thing policing you're going to see an
 
05:42:32.868 --> 05:42:32.878 align:start position:0%
increase in your economic growth if you
 
05:42:35.350 --> 05:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
don't have those things before right but
 
05:42:37.310 --> 05:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
you get to a point where there you start
 
05:42:38.708 --> 05:42:38.718 align:start position:0%
to have diminishing returns and that's
 
05:42:41.350 --> 05:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
the upside down curve of the U and then
 
05:42:43.670 --> 05:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
if you keep growing government beyond
 
05:42:46.468 --> 05:42:46.478 align:start position:0%
that again all things are being equal
 
05:42:49.270 --> 05:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
you start to generally speaking see um
 
05:42:51.230 --> 05:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
harm to the economic growth of that so
 
05:42:52.948 --> 05:42:52.958 align:start position:0%
that's kind of where we are but I can
 
05:42:54.548 --> 05:42:54.558 align:start position:0%
get to some of that in in a minute all
 
05:42:56.110 --> 05:42:56.120 align:start position:0%
right let's take one more question and
 
05:42:58.948 --> 05:42:58.958 align:start position:0%
then we'll move on representative Aly
 
05:43:01.750 --> 05:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:43:07.310 --> 05:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
um what we have got is the lowest
 
05:43:07.320 --> 05:43:08.430 align:start position:0%
um what we have got is the lowest
government

05:43:08.430 --> 05:43:08.440 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:43:12.510 --> 05:43:12.520 align:start position:0%
spending per something in the country as
 
05:43:15.750 --> 05:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
far as I can tell certainly uh because
 
05:43:20.310 --> 05:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
we have so much of our taxation is in
 
05:43:20.320 --> 05:43:22.628 align:start position:0%
we have so much of our taxation is in
property

05:43:22.628 --> 05:43:22.638 align:start position:0%
property
 
05:43:22.638 --> 05:43:25.430 align:start position:0%
property
tax

05:43:25.430 --> 05:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
tax
 
05:43:28.708 --> 05:43:28.718 align:start position:0%
there government can't had there are
 
05:43:30.708 --> 05:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
things that government is extremely
 
05:43:34.110 --> 05:43:34.120 align:start position:0%
efficient at and having all these small
 
05:43:38.628 --> 05:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
towns have to do it themselves is not
 
05:43:41.910 --> 05:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
efficient and I am pretty sure that we
 
05:43:45.830 --> 05:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
have long since passed that stage we're
 
05:43:48.830 --> 05:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
not in that U we're in a different you
 
05:43:53.750 --> 05:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
going down the other way that that we've
 
05:43:56.590 --> 05:43:56.600 align:start position:0%
got a lot of small towns that because
 
05:43:59.590 --> 05:43:59.600 align:start position:0%
they no longer get services
 
05:44:03.310 --> 05:44:03.320 align:start position:0%
from the state government are having to
 
05:44:06.510 --> 05:44:06.520 align:start position:0%
pay for it and figure out how to do it
 
05:44:09.548 --> 05:44:09.558 align:start position:0%
themselves M and some of them are better
 
05:44:13.350 --> 05:44:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:15.390 --> 05:44:15.400 align:start position:0%
others all right I'm going to go to to
 
05:44:17.110 --> 05:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
the uh next
 
05:44:20.110 --> 05:44:20.120 align:start position:0%
slide um and this gets to the size of
 
05:44:21.750 --> 05:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
government uh so the Frasier Institute
 
05:44:23.110 --> 05:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
which you guys are familiar with from
 
05:44:24.590 --> 05:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
Taylor caswell's presentation but I'll
 
05:44:26.110 --> 05:44:26.120 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about their bigger
 
05:44:28.628 --> 05:44:28.638 align:start position:0%
report in a minute they just released a
 
05:44:29.670 --> 05:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
report which I thought was really
 
05:44:32.548 --> 05:44:32.558 align:start position:0%
interesting this month um they looked at
 
05:44:35.230 --> 05:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
New England states and the northeastern
 
05:44:37.468 --> 05:44:37.478 align:start position:0%
uh provinces of Canada and and looked at
 
05:44:39.948 --> 05:44:39.958 align:start position:0%
the size of government and that is
 
05:44:42.150 --> 05:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
government expenditures total
 
05:44:43.590 --> 05:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
expenditures for government as a
 
05:44:46.350 --> 05:44:46.360 align:start position:0%
percentage of GDP for these states and
 
05:44:48.510 --> 05:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
provinces and I think what you'll notice
 
05:44:51.230 --> 05:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
here and represent me you are correct
 
05:44:54.548 --> 05:44:54.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um is at the bottom of the
 
05:45:00.990 --> 05:45:01.000 align:start position:0%
list here uh 30% in 2021 so again to go
 
05:45:02.548 --> 05:45:02.558 align:start position:0%
back to some economic studies that we've
 
05:45:04.310 --> 05:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
looked at on that upside down you there
 
05:45:07.628 --> 05:45:07.638 align:start position:0%
are different percentages some say 20% %
 
05:45:09.468 --> 05:45:09.478 align:start position:0%
of GDP is where you start to see
 
05:45:11.150 --> 05:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
diminishing returns and then negative
 
05:45:13.788 --> 05:45:13.798 align:start position:0%
impact some say 30% so New Hampshire at
 
05:45:17.868 --> 05:45:17.878 align:start position:0%
around 30% is right there at the point
 
05:45:19.788 --> 05:45:19.798 align:start position:0%
where further growth of government
 
05:45:22.548 --> 05:45:22.558 align:start position:0%
spending is probably going to start to
 
05:45:24.310 --> 05:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
be a bit of a drag it's probably You
 
05:45:26.070 --> 05:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
could argue that it is currently a drag
 
05:45:28.788 --> 05:45:28.798 align:start position:0%
on the economy but um this next one I
 
05:45:31.910 --> 05:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
just did just to show just went back to
 
05:45:34.990 --> 05:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
2000 to 2023 just to get a a sense you
 
05:45:36.430 --> 05:45:36.440 align:start position:0%
can start these in different places I
 
05:45:38.150 --> 05:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
thought 20 was just a nice place to
 
05:45:40.910 --> 05:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
start to look at the century um this is
 
05:45:43.110 --> 05:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
New England GDP
 
05:45:45.750 --> 05:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
growth um adjusted for
 
05:45:47.910 --> 05:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
inflation so you can see Massachusetts
 
05:45:50.590 --> 05:45:50.600 align:start position:0%
up there 61% very good their econom is
 
05:45:52.310 --> 05:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh Strong and booming uh New Hampshire
 
05:45:55.990 --> 05:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
54% second in the region um I thought it
 
05:45:57.310 --> 05:45:57.320 align:start position:0%
was important to point out that Maine
 
05:45:59.548 --> 05:45:59.558 align:start position:0%
and Vermont are our two Neighbors in
 
05:46:01.548 --> 05:46:01.558 align:start position:0%
Northern New England are at 42% so we do
 
05:46:03.990 --> 05:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
significantly better than Main and
 
05:46:06.110 --> 05:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
Vermont at economic growth Rhode Island
 
05:46:08.230 --> 05:46:08.240 align:start position:0%
and Connecticut
 
05:46:11.430 --> 05:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
not doing so well so I want to get to
 
05:46:15.628 --> 05:46:15.638 align:start position:0%
the Frasier Institute report on
 
05:46:19.310 --> 05:46:19.320 align:start position:0%
um economic freedom which
 
05:46:21.750 --> 05:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
is what Taylor Caswell mentioned
 
05:46:23.628 --> 05:46:23.638 align:start position:0%
yesterday about one one of the few
 
05:46:27.270 --> 05:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
reports that New Hampshire question
 
05:46:30.190 --> 05:46:30.200 align:start position:0%
representative Mr chair May
 
05:46:33.548 --> 05:46:33.558 align:start position:0%
yes one of the questions that uh came up
 
05:46:37.430 --> 05:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
for me after unfortunately uh Taylor
 
05:46:39.708 --> 05:46:39.718 align:start position:0%
caswell's presentation was can you
 
05:46:42.230 --> 05:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
please define economic freedom because
 
05:46:44.350 --> 05:46:44.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely I don't have a clu absolutely
 
05:46:47.670 --> 05:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll be happy to do that
 
05:46:52.190 --> 05:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
um so the Fraser Institute uh has been
 
05:46:54.230 --> 05:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
doing this study for 20 years they've
 
05:46:57.390 --> 05:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
looked at 26 years worth of data initial
 
05:46:58.708 --> 05:46:58.718 align:start position:0%
study they looked back a couple more
 
05:47:01.510 --> 05:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
years New Hampshire's been ranked first
 
05:47:03.030 --> 05:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
in economic freedom in all of North
 
05:47:07.350 --> 05:47:07.360 align:start position:0%
America 23 out of those 20 six years
 
05:47:11.230 --> 05:47:11.240 align:start position:0%
that they've studied so economic freedom
 
05:47:13.548 --> 05:47:13.558 align:start position:0%
uh one way to think about it is economic
 
05:47:16.468 --> 05:47:16.478 align:start position:0%
autonomy it's how many economic
 
05:47:18.830 --> 05:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
decisions do you as an individual get to
 
05:47:20.830 --> 05:47:20.840 align:start position:0%
control versus how many of those
 
05:47:23.270 --> 05:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
decisions are controlled by the state or
 
05:47:26.468 --> 05:47:26.478 align:start position:0%
somebody else you know some entity of
 
05:47:28.708 --> 05:47:28.718 align:start position:0%
government the way the Fraser Institute
 
05:47:31.590 --> 05:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
measures this is government spending
 
05:47:32.990 --> 05:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
it's three it's three portions
 
05:47:34.468 --> 05:47:34.478 align:start position:0%
government level of government spending
 
05:47:36.190 --> 05:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
and we saw the 30% there in New
 
05:47:39.070 --> 05:47:39.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is how how they measure it
 
05:47:41.708 --> 05:47:41.718 align:start position:0%
Taxation and then labor market Freedom
 
05:47:44.548 --> 05:47:44.558 align:start position:0%
so it's regulations on your ability to
 
05:47:46.670 --> 05:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
enter and participate in the labor
 
05:47:48.830 --> 05:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
market and they break those down into
 
05:47:51.030 --> 05:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
multiple other you can their report is
 
05:47:52.830 --> 05:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
on our website jet.org if you want to
 
05:47:55.030 --> 05:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
get down in much more detail but those
 
05:47:58.110 --> 05:47:58.120 align:start position:0%
are the three metrics um New Hampshire
 
05:48:00.948 --> 05:48:00.958 align:start position:0%
consistently ranks first or second and
 
05:48:03.230 --> 05:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
those depending on Idaho or Florida and
 
05:48:06.390 --> 05:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
whether they have some tax cut or uh
 
05:48:08.788 --> 05:48:08.798 align:start position:0%
regular cut but most of the time New
 
05:48:10.670 --> 05:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire ranks number one in those and
 
05:48:12.150 --> 05:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
a big part of the reason New Hampshire
 
05:48:14.868 --> 05:48:14.878 align:start position:0%
ranks consistently number one is our
 
05:48:17.468 --> 05:48:17.478 align:start position:0%
relatively low level of government
 
05:48:20.230 --> 05:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
spending so that that plays a a very big
 
05:48:22.270 --> 05:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
factor in New Hampshire being up there
 
05:48:24.270 --> 05:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
all we have a pretty high level of
 
05:48:27.468 --> 05:48:27.478 align:start position:0%
regulations on our economy surprisingly
 
05:48:29.030 --> 05:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
um but our government spending and our
 
05:48:32.990 --> 05:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
taxation pretty much keeps us at the top
 
05:48:35.670 --> 05:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
so that's how they look at it and so
 
05:48:37.468 --> 05:48:37.478 align:start position:0%
when I say that the BART Center looks at
 
05:48:39.590 --> 05:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
economic freedom and we look at policies
 
05:48:41.750 --> 05:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
that promote freedom and provote open
 
05:48:45.310 --> 05:48:45.320 align:start position:0%
markets and a a market is a mechanism
 
05:48:47.030 --> 05:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
where you make economic transactions
 
05:48:49.190 --> 05:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
based on buyers and sellers coming to an
 
05:48:51.708 --> 05:48:51.718 align:start position:0%
agreement on stuff government absolutely
 
05:48:54.350 --> 05:48:54.360 align:start position:0%
has a role to play and enforcing
 
05:48:56.628 --> 05:48:56.638 align:start position:0%
contracts and creating the regulatory
 
05:48:59.190 --> 05:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
boundaries of Market but the more free
 
05:49:00.390 --> 05:49:00.400 align:start position:0%
that market can
 
05:49:02.868 --> 05:49:02.878 align:start position:0%
be the more mutually beneficial it is
 
05:49:04.750 --> 05:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
and the more economic growth you get and
 
05:49:06.910 --> 05:49:06.920 align:start position:0%
everything else follows from economic
 
05:49:09.830 --> 05:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
growth right we find that economic
 
05:49:12.070 --> 05:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
growth uh the the higher economic growth
 
05:49:14.510 --> 05:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to have higher incomes
 
05:49:16.708 --> 05:49:16.718 align:start position:0%
you're going to have higher uh levels of
 
05:49:18.390 --> 05:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
well-being across the board lower levels
 
05:49:20.390 --> 05:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
of poverty and we see this in New
 
05:49:21.830 --> 05:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I mean New Hampshire has the
 
05:49:23.190 --> 05:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
lowest poverty rate in the country and
 
05:49:26.030 --> 05:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
it has for a very long time and just a
 
05:49:29.190 --> 05:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
way to sort of contextualize this what
 
05:49:30.830 --> 05:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
I'm always amazed at is that we have a
 
05:49:32.708 --> 05:49:32.718 align:start position:0%
lower poverty rate than
 
05:49:35.030 --> 05:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
Utah which is very culturally
 
05:49:35.040 --> 05:49:37.948 align:start position:0%
Utah which is very culturally
conservative

05:49:37.948 --> 05:49:37.958 align:start position:0%
conservative
 
05:49:40.270 --> 05:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
it's amazing to me that New Hampshire
 
05:49:43.350 --> 05:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
consistently beats Utah in poverty rate
 
05:49:46.868 --> 05:49:46.878 align:start position:0%
um part of it is that we are um a very
 
05:49:48.990 --> 05:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
economically free state so I just pulled
 
05:49:50.670 --> 05:49:50.680 align:start position:0%
some charts from the economic freedom in
 
05:49:52.590 --> 05:49:52.600 align:start position:0%
North America report which we partner
 
05:49:54.510 --> 05:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
with the Frasier Institute on in terms
 
05:49:56.350 --> 05:49:56.360 align:start position:0%
of publicizing and they do the report we
 
05:49:58.270 --> 05:49:58.280 align:start position:0%
don't do the report but we're partners
 
05:50:02.468 --> 05:50:02.478 align:start position:0%
of them um in talking about it and
 
05:50:05.948 --> 05:50:05.958 align:start position:0%
getting coverage for it so this is one
 
05:50:08.350 --> 05:50:08.360 align:start position:0%
of the chart they have all government
 
05:50:10.868 --> 05:50:10.878 align:start position:0%
economic freedom so this is through all
 
05:50:13.270 --> 05:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
of um North America Canada Mexico and
 
05:50:13.280 --> 05:50:15.110 align:start position:0%
of um North America Canada Mexico and
the

05:50:15.110 --> 05:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:50:18.350 --> 05:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
US income growth so you can see the
 
05:50:21.230 --> 05:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
least economically fre States from 2013
 
05:50:25.190 --> 05:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
to 2022 negative 13% economic growth the
 
05:50:28.590 --> 05:50:28.600 align:start position:0%
third quartile 7% the second 19% the
 
05:50:31.070 --> 05:50:31.080 align:start position:0%
most economically free states had 29%
 
05:50:31.080 --> 05:50:32.990 align:start position:0%
most economically free states had 29%
economic

05:50:32.990 --> 05:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
economic
 
05:50:35.110 --> 05:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
growth it's an indication of how
 
05:50:37.590 --> 05:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
important it is to be to have economic
 
05:50:40.990 --> 05:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
freedom This Is Us only taking out
 
05:50:43.430 --> 05:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
Canada and Mexico economic freedom and
 
05:50:45.510 --> 05:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
change in population so the least
 
05:50:48.350 --> 05:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
economically free states lost
 
05:50:51.350 --> 05:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
population you can see the giant
 
05:50:54.190 --> 05:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
increase from negative
 
05:50:57.708 --> 05:50:57.718 align:start position:0%
.8% to 8.3% in the most economically
 
05:50:57.718 --> 05:51:00.868 align:start position:0%
.8% to 8.3% in the most economically
free

05:51:00.868 --> 05:51:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:03.670 --> 05:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
states again this is United
 
05:51:05.708 --> 05:51:05.718 align:start position:0%
States this is change in total
 
05:51:05.718 --> 05:51:07.350 align:start position:0%
States this is change in total
employment

05:51:07.350 --> 05:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
employment
 
05:51:10.230 --> 05:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
least economically free states 4% to the
 
05:51:12.350 --> 05:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
most economically fre free states three
 
05:51:13.990 --> 05:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
times that
 
05:51:16.910 --> 05:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
12% and we can see some of the effects
 
05:51:20.230 --> 05:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
of this um this last chart is the Bureau
 
05:51:21.350 --> 05:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
of Labor
 
05:51:23.430 --> 05:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
Statistics this is changing non-farm
 
05:51:25.548 --> 05:51:25.558 align:start position:0%
payrolls since January of 2020 so we're
 
05:51:27.990 --> 05:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
looking back at the pandemic and you can
 
05:51:29.030 --> 05:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
see New
 
05:51:31.230 --> 05:51:31.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 3%
 
05:51:33.788 --> 05:51:33.798 align:start position:0%
increase Massachusetts negative Vermont
 
05:51:36.830 --> 05:51:36.840 align:start position:0%
negative Maine pretty good 2.8 but we do
 
05:51:39.390 --> 05:51:39.400 align:start position:0%
better than the rest of New England
 
05:51:43.230 --> 05:51:43.240 align:start position:0%
there so that's a a one of the effects
 
05:51:46.270 --> 05:51:46.280 align:start position:0%
of having an overall high score on
 
05:51:48.350 --> 05:51:48.360 align:start position:0%
economic freedom as you get this kind of
 
05:51:50.590 --> 05:51:50.600 align:start position:0%
uh result so that's one of the reasons
 
05:51:52.390 --> 05:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
why when we look at policies we're
 
05:51:54.750 --> 05:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
looking at policies that create markets
 
05:51:57.788 --> 05:51:57.798 align:start position:0%
and create more freedom more choices for
 
05:52:00.110 --> 05:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
people because the results tend to be
 
05:52:04.270 --> 05:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
quite good across the board y uh yes
 
05:52:06.910 --> 05:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
representative uh Shamburg followed by
 
05:52:08.948 --> 05:52:08.958 align:start position:0%
alberger thank you Mr chair and thank
 
05:52:12.430 --> 05:52:12.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr Klein sir uh I it's a two-part
 
05:52:14.990 --> 05:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
question here uh the Josiah Bartlett
 
05:52:17.430 --> 05:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
Center on January 10th stated and you've
 
05:52:20.190 --> 05:52:20.200 align:start position:0%
covered these here the most pressing
 
05:52:22.468 --> 05:52:22.478 align:start position:0%
public policy priorities are housing
 
05:52:25.468 --> 05:52:25.478 align:start position:0%
shortage which you've covered very well
 
05:52:27.350 --> 05:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
uh number two is the absence of a
 
05:52:30.468 --> 05:52:30.478 align:start position:0%
functioning Market in K through 12
 
05:52:33.910 --> 05:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
education and state spending exceeding
 
05:52:35.910 --> 05:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
projected state revenue so my first
 
05:52:37.270 --> 05:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
question is
 
05:52:40.510 --> 05:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
Y what is the absence what's the meaning
 
05:52:43.270 --> 05:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
of the absence of functioning Market in
 
05:52:46.548 --> 05:52:46.558 align:start position:0%
K through 12 education is it data driven
 
05:52:49.708 --> 05:52:49.718 align:start position:0%
or is it Theory well it's both um
 
05:52:51.788 --> 05:52:51.798 align:start position:0%
so if you think of the way we do K
 
05:52:54.468 --> 05:52:54.478 align:start position:0%
through2 education now um versus the way
 
05:52:56.750 --> 05:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
we do higher education so if you go to
 
05:52:59.070 --> 05:52:59.080 align:start position:0%
college you even if you get a pel grant
 
05:53:00.310 --> 05:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
so you're getting government assistance
 
05:53:02.310 --> 05:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
you can purchase uh an education
 
05:53:04.990 --> 05:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the country that you want to
 
05:53:07.190 --> 05:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
um that's not the case and K through 12
 
05:53:09.150 --> 05:53:09.160 align:start position:0%
so we have a we have a market in higher
 
05:53:11.110 --> 05:53:11.120 align:start position:0%
education because um it's
 
05:53:12.990 --> 05:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
consumer-driven consumers can choose
 
05:53:14.910 --> 05:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
where to go how much they want to spend
 
05:53:16.510 --> 05:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
they can go to cheaper colleges better
 
05:53:18.548 --> 05:53:18.558 align:start position:0%
whatever um and they can even take
 
05:53:21.070 --> 05:53:21.080 align:start position:0%
government money to do that we don't
 
05:53:22.788 --> 05:53:22.798 align:start position:0%
have that in K through 12 so K through2
 
05:53:24.150 --> 05:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire you're assigned to a
 
05:53:26.430 --> 05:53:26.440 align:start position:0%
public school if you want to go to a
 
05:53:29.390 --> 05:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
different school um and can't afford it
 
05:53:31.110 --> 05:53:31.120 align:start position:0%
well you're stuck if you if there's not
 
05:53:32.430 --> 05:53:32.440 align:start position:0%
a charter school near you maybe there's
 
05:53:33.548 --> 05:53:33.558 align:start position:0%
a public charter school which would be
 
05:53:37.628 --> 05:53:37.638 align:start position:0%
great um we see uh studies in the last
 
05:53:39.868 --> 05:53:39.878 align:start position:0%
couple years from um academic
 
05:53:42.670 --> 05:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
institutions and even one from uh which
 
05:53:43.628 --> 05:53:43.638 align:start position:0%
came out this fall which I would
 
05:53:45.510 --> 05:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
encourage everybody to go to from uh the
 
05:53:46.990 --> 05:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
progressive policy Institute which is
 
05:53:48.150 --> 05:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
not a free market they're they're
 
05:53:49.708 --> 05:53:49.718 align:start position:0%
Progressive Think Tank they don't like
 
05:53:52.510 --> 05:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
education savings accounts um so they're
 
05:53:54.628 --> 05:53:54.638 align:start position:0%
against those but they so but they do
 
05:53:55.750 --> 05:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
like charter schools and they did a
 
05:53:58.110 --> 05:53:58.120 align:start position:0%
study of charter schools and the
 
05:54:00.708 --> 05:54:00.718 align:start position:0%
penetration into a local District of um
 
05:54:02.670 --> 05:54:02.680 align:start position:0%
charter schools so they found that once
 
05:54:06.350 --> 05:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
a charter school enrollment in a in any
 
05:54:09.390 --> 05:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
Public School District reaches about 30%
 
05:54:12.150 --> 05:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
you see a dramatic increase in test
 
05:54:14.190 --> 05:54:14.200 align:start position:0%
score performance in the kids in the
 
05:54:16.628 --> 05:54:16.638 align:start position:0%
district public
 
05:54:19.190 --> 05:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
school so when we say a functioning
 
05:54:21.670 --> 05:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
Market in K through2 education what we
 
05:54:24.708 --> 05:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
mean is consumers parents can choose
 
05:54:26.468 --> 05:54:26.478 align:start position:0%
which school to go to whether that's
 
05:54:28.868 --> 05:54:28.878 align:start position:0%
through efas preferably um which are
 
05:54:31.750 --> 05:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
very expansive um you can also do it in
 
05:54:32.830 --> 05:54:32.840 align:start position:0%
a couple of different bills that are
 
05:54:34.468 --> 05:54:34.478 align:start position:0%
working their way in the legislature now
 
05:54:36.030 --> 05:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
there's one that would in two in the
 
05:54:38.230 --> 05:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
Senate both of them would give um open
 
05:54:40.030 --> 05:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
enrollment for your public school
 
05:54:42.948 --> 05:54:42.958 align:start position:0%
district um one is open enrollment
 
05:54:44.670 --> 05:54:44.680 align:start position:0%
within your District which which help
 
05:54:45.910 --> 05:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
somewhat but the other is open
 
05:54:47.830 --> 05:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
enrollment across the board so you could
 
05:54:50.030 --> 05:54:50.040 align:start position:0%
go to any public school in the state
 
05:54:51.708 --> 05:54:51.718 align:start position:0%
again that would help to create a market
 
05:54:54.788 --> 05:54:54.798 align:start position:0%
so you could shop around we have 29
 
05:54:56.750 --> 05:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
highquality studies done on the effects
 
05:55:00.070 --> 05:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
of school choice on school districts
 
05:55:01.868 --> 05:55:01.878 align:start position:0%
when school
 
05:55:04.590 --> 05:55:04.600 align:start position:0%
choice enters a district and parents
 
05:55:07.310 --> 05:55:07.320 align:start position:0%
actually have the option to take their
 
05:55:09.468 --> 05:55:09.478 align:start position:0%
Public School dollars and and go
 
05:55:12.030 --> 05:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
purchase an education on the market of
 
05:55:16.070 --> 05:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
those 29 studies 26 find a positive
 
05:55:18.468 --> 05:55:18.478 align:start position:0%
effect on outcomes for students who
 
05:55:21.750 --> 05:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
remain in the public
 
05:55:23.788 --> 05:55:23.798 align:start position:0%
schools and so that's what we mean by
 
05:55:25.270 --> 05:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
creating a market when you have that
 
05:55:25.280 --> 05:55:26.390 align:start position:0%
creating a market when you have that
market

05:55:26.390 --> 05:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
market
 
05:55:28.788 --> 05:55:28.798 align:start position:0%
competition it's about improving the
 
05:55:30.030 --> 05:55:30.040 align:start position:0%
outcomes for
 
05:55:32.510 --> 05:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
everybody so okay that's one of the
 
05:55:34.150 --> 05:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
priorities that we're looking at for the
 
05:55:36.628 --> 05:55:36.638 align:start position:0%
legislature if we get to the point where
 
05:55:38.628 --> 05:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
this year say they pass um Universal
 
05:55:40.430 --> 05:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
school choice of some form we would
 
05:55:41.990 --> 05:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
expect to see some pretty substantial
 
05:55:44.628 --> 05:55:44.638 align:start position:0%
economic positive impact from that okay
 
05:55:47.350 --> 05:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
on the follow-up question Mr chairman
 
05:55:50.070 --> 05:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
the uh second thing when you spending
 
05:55:52.468 --> 05:55:52.478 align:start position:0%
exceeding projected State now way and
 
05:55:55.788 --> 05:55:55.798 align:start position:0%
means is a very moderate
 
05:55:58.708 --> 05:55:58.718 align:start position:0%
group in looking at sources of revenue
 
05:56:02.230 --> 05:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
from the 14 categories of state revenue
 
05:56:03.948 --> 05:56:03.958 align:start position:0%
and recommending it
 
05:56:08.190 --> 05:56:08.200 align:start position:0%
forward my question is
 
05:56:11.310 --> 05:56:11.320 align:start position:0%
can you speculate on how the state
 
05:56:14.270 --> 05:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
spends more Revenue than what way and
 
05:56:18.070 --> 05:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
means reports out to the next
 
05:56:21.830 --> 05:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
committee I'm sorry I don't quite
 
05:56:25.070 --> 05:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
get since we're the ones Ways and Means
 
05:56:26.868 --> 05:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
is looking at our
 
05:56:30.708 --> 05:56:30.718 align:start position:0%
sources and it's more of a crystal ball
 
05:56:32.990 --> 05:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
approach I think and then we do it twice
 
05:56:34.510 --> 05:56:34.520 align:start position:0%
we only we don't do it once we do it
 
05:56:38.868 --> 05:56:38.878 align:start position:0%
twice we recommend out it still seems to
 
05:56:41.830 --> 05:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
gets out of here and it just shoots up
 
05:56:45.230 --> 05:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
even though we are more in the center of
 
05:56:47.510 --> 05:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to develop I think I
 
05:56:48.628 --> 05:56:48.638 align:start position:0%
see what you're saying are you are you
 
05:56:50.750 --> 05:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
asking how do the general the
 
05:56:53.230 --> 05:56:53.240 align:start position:0%
legislature as a whole increase revenues
 
05:56:57.548 --> 05:56:57.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:00.830 --> 05:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
right just want to know uh just a theory
 
05:57:03.390 --> 05:57:03.400 align:start position:0%
that's a theory isn't it no yeah I think
 
05:57:04.670 --> 05:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
I I think I might leave that to you I
 
05:57:05.708 --> 05:57:05.718 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know if I'd want to
 
05:57:09.430 --> 05:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
speculate that one sure thank you um
 
05:57:09.440 --> 05:57:11.190 align:start position:0%
speculate that one sure thank you um
representative

05:57:11.190 --> 05:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:57:13.590 --> 05:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chair I actually
 
05:57:16.788 --> 05:57:16.798 align:start position:0%
have two questions sure the first one uh
 
05:57:18.510 --> 05:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
related to something that you just
 
05:57:20.750 --> 05:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh you mentioned that New
 
05:57:23.590 --> 05:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's poverty late poverty rate is
 
05:57:27.548 --> 05:57:27.558 align:start position:0%
quite low lower even than Utah y uh at
 
05:57:30.708 --> 05:57:30.718 align:start position:0%
the same time New Hampshire's increase
 
05:57:32.990 --> 05:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
in the homeless population is the
 
05:57:34.430 --> 05:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
highest in the
 
05:57:36.788 --> 05:57:36.798 align:start position:0%
country so I'm trying trying to figure
 
05:57:40.390 --> 05:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
out how you reconcile that with a sense
 
05:57:43.230 --> 05:57:43.240 align:start position:0%
of economic us having more economic
 
05:57:45.830 --> 05:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
freedom than anyone else when we have
 
05:57:47.990 --> 05:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
had this enormous increase in the
 
05:57:51.468 --> 05:57:51.478 align:start position:0%
homeless population um so I haven't
 
05:57:52.990 --> 05:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
tried to study the increase in the
 
05:57:55.030 --> 05:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
homeless population myself and we at
 
05:57:57.110 --> 05:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
Barlett haven't looked at who those
 
05:57:58.590 --> 05:57:58.600 align:start position:0%
individuals are whether they've moved
 
05:58:00.510 --> 05:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
into the New Hampshire from out of state
 
05:58:02.910 --> 05:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
any of that so we don't I don't want to
 
05:58:04.628 --> 05:58:04.638 align:start position:0%
necessarily I don't have independent
 
05:58:09.150 --> 05:58:09.160 align:start position:0%
numbers on what that population is um so
 
05:58:12.628 --> 05:58:12.638 align:start position:0%
at this point I don't think we know from
 
05:58:15.590 --> 05:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
our point from our institution if that
 
05:58:17.750 --> 05:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
increase in the homeless population was
 
05:58:20.310 --> 05:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
people who migrated here in the last
 
05:58:23.830 --> 05:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
year versus people who may have become
 
05:58:25.310 --> 05:58:25.320 align:start position:0%
native New Hampshire people who became
 
05:58:27.310 --> 05:58:27.320 align:start position:0%
homeless um one study I have looked at
 
05:58:28.948 --> 05:58:28.958 align:start position:0%
was done by the Manhattan Institute and
 
05:58:30.310 --> 05:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
just published in the last couple of
 
05:58:33.510 --> 05:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
weeks where they looked at the last year
 
05:58:34.868 --> 05:58:34.878 align:start position:0%
huge increases in the homeless
 
05:58:37.030 --> 05:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
population all around the country
 
05:58:40.430 --> 05:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
and they attributed the majority of that
 
05:58:43.830 --> 05:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
increase to Illegal immigration so
 
05:58:45.830 --> 05:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
that's from a national level I think
 
05:58:47.548 --> 05:58:47.558 align:start position:0%
that's one of the places to sort of look
 
05:58:50.830 --> 05:58:50.840 align:start position:0%
and see um how did that overlap with New
 
05:58:52.910 --> 05:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but I don't have that data to
 
05:58:55.830 --> 05:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
know exactly who those people are just a
 
05:58:58.350 --> 05:58:58.360 align:start position:0%
followup to that first question let's
 
05:59:02.030 --> 05:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
take out any immigrants and just look at
 
05:59:04.390 --> 05:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
however many homeless people we have
 
05:59:08.070 --> 05:59:08.080 align:start position:0%
here okay how do we reconcile that
 
05:59:11.270 --> 05:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
significant homeless population with the
 
05:59:13.948 --> 05:59:13.958 align:start position:0%
notion of economic
 
05:59:17.190 --> 05:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
freedom um I'm not sure I quite
 
05:59:18.670 --> 05:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
understand what the point you're getting
 
05:59:22.310 --> 05:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
at uh we have a safety net in New
 
05:59:24.468 --> 05:59:24.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have safety nets in local
 
05:59:30.788 --> 05:59:30.798 align:start position:0%
communities um we have policies that are
 
05:59:34.230 --> 05:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
not conducive to helping people find
 
05:59:36.548 --> 05:59:36.558 align:start position:0%
places to live and I think think we've
 
05:59:38.030 --> 05:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
written a bit about that in the past
 
05:59:39.910 --> 05:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
about housing policies that could be
 
05:59:42.110 --> 05:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
more open to allow to to find helping
 
05:59:44.190 --> 05:59:44.200 align:start position:0%
people find homes and lowcost homes you
 
05:59:46.390 --> 05:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
know one of the problems that we've seen
 
05:59:48.190 --> 05:59:48.200 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is that the growth of
 
05:59:51.230 --> 05:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
these local regulations for example have
 
05:59:53.110 --> 05:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
essentially baned boarding houses in
 
05:59:55.230 --> 05:59:55.240 align:start position:0%
many many many communities in in in the
 
05:59:57.390 --> 05:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
state so there are very few places where
 
06:00:00.190 --> 06:00:00.200 align:start position:0%
you can have um what we used to have in
 
06:00:02.910 --> 06:00:02.920 align:start position:0%
the 19th and most of the 20th century
 
06:00:04.070 --> 06:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
the first half of the 20th century which
 
06:00:06.030 --> 06:00:06.040 align:start position:0%
is a boarding house where you can charge
 
06:00:08.430 --> 06:00:08.440 align:start position:0%
very low rates at a weekly basis or a
 
06:00:10.628 --> 06:00:10.638 align:start position:0%
monthly basis those boarding houses that
 
06:00:13.110 --> 06:00:13.120 align:start position:0%
used to be very common um essentially no
 
06:00:15.110 --> 06:00:15.120 align:start position:0%
longer exist because of housing policy
 
06:00:17.390 --> 06:00:17.400 align:start position:0%
so that's is one factor but there's also
 
06:00:19.788 --> 06:00:19.798 align:start position:0%
um mental health Investments and all
 
06:00:21.868 --> 06:00:21.878 align:start position:0%
kinds of other things that contribute to
 
06:00:23.910 --> 06:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
that population
 
06:00:27.190 --> 06:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
but the existence of a population of
 
06:00:29.310 --> 06:00:29.320 align:start position:0%
people who are struggling to get by does
 
06:00:32.910 --> 06:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
not negate the
 
06:00:32.920 --> 06:00:34.548 align:start position:0%
not negate the
um

06:00:34.548 --> 06:00:34.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:00:38.310 --> 06:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:42.110 --> 06:00:42.120 align:start position:0%
on the state of having a largely free
 
06:00:44.230 --> 06:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
economy that what we've seen again to
 
06:00:47.150 --> 06:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
point out the data and you can go to an
 
06:00:49.510 --> 06:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
or a website called our world and data
 
06:00:51.670 --> 06:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
where they point out that how economic
 
06:00:54.150 --> 06:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
growth has essentially
 
06:00:57.310 --> 06:00:57.320 align:start position:0%
eradicated um extreme poverty it's not
 
06:01:00.150 --> 06:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
entirely gone but because of economic
 
06:01:02.590 --> 06:01:02.600 align:start position:0%
growth and it's almost been wiped out
 
06:01:06.190 --> 06:01:06.200 align:start position:0%
and so it's better to have more freedom
 
06:01:08.350 --> 06:01:08.360 align:start position:0%
and more economic growth which creates
 
06:01:11.910 --> 06:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
the wealth that we then use to provide
 
06:01:13.430 --> 06:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
Social Services to
 
06:01:15.948 --> 06:01:15.958 align:start position:0%
people um I
 
06:01:18.548 --> 06:01:18.558 align:start position:0%
will suggest you might talk to some of
 
06:01:20.708 --> 06:01:20.718 align:start position:0%
those folks who are struggling but as a
 
06:01:23.590 --> 06:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
separate question you also mentioned
 
06:01:25.030 --> 06:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
some studies
 
06:01:28.390 --> 06:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
concerning uh choice in in a general
 
06:01:30.830 --> 06:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
term yeah with regard to education and
 
06:01:33.628 --> 06:01:33.638 align:start position:0%
you talked about data that was
 
06:01:37.070 --> 06:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
collected concerning people satisfaction
 
06:01:39.910 --> 06:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
and the rise in test scores among
 
06:01:39.920 --> 06:01:41.030 align:start position:0%
and the rise in test scores among
different

06:01:41.030 --> 06:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
different
 
06:01:43.510 --> 06:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
populations the way the education
 
06:01:45.948 --> 06:01:45.958 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts are set up here in New
 
06:01:50.350 --> 06:01:50.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there is no accountability we
 
06:01:53.868 --> 06:01:53.878 align:start position:0%
don't know what costs are we have no
 
06:01:56.788 --> 06:01:56.798 align:start position:0%
idea what testing is well we know what
 
06:01:59.190 --> 06:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
we're paying in we don't know where that
 
06:02:01.350 --> 06:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
all that money is going necessarily
 
06:02:03.310 --> 06:02:03.320 align:start position:0%
respectfully man that's incorrect U the
 
06:02:06.150 --> 06:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund literally
 
06:02:08.230 --> 06:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
vets every single purchase down to the
 
06:02:10.830 --> 06:02:10.840 align:start position:0%
penny so we have reports on that we know
 
06:02:13.110 --> 06:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
exactly where that money goes we know
 
06:02:15.670 --> 06:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
precisely what that money is spent on
 
06:02:18.350 --> 06:02:18.360 align:start position:0%
they produce reports on that and um we
 
06:02:22.270 --> 06:02:22.280 align:start position:0%
in fact are the most uh
 
06:02:24.830 --> 06:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
heavily put it this way New Hampshire
 
06:02:27.070 --> 06:02:27.080 align:start position:0%
vets the spending more aggressively than
 
06:02:28.830 --> 06:02:28.840 align:start position:0%
every other every other education
 
06:02:31.070 --> 06:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
savings account in the country I've had
 
06:02:32.548 --> 06:02:32.558 align:start position:0%
um folks from other
 
06:02:36.468 --> 06:02:36.478 align:start position:0%
states um ask why in the world do you
 
06:02:38.868 --> 06:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
guys vet every expenditure you make us
 
06:02:40.910 --> 06:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
look bad because we don't do that every
 
06:02:43.030 --> 06:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
single expenditure gets vetted you
 
06:02:46.390 --> 06:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
cannot um go for example so Amazon is a
 
06:02:48.270 --> 06:02:48.280 align:start position:0%
vendor in the education Freedom account
 
06:02:52.350 --> 06:02:52.360 align:start position:0%
program if you put um your
 
06:02:55.350 --> 06:02:55.360 align:start position:0%
approved educational items in your a
 
06:02:57.708 --> 06:02:57.718 align:start position:0%
cart from Amazon and then throw a bag of
 
06:03:00.190 --> 06:03:00.200 align:start position:0%
Oreos in that entire cart will not get
 
06:03:02.628 --> 06:03:02.638 align:start position:0%
approved the system doesn't allow that
 
06:03:04.910 --> 06:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
um that's how that's the level of degree
 
06:03:06.628 --> 06:03:06.638 align:start position:0%
of oversight that we have on the
 
06:03:09.310 --> 06:03:09.320 align:start position:0%
spending M we um I'm going to have to
 
06:03:11.548 --> 06:03:11.558 align:start position:0%
cut it off there we've got we're over
 
06:03:13.350 --> 06:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
time I've got I'm going to call on two
 
06:03:14.830 --> 06:03:14.840 align:start position:0%
more people representative ORS and
 
06:03:16.310 --> 06:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
representative rung and then we'll end
 
06:03:18.030 --> 06:03:18.040 align:start position:0%
to be respectful of the time
 
06:03:19.548 --> 06:03:19.558 align:start position:0%
representative ORS thank you Mr chair
 
06:03:21.390 --> 06:03:21.400 align:start position:0%
and thanks again for taking my question
 
06:03:24.070 --> 06:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
sure uh it's one thing about the
 
06:03:26.310 --> 06:03:26.320 align:start position:0%
homeless I saw a documentary that most
 
06:03:28.030 --> 06:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
of the homeless are homeless because of
 
06:03:31.150 --> 06:03:31.160 align:start position:0%
their drug addiction so I'm not sure but
 
06:03:32.948 --> 06:03:32.958 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to mention that my
 
06:03:35.350 --> 06:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
question is uh what is you talked about
 
06:03:37.390 --> 06:03:37.400 align:start position:0%
the business business tax rate and
 
06:03:40.310 --> 06:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
healthy economics what is the mass tax
 
06:03:43.868 --> 06:03:43.878 align:start position:0%
rate for business versus New Hampshire
 
06:03:46.628 --> 06:03:46.638 align:start position:0%
um mass is actually better than us I
 
06:03:48.708 --> 06:03:48.718 align:start position:0%
don't I would call right off hand 7 and
 
06:03:51.230 --> 06:03:51.240 align:start position:0%
a half% four four yeah I think it's
 
06:03:53.190 --> 06:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
that's why I thought was about 4 it's so
 
06:03:55.830 --> 06:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
they're but they're trade-off right
 
06:03:58.708 --> 06:03:58.718 align:start position:0%
so we don't tax personal income and they
 
06:04:01.750 --> 06:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
do right so they've or sales right so
 
06:04:03.310 --> 06:04:03.320 align:start position:0%
they balance it so they can have a lower
 
06:04:04.750 --> 06:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
business tax rate because they have
 
06:04:06.070 --> 06:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
broad-based taxes which which we don't
 
06:04:07.590 --> 06:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
have so that's why our business tax rate
 
06:04:10.948 --> 06:04:10.958 align:start position:0%
is is higher so it's approximately four
 
06:04:12.788 --> 06:04:12.798 align:start position:0%
versus 7 and a half or something like
 
06:04:15.150 --> 06:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
that I I'll take your four yeah very
 
06:04:20.190 --> 06:04:20.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:22.468 --> 06:04:22.478 align:start position:0%
run thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
06:04:25.310 --> 06:04:25.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question sure regarding the K
 
06:04:28.628 --> 06:04:28.638 align:start position:0%
through2 education Market um Do You
 
06:04:31.830 --> 06:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
Believe parents have as much control
 
06:04:36.150 --> 06:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
over the quality of their schools um
 
06:04:38.310 --> 06:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
by just electing Schoolboard members
 
06:04:40.948 --> 06:04:40.958 align:start position:0%
don't school boards who are elected by
 
06:04:43.350 --> 06:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
all voters in the community have the
 
06:04:46.548 --> 06:04:46.558 align:start position:0%
power to develop education and curricula
 
06:04:48.628 --> 06:04:48.638 align:start position:0%
to meet the needs of the students no
 
06:04:49.510 --> 06:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question that's
 
06:04:51.270 --> 06:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
actually a great question um and I I
 
06:04:54.110 --> 06:04:54.120 align:start position:0%
think the answer is no and the reason is
 
06:04:56.270 --> 06:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
um when you have a school district to
 
06:04:57.948 --> 06:04:57.958 align:start position:0%
which all students in that District are
 
06:05:00.510 --> 06:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
assigned and they must go um if they
 
06:05:02.070 --> 06:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
want to access their public education
 
06:05:05.948 --> 06:05:05.958 align:start position:0%
money you have a 50% plus one on the
 
06:05:09.788 --> 06:05:09.798 align:start position:0%
school board right so the board is voted
 
06:05:11.628 --> 06:05:11.638 align:start position:0%
on by the entire Community right it
 
06:05:13.590 --> 06:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
makes decisions for the entire community
 
06:05:17.990 --> 06:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
and it's a 50 plus one so 50% plus one
 
06:05:19.990 --> 06:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
gets to pass the policy so if you're in
 
06:05:20.000 --> 06:05:20.830 align:start position:0%
gets to pass the policy so if you're in
the

06:05:20.830 --> 06:05:20.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:05:24.070 --> 06:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
49% that might disagree with that policy
 
06:05:26.910 --> 06:05:26.920 align:start position:0%
you have nowhere to go right so if you
 
06:05:29.670 --> 06:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
have for example um you can take any
 
06:05:32.510 --> 06:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
number of curricula issues Library
 
06:05:35.750 --> 06:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
access um the way special ed is offered
 
06:05:37.390 --> 06:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
like any number of things that might
 
06:05:39.948 --> 06:05:39.958 align:start position:0%
impact the way you uh interact with your
 
06:05:43.390 --> 06:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
education as a child if the collective
 
06:05:45.430 --> 06:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
decision to offer a public education in
 
06:05:47.868 --> 06:05:47.878 align:start position:0%
that school in this particular way
 
06:05:49.350 --> 06:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't work for you and your child
 
06:05:51.830 --> 06:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't respond well to that you're
 
06:05:54.590 --> 06:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
stuck there whereas if you have the
 
06:05:56.670 --> 06:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
ability to shop around and the education
 
06:05:58.548 --> 06:05:58.558 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts include other District
 
06:06:00.548 --> 06:06:00.558 align:start position:0%
Public Schools I think that's very clear
 
06:06:02.708 --> 06:06:02.718 align:start position:0%
and that was by Design you can go buy a
 
06:06:04.590 --> 06:06:04.600 align:start position:0%
private education but you can also take
 
06:06:05.948 --> 06:06:05.958 align:start position:0%
that and go to another District public
 
06:06:07.270 --> 06:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
school if you want if you find one that
 
06:06:10.430 --> 06:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
works better for you that creates more
