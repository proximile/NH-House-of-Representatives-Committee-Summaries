00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
for being here on a Friday afternoon we
 
00:19:10.029 --> 00:19:10.039 align:start position:0%
appreciate that um we have a couple
 
00:19:13.029 --> 00:19:13.039 align:start position:0%
of uh we have uh three of our members
 
00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
are currently at a county delegation
 
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
meeting and will be uh here later um so
 
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
we will take no official actions on any
 
00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:25.240 align:start position:0%
bills um until we have a quorum uh if we
 
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:27.400 align:start position:0%
do take any official actions
 
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
today uh just a another quick
 
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
announcement um in the announcement for
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
this subcommittee meeting uh HB 608 was
 
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
listed um that was an inadvertent error
 
00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:44.360 align:start position:0%
administratively we won't say who made
 
00:19:48.430 --> 00:19:48.440 align:start position:0%
the error um but it was already exec and
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
so we will not be reviewing that any
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
further under the committee we
 
00:19:56.669 --> 00:19:56.679 align:start position:0%
may um mention it in the context of
 
00:19:58.830 --> 00:19:58.840 align:start position:0%
another bill perhaps but but it will not
 
00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
be reviewed or acted on by the
 
00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.230 align:start position:0%
be reviewed or acted on by the
subcommittee

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
then uh I think I will wait on any more
 
00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
announcements until the rest of the
 
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760 align:start position:0%

please well thank you so much for the
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
record my name is Henry clemento I'm the
 
00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
deputy legal director at the American
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
civil liberties of Union of New
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I want to start with uh
 
00:22:24.549 --> 00:22:24.559 align:start position:0%
expressing my profound appreciation for
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee for allowing me to
 
00:22:29.549 --> 00:22:29.559 align:start position:0%
testify at this time um just very
 
00:22:29.559 --> 00:22:30.430 align:start position:0%
testify at this time um just very
greatly

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
greatly
 
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
appreciated so I I have a few remarks
 
00:22:35.269 --> 00:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to keep pretty short um I
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
think that there's two and I'm going to
 
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
talk just about the changes requ uh
 
00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
about legal dependents who are claim can
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
be claimed outside of the state and so I
 
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
think there's two issues with this that
 
00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
I wanted to raise for the subcommittee
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
one constitutional and one
 
00:22:52.669 --> 00:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
practical so the the first
 
00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
constitutional issue is that um it's
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
really not so I understand this bill to
 
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:00.440 align:start position:0%
be talking about when that uses the word
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
dependent to be talking about that from
 
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
a tax perspective in that um because I'm
 
00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:07.640 align:start position:0%
not aware of that being used throughout
 
00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire statutes otherwise so
 
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
I understand it to
 
00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
be if if a person is claimed on the
 
00:23:16.669 --> 00:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
taxes of their parents as a
 
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
dependent um and those parents reside
 
00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
outside the state that the person won't
 
00:23:23.909 --> 00:23:23.919 align:start position:0%
have domicile in New Hampshire even if
 
00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:26.200 align:start position:0%
they otherwise meet the qualifications
 
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
and so from a constitutional perspective
 
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
the problem I see is that you are
 
00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:31.799 align:start position:0%
conditioning someone else's right to
 
00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
vote on the actions of another which is
 
00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
their parents and it's not up to like
 
00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
when I was a child my parents I think
 
00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:43.240 align:start position:0%
claimed me on their taxes as a dependent
 
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know whether that continued when
 
00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
I was throughout college but it wasn't
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
up to me they didn't discuss it with me
 
00:23:52.669 --> 00:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
and so if my right to vote were
 
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
dependent on them claiming me as a
 
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
dependent for taxes or
 
00:23:59.669 --> 00:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
not I think that's that's an
 
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional condition to put on
 
00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:02.799 align:start position:0%
someone else's right to vote because the
 
00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
other qualifications that we talk about
 
00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of domicile are really within a
 
00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
person's control so you choose to live
 
00:24:11.269 --> 00:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
within New Hampshire to establish a
 
00:24:13.149 --> 00:24:13.159 align:start position:0%
physical presence and you choose to make
 
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
it your primary place for engaging in
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
Civic self-government but in in essence
 
00:24:19.870 --> 00:24:19.880 align:start position:0%
what this is doing is giving your
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
parents a veto over whether you can vote
 
00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so say for example a
 
00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:26.559 align:start position:0%
person you know were a registered
 
00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:27.919 align:start position:0%
Republican and wanted to vote for
 
00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
candidate a went to college in New
 
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but their parents were
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
Democrats and didn't want their child
 
00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
voting in New Hampshire they could stop
 
00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:37.039 align:start position:0%
them from doing that by claiming them on
 
00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%
their taxes under this bill and so I
 
00:24:41.269 --> 00:24:41.279 align:start position:0%
think that's an
 
00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional condition from a
 
00:24:46.029 --> 00:24:46.039 align:start position:0%
practical perspective I think it's in
 
00:24:47.789 --> 00:24:47.799 align:start position:0%
some way this is in some ways even a
 
00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
bigger issue in so far as tax returns
 
00:24:54.269 --> 00:24:54.279 align:start position:0%
are confidential by Statute and so
 
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
there's no way of anyone knowing as far
 
00:24:59.149 --> 00:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
as I'm aware whether the has happened or
 
00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:01.799 align:start position:0%
not so if I wanted to know whether my
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
parents claimed me as a dependent I'd
 
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:07.240 align:start position:0%
have to ask them they're under no
 
00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:09.640 align:start position:0%
obligation to tell me they could tell me
 
00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
the truth or not and unless I you know
 
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
were able to somehow subpoena their tax
 
00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:19.039 align:start position:0%
records I I'd be sort of at a loss as to
 
00:25:21.950 --> 00:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
whether or not I am in fact claimed as a
 
00:25:24.269 --> 00:25:24.279 align:start position:0%
dependent because I don't as a minor or
 
00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
as a dependent necessarily have access
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
to their taxes in addition
 
00:25:30.669 --> 00:25:30.679 align:start position:0%
the state authorities wouldn't
 
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily either they may I mean the
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
Dr will have access if the person is
 
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
paying New Hampshire taxes although we
 
00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:39.320 align:start position:0%
don't have an income tax anymore but the
 
00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:41.720 align:start position:0%
Dr or or or the Attorney General's
 
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
office or the supervisors of the
 
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
checklist are not going to have access
 
00:25:47.149 --> 00:25:47.159 align:start position:0%
to the parents IRS
 
00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:49.240 align:start position:0%
returns and so there's no way for that
 
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
to be enforced either and so you're kind
 
00:25:53.549 --> 00:25:53.559 align:start position:0%
of putting the potential voter in a
 
00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
catch 22 of they can ask their parents
 
00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
whether they're being claimed they can
 
00:26:01.149 --> 00:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
ask their parents not to claim them and
 
00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
Sort of hope that their
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
parents don't claim them if asked or
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
respond or respond truthfully but sort
 
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
of like actually meeting with your
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
parents accountant and getting them to
 
00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:13.640 align:start position:0%
wave confidentiality there's nothing
 
00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
that the voter can do to ensure that
 
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
they're voting lawfully because they may
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
not know and there's really no way for
 
00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:21.799 align:start position:0%
the state to know whether the person is
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
voting lawfully either because they're
 
00:26:24.269 --> 00:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
not going to have access to the parents
 
00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:26.039 align:start position:0%
tax returns and if the parents are
 
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
residing out of state as I'm saying this
 
00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
I'm real ing they're not going to be
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
paying New Hampshire income taxes anyway
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
they're going to be paying another
 
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
State's taxes and so there wouldn't be
 
00:26:37.149 --> 00:26:37.159 align:start position:0%
Dr records so those are the the the
 
00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:38.799 align:start position:0%
issues as I see them they're sort of the
 
00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
Constitutional issue of conditioning a
 
00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
person's right to vote on the actions of
 
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:44.440 align:start position:0%
their parents and then the Practical
 
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
issues of like all this is confidential
 
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
and how does anyone know so those are my
 
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
concerns um again I really appreciate so
 
00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:53.720 align:start position:0%
much the actions of the chair and the
 
00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
full subcommittee for allowing me to
 
00:26:57.909 --> 00:26:57.919 align:start position:0%
testify um and I'm happy to take any
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any thank you Mr
 
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.909 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any thank you Mr
Clementon

00:27:02.909 --> 00:27:02.919 align:start position:0%
Clementon
 
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative Burnham do you have
 
00:27:09.149 --> 00:27:09.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
time thank you Mr chair I I I appreciate
 
00:27:15.549 --> 00:27:15.559 align:start position:0%
the explanation
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
um I I don't have any questions at this
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
time though thank
 
00:27:24.669 --> 00:27:24.679 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you I if
 
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
um I I do have some questions for and
 
00:27:30.029 --> 00:27:30.039 align:start position:0%
now it seems like the perfect time to
 
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
mention that I am not a tax attorney
 
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
right and right okay and so um I will do
 
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
my best to answer but people should not
 
00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:40.120 align:start position:0%
for be operating under the illusion that
 
00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:41.960 align:start position:0%
I know anything about taxes in looking
 
00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:43.880 align:start position:0%
around the room I do not see any tax
 
00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
attorney so I think we're all in good
 
00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
company uh no offense to tax attorneys
 
00:27:50.669 --> 00:27:50.679 align:start position:0%
but um so let me just ask uh this
 
00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
um if if the person is here in New
 
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:01.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is truly a dependent and is
 
00:28:08.029 --> 00:28:08.039 align:start position:0%
only um here under the sustenance of the
 
00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh parent or
 
00:28:12.789 --> 00:28:12.799 align:start position:0%
Guardian um and they are in fact
 
00:28:15.509 --> 00:28:15.519 align:start position:0%
controlling that person being here by
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
that sustaining resources does that
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
change your opinion on any of
 
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
this so it's a it's it's a great
 
00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
question and I think the answer is no
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
what I'm thinking as I'm speaking so I'm
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
going to do my best um so
 
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
first I don't I'm not as I said a tax
 
00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
expert and so I'm not sure if that's
 
00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:40.799 align:start position:0%
really what's required for person to be
 
00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
claimed as a dependent under the tax
 
00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.710 align:start position:0%
claimed as a dependent under the tax
code

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
code
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
um I did a little bit of brief research
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
and it if I if I may I I'm again I'm not
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
a tax person but I believe it the law or
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
the language on the tax forms is
 
00:29:02.269 --> 00:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
something of supplying more than 50% of
 
00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:05.320 align:start position:0%
the wherewithal you know or equivalent
 
00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
for a person so if they're in fact if
 
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
that person is in fact living in New
 
00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the parents or Guardian
 
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
are living elsewhere then um you know
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
and now especially with be because of
 
00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
the health care uh through the
 
00:29:24.669 --> 00:29:24.679 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act the requirement to
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
support Health Care coverage up through
 
00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:29.630 align:start position:0%
support Health Care coverage up through
age

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
age
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
26 right um so those those aspects I
 
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
think come to bear on this so again I'm
 
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:39.640 align:start position:0%
to Echo your your Sage words I am not a
 
00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
tax accountant but I am familiar with
 
00:29:46.029 --> 00:29:46.039 align:start position:0%
those aspects and so uh a a person who
 
00:29:49.789 --> 00:29:49.799 align:start position:0%
is a dependent is ostensibly yeah uh
 
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
more than 50% supported and I I think it
 
00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:29:57.149 --> 00:29:57.159 align:start position:0%
reasonably I think it would be logical
 
00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
to conclude that in fact their ability
 
00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
to to be in New Hampshire in a place
 
00:30:04.909 --> 00:30:04.919 align:start position:0%
separate from their parents and
 
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
Guardians and with the parents and
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
Guardians also claiming them as a
 
00:30:11.789 --> 00:30:11.799 align:start position:0%
dependent again some coordination needs
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
to and communication needs to occur in
 
00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
order to have that but in in fact that
 
00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
person is here on valtion of the parent
 
00:30:24.909 --> 00:30:24.919 align:start position:0%
or Guardian so so yeah what does what
 
00:30:26.909 --> 00:30:26.919 align:start position:0%
are your insights onto that so A few
 
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
things so um I think a common scenario
 
00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:31.000 align:start position:0%
of people that we're talking about who
 
00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
are voting age who could be claimed for
 
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
their are students and I think that
 
00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:37.480 align:start position:0%
there are special tax rules for choosing
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
students and so I think a common
 
00:30:42.029 --> 00:30:42.039 align:start position:0%
Arrangement it involves a student and
 
00:30:44.909 --> 00:30:44.919 align:start position:0%
parents co-signing loans for tuition is
 
00:30:44.919 --> 00:30:45.750 align:start position:0%
parents co-signing loans for tuition is
a

00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
frequent um and so whether that is
 
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
enough of a financial contribution to
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
claim someone as a dependent I don't
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
know but the student is still taking on
 
00:30:58.350 --> 00:30:58.360 align:start position:0%
significant debt in order to to pay
 
00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:01.000 align:start position:0%
their own way and so typically people
 
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
who are in New Hampshire to be in school
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
are doing that are financing that and so
 
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
whether they're doing that with the
 
00:31:11.389 --> 00:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
assistance of their parents or no um I
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
think that's part so that that's part of
 
00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
it number two um you know most of us are
 
00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:19.799 align:start position:0%
existing in in New Hampshire at the
 
00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
sustenance of somebody whether it's our
 
00:31:24.389 --> 00:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
parents or our employers and I think
 
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
that there's a slippery slope between
 
00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:28.360 align:start position:0%
saying you know your parents are paying
 
00:31:30.909 --> 00:31:30.919 align:start position:0%
for you to be here and so you don't have
 
00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:32.799 align:start position:0%
the same full rights of citizenship
 
00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
because your parents live out of state
 
00:31:36.269 --> 00:31:36.279 align:start position:0%
instead of you know maybe you're
 
00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:37.960 align:start position:0%
remotely working for a company that's
 
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:39.320 align:start position:0%
headquartered outside of the state and
 
00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
they're paying for you there's obviously
 
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:43.480 align:start position:0%
differences but I but but I think that
 
00:31:46.909 --> 00:31:46.919 align:start position:0%
that's a um a road that we don't want to
 
00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:49.960 align:start position:0%
travel down is looking at the financial
 
00:31:51.629 --> 00:31:51.639 align:start position:0%
wherewithal of New Hampshire voters
 
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
because some people who vote in New
 
00:31:57.029 --> 00:31:57.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have no means to speak of and
 
00:31:59.549 --> 00:31:59.559 align:start position:0%
um and and so I'm you know and given the
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
history of voting in this country I'm in
 
00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
particular look a scance at the idea of
 
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
trying to inquire into the financial
 
00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:09.919 align:start position:0%
respects of people but I I'll note that
 
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
in general the New Hampshire domicile
 
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
definition has never inquired as to
 
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
where your assets come from it's really
 
00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:17.960 align:start position:0%
about do you have a physical presence in
 
00:32:19.629 --> 00:32:19.639 align:start position:0%
the state and is it your home for
 
00:32:21.149 --> 00:32:21.159 align:start position:0%
participation in Democratic
 
00:32:23.509 --> 00:32:23.519 align:start position:0%
self-government and how you get there or
 
00:32:25.149 --> 00:32:25.159 align:start position:0%
not you know where your money comes from
 
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:27.320 align:start position:0%
has never before been a test for the
 
00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
domicile requirement and so this would
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
be something new you know I understand
 
00:32:33.389 --> 00:32:33.399 align:start position:0%
that it
 
00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:37.480 align:start position:0%
is uh Ju Just if I may interject that uh
 
00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
one of the uh proofs of evidence of
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
docility or if that's the right word of
 
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
domicile um can be a tax form that has a
 
00:32:50.269 --> 00:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire address so there is that
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
connection I I didn't want you to forget
 
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
that but um but uh so it's not
 
00:32:59.830 --> 00:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
completely unique or or out of it it's
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
not like it hasn't intruded into the
 
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
election law discussion before but it's
 
00:33:06.629 --> 00:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
an excellent point that you're making I
 
00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:08.360 align:start position:0%
mean a tax form is a government document
 
00:33:10.629 --> 00:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
with your address on it and so I think I
 
00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.519 align:start position:0%
look at that as proof of physical
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
presence um more than as participation
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
in Democratic self-government in the
 
00:33:21.870 --> 00:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
state because you may be paying you know
 
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:23.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire income taxes if you work
 
00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
in the state but live in Massachusetts
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
for example if we still had income taxes
 
00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
that may be the case you would be paying
 
00:33:30.149 --> 00:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire property taxes if you own
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
a second home in the state regardless of
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
whether it's your primary domicide um so
 
00:33:36.149 --> 00:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
I've always thought of that more as
 
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
proof of the physical presence but I but
 
00:33:42.830 --> 00:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
I but I take your point um and so I
 
00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
think that's probably the best job that
 
00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
I can do answering your question and
 
00:33:49.029 --> 00:33:49.039 align:start position:0%
then of course there's the issue of like
 
00:33:51.789 --> 00:33:51.799 align:start position:0%
what if a parent claims someone as a do
 
00:33:53.470 --> 00:33:53.480 align:start position:0%
you know as a dependent on their tax
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
returns either mistakenly or
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
fraudulently thinking that they're
 
00:33:59.669 --> 00:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
providing half of the person's assets
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
but in fact they're not I'm not sure
 
00:34:03.789 --> 00:34:03.799 align:start position:0%
that the you know that the statute as
 
00:34:06.029 --> 00:34:06.039 align:start position:0%
written really contemplates that I mean
 
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
it says legal dependent sure but I'm I'm
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
not sure that it does and then you have
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
that if there were ever an enforcement
 
00:34:13.629 --> 00:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
action you're going to have to prove up
 
00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:17.240 align:start position:0%
everyone's assets and bring in forensic
 
00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:19.839 align:start position:0%
accountants to do that in it I I'm not
 
00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
plausible it it does it does seem to be
 
00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:28.430 align:start position:0%
plausible it it does it does seem to be
uh

00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
following it to that extreme
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
uh does seem to be Beyond The Pale but I
 
00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:38.200 align:start position:0%
I again you're you're laying out a whole
 
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
sequence of events there at that point
 
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
that's my job um all right
 
00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.030 align:start position:0%
that's my job um all right
so

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:49.599 align:start position:0%
um I don't have any other questions at
 
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
this time I want to thank you very much
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
for your testimony and we were able to
 
00:34:54.990 --> 00:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
get you out of here uh before your court
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
appearance yes thank you so much and
 
00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
I'll just reiterate that if anyone on
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee has any questions about
 
00:35:03.069 --> 00:35:03.079 align:start position:0%
anything I'm always available uh thank
 
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
you um I'll I'll let the other remaining
 
00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:08.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh members know that and
 
00:35:10.109 --> 00:35:10.119 align:start position:0%
and that goes for committee staff as
 
00:35:12.069 --> 00:35:12.079 align:start position:0%
well oh thank you appreciate that all
 
00:35:14.069 --> 00:35:14.079 align:start position:0%
right thank you so
 
00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
luck all right um at this time
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to welcome Mr Richard Daniel
 
00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:31.960 align:start position:0%

Richard to oh I'm sorry did you uh yes
Mr

00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
O'Brien thank you very much Mr chair uh
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Michael
 
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
O'Brien lobbyist with pry strategies uh
 
00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
and representing America votes um I just
 
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:48.440 align:start position:0%
um to bring up the second part which is
 
00:35:52.190 --> 00:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
the attachment of of uh UNH um residency
 
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
and state tuition standards to uh and
 
00:35:56.589 --> 00:35:56.599 align:start position:0%
just read their definition for you just
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
so we're all clear um a students's
 
00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
resident for tuition purposes is
 
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
considered to be that of their parent
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
unless the student is emancipated to
 
00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:07.839 align:start position:0%
qualify for Interstate tuition status a
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
student or his her parents if a
 
00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:12.040 align:start position:0%
dependent must physically reside in New
 
00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:13.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for no less than 12 continuous
 
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
months prior to the term for which the
 
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:18.760 align:start position:0%
estate status is desired must reside in
 
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for some purpose other
 
00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:22.079 align:start position:0%
than attending the university and meet
 
00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
all the requirements for tuition rules I
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
also want to stress that in the
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
beginning um it talks about how they
 
00:36:29.349 --> 00:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
they apply this standard at the as a
 
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
freshman so you can't you know this
 
00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
isn't this doesn't get Revisited uh you
 
00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
you can't actively try to if they change
 
00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
it so what you're saying is if they if
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
the student were to change that in you
 
00:36:46.829 --> 00:36:46.839 align:start position:0%
know from their sophomore to junior year
 
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
it would it's they're still obligated as
 
00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
I as I read it the website says
 
00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
residency is determined at the time of
 
00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
admission for a degree ah so to not to
 
00:36:59.870 --> 00:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
regate everything that attorney Clement
 
00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:02.200 align:start position:0%
Tois just said but uh this again goes
 
00:37:04.109 --> 00:37:04.119 align:start position:0%
back to dependency right as was stated
 
00:37:06.109 --> 00:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
in that definition that it depends on
 
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
where your dependents live not
 
00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily where you live and also
 
00:37:12.190 --> 00:37:12.200 align:start position:0%
again you could very well establish um
 
00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
yourself in in New Hampshire over the
 
00:37:16.270 --> 00:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
four years but because this is set at
 
00:37:19.109 --> 00:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
the first year um you know you would
 
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
never qualify under and obviously there
 
00:37:21.990 --> 00:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
are lots of constitutional problems if I
 
00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
lived in a place for four years and was
 
00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:25.079 align:start position:0%
told that I couldn't vote but more than
 
00:37:27.309 --> 00:37:27.319 align:start position:0%
that all of the definitions made up here
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
um 12 months to qualify and all these

um various aspects that this uh
 
00:38:50.109 --> 00:38:50.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is looking at so
 
00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:56.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:01.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
glasses that that's uh
 
00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
what power multiple places because of
 
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
the wind yeah
 
00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:11.480 align:start position:0%
delay all right so glad it didn't affect
 
00:39:14.069 --> 00:39:14.079 align:start position:0%
me other than printing yeah so is this a
 
00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:16.760 align:start position:0%
quorum it it doesn't uh you missed that
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
part it doesn't have to be a quorum
 
00:39:22.349 --> 00:39:22.359 align:start position:0%
until uh if unless we make an official
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
action on a specific
 
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
bill so um let me let me uh give you the
 
00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
option is it sounds
 
00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:37.870 align:start position:0%
option is it sounds
like

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
um if you have the time I'm completely
 
00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:43.240 align:start position:0%
flexible I'm here to be till close we
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
could take a brief recess for a few
 
00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
minutes and allow more members to get
 
00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
here perfect um let me uh if you'll
 
00:39:57.550 --> 00:39:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
if uh the
 
00:40:03.069 --> 00:40:03.079 align:start position:0%
other members will be coming here as
 
00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.200 align:start position:0%
well I I just got a message from one
 
00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:07.960 align:start position:0%
person that they would be leaving in
 
00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
five minutes and that's appro they would
 
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:18.309 --> 00:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
now so let me just uh check into that
 
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
but what I what I would suggest they're
 
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
they're reportedly about uh 10 minutes
 
00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
away so so I would suggest maybe taking
 
00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
a brief
 
00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.910 align:start position:0%
a brief
recess

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
recess
 
00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:35.589 align:start position:0%
recess
until

00:40:35.589 --> 00:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
until
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
um 10 of and then that would all that
 
00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
would allow us to do um some things
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
again uh one of my favorite sayings is
 
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
blessed are the flexible they will not
 
00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
be broken so we will uh adhere to that
 
00:40:52.829 --> 00:40:52.839 align:start position:0%
motto and um we will be flexible and
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
we'll recess until 10 minutes before two
 
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
and they'll reconvene and begin to hear
 
00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
Mr Richard's testimony and that'll allow
 
00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
me also an opportunity to speak with Mr
 
00:41:05.069 --> 00:41:05.079 align:start position:0%
Allen so thank you very much we'll be
 
00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:56.230 align:start position:0%

00:58:07.029 --> 00:58:07.039 align:start position:0%
here to talk about today the election
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
issues before us today should remain
 
00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:11.720 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan as they are as they affect
 
00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
all of us full disclosure I'm a
 
00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
registered Republican and I vote
 
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:18.839 align:start position:0%
Republican unfortunately all the named
 
00:58:21.950 --> 00:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
defendants in my case are Republicans
 
00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:23.640 align:start position:0%
because they fail to obey their Oath by
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
refusing to follow the Constitution the
 
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
this does not make me very popular with
 
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
the Republican
 
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
party uh of the past the sad reality is
 
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
everyone in government this is important
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
everyone in government today did not
 
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
create the problems we're here to
 
00:58:41.789 --> 00:58:41.799 align:start position:0%
discuss but rather We inherited these
 
00:58:44.309 --> 00:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
election changes by Design when all the
 
00:58:47.549 --> 00:58:47.559 align:start position:0%
previous election laws were codified 46
 
00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:48.760 align:start position:0%
years ago in
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
1979 under the previous Secretary of
 
00:58:55.829 --> 00:58:55.839 align:start position:0%
State Bill Gardner the ACT codified 195
 
00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
years years of new H New Hampshire
 
00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:00.760 align:start position:0%
election law by a single act and is now
 
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
our current election statutes that's how
 
00:59:04.430 --> 00:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
they all came to be along with other
 
00:59:07.510 --> 00:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
changes since that's a huge load that
 
00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
they took upon themselves think about it
 
00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:13.559 align:start position:0%
to consolidate 195 years all in one act
 
00:59:17.069 --> 00:59:17.079 align:start position:0%
and so that was 436 colon one was the
 
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
act and I have copies as part of these
 
00:59:21.190 --> 00:59:21.200 align:start position:0%
part of the records I've given
 
00:59:25.230 --> 00:59:25.240 align:start position:0%
everyone and so um it's impossible for
 
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
anyone to be perfect so the fact that
 
00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
there are uh um issues that W properly
 
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
sorted out when the recodification
 
00:59:37.630 --> 00:59:37.640 align:start position:0%
happened is is not a huge problem uh in
 
00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:39.839 align:start position:0%
this respect one of the Geniuses of our
 
00:59:41.829 --> 00:59:41.839 align:start position:0%
state constitution is the ability to
 
00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:44.200 align:start position:0%
alter the document and they found that
 
00:59:47.230 --> 00:59:47.240 align:start position:0%
out very early in our history in 1776
 
00:59:49.150 --> 00:59:49.160 align:start position:0%
where that was what was wrong with our
 
00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
January 1776 Constitution there was no
 
00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
way to amend the document but they would
 
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
go on to draft the one that we had have
 
00:59:58.029 --> 00:59:58.039 align:start position:0%
today after three constitutional
 
01:00:00.349 --> 01:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
conventions and so the one we work with
 
01:00:03.349 --> 01:00:03.359 align:start position:0%
today of 1784 has been amended ever
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
since and
 
01:00:09.549 --> 01:00:09.559 align:start position:0%
um the uh in my case for those of you
 
01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:11.480 align:start position:0%
who don't know um I currently have a
 
01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
case that has went all the way to the
 
01:00:14.589 --> 01:00:14.599 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court on Election law it's been
 
01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
remanded to the trial court I'll expound
 
01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:19.640 align:start position:0%
on that in in in a lot of specificity
 
01:00:21.309 --> 01:00:21.319 align:start position:0%
because it had deals specifically with
 
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
the affidavit questions that I raised
 
01:00:26.069 --> 01:00:26.079 align:start position:0%
when I testified last time and I looked
 
01:00:30.109 --> 01:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
to clarify them today um the the issue
 
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
is as I said the problem isn't that uh
 
01:00:37.789 --> 01:00:37.799 align:start position:0%
that they C that the people that I filed
 
01:00:40.349 --> 01:00:40.359 align:start position:0%
suit against were they didn't physically
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
cause the problems it's the cover up
 
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
it's the refusal to address the issue I
 
01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
did in fact use the constitutional right
 
01:00:48.990 --> 01:00:49.000 align:start position:0%
to redress our grievances by
 
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
remonstrance by giving everyone involved
 
01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
notice from the Secretary of State to
 
01:00:55.549 --> 01:00:55.559 align:start position:0%
the governor to the attorney general to
 
01:00:57.789 --> 01:00:57.799 align:start position:0%
my local municipality everyone had
 
01:01:00.309 --> 01:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
notice and they chose rather than
 
01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
address any of the issues they I had no
 
01:01:04.589 --> 01:01:04.599 align:start position:0%
choice but to go down through the legal
 
01:01:07.589 --> 01:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
process so that it's been entertaining
 
01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
to say the
 
01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:11.750 align:start position:0%
to say the
least

01:01:11.750 --> 01:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
least
 
01:01:14.430 --> 01:01:14.440 align:start position:0%
uh needless to say today I'm very
 
01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
pleased to finally have an opportunity
 
01:01:18.349 --> 01:01:18.359 align:start position:0%
before this committee to address these
 
01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:21.640 align:start position:0%
issues so thank you again my background
 
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
I was born outside of the United States
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
200 miles from here in Canada my parent
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
parents applied for and were granted
 
01:01:30.029 --> 01:01:30.039 align:start position:0%
visas thereby establishing their legal
 
01:01:33.069 --> 01:01:33.079 align:start position:0%
status as lawful resident alien which
 
01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
allowed my parents to reside permanently
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire as a permanent resident
 
01:01:39.990 --> 01:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
legal alien a green card holder this
 
01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:42.920 align:start position:0%
will become important as we try to us
 
01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
deal with these issues of defining who a
 
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
qualified voter is and I think my
 
01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:49.480 align:start position:0%
personal experience will expound upon
 
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
that I was naturalized in 1981 at the
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County Superior Court in
 
01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
Manchester under state and federal
 
01:01:58.029 --> 01:01:58.039 align:start position:0%
immigration laws which run parallel to
 
01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
each other under state and federal
 
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction my naturalization
 
01:02:04.109 --> 01:02:04.119 align:start position:0%
certificate defines me as a citizen of
 
01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
the United States of America which also
 
01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
establishes my legal status as a citizen
 
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire as defined
 
01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
by section one of the 14th Amendment of
 
01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
the US
 
01:02:15.789 --> 01:02:15.799 align:start position:0%
Constitution professionally I I I've
 
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
been a professional dog police dog
 
01:02:19.710 --> 01:02:19.720 align:start position:0%
trainer and the former can9 manager for
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
the United States Department of energy I
 
01:02:24.069 --> 01:02:24.079 align:start position:0%
had 10 bomb dogs under my command and it
 
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
was that background that first I first
 
01:02:29.910 --> 01:02:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh cut my teeth on learning law I didn't
 
01:02:32.069 --> 01:02:32.079 align:start position:0%
go to law school but because of the
 
01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
training agencies I had to learn all
 
01:02:36.029 --> 01:02:36.039 align:start position:0%
their rules their regulations local
 
01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
ordinances and statutes whether it be
 
01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
local County state or federal agencies
 
01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
so that's where my um the beginning of
 
01:02:47.109 --> 01:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
my interest began from the from a from a
 
01:02:53.710 --> 01:02:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:56.029 --> 01:02:56.039 align:start position:0%
um I've always had an interest in
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
American history as a hobby I've spent
 
01:03:00.069 --> 01:03:00.079 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years of my constitutional
 
01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
studies focused on the New Hampshire
 
01:03:04.309 --> 01:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
State history of our state constitution
 
01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:07.160 align:start position:0%
and the form of government created by it
 
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
I've read all of the New Hampshire
 
01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
election laws going back to
 
01:03:13.829 --> 01:03:13.839 align:start position:0%
1775 and most importantly how the state
 
01:03:15.390 --> 01:03:15.400 align:start position:0%
and federal Constitution and the
 
01:03:17.990 --> 01:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
statutes written pursuant thereof work
 
01:03:19.950 --> 01:03:19.960 align:start position:0%
together on the issues of voting and
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
immigration both relevant to our
 
01:03:25.230 --> 01:03:25.240 align:start position:0%
election laws several years ago I was in
 
01:03:27.309 --> 01:03:27.319 align:start position:0%
Bill Garden office and former Secretary
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
of State paid me a very very high
 
01:03:31.549 --> 01:03:31.559 align:start position:0%
compliment in a meeting in his office
 
01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:33.160 align:start position:0%
with several members of the legislature
 
01:03:34.589 --> 01:03:34.599 align:start position:0%
when he told the representatives in
 
01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
attendance that he believed that I knew
 
01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
more about our Constitution and our
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
election laws than the lawyers and
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
judges in the state and I was profoundly
 
01:03:45.870 --> 01:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
taken back by that and it led to his
 
01:03:48.309 --> 01:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
invitation to teach a constitutional Law
 
01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:51.400 align:start position:0%
class to his entire legal staff uh cour
 
01:03:55.029 --> 01:03:55.039 align:start position:0%
including Bud Fitch um uh many members
 
01:03:56.349 --> 01:03:56.359 align:start position:0%
of the House of rep representatives were
 
01:03:57.910 --> 01:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
in attendance I filmed the whole thing
 
01:03:59.950 --> 01:03:59.960 align:start position:0%
I'd be glad to do it again if anyone is
 
01:04:02.109 --> 01:04:02.119 align:start position:0%
has the interest but what I did is I
 
01:04:04.269 --> 01:04:04.279 align:start position:0%
walked everyone through knowing the
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
beginning real what a real important
 
01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
part of understanding how to fix
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
legislation that is being looked at for
 
01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
revision is to understand where we came
 
01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
from this is the tool the courts use
 
01:04:19.069 --> 01:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
right the state supreme court uses the
 
01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
same instrument which is judicial
 
01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:23.480 align:start position:0%
scrutiny is always based on what did the
 
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
founding fathers say and do at the time
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
and recently the US Supreme Court has
 
01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
reaffirmed that and we'll talk about
 
01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:33.279 align:start position:0%
that later on as to how those recent
 
01:04:35.309 --> 01:04:35.319 align:start position:0%
precedents are now going to change the
 
01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:42.190 --> 01:04:42.200 align:start position:0%
legislation I've argued two cases before
 
01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court the
 
01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:45.559 align:start position:0%
first case being the right to petition
 
01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:47.240 align:start position:0%
or remonstrate before the legislature
 
01:04:49.109 --> 01:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
for redress grievances which I alluded
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
to earlier and the second case of course
 
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
was is been remanded back to the trial
 
01:04:56.349 --> 01:04:56.359 align:start position:0%
court after establishing standing before
 
01:04:59.150 --> 01:04:59.160 align:start position:0%
the state supreme court I've listed the
 
01:05:01.109 --> 01:05:01.119 align:start position:0%
video link from the State website if you
 
01:05:02.990 --> 01:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
care to see it it's those are the links
 
01:05:04.589 --> 01:05:04.599 align:start position:0%
that would take you there from
 
01:05:08.309 --> 01:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:11.109 --> 01:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
2023 proposed election legislation now
 
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
before the election law committee I'm
 
01:05:14.789 --> 01:05:14.799 align:start position:0%
here to share with you the importance of
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
the historical and legal definitions of
 
01:05:18.589 --> 01:05:18.599 align:start position:0%
both voting rights and Naturalization
 
01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
laws of the State of New Hampshire the
 
01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
following is the foundation or standard
 
01:05:24.829 --> 01:05:24.839 align:start position:0%
of review that I will use to render my
 
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
opinions about any election or
 
01:05:28.589 --> 01:05:28.599 align:start position:0%
naturalization questions you may pose to
 
01:05:31.269 --> 01:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
me any of my opinions prop of the
 
01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:33.240 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation will be mindful of
 
01:05:36.510 --> 01:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
an important fact that all legislation
 
01:05:38.029 --> 01:05:38.039 align:start position:0%
must be written
 
01:05:41.269 --> 01:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
pursuant uh excuse me I lost my way my
 
01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
opinions will be based uh on proposed
 
01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
fixes to legislation must be written and
 
01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:48.200 align:start position:0%
they must survive judicial scrutiny
 
01:05:50.470 --> 01:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
anyone who's been involved in litigation
 
01:05:51.950 --> 01:05:51.960 align:start position:0%
um I know sometimes when I hear the
 
01:05:53.789 --> 01:05:53.799 align:start position:0%
attorneys come testify about proposed
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
legislation they'll always give that
 
01:05:58.349 --> 01:05:58.359 align:start position:0%
that cautionary note that in the end
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
you're likely to have some type of legal
 
01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:02.799 align:start position:0%
challenge so it's important to go ahead
 
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
and make sure that you're mindful of
 
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
these things and that's what I want to
 
01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
cover with you today what are those
 
01:06:11.069 --> 01:06:11.079 align:start position:0%
constitutional or statutory issues that
 
01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:14.920 align:start position:0%
are going to hinder a possibly good idea
 
01:06:17.470 --> 01:06:17.480 align:start position:0%
that has conflicting statutes and that's
 
01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
where I thought I'd be of great help to
 
01:06:22.349 --> 01:06:22.359 align:start position:0%
the committee here today so um the the
 
01:06:24.589 --> 01:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
big part of this too is that uh and
 
01:06:25.950 --> 01:06:25.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to get into this is Article
 
01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
90 and that is that retrospect uh
 
01:06:30.789 --> 01:06:30.799 align:start position:0%
Article 90 which is that all proposed
 
01:06:33.549 --> 01:06:33.559 align:start position:0%
changes to our statutes must be done so
 
01:06:36.589 --> 01:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
in harmony with our state and federal
 
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
Constitution uh whether the election
 
01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
laws in the past or the immigration laws
 
01:06:43.589 --> 01:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
were changed by mistake or design should
 
01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
not affect this committee's ability to
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
recommend solutions to the legislature
 
01:06:50.309 --> 01:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
which is still constitutionally
 
01:06:53.029 --> 01:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
authorized to fix these issues part one
 
01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
article 29 leaves to the legisl the
 
01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
responsibility to suspend the laws or to
 
01:07:01.269 --> 01:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
make the laws and no other and so that's
 
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
really important so you are statute
 
01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
constitutionally authorized to make
 
01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:05.710 align:start position:0%
constitutionally authorized to make
these

01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
fixes the next
 
01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:09.750 align:start position:0%
fixes the next
part

01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:07:12.789 --> 01:07:12.799 align:start position:0%
uh because whatever the legisl whatever
 
01:07:14.829 --> 01:07:14.839 align:start position:0%
the legislative solution is it must
 
01:07:16.829 --> 01:07:16.839 align:start position:0%
still be in harmony with part two
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
Article 90 of the Constitution of New
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which requires that the common
 
01:07:24.190 --> 01:07:24.200 align:start position:0%
law which was in effect prior to the
 
01:07:26.349 --> 01:07:26.359 align:start position:0%
adaptation of any new new proposed
 
01:07:29.230 --> 01:07:29.240 align:start position:0%
legislation must be in harmony the
 
01:07:32.069 --> 01:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
backstory to Article 90 is that when New
 
01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was settled after the
 
01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
Mayflower Compact and the first settlers
 
01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:38.799 align:start position:0%
landed here we had nearly 150 years of
 
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
occupancy till the Revolution and so
 
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
when they wrote the new Constitution
 
01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
that we're working with today they had
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
to figure out G which of the Old Law of
 
01:07:50.990 --> 01:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
the Old English common law that's
 
01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
practiced here in America what are we
 
01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
going to keep and what are we going to
 
01:07:57.069 --> 01:07:57.079 align:start position:0%
push away and of course all the things
 
01:07:58.990 --> 01:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
that they didn't like that came from the
 
01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:01.240 align:start position:0%
King they were going to dismiss it so
 
01:08:04.589 --> 01:08:04.599 align:start position:0%
Article 90 says very clearly all laws
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
which have heret for been adopted used
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
and approved in the province Colony or
 
01:08:12.510 --> 01:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and usually
 
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
practice on in the courts of law this is
 
01:08:17.709 --> 01:08:17.719 align:start position:0%
the key shall remain and be in full
 
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
force so when you're dealing with this
 
01:08:22.110 --> 01:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
in my opinion when you're dealing with a
 
01:08:26.309 --> 01:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
statute that has um that is is going to
 
01:08:29.149 --> 01:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
radically change the past you need to
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
make sure that it isn't going to cause
 
01:08:34.349 --> 01:08:34.359 align:start position:0%
conflict with the other con consisting
 
01:08:35.470 --> 01:08:35.480 align:start position:0%
or the other provisions of the
 
01:08:38.349 --> 01:08:38.359 align:start position:0%
Constitution and or relevant statutes
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
and then it goes on to say that again
 
01:08:43.309 --> 01:08:43.319 align:start position:0%
the legislature can in fact make those
 
01:08:46.070 --> 01:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
changes until altered or repealed by the
 
01:08:48.749 --> 01:08:48.759 align:start position:0%
legislature and then the caveat such
 
01:08:50.910 --> 01:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
Parts thereof only accepted as our
 
01:08:52.669 --> 01:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
repugnant to the rights and Liberties
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
contained in this constitution so new
 
01:08:58.709 --> 01:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
new legislation that fixes or attempts
 
01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
to fix the past must still be in harmony
 
01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
with the Constitution and this is where
 
01:09:06.189 --> 01:09:06.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of these things I've discovered
 
01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:07.640 align:start position:0%
about the
 
01:09:10.709 --> 01:09:10.719 align:start position:0%
1979 recodification of our election laws
 
01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:13.759 align:start position:0%
as I said is there are some mistakes
 
01:09:15.789 --> 01:09:15.799 align:start position:0%
there whether you know doesn't matter
 
01:09:18.030 --> 01:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
why they're there they're simply there
 
01:09:21.149 --> 01:09:21.159 align:start position:0%
and uh a lot a lot a lot of this has to
 
01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
do with the fact that our Civics
 
01:09:25.470 --> 01:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
curriculum is quite lacking in the state
 
01:09:27.269 --> 01:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
now we're no longer teaching State the
 
01:09:28.749 --> 01:09:28.759 align:start position:0%
state constitution in our Civics
 
01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:30.400 align:start position:0%
curriculum there's no longer that
 
01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
mandate only that they students only
 
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
have to take a federal naturalization
 
01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
examination as part of their passing
 
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
their school curriculum and I think that
 
01:09:43.709 --> 01:09:43.719 align:start position:0%
that affects uh the lawmaking process
 
01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes in a negative way because when
 
01:09:49.709 --> 01:09:49.719 align:start position:0%
as some people have publicly stated some
 
01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
some reps have publicly stated that it's
 
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
not my job to know whether the proposed
 
01:09:56.270 --> 01:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
legislation is constitutional it's for
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
the courts to figure out I would
 
01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:00.640 align:start position:0%
vehemently disagree with that I know
 
01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
that I believe that I should say I
 
01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
believe house the current house rules
 
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
govern that every Vice chair of every
 
01:10:12.149 --> 01:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
committee is supposed to know or make
 
01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:14.679 align:start position:0%
sure that any proposed legislation in
 
01:10:17.470 --> 01:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
his committee can only move forward if
 
01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
in fact it's
 
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional yeah yes uh thank you Mr
 
01:10:24.350 --> 01:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
Rich want to confirm that that is
 
01:10:26.830 --> 01:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
actually uh correct that um that is a
 
01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
rule that we have and um you're
 
01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct every Vice chairman
 
01:10:35.229 --> 01:10:35.239 align:start position:0%
of every uh standing committee is um
 
01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
supposed to do that as part of their
 
01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
rules so uh thank you I also gave you a
 
01:10:40.830 --> 01:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
chance to get a drink of water there no
 
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you reading the
 
01:10:48.030 --> 01:10:48.040 align:start position:0%
room um so anyway that's Article 90 now
 
01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
Article 90 goes on to say that it um
 
01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
when compared to the 23rd article in the
 
01:10:57.270 --> 01:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights shall be cons shall be
 
01:10:59.950 --> 01:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
construed to affect the laws already
 
01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
made respecting persons and Estates in
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
other words you can't pass retrospective
 
01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
laws that's a big deal so that 90 and 23
 
01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
work together and by the way most of the
 
01:11:13.229 --> 01:11:13.239 align:start position:0%
Constitution there's a lot of synergy
 
01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
and Harmony in the document part one was
 
01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
was created on purpose the Bill of
 
01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
Rights is first for a reason there is 38
 
01:11:23.310 --> 01:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
in the original text more now with
 
01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
additional amendments and changes but 38
 
01:11:27.870 --> 01:11:27.880 align:start position:0%
in the original in part two the form of
 
01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
government in my opinion was written and
 
01:11:32.590 --> 01:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
in the courts have reaffirmed this was
 
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
written specifically to protect part one
 
01:11:37.590 --> 01:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
that's why it exists so unlike the US
 
01:11:40.149 --> 01:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights which is backwards the US
 
01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
Constitution was written and then the
 
01:11:44.510 --> 01:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
states half of the states that
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
considered the adaptation of the US
 
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution wrote what we ultimately
 
01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
know today is the Bill of Rights New
 
01:11:53.629 --> 01:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specifically had 12 it had 12
 
01:11:55.149 --> 01:11:55.159 align:start position:0%
Provisions that said hey if we're going
 
01:11:57.310 --> 01:11:57.320 align:start position:0%
to to adopt this new document we want to
 
01:12:00.189 --> 01:12:00.199 align:start position:0%
go ahead and and and and and follow that
 
01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:04.760 align:start position:0%
course but anyway moving on from there
 
01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:06.070 align:start position:0%
course but anyway moving on from there
affidavit

01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
affidavit
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
issue let's get to the affidavit issue I
 
01:12:13.229 --> 01:12:13.239 align:start position:0%
want to begin by uh pointing out um some
 
01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:15.880 align:start position:0%
misleading testimony a few weeks ago and
 
01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
I've known secretary scanland for a long
 
01:12:21.790 --> 01:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
time and I was disappointed um to to to
 
01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
hear these things but they need to be
 
01:12:25.950 --> 01:12:25.960 align:start position:0%
addressed and a few weeks ago as you
 
01:12:28.030 --> 01:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
well know we were here discussing House
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
Bill through the full committee on house
 
01:12:34.709 --> 01:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
bill FN 608 or I'm sorry backwards HB
 
01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:38.239 align:start position:0%
608 FN and that bill is being proposed
 
01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
to address a conflict with the
 
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the word affidavit uh
 
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
representative Lane asked a brilliant
 
01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
question I wanted to LEAP up and hug her
 
01:12:50.669 --> 01:12:50.679 align:start position:0%
and get her some roses because she asked
 
01:12:52.629 --> 01:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
the million dooll question right I've
 
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
been trying to get the state government
 
01:12:56.910 --> 01:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
to answer that question what do you
 
01:13:00.149 --> 01:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
consider a properly executed affidavit
 
01:13:02.430 --> 01:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
and the sad reality is is that the attor
 
01:13:05.189 --> 01:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State withheld some
 
01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
Vital Information and that Vital
 
01:13:09.669 --> 01:13:09.679 align:start position:0%
Information is part of this package that
 
01:13:12.870 --> 01:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
I'll get to it the election procedure
 
01:13:16.030 --> 01:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
manual is different than law it says on
 
01:13:19.390 --> 01:13:19.400 align:start position:0%
page four that this is not law and on
 
01:13:27.550 --> 01:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:28.669 --> 01:13:28.679 align:start position:0%
on page
 
01:13:31.709 --> 01:13:31.719 align:start position:0%
154 this is what he left out in his
 
01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:34.120 align:start position:0%
testimony determining if a voter
 
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
properly executed by the way there is an
 
01:13:39.550 --> 01:13:39.560 align:start position:0%
existing statute that was on the books
 
01:13:42.149 --> 01:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
when all of this happened last fall
 
01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
1569 that the chair of the of the big
 
01:13:49.470 --> 01:13:49.480 align:start position:0%
committee passed made a passed the law
 
01:13:53.229 --> 01:13:53.239 align:start position:0%
that says no exemptions on voter ID the
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
problem when they did that is that they
 
01:13:57.629 --> 01:13:57.639 align:start position:0%
actually passed a retrospective law they
 
01:13:57.639 --> 01:13:58.830 align:start position:0%
actually passed a retrospective law they
repealed

01:13:58.830 --> 01:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
6593 which is the statutory definition
 
01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
of an affidavit and so it says clearly
 
01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
there that in the 12 Provisions that the
 
01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
legislature has established for an
 
01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
affidavit to be executed it says that
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
they must all be done under the
 
01:14:17.270 --> 01:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
traditional Norm right the word is 500
 
01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:19.400 align:start position:0%
years old the courts have been using it
 
01:14:21.709 --> 01:14:21.719 align:start position:0%
and still use it you can't have an
 
01:14:23.790 --> 01:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
admission if you're going to change it
 
01:14:25.709 --> 01:14:25.719 align:start position:0%
that'd be one thing but they did
 
01:14:28.590 --> 01:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
upon finding the defect as secretary
 
01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
scanland gets to in his testimony they
 
01:14:33.310 --> 01:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
didn't fix or suggest that we fix the
 
01:14:36.189 --> 01:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
problem they fixed it in the manual and
 
01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
here it is determining if a voter
 
01:14:41.390 --> 01:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
properly executed the affidavit envelope
 
01:14:45.070 --> 01:14:45.080 align:start position:0%
an affidavit is properly executed if a
 
01:14:47.070 --> 01:14:47.080 align:start position:0%
the voter has completed the affidavit
 
01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
and signed it with a legible signature
 
01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballot affidavit envelope
 
01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
was amended by House Bill 555 and Now
 
01:14:57.070 --> 01:14:57.080 align:start position:0%
does not require the voter to Mark the
 
01:14:59.470 --> 01:14:59.480 align:start position:0%
specific circumstances that permits the
 
01:15:01.950 --> 01:15:01.960 align:start position:0%
use of an absentee ballot the voter
 
01:15:04.189 --> 01:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
signs the affidavit which states one of
 
01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
the following applies with me that's a
 
01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
now before we go any further if we're
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
going to if the legislature chooses to
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
reduce and change an affidavit to a uh
 
01:15:18.910 --> 01:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
an unsworn
 
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
declaration right you at least need to
 
01:15:23.550 --> 01:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
tell the moderator why it is you're
 
01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
claiming to vote absentee
 
01:15:28.189 --> 01:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
representative Lane is moving uh a cacr
 
01:15:30.830 --> 01:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
to kind of go to to eliminate this issue
 
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
from a different perspective and but the
 
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
way the law reads today uh how can you
 
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
even claim that that's in fact uh
 
01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
permissible right to say well gee and
 
01:15:43.629 --> 01:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
that's part of my lawsuit which says
 
01:15:46.149 --> 01:15:46.159 align:start position:0%
look you can't put seven excuses on the
 
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
envelope and say and not declare which
 
01:15:51.709 --> 01:15:51.719 align:start position:0%
of them applies to me never mind there's
 
01:15:52.910 --> 01:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
no eyewitness and there's no
 
01:15:55.310 --> 01:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
notarization no chain of custody on this
 
01:15:58.110 --> 01:15:58.120 align:start position:0%
and this is a big problem B the
 
01:16:00.669 --> 01:16:00.679 align:start position:0%
affidavit is signed with an illegible
 
01:16:02.590 --> 01:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
signature you must assume it's the
 
01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
voter's name think about that
 
01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
no that that's not a sworn affidavit be
 
01:16:12.669 --> 01:16:12.679 align:start position:0%
so C again you have to assume that the
 
01:16:14.550 --> 01:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
person's disabled if you can't read
 
01:16:17.310 --> 01:16:17.320 align:start position:0%
their signature and and see the one
 
01:16:18.510 --> 01:16:18.520 align:start position:0%
that's really
 
01:16:21.149 --> 01:16:21.159 align:start position:0%
bad there's no voter signature on the
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
affidavit envelope but there is a name
 
01:16:25.870 --> 01:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
and a signature of the person assisting
 
01:16:28.669 --> 01:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
the voter you must assume the voter has
 
01:16:30.990 --> 01:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
a disability it prevents the voter from
 
01:16:33.830 --> 01:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
signing his or her name in other words
 
01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:36.159 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballots that are submitted
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
to your moderators for disabled people
 
01:16:41.229 --> 01:16:41.239 align:start position:0%
we don't even know who they are because
 
01:16:43.229 --> 01:16:43.239 align:start position:0%
their name isn't even on the envelope
 
01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
there's no provision for any there's no
 
01:16:47.070 --> 01:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
space on that envelope I have a copy
 
01:16:50.110 --> 01:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
amongst this all of this to to figure
 
01:16:52.990 --> 01:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
that out it's not even there so this is
 
01:16:56.110 --> 01:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
a a huge problem uh uh thank you Mr
 
01:16:59.390 --> 01:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
Richard let me uh let me just uh inter
 
01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
inter ask a question just a moment just
 
01:17:04.350 --> 01:17:04.360 align:start position:0%
to confirm um we know exactly where
 
01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
you're reading from that that is the 20
 
01:17:10.110 --> 01:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
24 the current version with the pretty
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
purple cover to it and that's the
 
01:17:14.709 --> 01:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
election law manual and you're reading
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
page 154 duties of the
 
01:17:20.189 --> 01:17:20.199 align:start position:0%
moderators duties of the moderators and
 
01:17:23.629 --> 01:17:23.639 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:17:25.950 --> 01:17:25.960 align:start position:0%
uh and it's
 
01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:28.189 align:start position:0%
uh and it's
your

01:17:28.189 --> 01:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:17:32.270 --> 01:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
um premise or assertion I don't mean to
 
01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
imply any uh thing in there but that uh
 
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:39.760 align:start position:0%
secretary the Secretary of State's
 
01:17:42.189 --> 01:17:42.199 align:start position:0%
office through the election law manual
 
01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
attempt attempted
 
01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:47.189 align:start position:0%
attempt attempted
to

01:17:47.189 --> 01:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
um oh wait no that would not have been
 
01:17:54.430 --> 01:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
uh 1569 would not have been in place no
 
01:17:58.229 --> 01:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
until correct so
 
01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
so that is so the election law manual is
 
01:18:03.229 --> 01:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
not reflective of
 
01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
1569 well my issue with the election
 
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
procedure manual is simple the
 
01:18:10.110 --> 01:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
legislature makes the law they don't
 
01:18:11.790 --> 01:18:11.800 align:start position:0%
that's what I left that's what I teed
 
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
off for this for the secretary in his
 
01:18:16.229 --> 01:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
testimony was I said look the
 
01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
legislature makes the law Secretary of
 
01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
State can't make law and neither can the
 
01:18:22.590 --> 01:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office and the State
 
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
of Arizona has just held their Secretary
 
01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
of State in contempt of court for the
 
01:18:30.510 --> 01:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
same issue the difference between
 
01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:33.719 align:start position:0%
Arizona's election procedure manual and
 
01:18:36.870 --> 01:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
the uh New Hampshire the only difference
 
01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:39.560 align:start position:0%
there is that they permit by Statute
 
01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
that Arizona by Arizona law that the
 
01:18:45.390 --> 01:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
manual is enforced as law because it's
 
01:18:47.470 --> 01:18:47.480 align:start position:0%
written by the legislature and not
 
01:18:49.870 --> 01:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
modified by the Secretary of State and
 
01:18:51.550 --> 01:18:51.560 align:start position:0%
that's where the Arizona Secretary of
 
01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
State got in got himself in trouble it's
 
01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
the same thing going on here
 
01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
is that seeing a defect or a difference
 
01:19:01.830 --> 01:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
of opinion they've chosen to write a
 
01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
solution as if it they have lawmaking
 
01:19:06.910 --> 01:19:06.920 align:start position:0%
power and they don't now if the
 
01:19:09.189 --> 01:19:09.199 align:start position:0%
legislature wants to do this that's for
 
01:19:11.189 --> 01:19:11.199 align:start position:0%
the legislature to decide but not for
 
01:19:12.910 --> 01:19:12.920 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State because he has no
 
01:19:15.390 --> 01:19:15.400 align:start position:0%
lawmaking power he's the secretary and
 
01:19:17.229 --> 01:19:17.239 align:start position:0%
and he reaffirmed this in his testimony
 
01:19:19.110 --> 01:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
over the printing of the election manual
 
01:19:22.149 --> 01:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
excuse me the printing of the text on
 
01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
the envelope on the absentee affid David
 
01:19:27.910 --> 01:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
envelope he said I'm powerless I don't I
 
01:19:30.030 --> 01:19:30.040 align:start position:0%
follow the law right that was his
 
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
testimony and he's testified the same
 
01:19:34.110 --> 01:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
and he's correct when he says that he
 
01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any discretionary authority
 
01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
to make law neither does the attorney
 
01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
general and I think there's a serious
 
01:19:42.990 --> 01:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
defect in in uh separation of powers
 
01:19:45.790 --> 01:19:45.800 align:start position:0%
over this issue of letting those two do
 
01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
this because again it's up to the
 
01:19:50.229 --> 01:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
legislature to do these things and
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
that's really my my disagreement with it
 
01:19:55.790 --> 01:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
is not so much the substance of this
 
01:19:59.990 --> 01:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
but so so uh again just sorry for the
 
01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
interruption just a quick question is so
 
01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
is the recent ruling on bruan and its
 
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
impact on administrative
 
01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.790 align:start position:0%
impact on administrative
rules

01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:20:14.189 --> 01:20:14.199 align:start position:0%
um is is that wrong case but that's I
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
get where you're going with that okay is
 
01:20:17.629 --> 01:20:17.639 align:start position:0%
I know where you're going the right case
 
01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
then so the the right case you'd be
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
talking about would be the more V Harper
 
01:20:25.149 --> 01:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
decision and also the uh decision last
 
01:20:27.669 --> 01:20:27.679 align:start position:0%
summer which is the NAACP of South
 
01:20:29.950 --> 01:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
Carolina versus the South Carolina
 
01:20:32.709 --> 01:20:32.719 align:start position:0%
legislature and where there is a lot
 
01:20:34.709 --> 01:20:34.719 align:start position:0%
where I found a lot of case precedent to
 
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
support my position in fed over Federal
 
01:20:40.830 --> 01:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
issues was uh all these redistricting
 
01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:42.440 align:start position:0%
fights when they end up in front of the
 
01:20:44.110 --> 01:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court they always say the same
 
01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
thing we don't have the authority we
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
can't tell the state government how to
 
01:20:50.590 --> 01:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
redistrict that's for the state
 
01:20:53.669 --> 01:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
legislature and or the federal Congress
 
01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
if you look at the part of Article 1
 
01:20:59.550 --> 01:20:59.560 align:start position:0%
Section 4 of the US Constitution Clause
 
01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
2 that if the there's a fascinating
 
01:21:03.870 --> 01:21:03.880 align:start position:0%
story I'll tell you about on that in a
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
second but that provision says that if
 
01:21:09.189 --> 01:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
the state legislature refuses to
 
01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
establish the time place and manner for
 
01:21:12.990 --> 01:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
conducting the
 
01:21:16.910 --> 01:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
elections that the federal Congress can
 
01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
and and the mor V Harper decision it
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
went further and it said we as the
 
01:21:23.189 --> 01:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court are not delegated any
 
01:21:26.030 --> 01:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
power under article 3 to do this so it
 
01:21:28.229 --> 01:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
belongs with the state legislature and
 
01:21:30.189 --> 01:21:30.199 align:start position:0%
again if they're going to fix the
 
01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
problem because the states refuse and
 
01:21:34.510 --> 01:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
that's matter of fact you find that in
 
01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
article four of New Hampshire's uh
 
01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
consent to the US Constitution the
 
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
fourth provision in that document was
 
01:21:46.430 --> 01:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
that that we will we agree to the new
 
01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
Constitution under these conditions and
 
01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
one of them was that the federal
 
01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
legislature never exercised the state
 
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
legislator's powers unless the state
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
refused to establish the time place in
 
01:22:01.030 --> 01:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
Manner and I found it fascinating that
 
01:22:03.110 --> 01:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire put that there as one of
 
01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
their conditions but that's a big piece
 
01:22:07.870 --> 01:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
of it all right uh thank you I didn't
 
01:22:11.070 --> 01:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
mean to take you too far down a side uh
 
01:22:13.110 --> 01:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
Road there but I appreciate the
 
01:22:15.629 --> 01:22:15.639 align:start position:0%
testimony about that that's that is of
 
01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
course of interest to us as well um from
 
01:22:20.990 --> 01:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
an election law perspective but uh let's
 
01:22:23.950 --> 01:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
return to um the affidavit issue that
 
01:22:25.990 --> 01:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
you were disc discussing and if you
 
01:22:28.229 --> 01:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
would continue with your testimony that
 
01:22:31.110 --> 01:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
would be uh much appreciated thank you
 
01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:42.709 align:start position:0%
would be uh much appreciated thank you
you're

01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:45.149 --> 01:22:45.159 align:start position:0%
welcome yeah I was looking back on page
 
01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
four I went too
 
01:22:50.790 --> 01:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
far okay there we go also another
 
01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
decision I I stopped where I was talking
 
01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
about Article 90 and I wanted to
 
01:22:57.950 --> 01:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
reaffirm reaffirm that from the state
 
01:23:01.030 --> 01:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
supreme court in a long time ago in a
 
01:23:02.910 --> 01:23:02.920 align:start position:0%
famous case that still stands today
 
01:23:05.510 --> 01:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
Merill versus Sherburn Merill versus
 
01:23:08.229 --> 01:23:08.239 align:start position:0%
Sherburn reaffirmed the repugnant or
 
01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
contrary Provisions in the constitution
 
01:23:12.510 --> 01:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
in three places and it when it said the
 
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
following quote that clause which
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
confers upon the general court the
 
01:23:19.149 --> 01:23:19.159 align:start position:0%
authority to make laws provides at the
 
01:23:20.590 --> 01:23:20.600 align:start position:0%
same time that they must not be
 
01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
repugnant or contrary to the
 
01:23:24.189 --> 01:23:24.199 align:start position:0%
Constitution and that's exactly what Mor
 
01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
V Harper did which was another
 
01:23:28.510 --> 01:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
redistricting case that case had to do
 
01:23:30.629 --> 01:23:30.639 align:start position:0%
with the North Carolina legislature
 
01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
spearheaded by a republican majority
 
01:23:36.510 --> 01:23:36.520 align:start position:0%
abused their power they abused their
 
01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:38.719 align:start position:0%
power and they said hey
 
01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
since since we get our power to
 
01:23:45.189 --> 01:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
redistrict federally from the federal
 
01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
elections Clause no one can tell us what
 
01:23:50.990 --> 01:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
to do and that's what took them all the
 
01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
way to the Supreme Court and the Supreme
 
01:23:53.910 --> 01:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
Court said sit down little boys and
 
01:23:55.709 --> 01:23:55.719 align:start position:0%
girls yes we are going to tell you what
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
to do and so that's where it and all of
 
01:24:01.310 --> 01:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
those cases by the way that are part of
 
01:24:03.149 --> 01:24:03.159 align:start position:0%
uh some of these additional filings I
 
01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
have for you to to read at your leisure
 
01:24:07.550 --> 01:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
uh all address the same thing they're
 
01:24:11.430 --> 01:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
all about that the state lawmaking power
 
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
must always follow the State
 
01:24:15.149 --> 01:24:15.159 align:start position:0%
Constitution and it can't delegate its
 
01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
Authority I'm not going to get into the
 
01:24:18.870 --> 01:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
ballot law commission but some of this
 
01:24:22.149 --> 01:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
case deals with that also of delegating
 
01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
lawmaking power to that body as well
 
01:24:28.750 --> 01:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
to continue here with this um what I
 
01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
wanted and I just alluded to this about
 
01:24:35.470 --> 01:24:35.480 align:start position:0%
his testimony is that he affirms the
 
01:24:37.669 --> 01:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
secretary affirmed some of my arguments
 
01:24:39.870 --> 01:24:39.880 align:start position:0%
in part some of it was misleading in
 
01:24:43.070 --> 01:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
part and some of it was flatly not very
 
01:24:45.709 --> 01:24:45.719 align:start position:0%
honest and and I wanted to make sure
 
01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
that this committee understood this and
 
01:24:50.430 --> 01:24:50.440 align:start position:0%
I I voed these concerns to cheer uh
 
01:24:54.070 --> 01:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
chair chairman Barry as well um there
 
01:24:55.950 --> 01:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
are eight relevant issues to this
 
01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
election law case regarding secretary
 
01:24:59.629 --> 01:24:59.639 align:start position:0%
scandin public testimony on the
 
01:25:03.629 --> 01:25:03.639 align:start position:0%
affidavit question a secretary SC excuse
 
01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
me secretary scandin testimony addressed
 
01:25:08.030 --> 01:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
the proposed legislative amendment to
 
01:25:10.990 --> 01:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
fix 659
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
51b and that's what house bill 608 is
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
trying to fix is to clarify the
 
01:25:19.709 --> 01:25:19.719 align:start position:0%
discrepancy between the statutory
 
01:25:21.790 --> 01:25:21.800 align:start position:0%
definition of a qu of an affidavit the
 
01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
execution of an affidavit and the
 
01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:24.719 align:start position:0%
election procedure man manual because
 
01:25:26.229 --> 01:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
we've been operating under the procedure
 
01:25:29.229 --> 01:25:29.239 align:start position:0%
manual and not following the
 
01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
law if if I may just to just to clarify
 
01:25:36.990 --> 01:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
um uh you may continue your testimony um
 
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
but just um I was notified that there
 
01:25:43.149 --> 01:25:43.159 align:start position:0%
was in fact an error in the public
 
01:25:45.669 --> 01:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
announcement of the working session
 
01:25:48.990 --> 01:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
regarding um the possibility of working
 
01:25:53.390 --> 01:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
on HB 608 that was already exec um by
 
01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
the full committee and therefore that
 
01:25:58.629 --> 01:25:58.639 align:start position:0%
will not be um handled any further by
 
01:26:01.310 --> 01:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee but if you're having
 
01:26:03.669 --> 01:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
testimony relevant to the theme as a
 
01:26:05.629 --> 01:26:05.639 align:start position:0%
whole and it in involves your
 
01:26:08.669 --> 01:26:08.679 align:start position:0%
considerations of 608 I think we can
 
01:26:10.950 --> 01:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
still hear that without any problem just
 
01:26:12.790 --> 01:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
the committee will not be working on
 
01:26:15.629 --> 01:26:15.639 align:start position:0%
that so just just um that was announced
 
01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
at the beginning um but not everyone was
 
01:26:22.629 --> 01:26:22.639 align:start position:0%
here at that time so I just want to uh
 
01:26:24.950 --> 01:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
make that announcement again and clarify
 
01:26:27.870 --> 01:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
so um thank you yeah no I bring that
 
01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
issue up only because the secretary and
 
01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
the AG's defense on this issue has been
 
01:26:37.229 --> 01:26:37.239 align:start position:0%
to look at to ignore the moderator's
 
01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
duty and focus exclusively on the voters
 
01:26:45.910 --> 01:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility how to how to properly
 
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
vote the voting process and the
 
01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
beginning of the chain of custody so
 
01:26:53.070 --> 01:26:53.080 align:start position:0%
he's complete he's now telling us that
 
01:26:55.189 --> 01:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
he's aware of the issue because in the
 
01:26:59.390 --> 01:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
court what he's doing is he's there one
 
01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that the AG isn't thrilled for
 
01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
him to have testified and now now we
 
01:27:06.270 --> 01:27:06.280 align:start position:0%
have now they're actually saying
 
01:27:08.950 --> 01:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
something about an issue that if their
 
01:27:12.070 --> 01:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
Council had the had better oversight
 
01:27:13.950 --> 01:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
they would have said don't say anything
 
01:27:16.189 --> 01:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
but they did so now there's a conflict
 
01:27:17.629 --> 01:27:17.639 align:start position:0%
between him and the Secretary of State
 
01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
on this issue and that is that uh you
 
01:27:22.189 --> 01:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
know again they're using the election
 
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
procedure manual they're not following
 
01:27:25.709 --> 01:27:25.719 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
law B on the second part of his
 
01:27:32.350 --> 01:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
testimony was just what I alluded to
 
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
6577 does not contain the language
 
01:27:38.070 --> 01:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
directing the SOS to print the notary
 
01:27:40.550 --> 01:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
certificate on the return envelope and
 
01:27:43.870 --> 01:27:43.880 align:start position:0%
that's what his testimony then and what
 
01:27:47.350 --> 01:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
I brought with me today are the the the
 
01:27:49.750 --> 01:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
historical Journey from
 
01:27:53.229 --> 01:27:53.239 align:start position:0%
1942 up till current and we'll cover
 
01:27:55.270 --> 01:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
that when we get there
 
01:27:57.990 --> 01:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh just to uh U not to spoil your
 
01:28:01.470 --> 01:28:01.480 align:start position:0%
punchline but um Ju Just In in two
 
01:28:06.030 --> 01:28:06.040 align:start position:0%
summaries H uh had it been there before
 
01:28:09.870 --> 01:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
and and it has been since removed is
 
01:28:11.950 --> 01:28:11.960 align:start position:0%
that what exactly that's exactly right
 
01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
so the process was in effect from 1942
 
01:28:17.390 --> 01:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
and I have a copy of that Amendment from
 
01:28:19.149 --> 01:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
1942 to
 
01:28:22.629 --> 01:28:22.639 align:start position:0%
1979 and uh that's exactly right it was
 
01:28:24.990 --> 01:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
there before and they they kept the word
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
the same so the envelope that had a
 
01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
notary certificate and that process was
 
01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
in place was called an affidavit
 
01:28:34.950 --> 01:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
envelope and the name stayed the same
 
01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
even though the duties of both the
 
01:28:39.229 --> 01:28:39.239 align:start position:0%
moderator and or excuse me the
 
01:28:41.070 --> 01:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
moderator's duty stayed the same but the
 
01:28:42.590 --> 01:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
voter's Duty
 
01:28:45.070 --> 01:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
changed so the voter is no longer
 
01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
statutorily bound to appear before
 
01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
anyone and and so that's been their
 
01:28:52.629 --> 01:28:52.639 align:start position:0%
legal defense is that well I only print
 
01:28:54.750 --> 01:28:54.760 align:start position:0%
the envelope the way it's instructed to
 
01:28:56.550 --> 01:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
and that says that under the current
 
01:28:58.510 --> 01:28:58.520 align:start position:0%
statutory scheme that the voter doesn't
 
01:28:59.830 --> 01:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
have to do these things and that's going
 
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
to be part of this committee's decision
 
01:29:05.109 --> 01:29:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:09.750 --> 01:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
affidavits the next piece on this um he
 
01:29:12.149 --> 01:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
secretary scandin also reaffirmed my
 
01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
testimony on the all this historical
 
01:29:16.750 --> 01:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
thing he broke it down very well and I
 
01:29:19.229 --> 01:29:19.239 align:start position:0%
have a copy part of my testimony that
 
01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
I've got here is the transcript of that
 
01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
I did my own transcript as best I could
 
01:29:28.390 --> 01:29:28.400 align:start position:0%
um he also reaffirmed that uh the state
 
01:29:31.870 --> 01:29:31.880 align:start position:0%
election laws were in fact recodified in
 
01:29:34.830 --> 01:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
1979 and uh the afores said changes
 
01:29:37.030 --> 01:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
included most of the election statutes
 
01:29:38.510 --> 01:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
now in question here
 
01:29:41.990 --> 01:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
today uh e that he the SOS has
 
01:29:43.830 --> 01:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
directions on the language that shall
 
01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
appear on the envelope this is true it's
 
01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
exactly correct he he follows the
 
01:29:51.070 --> 01:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
statute as it's written now there's a
 
01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:52.440 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest between the
 
01:29:55.229 --> 01:29:55.239 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State and the AGS office uh
 
01:29:56.430 --> 01:29:56.440 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry yeah Secretary of State in the
 
01:29:59.830 --> 01:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
AG's office because now he's giving
 
01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
rather than remaining silent they're now
 
01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
giving testimony on this issue and so
 
01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
that's not going to work out so well for
 
01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
them but anyway um and then of course uh
 
01:30:10.990 --> 01:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
representative Lane asked the brilliant
 
01:30:12.709 --> 01:30:12.719 align:start position:0%
question what do you consider then to be
 
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
a proper affidavit and he told us uh
 
01:30:18.189 --> 01:30:18.199 align:start position:0%
from his perspective uh secretary
 
01:30:20.229 --> 01:30:20.239 align:start position:0%
scandal's testimony is also relevant
 
01:30:21.910 --> 01:30:21.920 align:start position:0%
because of the conflicting testimony
 
01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
between the two and so next in line um
 
01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
if you follow through on bottom of page
 
01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
six is actually his testimony I would
 
01:30:32.189 --> 01:30:32.199 align:start position:0%
like to run through it briefly if that's
 
01:30:35.109 --> 01:30:35.119 align:start position:0%
okay if I could ask you just to maybe
 
01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
touch upon some highlights I I think
 
01:30:40.910 --> 01:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
again I would reiterate that um some of
 
01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
your comments early on that this was an
 
01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
inherited an inherited uh aspect that uh
 
01:30:50.229 --> 01:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
the secretary has had to deal with and
 
01:30:52.709 --> 01:30:52.719 align:start position:0%
so it's all in print here so I'll skip
 
01:30:54.990 --> 01:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
over and get to the money the money on
 
01:31:02.070 --> 01:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:04.719 align:start position:0%
end responding to representative Lane's
 
01:31:06.990 --> 01:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
question he said the following well I
 
01:31:07.990 --> 01:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
think the
 
01:31:10.669 --> 01:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
case in this case the affidavit is what
 
01:31:12.430 --> 01:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
the legislature calls
 
01:31:15.950 --> 01:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
it but sure there is a legal definition
 
01:31:17.790 --> 01:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
of what an affidavit constitutes and I
 
01:31:19.590 --> 01:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
think Mr Richard is well schooled in
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
that but I think the legislature can say
 
01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
something and mean something else
 
01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
this is a big big problem are you
 
01:31:28.870 --> 01:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
telling me that if the legislature
 
01:31:30.830 --> 01:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
writes a statute that you don't
 
01:31:33.229 --> 01:31:33.239 align:start position:0%
necessarily agree with it that you have
 
01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
somehow a discretionary authority to use
 
01:31:38.189 --> 01:31:38.199 align:start position:0%
the election procedure manual to fix the
 
01:31:40.030 --> 01:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
problem that's what's happened here and
 
01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
that's where we're going to need a
 
01:31:45.070 --> 01:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
fix I I will make a charitable note uh
 
01:31:46.750 --> 01:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
is that sometimes the
 
01:31:50.229 --> 01:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
legislature um May May in fact write
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
contradictory laws themselves because we
 
01:31:56.830 --> 01:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
are gifted in our ability to do that um
 
01:31:59.470 --> 01:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
present company accepted of course and
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
so um I I will um I will give the
 
01:32:06.629 --> 01:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
benefit of Doubt to all parties involved
 
01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
as much as I can um but
 
01:32:13.510 --> 01:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
um uh so thank you for the clarification
 
01:32:16.350 --> 01:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that please please continue
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
um I know you
 
01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:19.390 align:start position:0%
um I know you
have

01:32:19.390 --> 01:32:19.400 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
um 17 pages of testimony so I don't I
 
01:32:25.510 --> 01:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
don't want you to miss any you put it
 
01:32:28.590 --> 01:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
all down I did I I did ask that in my
 
01:32:32.430 --> 01:32:32.440 align:start position:0%
email and at at at the bequest of my
 
01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
bipartisan requesters of your presence
 
01:32:38.229 --> 01:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
here so I I acknowledge my failings in
 
01:32:40.310 --> 01:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
in saying something like keep it to
 
01:32:43.350 --> 01:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
eight pages but having um since you have
 
01:32:45.870 --> 01:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
been done so well to put this all I
 
01:32:47.629 --> 01:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
guarantee you we are all readers here on
 
01:32:49.229 --> 01:32:49.239 align:start position:0%
this subcommittee this will not go
 
01:32:52.109 --> 01:32:52.119 align:start position:0%
unread awesome I want you to know that
 
01:32:54.830 --> 01:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:32:58.470 --> 01:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
but uh may I may I suggest that uh you
 
01:33:01.229 --> 01:33:01.239 align:start position:0%
continue to go through
 
01:33:07.189 --> 01:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:09.310 --> 01:33:09.320 align:start position:0%
here uh do you think you could be
 
01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
finished I can speak three or 3:15 I
 
01:33:14.310 --> 01:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
think I can be done by 3:15
 
01:33:17.950 --> 01:33:17.960 align:start position:0%
okay yes oh please anytime yes um thank
 
01:33:21.470 --> 01:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
you and um
 
01:33:24.270 --> 01:33:24.280 align:start position:0%
so can the legislature
 
01:33:27.149 --> 01:33:27.159 align:start position:0%
decide what an affidavit is if it chose
 
01:33:30.270 --> 01:33:30.280 align:start position:0%
to do so I believe it could because it
 
01:33:32.590 --> 01:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
is the ultimate law all that power is
 
01:33:35.189 --> 01:33:35.199 align:start position:0%
delegated to that body for that purpose
 
01:33:36.510 --> 01:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
and so I think that's what secretary
 
01:33:38.990 --> 01:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
scanland was saying is that that the
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
legislature defines the word and what
 
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
you find throughout if we use all of the
 
01:33:46.510 --> 01:33:46.520 align:start position:0%
other places in state in where
 
01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
affidavits are required and I did this
 
01:33:52.430 --> 01:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
study there's 262 places in state law
 
01:33:55.910 --> 01:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
where in specific places where there is
 
01:33:58.750 --> 01:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
a specific process required because of
 
01:34:01.470 --> 01:34:01.480 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the affidavit you'll find
 
01:34:04.070 --> 01:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
that the either the federal Congress or
 
01:34:06.149 --> 01:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
the state legislature will Define the
 
01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
parameters for that application and in
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
this case if they was going to do so
 
01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
that would be a fix the only caveat
 
01:34:15.550 --> 01:34:15.560 align:start position:0%
being as long as it's not contrary or
 
01:34:19.709 --> 01:34:19.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:23.990 --> 01:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
provision so it it doesn't necessarily
 
01:34:27.550 --> 01:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
have to be consistent does it with the
 
01:34:31.149 --> 01:34:31.159 align:start position:0%
other chapters of the law this is my
 
01:34:33.510 --> 01:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
question to you or can we Define it for
 
01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
purposes of the election law um like the
 
01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
650s all those it did 65 930 before it
 
01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
was repealed right and it was there
 
01:34:47.070 --> 01:34:47.080 align:start position:0%
before uh before the recodification
 
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
and and let me make a really important
 
01:34:51.790 --> 01:34:51.800 align:start position:0%
distinction about affidavits and and a
 
01:34:54.109 --> 01:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
lot of people that I heard testimony to
 
01:34:56.310 --> 01:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
when I testified last time were
 
01:34:58.510 --> 01:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
concerned about the burden it may place
 
01:35:00.830 --> 01:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
on the voter and they were skipping the
 
01:35:02.229 --> 01:35:02.239 align:start position:0%
all important point that I'm going to
 
01:35:04.109 --> 01:35:04.119 align:start position:0%
touch upon now with the Supreme Court
 
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
case in in my Supreme Court case and
 
01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
that is it's not just about the
 
01:35:10.270 --> 01:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
affidavit it's about the chain of
 
01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
custody and the beginning of the chain
 
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
of custody in other words if we're going
 
01:35:17.229 --> 01:35:17.239 align:start position:0%
to apply election laws equally to
 
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
everybody then the practice that was in
 
01:35:22.870 --> 01:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
place for in-person voting should apply
 
01:35:24.750 --> 01:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
equally to C he voting and that's what
 
01:35:27.229 --> 01:35:27.239 align:start position:0%
they did in 1942 that's what was in
 
01:35:29.109 --> 01:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
effect in s till
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
1979 and these changes either by
 
01:35:34.669 --> 01:35:34.679 align:start position:0%
designer mistake came to be and this is
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
why we have this dis disparity and so
 
01:35:41.390 --> 01:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
the key is that that was removed in 79
 
01:35:43.950 --> 01:35:43.960 align:start position:0%
was the following a voter upon receiving
 
01:35:46.910 --> 01:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
his absentee ballot package has a
 
01:35:49.390 --> 01:35:49.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility under the old Provisions
 
01:35:51.669 --> 01:35:51.679 align:start position:0%
to show up in front of an election law
 
01:35:53.629 --> 01:35:53.639 align:start position:0%
official that would be one of five p
 
01:35:56.189 --> 01:35:56.199 align:start position:0%
people a notary a Justice of the Peace A
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
selectman a clerk or a moderator all
 
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
five of them under the 6593 were
 
01:36:04.510 --> 01:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
authorized to act in that capacity and
 
01:36:06.550 --> 01:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
what was required was one they would
 
01:36:08.430 --> 01:36:08.440 align:start position:0%
verify that the mar ballot wasn't
 
01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
pre-marked the the super whoever is
 
01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
helping you vote absentee confirms your
 
01:36:16.109 --> 01:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
ballot isn't pre-marked then the next
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
thing they would do is uh uh you'd mark
 
01:36:21.229 --> 01:36:21.239 align:start position:0%
it in the vicinity just like we do in
 
01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
person and then you'd go into deposit
 
01:36:26.430 --> 01:36:26.440 align:start position:0%
your ballot into an envelope instead of
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
a box or a machine and there was an
 
01:36:31.790 --> 01:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
eyewitness just like it is in person so
 
01:36:35.550 --> 01:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
the the notary certificate was just the
 
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
sealing the deal right confirming that
 
01:36:40.270 --> 01:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
the process we now have a lawful chain
 
01:36:42.590 --> 01:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
of custody and everyone's being treated
 
01:36:45.229 --> 01:36:45.239 align:start position:0%
the same so that was the that that's the
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
real underlying issue it's not just
 
01:36:50.229 --> 01:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
about having it notorized it's about
 
01:36:52.990 --> 01:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
starting a lawful chain of custody and
 
01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
of course now
 
01:36:57.870 --> 01:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
659 adds an additional complication how
 
01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
are we going to now not address this
 
01:37:02.070 --> 01:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
issue because now we're going to run
 
01:37:04.390 --> 01:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
into the equal protection clause and let
 
01:37:05.870 --> 01:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
me share with you the state Supreme
 
01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
Court's decision in my case I only
 
01:37:09.390 --> 01:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
Cherry Picked the point the relevant
 
01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:10.590 align:start position:0%
Cherry Picked the point the relevant
relevant

01:37:10.590 --> 01:37:10.600 align:start position:0%
relevant
 
01:37:12.790 --> 01:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
point I line
 
01:37:16.149 --> 01:37:16.159 align:start position:0%
20 quoting this the court the plaintiff
 
01:37:17.550 --> 01:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
alleges in his complaint that the
 
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
defendants sanctioning of discretionary
 
01:37:20.950 --> 01:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
use of voting machines at the local
 
01:37:22.590 --> 01:37:22.600 align:start position:0%
level violates the equal protection
 
01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
Clause of part one article one of the
 
01:37:26.590 --> 01:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
State Constitution and the 14th
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment to the US Constitution by
 
01:37:31.910 --> 01:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
authorizing uh use of programmable open-
 
01:37:33.709 --> 01:37:33.719 align:start position:0%
Source electronic voting machines in
 
01:37:36.310 --> 01:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
town in some towns and cities or other
 
01:37:38.189 --> 01:37:38.199 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions of the state or
 
01:37:41.790 --> 01:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
not this is a big problem right when the
 
01:37:43.390 --> 01:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
statutes were passed in
 
01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:46.679 align:start position:0%
1979 they were done for a trial basis
 
01:37:49.790 --> 01:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
for a temporary trial basis and I think
 
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
this is what was going on then that that
 
01:37:53.830 --> 01:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
they didn't realize they were in erting
 
01:37:55.950 --> 01:37:55.960 align:start position:0%
a secondary problem which is this
 
01:37:59.390 --> 01:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
problem now so in order to treat
 
01:38:02.109 --> 01:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
everyone the same are we going to force
 
01:38:04.510 --> 01:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
the 103 towns in the state an unfunded
 
01:38:07.390 --> 01:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
mandate to say Hey you now have to get
 
01:38:09.709 --> 01:38:09.719 align:start position:0%
machines like everybody else or are we
 
01:38:12.270 --> 01:38:12.280 align:start position:0%
going to force the 135 towns to say you
 
01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
can't use machines until the legislature
 
01:38:16.669 --> 01:38:16.679 align:start position:0%
figures this problem out that's what
 
01:38:18.750 --> 01:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
they did in Massachusetts by the way
 
01:38:20.510 --> 01:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
because these Provisions John Adams
 
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
wrote the Massachusetts Constitution we
 
01:38:24.229 --> 01:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
used it as a temp
 
01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
and so that voting provision was the
 
01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
same and so Massachusetts to address the
 
01:38:31.189 --> 01:38:31.199 align:start position:0%
voting machine issue did in fact put it
 
01:38:34.589 --> 01:38:34.599 align:start position:0%
on a cacr and they got it approved and
 
01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
so it's uniformed throughout the state
 
01:38:38.070 --> 01:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
of Massachusetts whether you like it
 
01:38:40.470 --> 01:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
dislike it or not that's now a provision
 
01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
in their in their constitution and it's
 
01:38:44.510 --> 01:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
not here this is one of the other
 
01:38:47.470 --> 01:38:47.480 align:start position:0%
underlying issues is that we have all
 
01:38:50.870 --> 01:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
103 towns that choose not to we have 135
 
01:38:54.189 --> 01:38:54.199 align:start position:0%
to do now this really gets compounded in
 
01:38:56.669 --> 01:38:56.679 align:start position:0%
a bad bad way when we go to the next
 
01:38:59.430 --> 01:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
step with the affidavit problem I argued
 
01:39:02.229 --> 01:39:02.239 align:start position:0%
on appeal uh very
 
01:39:05.550 --> 01:39:05.560 align:start position:0%
importantly that if the moderator does
 
01:39:07.629 --> 01:39:07.639 align:start position:0%
not authenticate that the affidavit was
 
01:39:10.270 --> 01:39:10.280 align:start position:0%
properly executed under that provision
 
01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:12.990 align:start position:0%
properly executed under that provision
659

01:39:12.990 --> 01:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
659
 
01:39:16.510 --> 01:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
65950 B which is the affidavit appears
 
01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
to be properly executed and he goes
 
01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
ahead and removes it out of the envelope
 
01:39:22.950 --> 01:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
instead of disposing it as required by
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
state statute
 
01:39:28.189 --> 01:39:28.199 align:start position:0%
65953 material defective that's the
 
01:39:30.149 --> 01:39:30.159 align:start position:0%
requirement on that as far as dealing
 
01:39:33.030 --> 01:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
with an envelope that is not properly
 
01:39:35.390 --> 01:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
executed and so if you go down that
 
01:39:42.950 --> 01:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:49.750 --> 01:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:52.589 --> 01:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
I uh so you uh you were talking about
 
01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
the affid Davids in the context of the
 
01:39:58.229 --> 01:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots correct and so um and
 
01:40:02.149 --> 01:40:02.159 align:start position:0%
and pointing out the there's a section
 
01:40:05.669 --> 01:40:05.679 align:start position:0%
of the rsa's uh beginning at
 
01:40:10.030 --> 01:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
65946 and continuing on for several
 
01:40:13.350 --> 01:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
Pages uh up through 659
 
01:40:16.790 --> 01:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
55 that concern the processing of
 
01:40:19.109 --> 01:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots and so I think I was at
 
01:40:20.990 --> 01:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court I found my way okay
 
01:40:23.149 --> 01:40:23.159 align:start position:0%
great thank you I I stalled as long as I
 
01:40:25.229 --> 01:40:25.239 align:start position:0%
could that's okay so the four the four
 
01:40:27.790 --> 01:40:27.800 align:start position:0%
items the disparity in the towns using
 
01:40:30.390 --> 01:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
machines versus not and then the
 
01:40:32.229 --> 01:40:32.239 align:start position:0%
counting of unverified ballots they
 
01:40:34.470 --> 01:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
found problematic and the second issue
 
01:40:37.189 --> 01:40:37.199 align:start position:0%
is that as soon as you remove an a
 
01:40:39.550 --> 01:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
ballot from an absentee envelope that
 
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a properly executed
 
01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:42.880 align:start position:0%
affidavit you put it in a machine it
 
01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
can't be
 
01:40:46.709 --> 01:40:46.719 align:start position:0%
reconciled Hava required that all the
 
01:40:50.270 --> 01:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
states adopt a proper manner in which we
 
01:40:52.589 --> 01:40:52.599 align:start position:0%
can do proper recounts and there's
 
01:40:54.430 --> 01:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
another reason that that ballot can't be
 
01:40:56.790 --> 01:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
recounted it's not a lawful affidavit
 
01:40:58.709 --> 01:40:58.719 align:start position:0%
it's not admissible in a court of
 
01:41:02.550 --> 01:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
law so we have a secondary problem so
 
01:41:06.510 --> 01:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
you you're puzzled but go ahead ask
 
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
so um could could you uh repeat your
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
statement regarding how this violates
 
01:41:15.870 --> 01:41:15.880 align:start position:0%
Hava yes if there's no way to do a
 
01:41:18.709 --> 01:41:18.719 align:start position:0%
lawful recount because even though
 
01:41:22.229 --> 01:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots are are in some cases
 
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
of a different color they're named on
 
01:41:27.669 --> 01:41:27.679 align:start position:0%
the face as an absentee ballot the
 
01:41:29.910 --> 01:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
problem is is that if they've been
 
01:41:32.350 --> 01:41:32.360 align:start position:0%
removed from the affidavit instrument
 
01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
and put in the
 
01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
machine now there's no way to reconcile
 
01:41:39.149 --> 01:41:39.159 align:start position:0%
who is who because we don't know if
 
01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
let's say you have a th000 absentee
 
01:41:43.149 --> 01:41:43.159 align:start position:0%
ballots and you don't know which one
 
01:41:45.950 --> 01:41:45.960 align:start position:0%
some people by the way who do return
 
01:41:47.790 --> 01:41:47.800 align:start position:0%
their absentee ballots let's say you're
 
01:41:49.910 --> 01:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
you're scheduled on a trip you apply for
 
01:41:51.709 --> 01:41:51.719 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot and then you find out
 
01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
that your trip is canceled some people
 
01:41:55.470 --> 01:41:55.480 align:start position:0%
will simply take that absentee ballot go
 
01:41:57.669 --> 01:41:57.679 align:start position:0%
to the town they'll happy to check you
 
01:42:00.589 --> 01:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
in right so some of those will actually
 
01:42:03.430 --> 01:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
have a notary authentification it goes
 
01:42:06.149 --> 01:42:06.159 align:start position:0%
back to the to to the town at the local
 
01:42:08.990 --> 01:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
level for counting um
 
01:42:13.229 --> 01:42:13.239 align:start position:0%
so 103 to 135 is one unverified ballots
 
01:42:16.910 --> 01:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
is two three is the inability to recount
 
01:42:19.510 --> 01:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
them properly and four certifying the
 
01:42:22.149 --> 01:42:22.159 align:start position:0%
election with unverified
 
01:42:25.390 --> 01:42:25.400 align:start position:0%
ballots may I ask you a a practical
 
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
question about this aspect of recounts
 
01:42:31.149 --> 01:42:31.159 align:start position:0%
and the absentee ballots
 
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
maintain you're worried about the chain
 
01:42:45.990 --> 01:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
of custody when there is not an
 
01:42:50.109 --> 01:42:50.119 align:start position:0%
official a not not a legal
 
01:42:54.270 --> 01:42:54.280 align:start position:0%
affidavit so if if someone had a legal
 
01:42:58.430 --> 01:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
affidavit and removed it
 
01:43:01.350 --> 01:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
from the from the envelope from the
 
01:43:04.589 --> 01:43:04.599 align:start position:0%
envelope and then processed
 
01:43:08.270 --> 01:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
it would that be acceptable under those
 
01:43:10.589 --> 01:43:10.599 align:start position:0%
conditions or not well it would be the
 
01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
problem is you have all the others that
 
01:43:15.070 --> 01:43:15.080 align:start position:0%
aren't that's where you get into trouble
 
01:43:16.589 --> 01:43:16.599 align:start position:0%
right is that it's not the person who
 
01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
actually has a lawful ex lawfully
 
01:43:21.830 --> 01:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
executed affidavit it's deluding that
 
01:43:24.270 --> 01:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
vote when you then then add all of the
 
01:43:26.629 --> 01:43:26.639 align:start position:0%
others that have not been checked and by
 
01:43:29.589 --> 01:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
the way in 2020 just so you know we
 
01:43:32.830 --> 01:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
maintained an average of 4% of the three
 
01:43:35.669 --> 01:43:35.679 align:start position:0%
previous election Cycles prior to 2020
 
01:43:39.790 --> 01:43:39.800 align:start position:0%
4% is our average okay 2020 with the
 
01:43:42.430 --> 01:43:42.440 align:start position:0%
expanded absentee Provisions that were
 
01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
brought about because of covid and other
 
01:43:49.109 --> 01:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
expansions but statutorily uh we went to
 
01:43:54.030 --> 01:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
32% over 260,000 absentee back Bots and
 
01:43:56.310 --> 01:43:56.320 align:start position:0%
one of the things uh one of the things
 
01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court found and I I'll
 
01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
finish up their quote according to the
 
01:44:02.750 --> 01:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
plain if this disparity between methods
 
01:44:04.669 --> 01:44:04.679 align:start position:0%
of counting votes and the non
 
01:44:06.750 --> 01:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
verifiability of ballots submitted by
 
01:44:09.229 --> 01:44:09.239 align:start position:0%
electronic voting machine at the time of
 
01:44:11.229 --> 01:44:11.239 align:start position:0%
counting and later for auditing
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
parentheses recounts the validity of
 
01:44:15.629 --> 01:44:15.639 align:start position:0%
each ballot and vote produce an
 
01:44:17.830 --> 01:44:17.840 align:start position:0%
unreliable outcome and a hidden
 
01:44:20.109 --> 01:44:20.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity to manipulate the computer
 
01:44:22.669 --> 01:44:22.679 align:start position:0%
counted data see I didn't argue that the
 
01:44:24.830 --> 01:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
machine were being flipped that they
 
01:44:27.390 --> 01:44:27.400 align:start position:0%
were being accessed electronically I
 
01:44:29.470 --> 01:44:29.480 align:start position:0%
simply argued there's a process and the
 
01:44:31.709 --> 01:44:31.719 align:start position:0%
process isn't being followed because
 
01:44:34.070 --> 01:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
that is the only statutory enforcement I
 
01:44:37.750 --> 01:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
have under under election Purity 666 col
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
2 and 666 col three are the statutory
 
01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
Provisions where if local election
 
01:44:45.790 --> 01:44:45.800 align:start position:0%
officials or anyone in in involved with
 
01:44:47.589 --> 01:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
the election process doesn't follow the
 
01:44:50.830 --> 01:44:50.840 align:start position:0%
process that is my only statutory relief
 
01:44:54.109 --> 01:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
available to me so claiming fraud and
 
01:44:57.430 --> 01:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
and my argument in my brief was every
 
01:45:02.070 --> 01:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
single absentee ballot is they're all
 
01:45:04.390 --> 01:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
defective and when you say defective
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
just just to make sure I understand um
 
01:45:12.109 --> 01:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
is because it did not have a proper uh a
 
01:45:15.669 --> 01:45:15.679 align:start position:0%
legal affidavit that that established as
 
01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
you discussed the lawful chain of
 
01:45:18.239 --> 01:45:19.990 align:start position:0%
you discussed the lawful chain of
custody

01:45:19.990 --> 01:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
custody
 
01:45:23.589 --> 01:45:23.599 align:start position:0%
if is that that's correct right you're
 
01:45:26.070 --> 01:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
right all right and then just to follow
 
01:45:30.149 --> 01:45:30.159 align:start position:0%
up on that so if let me take one extreme
 
01:45:33.310 --> 01:45:33.320 align:start position:0%
and say if every absentee ballot had
 
01:45:34.870 --> 01:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
come in with a
 
01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
legal affidavit as we've defined at
 
01:45:41.629 --> 01:45:41.639 align:start position:0%
least in our discussions here at that
 
01:45:45.229 --> 01:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
point that would have been acceptable
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
because there was at that point a lawful
 
01:45:49.189 --> 01:45:49.199 align:start position:0%
chain of custody would have been
 
01:45:51.830 --> 01:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
established I'm trying to think about
 
01:45:54.149 --> 01:45:54.159 align:start position:0%
legislative Solutions it's not just your
 
01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
your case specifically and that's the
 
01:45:58.790 --> 01:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
point of my question so if it had had
 
01:46:02.709 --> 01:46:02.719 align:start position:0%
the full legal affidavit at least that
 
01:46:06.790 --> 01:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
aspect of your case would have not been
 
01:46:11.070 --> 01:46:11.080 align:start position:0%
gerine because every every absentee
 
01:46:13.390 --> 01:46:13.400 align:start position:0%
ballot at that point would have had a
 
01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
legal chain of custody right and that's
 
01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
what the affidavit is it's verification
 
01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
of the beginning of the chain of custody
 
01:46:21.709 --> 01:46:21.719 align:start position:0%
that's the key here so it's not just the
 
01:46:23.470 --> 01:46:23.480 align:start position:0%
affidavit instrument by itself self but
 
01:46:26.070 --> 01:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
rather that someone witnessed you insert
 
01:46:28.189 --> 01:46:28.199 align:start position:0%
your ballot inside of an envelope and
 
01:46:30.709 --> 01:46:30.719 align:start position:0%
that begins the process it is the it is
 
01:46:33.550 --> 01:46:33.560 align:start position:0%
the um not again not to put words in
 
01:46:35.070 --> 01:46:35.080 align:start position:0%
your mouth but I
 
01:46:39.750 --> 01:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
think we because of the equal um
 
01:46:42.430 --> 01:46:42.440 align:start position:0%
treatment of people's equal protection
 
01:46:45.030 --> 01:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
Clause we cannot
 
01:46:47.910 --> 01:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
treat someone who has an absentee ballot
 
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
different from someone who is in who is
 
01:46:53.870 --> 01:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
present on Election Day
 
01:46:57.310 --> 01:46:57.320 align:start position:0%
and in the election day mechanism where
 
01:47:00.149 --> 01:47:00.159 align:start position:0%
people are present they have people who
 
01:47:03.149 --> 01:47:03.159 align:start position:0%
are witnessing them handing out ballots
 
01:47:05.229 --> 01:47:05.239 align:start position:0%
putting them and following and tracking
 
01:47:08.790 --> 01:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
them from taking that ballot
 
01:47:11.550 --> 01:47:11.560 align:start position:0%
from the point where uh they're
 
01:47:13.030 --> 01:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
obtaining a
 
01:47:16.030 --> 01:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
ballot uh confirming their registration
 
01:47:18.510 --> 01:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
obtaining a ballot marking it as
 
01:47:20.910 --> 01:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
necessary and then delivering it to the
 
01:47:23.229 --> 01:47:23.239 align:start position:0%
machine that chain of custody is
 
01:47:24.910 --> 01:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
established by the
 
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
witnesses at that election poll correct
 
01:47:30.070 --> 01:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
and the only difference the only
 
01:47:31.790 --> 01:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
difference between the absentee voter in
 
01:47:35.030 --> 01:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
the affidavit is the extra step but the
 
01:47:37.149 --> 01:47:37.159 align:start position:0%
extra step is necessary to not be
 
01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
burdened with voting with everyone else
 
01:47:41.350 --> 01:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
on Election Day right if you're going to
 
01:47:43.070 --> 01:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
be exempt from that process because I
 
01:47:45.470 --> 01:47:45.480 align:start position:0%
did hear that in testimony from opposing
 
01:47:48.830 --> 01:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
opposing the bill explaining the burden
 
01:47:52.830 --> 01:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
that that that may befall certain people
 
01:47:54.430 --> 01:47:54.440 align:start position:0%
because of their health conditions or
 
01:47:56.830 --> 01:47:56.840 align:start position:0%
others and so they brought that up as a
 
01:48:00.550 --> 01:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
great question so yes I think that's the
 
01:48:03.709 --> 01:48:03.719 align:start position:0%
answer so uh representative C first and
 
01:48:05.950 --> 01:48:05.960 align:start position:0%
then um representative Lane all right
 
01:48:09.510 --> 01:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'm I'm gathering that uh
 
01:48:11.669 --> 01:48:11.679 align:start position:0%
it's it's a two-part question here I'm
 
01:48:16.350 --> 01:48:16.360 align:start position:0%
gathering that uh for the affidavit on
 
01:48:19.070 --> 01:48:19.080 align:start position:0%
absente ballot it only needs to start
 
01:48:21.350 --> 01:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
the chain of command or the chain of
 
01:48:23.870 --> 01:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
custody at the time the person is going
 
01:48:25.510 --> 01:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
to Mark the ballot and put it in the
 
01:48:29.390 --> 01:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
envelope correct so wouldn't need it
 
01:48:32.510 --> 01:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
just to you know call up the clerk's
 
01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
office and say hey send me a absentee
 
01:48:37.910 --> 01:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
ballot or anything like that well I
 
01:48:39.310 --> 01:48:39.320 align:start position:0%
don't see anything broken with the
 
01:48:41.350 --> 01:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
current application process in other
 
01:48:44.109 --> 01:48:44.119 align:start position:0%
words everyone the the key in article 11
 
01:48:46.390 --> 01:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
of the Bill of Rights establishes that
 
01:48:48.510 --> 01:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
you're already a qualified voter which
 
01:48:50.270 --> 01:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
means you're already registered in your
 
01:48:53.070 --> 01:48:53.080 align:start position:0%
local community so when you apply for
 
01:48:55.229 --> 01:48:55.239 align:start position:0%
your absentee ballot if you're not
 
01:48:57.149 --> 01:48:57.159 align:start position:0%
already registered they can't send out a
 
01:48:59.109 --> 01:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
package they have to make sure that you
 
01:49:00.950 --> 01:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
are in fact registered in your local
 
01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
community so that's an important
 
01:49:05.229 --> 01:49:05.239 align:start position:0%
distinction and then then to follow on
 
01:49:09.790 --> 01:49:09.800 align:start position:0%
on that uh the various people who can be
 
01:49:12.430 --> 01:49:12.440 align:start position:0%
the legal Witnesses notaries justice of
 
01:49:14.830 --> 01:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
peace and whatever uh what happens if
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
you're out of the state or out of the
 
01:49:18.669 --> 01:49:18.679 align:start position:0%
country do we need to
 
01:49:21.430 --> 01:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
have uh well out of state you can get a
 
01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%
notary or Justice P easily enough do we
 
01:49:28.229 --> 01:49:28.239 align:start position:0%
need to have them certify where they
 
01:49:29.790 --> 01:49:29.800 align:start position:0%
have their
 
01:49:32.910 --> 01:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
commission well uh I my answer is always
 
01:49:34.870 --> 01:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
what was going on before the beauty of
 
01:49:36.790 --> 01:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
our state is that we have been here so
 
01:49:39.870 --> 01:49:39.880 align:start position:0%
long in a continuous manner that my
 
01:49:43.510 --> 01:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
first my first problem solving tool is
 
01:49:45.229 --> 01:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
to go back and what were they doing
 
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
before we changed it and was that a bad
 
01:49:51.149 --> 01:49:51.159 align:start position:0%
move and so that would be that would be
 
01:49:53.629 --> 01:49:53.639 align:start position:0%
my response to address that issue okay
 
01:49:55.870 --> 01:49:55.880 align:start position:0%
and then the only other part of that is
 
01:49:59.189 --> 01:49:59.199 align:start position:0%
if you're out of the country would uh
 
01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
would a u i know the military has has
 
01:50:04.629 --> 01:50:04.639 align:start position:0%
deferred to their commanding officers as
 
01:50:06.990 --> 01:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
a surrogate and so that's always been
 
01:50:09.790 --> 01:50:09.800 align:start position:0%
the I believe the way we deal with UK
 
01:50:12.189 --> 01:50:12.199 align:start position:0%
possibly Embassy Personnel or something
 
01:50:16.510 --> 01:50:16.520 align:start position:0%
like that correct correct thank I think
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
there are other uh states that have that
 
01:50:21.350 --> 01:50:21.360 align:start position:0%
in their election laws that you can use
 
01:50:23.550 --> 01:50:23.560 align:start position:0%
an embassy or conselor something that
 
01:50:27.589 --> 01:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
extent so um representative
 
01:50:27.599 --> 01:50:30.870 align:start position:0%
extent so um representative
Lane

01:50:30.870 --> 01:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:33.950 --> 01:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
um my concern and I've heard what you
 
01:50:36.589 --> 01:50:36.599 align:start position:0%
were saying but my concern goes back to
 
01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
you know if we look at what was
 
01:50:40.030 --> 01:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
happening in
 
01:50:43.709 --> 01:50:43.719 align:start position:0%
1979 what if we're not happy with what
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
they were doing because there are a lot
 
01:50:48.750 --> 01:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
of people who can't you know they're
 
01:50:52.629 --> 01:50:52.639 align:start position:0%
homebound or right there how do we again
 
01:50:56.189 --> 01:50:56.199 align:start position:0%
to Echo the the legislative mind so how
 
01:50:59.950 --> 01:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
do we resolve that issue but yet try to
 
01:51:03.310 --> 01:51:03.320 align:start position:0%
treat them the same great question and I
 
01:51:05.229 --> 01:51:05.239 align:start position:0%
think the answer is in Article 90 and
 
01:51:06.830 --> 01:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
that's why I started early on in
 
01:51:10.310 --> 01:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
explaining that is whatever changes the
 
01:51:12.990 --> 01:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
legislature proposes and it's free to do
 
01:51:15.629 --> 01:51:15.639 align:start position:0%
so right it's it's it's Unlimited in its
 
01:51:17.790 --> 01:51:17.800 align:start position:0%
capacity to offer Solutions it is not
 
01:51:20.910 --> 01:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
constrained by anything other than both
 
01:51:23.910 --> 01:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
constitutions so if like for example
 
01:51:26.990 --> 01:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
with the cacr that you proposed right
 
01:51:29.310 --> 01:51:29.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not for or against the bill all I'm
 
01:51:30.830 --> 01:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
pointing out in my that I think I
 
01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
pointed out in my testimony was that
 
01:51:35.950 --> 01:51:35.960 align:start position:0%
that provision runs into other problems
 
01:51:37.589 --> 01:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
that that other provisions of the
 
01:51:39.430 --> 01:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
constit they would have to be altered as
 
01:51:42.109 --> 01:51:42.119 align:start position:0%
well and I think that's the so if we're
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
going to be a a recodification for
 
01:51:47.430 --> 01:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
example right that things need to change
 
01:51:50.189 --> 01:51:50.199 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason that we're still
 
01:51:52.830 --> 01:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
Bound by making those changes because AR
 
01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
one of the Bill of Rights says all
 
01:51:56.069 --> 01:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
government of right originates from the
 
01:51:58.270 --> 01:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
people and the last sentence of article
 
01:52:01.149 --> 01:52:01.159 align:start position:0%
101 in part two says that this document
 
01:52:02.669 --> 01:52:02.679 align:start position:0%
can't be changed without the consent of
 
01:52:05.709 --> 01:52:05.719 align:start position:0%
the people right and so this is this is
 
01:52:07.189 --> 01:52:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh an important piece so that would be
 
01:52:09.870 --> 01:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
my answer uh to and I say this to people
 
01:52:14.270 --> 01:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
all the time if if you sometimes the U
 
01:52:17.709 --> 01:52:17.719 align:start position:0%
proposed legislative changes are um I'll
 
01:52:19.550 --> 01:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
pick on Parental Bill of Rights for a
 
01:52:22.589 --> 01:52:22.599 align:start position:0%
moment since I know it's a Hot Topic my
 
01:52:25.149 --> 01:52:25.159 align:start position:0%
my my argument is it's not necessary
 
01:52:27.629 --> 01:52:27.639 align:start position:0%
it's not necessary because the parents
 
01:52:29.910 --> 01:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
already possess that Authority Under The
 
01:52:32.270 --> 01:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights so the fact that you've
 
01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
surrendered your children to the state
 
01:52:35.149 --> 01:52:35.159 align:start position:0%
is another problem that's the real
 
01:52:36.830 --> 01:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
problem so don't complain how they
 
01:52:38.189 --> 01:52:38.199 align:start position:0%
handle it
 
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:49.870 --> 01:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
example uh uh representative Burnham yes
 
01:52:53.790 --> 01:52:53.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um do you think that absentee
 
01:52:56.149 --> 01:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
ballots should be held accountable just
 
01:52:58.350 --> 01:52:58.360 align:start position:0%
like official ballots uh and I mean
 
01:53:00.870 --> 01:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
accountable from the moment that a clerk
 
01:53:02.709 --> 01:53:02.719 align:start position:0%
receives them from the Secretary of
 
01:53:05.550 --> 01:53:05.560 align:start position:0%
State's office official official ballots
 
01:53:08.990 --> 01:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
are are counted right by wi uh and
 
01:53:11.310 --> 01:53:11.320 align:start position:0%
witness of those countings they are
 
01:53:14.350 --> 01:53:14.360 align:start position:0%
separated by um testing
 
01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:16.310 align:start position:0%
separated by um testing
samples

01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
samples
 
01:53:19.589 --> 01:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
um or from samp from the testing samples
 
01:53:23.069 --> 01:53:23.079 align:start position:0%
and then they are placed in sealed until
 
01:53:25.189 --> 01:53:25.199 align:start position:0%
election day okay so that process has
 
01:53:26.870 --> 01:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
happened with the official ballots
 
01:53:28.390 --> 01:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
however when they receive absente
 
01:53:30.229 --> 01:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
ballots from the Secretary of State's
 
01:53:33.109 --> 01:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
office it is not handled that way you're
 
01:53:35.550 --> 01:53:35.560 align:start position:0%
right and uh when you look back at the
 
01:53:38.790 --> 01:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
past you'll see that the um uh the
 
01:53:41.589 --> 01:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
absentee voting process is uh been
 
01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
monkeyed with for a long time and I
 
01:53:48.030 --> 01:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
don't uh please re rephrase the question
 
01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:49.950 align:start position:0%
don't uh please re rephrase the question
for

01:53:49.950 --> 01:53:49.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:53:52.950 --> 01:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
me do you believe that the absentee
 
01:53:55.870 --> 01:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
ballots should receive the same chain of
 
01:53:58.510 --> 01:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
custody and accountability as our
 
01:54:01.750 --> 01:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
official ballots article 11 says so
 
01:54:03.910 --> 01:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
right that the election process must be
 
01:54:06.270 --> 01:54:06.280 align:start position:0%
fair and equal throughout so this is
 
01:54:08.109 --> 01:54:08.119 align:start position:0%
what's not happening now is that we're
 
01:54:10.629 --> 01:54:10.639 align:start position:0%
not we're not treating them the same
 
01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
they're being treated differently
 
01:54:14.310 --> 01:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
because there's no verification of who
 
01:54:17.669 --> 01:54:17.679 align:start position:0%
they are like I said earlier we've gone
 
01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
from and the word affidavit to a process
 
01:54:25.510 --> 01:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
that closely resembles an unsworn
 
01:54:28.350 --> 01:54:28.360 align:start position:0%
declaration so it that's not what it is
 
01:54:29.990 --> 01:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
I mean if if the legislature was going
 
01:54:32.310 --> 01:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
to make it that then it run into other
 
01:54:34.149 --> 01:54:34.159 align:start position:0%
problems of not being able to verify so
 
01:54:35.629 --> 01:54:35.639 align:start position:0%
the answer to your question is yes I
 
01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
believe that they should be and they
 
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
have to be dealt with the same way they
 
01:54:41.629 --> 01:54:41.639 align:start position:0%
can't be treated differently I have a
 
01:54:45.390 --> 01:54:45.400 align:start position:0%
followup please um so with that in mind
 
01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
currently absente ballots aren't counted
 
01:54:51.149 --> 01:54:51.159 align:start position:0%
they're not being tracked um some clerks
 
01:54:53.390 --> 01:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
say that they do track a personally just
 
01:54:56.270 --> 01:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
so that they are aware who they sent uh
 
01:54:57.830 --> 01:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
how many times they may have sent one
 
01:55:00.069 --> 01:55:00.079 align:start position:0%
out to a voter because sometimes that
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
happens they may not receive it on the
 
01:55:04.790 --> 01:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
other end or they may have thrown it
 
01:55:06.790 --> 01:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
away or maybe they went somewhere else
 
01:55:08.950 --> 01:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
and they needed in a new location none
 
01:55:11.109 --> 01:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
of those are necessarily being tracked
 
01:55:13.589 --> 01:55:13.599 align:start position:0%
from my understanding um and then
 
01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
they're not being
 
01:55:18.189 --> 01:55:18.199 align:start position:0%
counted reduced from the total of
 
01:55:19.709 --> 01:55:19.719 align:start position:0%
whatever total that is from the
 
01:55:21.550 --> 01:55:21.560 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office they're not
 
01:55:24.589 --> 01:55:24.599 align:start position:0%
being counted at the clerk's office the
 
01:55:27.109 --> 01:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
only absentee ballots that are being
 
01:55:29.390 --> 01:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
counted are the absentee ballots that
 
01:55:32.510 --> 01:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
are being used as an official ballot if
 
01:55:34.589 --> 01:55:34.599 align:start position:0%
they've run out of the official
 
01:55:38.069 --> 01:55:38.079 align:start position:0%
ballots or any absentee ballots received
 
01:55:41.430 --> 01:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
to be processed on Election Day there is
 
01:55:42.750 --> 01:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
nothing in between if they've been
 
01:55:45.030 --> 01:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
spoiled like our official ballots right
 
01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
our official ballots are spoiled those
 
01:55:49.790 --> 01:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
are C calculated as well in the final
 
01:55:53.229 --> 01:55:53.239 align:start position:0%
count of their ballots and at the end of
 
01:55:55.229 --> 01:55:55.239 align:start position:0%
the day we don't know how many absentee
 
01:55:57.510 --> 01:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
ballots we have remaining but we do for
 
01:56:00.030 --> 01:56:00.040 align:start position:0%
the official ballots the process is not
 
01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
the same and I'm just my understanding
 
01:56:05.430 --> 01:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
is that there's no need to have to worry
 
01:56:07.390 --> 01:56:07.400 align:start position:0%
about that it's the absentee ballots
 
01:56:08.790 --> 01:56:08.800 align:start position:0%
that are being processed through the
 
01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
machine or hand counted and that's
 
01:56:12.310 --> 01:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
really part of the problem is that
 
01:56:14.270 --> 01:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
you'll find this fascinating when they
 
01:56:15.669 --> 01:56:15.679 align:start position:0%
first made these provisions and
 
01:56:15.679 --> 01:56:17.030 align:start position:0%
first made these provisions and
recodification

01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
recodification
 
01:56:19.550 --> 01:56:19.560 align:start position:0%
1979 if you were using voting machines
 
01:56:21.629 --> 01:56:21.639 align:start position:0%
in your local voting district you
 
01:56:23.430 --> 01:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't count the absentee ballots you
 
01:56:25.950 --> 01:56:25.960 align:start position:0%
had to count them by hand and you
 
01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't start counting them till the
 
01:56:29.709 --> 01:56:29.719 align:start position:0%
election was done so at the end of the
 
01:56:31.229 --> 01:56:31.239 align:start position:0%
day was when they were done so they were
 
01:56:34.109 --> 01:56:34.119 align:start position:0%
all put aside and once the election day
 
01:56:36.229 --> 01:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
was over then the moderator would make
 
01:56:37.310 --> 01:56:37.320 align:start position:0%
his announcement that he's going to
 
01:56:39.310 --> 01:56:39.320 align:start position:0%
start counting them but yeah they used
 
01:56:41.750 --> 01:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
to not because remember part two article
 
01:56:45.870 --> 01:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
32 of the uh the the election U
 
01:56:47.550 --> 01:56:47.560 align:start position:0%
provision for the moderator selectman
 
01:56:50.669 --> 01:56:50.679 align:start position:0%
and clerk says the moderator is to sort
 
01:56:53.390 --> 01:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
and count the machine can't sort they
 
01:56:56.030 --> 01:56:56.040 align:start position:0%
can't do an examination of the ballot
 
01:56:58.270 --> 01:56:58.280 align:start position:0%
and that also when we when we added this
 
01:57:00.189 --> 01:57:00.199 align:start position:0%
piece to it to the election process we
 
01:57:03.149 --> 01:57:03.159 align:start position:0%
also the eliminated the problem of doing
 
01:57:06.990 --> 01:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
the fix before the certification so the
 
01:57:10.790 --> 01:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
moderator could fix this problem in the
 
01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
moment and and so some of these changes
 
01:57:15.830 --> 01:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
like I don't agree with the the starting
 
01:57:18.470 --> 01:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
early in the day only because if people
 
01:57:20.629 --> 01:57:20.639 align:start position:0%
want to challenge most people are
 
01:57:22.709 --> 01:57:22.719 align:start position:0%
working 9 to5
 
01:57:24.950 --> 01:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh or whatever their time frame is if
 
01:57:27.550 --> 01:57:27.560 align:start position:0%
you start doing it early in the day
 
01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
you're unable to make these challenges
 
01:57:31.270 --> 01:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
and and now we're being legally
 
01:57:32.910 --> 01:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
threatened with consequences but that's
 
01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:35.629 align:start position:0%
threatened with consequences but that's
another

01:57:35.629 --> 01:57:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:39.030 --> 01:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
story I do have one more but I let me
 
01:57:41.709 --> 01:57:41.719 align:start position:0%
just just to clarify your your questions
 
01:57:43.750 --> 01:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
and and the response so there's a
 
01:57:47.430 --> 01:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
distinction between an absente ballot
 
01:57:50.910 --> 01:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
package and then uh which contains a set
 
01:57:52.910 --> 01:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
of envelopes right two envelopes two
 
01:57:55.149 --> 01:57:55.159 align:start position:0%
envelopes an affidavit envelope and a
 
01:57:57.589 --> 01:57:57.599 align:start position:0%
mailing envelope and then there's also
 
01:58:00.830 --> 01:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
the the blank ballot and then we've been
 
01:58:04.109 --> 01:58:04.119 align:start position:0%
talking about you've been talking about
 
01:58:07.550 --> 01:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
before the ballot is marked my earlier
 
01:58:10.350 --> 01:58:10.360 align:start position:0%
conversation with Mr Richard discussed
 
01:58:12.109 --> 01:58:12.119 align:start position:0%
the ballot after it was marked and the
 
01:58:14.390 --> 01:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
chain of custody so I just want to
 
01:58:17.870 --> 01:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
clarify we're using the same terms but
 
01:58:19.790 --> 01:58:19.800 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure we distinguish
 
01:58:23.390 --> 01:58:23.400 align:start position:0%
where in the life cycle uh that ballot
 
01:58:26.189 --> 01:58:26.199 align:start position:0%
is so um I just wanted to clarify that
 
01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
for anyone who might be listening or
 
01:58:33.550 --> 01:58:33.560 align:start position:0%
thinking about this um so um did you say
 
01:58:36.229 --> 01:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
you had another question ah so um we
 
01:58:38.830 --> 01:58:38.840 align:start position:0%
will entertain uh representative
 
01:58:41.870 --> 01:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
Lan's uh she's had enough we'll uh we'll
 
01:58:44.069 --> 01:58:44.079 align:start position:0%
get we'll get back to representative
 
01:58:45.870 --> 01:58:45.880 align:start position:0%
Burnham in a second but I have to give
 
01:58:48.270 --> 01:58:48.280 align:start position:0%
you I have to give equal treatment here
 
01:58:50.589 --> 01:58:50.599 align:start position:0%
as as the chair I'm trying to do a
 
01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
balanced uh uh unbiased situation so
 
01:58:57.669 --> 01:58:57.679 align:start position:0%
representative Lane please ask your
 
01:58:57.679 --> 01:59:00.470 align:start position:0%
representative Lane please ask your
question

01:59:00.470 --> 01:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:59:04.189 --> 01:59:04.199 align:start position:0%
so with my legisl lative hat on and
 
01:59:07.629 --> 01:59:07.639 align:start position:0%
trying to craft an
 
01:59:09.910 --> 01:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
affidavit and you talked about
 
01:59:12.589 --> 01:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
self-affirming so I'm kind of going
 
01:59:14.510 --> 01:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
that's not really in your mind an
 
01:59:17.550 --> 01:59:17.560 align:start position:0%
affidavit no no based on usage and
 
01:59:19.790 --> 01:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
custom and history the word is 500 years
 
01:59:22.149 --> 01:59:22.159 align:start position:0%
old right and and the courts have
 
01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
established its definition and so is the
 
01:59:28.709 --> 01:59:28.719 align:start position:0%
legislature in 262 places okay if we
 
01:59:32.069 --> 01:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
wanted to yes if we wanted to say a
 
01:59:32.079 --> 01:59:33.750 align:start position:0%
wanted to yes if we wanted to say a
self-affirming

01:59:33.750 --> 01:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
self-affirming
 
01:59:36.390 --> 01:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
affidavit would suffice because they're
 
01:59:38.270 --> 01:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
signing to say it's subject to the
 
01:59:39.550 --> 01:59:39.560 align:start position:0%
penalties of
 
01:59:42.270 --> 01:59:42.280 align:start position:0%
perjury that we lay out what the
 
01:59:44.069 --> 01:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
penalties are that there's a civil
 
01:59:46.109 --> 01:59:46.119 align:start position:0%
penalty and a criminal penalty and all
 
01:59:50.270 --> 01:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
that and they sign that in your mind
 
01:59:52.830 --> 01:59:52.840 align:start position:0%
it's not an and I agree it's not an
 
01:59:55.709 --> 01:59:55.719 align:start position:0%
affidavit correct but would that be
 
02:00:00.149 --> 02:00:00.159 align:start position:0%
enforcable in court if they've signed it
 
02:00:02.310 --> 02:00:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh no because there was no witness right
 
02:00:03.830 --> 02:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
we we there's no beginning of the chain
 
02:00:05.510 --> 02:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
of custody because that's all the
 
02:00:07.990 --> 02:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
affidavit is for is to reaffirm that
 
02:00:11.030 --> 02:00:11.040 align:start position:0%
we've begun with the in other words
 
02:00:12.950 --> 02:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
everyone who cast a ballot must cast The
 
02:00:15.030 --> 02:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
Ballot in front of someone authorized by
 
02:00:17.950 --> 02:00:17.960 align:start position:0%
law to be an election official and
 
02:00:22.830 --> 02:00:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:27.790 --> 02:00:27.800 align:start position:0%
so have you thought about how we might
 
02:00:30.990 --> 02:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
try and solve this cuss chain of custody
 
02:00:33.069 --> 02:00:33.079 align:start position:0%
issue for people who really are
 
02:00:36.229 --> 02:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
homebound or can't get into the clerk's
 
02:00:39.229 --> 02:00:39.239 align:start position:0%
office um and don't necessarily have the
 
02:00:41.550 --> 02:00:41.560 align:start position:0%
money to pay I mean it can cost anywhere
 
02:00:43.750 --> 02:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
from 50 to $100 to get someone to come
 
02:00:46.790 --> 02:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
to your home right and sign an affidavit
 
02:00:48.709 --> 02:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
yeah no my answer to that would be to do
 
02:00:50.270 --> 02:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
what we used to do in the past for
 
02:00:52.790 --> 02:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
example people in nursing homes right
 
02:00:55.069 --> 02:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
dispatch someone who was authorized to
 
02:00:57.790 --> 02:00:57.800 align:start position:0%
do so at the state or local people in
 
02:01:00.109 --> 02:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
other words at local expense to make
 
02:01:02.750 --> 02:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
sure that they get to right to exercise
 
02:01:05.030 --> 02:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
their right to vote and and I that would
 
02:01:08.030 --> 02:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
be the solution is to make it be part of
 
02:01:09.870 --> 02:01:09.880 align:start position:0%
the responsibility because the state
 
02:01:13.750 --> 02:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
carries the burden to make sure that um
 
02:01:17.149 --> 02:01:17.159 align:start position:0%
uh that the uh the voter Integrity is is
 
02:01:20.910 --> 02:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:23.350 --> 02:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
maintained so then it would be incumbent
 
02:01:27.229 --> 02:01:27.239 align:start position:0%
upon the clerks or the whoever we decide
 
02:01:31.470 --> 02:01:31.480 align:start position:0%
to go out to these people not I mean
 
02:01:33.189 --> 02:01:33.199 align:start position:0%
they're not all in nursing homes a lot
 
02:01:34.750 --> 02:01:34.760 align:start position:0%
of them are you know living in
 
02:01:37.390 --> 02:01:37.400 align:start position:0%
apartments or living in their homes so
 
02:01:40.790 --> 02:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
do we then have it be the responsibility
 
02:01:43.910 --> 02:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
of the clerks to go out say on
 
02:01:46.629 --> 02:01:46.639 align:start position:0%
designated dat I I don't even know I'm
 
02:01:48.189 --> 02:01:48.199 align:start position:0%
kind of yeah yeah no and be honest with
 
02:01:49.750 --> 02:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
you it's beyond my pay grade to make
 
02:01:50.990 --> 02:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
that decision because I'm not in the
 
02:01:53.510 --> 02:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
legislature so I can't speculate to I'll
 
02:01:59.470 --> 02:01:59.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:02.790 --> 02:02:02.800 align:start position:0%
to no you're welcome so uh I'll move
 
02:02:05.870 --> 02:02:05.880 align:start position:0%
along here get on to I think my Mr
 
02:02:10.109 --> 02:02:10.119 align:start position:0%
Richard um I'm now uh now that we've uh
 
02:02:12.790 --> 02:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
allowed representative Lane a turn we're
 
02:02:14.910 --> 02:02:14.920 align:start position:0%
we're now back to representative Burnham
 
02:02:17.310 --> 02:02:17.320 align:start position:0%
to uh follow up with her questions thank
 
02:02:18.910 --> 02:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
you I'm just really passionate about my
 
02:02:21.030 --> 02:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
absente ballot there you go I'm glad you
 
02:02:23.149 --> 02:02:23.159 align:start position:0%
are so kind of been on this for a little
 
02:02:26.069 --> 02:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
while and I'm just want some clarity uh
 
02:02:29.189 --> 02:02:29.199 align:start position:0%
and support would be great um so with
 
02:02:31.709 --> 02:02:31.719 align:start position:0%
that I we find that there are some
 
02:02:34.790 --> 02:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
people that cannot come into a polling
 
02:02:37.390 --> 02:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
place but they can be driven to say the
 
02:02:40.350 --> 02:02:40.360 align:start position:0%
door and the moderator can come outside
 
02:02:44.310 --> 02:02:44.320 align:start position:0%
or ballot election official with an
 
02:02:47.390 --> 02:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot so that now that
 
02:02:49.069 --> 02:02:49.079 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot which has had not been
 
02:02:52.510 --> 02:02:52.520 align:start position:0%
counted right comes outside and it's
 
02:02:55.990 --> 02:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
being witnessed by that elected official
 
02:02:59.229 --> 02:02:59.239 align:start position:0%
of the voter completing that ballot but
 
02:03:01.709 --> 02:03:01.719 align:start position:0%
it's still an absentee ballot my I've
 
02:03:05.310 --> 02:03:05.320 align:start position:0%
never gotten the a firm answer as to why
 
02:03:07.589 --> 02:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
that needs to be an absentee ballot
 
02:03:10.030 --> 02:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
versus an official day ballot when the
 
02:03:12.990 --> 02:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
voters coming to the location but not
 
02:03:15.990 --> 02:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
inside right because now you have what I
 
02:03:17.069 --> 02:03:17.079 align:start position:0%
can tell you from a practical
 
02:03:19.790 --> 02:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
perspective is the absentee ballot is
 
02:03:22.790 --> 02:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
labeled as such all absentee ballots are
 
02:03:24.830 --> 02:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
printed absentee ballot at the header
 
02:03:27.550 --> 02:03:27.560 align:start position:0%
and many of them are a different color
 
02:03:30.430 --> 02:03:30.440 align:start position:0%
so um so you'd be looking at a
 
02:03:32.510 --> 02:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
legislative solution to convert an
 
02:03:35.350 --> 02:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot into a normal ballot now
 
02:03:37.910 --> 02:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
there used to be and there may still be
 
02:03:39.750 --> 02:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know the solid I'm not solid on
 
02:03:41.790 --> 02:03:41.800 align:start position:0%
this answer but there used to be the
 
02:03:45.790 --> 02:03:45.800 align:start position:0%
ability to uh take that absentee ballot
 
02:03:48.030 --> 02:03:48.040 align:start position:0%
and do exactly that to show up on
 
02:03:49.910 --> 02:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
Election Day and have it deposited
 
02:03:52.189 --> 02:03:52.199 align:start position:0%
either at the polling station or by any
 
02:03:53.870 --> 02:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
other means with the only caveat of
 
02:03:55.750 --> 02:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
getting it processed before the polls
 
02:03:58.510 --> 02:03:58.520 align:start position:0%
close so it's a risky game of being way
 
02:04:01.109 --> 02:04:01.119 align:start position:0%
too late on that but yeah I I I don't
 
02:04:02.950 --> 02:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
see a problem with that and it is part
 
02:04:05.189 --> 02:04:05.199 align:start position:0%
of our usage and custom of the
 
02:04:07.229 --> 02:04:07.239 align:start position:0%
past you're
 
02:04:10.510 --> 02:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
welcome I I'll just say this as a sort
 
02:04:12.430 --> 02:04:12.440 align:start position:0%
of rhetorical question it might have to
 
02:04:15.310 --> 02:04:15.320 align:start position:0%
do with processing of ballots within the
 
02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
guard rails and things like that so I
 
02:04:21.870 --> 02:04:21.880 align:start position:0%
I'm yeah I'm thinking that's why when
 
02:04:25.189 --> 02:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
you're taking a ballot outside of the
 
02:04:28.229 --> 02:04:28.239 align:start position:0%
guard rails within that election polling
 
02:04:31.910 --> 02:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
place you are you you should not be
 
02:04:34.589 --> 02:04:34.599 align:start position:0%
taking regular ballots so you take an
 
02:04:36.790 --> 02:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
absentee balot I think that's the
 
02:04:39.990 --> 02:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
rationale of I'm not sure that the I'm
 
02:04:42.149 --> 02:04:42.159 align:start position:0%
not sure that the RSA specifies that it
 
02:04:44.709 --> 02:04:44.719 align:start position:0%
might specify that in the election law
 
02:04:47.189 --> 02:04:47.199 align:start position:0%
manual again something for the election
 
02:04:49.109 --> 02:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
law committee to consider yeah I
 
02:04:50.990 --> 02:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate that I I think the level of
 
02:04:53.430 --> 02:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
concern is the voters they don't they've
 
02:04:56.030 --> 02:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
taken the time to come out even as far
 
02:04:59.270 --> 02:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
as they can uh be whatever their
 
02:05:01.149 --> 02:05:01.159 align:start position:0%
situation and when they see that it's an
 
02:05:03.870 --> 02:05:03.880 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot they feel like they've
 
02:05:05.910 --> 02:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
been dismissed in such a way that it's
 
02:05:07.629 --> 02:05:07.639 align:start position:0%
not the official one that's all I'm
 
02:05:10.109 --> 02:05:10.119 align:start position:0%
asking if how how does that play for
 
02:05:13.790 --> 02:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
their own particular situation so I I I
 
02:05:15.669 --> 02:05:15.679 align:start position:0%
think that's that's something that we
 
02:05:17.549 --> 02:05:17.559 align:start position:0%
should consider in the larger committee
 
02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
about how to properly address that
 
02:05:23.030 --> 02:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
aspect so that there are
 
02:05:27.149 --> 02:05:27.159 align:start position:0%
some um everyone here knows that I'm
 
02:05:30.629 --> 02:05:30.639 align:start position:0%
very passionate about uh the ability of
 
02:05:33.470 --> 02:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
people who have uh disabilities and
 
02:05:36.669 --> 02:05:36.679 align:start position:0%
other similar challenges must their
 
02:05:39.229 --> 02:05:39.239 align:start position:0%
their right to vote must be protected
 
02:05:43.030 --> 02:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
and um I think we just need to clarify
 
02:05:46.189 --> 02:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
how that uh is enacted in a way that
 
02:05:48.510 --> 02:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
they don't feel uh discriminated against
 
02:05:52.149 --> 02:05:52.159 align:start position:0%
or in some manner so uh
 
02:05:54.430 --> 02:05:54.440 align:start position:0%
excellent line of questioning thank you
 
02:05:57.510 --> 02:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
very much uh representative Newsome
 
02:05:58.629 --> 02:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and I'd like to
 
02:06:01.030 --> 02:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
apologize to the subcommittee and uh our
 
02:06:03.510 --> 02:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
guest for my tardiness uh this
 
02:06:05.549 --> 02:06:05.559 align:start position:0%
afternoon that's fine I still want to
 
02:06:08.549 --> 02:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
get that on record so um and I'm not
 
02:06:10.310 --> 02:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
sure if this really matters in the grand
 
02:06:12.189 --> 02:06:12.199 align:start position:0%
scheme but in your opinion when does an
 
02:06:16.069 --> 02:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
absentee voter technically vote is it
 
02:06:18.629 --> 02:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
when the ballot goes in the envelope and
 
02:06:18.639 --> 02:06:19.310 align:start position:0%
when the ballot goes in the envelope and
is

02:06:19.310 --> 02:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:06:22.310 --> 02:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
sealed or puts in in the
 
02:06:24.669 --> 02:06:24.679 align:start position:0%
mailbox or when it's received on the
 
02:06:27.069 --> 02:06:27.079 align:start position:0%
other end and I'm not really sure if it
 
02:06:28.470 --> 02:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
matters in the grant scheme I'm just
 
02:06:29.870 --> 02:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
curious what your thoughts on that might
 
02:06:32.030 --> 02:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
be yeah no I would say that it the
 
02:06:34.109 --> 02:06:34.119 align:start position:0%
ballot has been cast once it's been
 
02:06:36.069 --> 02:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
received by the moderator and then the
 
02:06:38.870 --> 02:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
moderator has a three-step process a to
 
02:06:42.669 --> 02:06:42.679 align:start position:0%
make sure that the voter is is a um on
 
02:06:45.669 --> 02:06:45.679 align:start position:0%
the checklist that's the first step B
 
02:06:46.910 --> 02:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
that the affidavit appears to be
 
02:06:49.149 --> 02:06:49.159 align:start position:0%
properly executed and C that the
 
02:06:52.549 --> 02:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
signature verification is also
 
02:06:55.669 --> 02:06:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh is also in line now there's I don't
 
02:06:57.470 --> 02:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
want to get off in the weeds but we
 
02:06:59.870 --> 02:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
could have this conversation offline
 
02:07:03.430 --> 02:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
about saato versus Garder where this
 
02:07:06.310 --> 02:07:06.320 align:start position:0%
went to the federal court and there was
 
02:07:08.709 --> 02:07:08.719 align:start position:0%
some hanky panky that went on and we'll
 
02:07:11.030 --> 02:07:11.040 align:start position:0%
take that offline but yeah it's it's
 
02:07:12.149 --> 02:07:12.159 align:start position:0%
it's been an
 
02:07:14.430 --> 02:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
issue but that would be my answer to
 
02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
your question so yeah the fact the fact
 
02:07:19.069 --> 02:07:19.079 align:start position:0%
that well and again what I like about
 
02:07:21.950 --> 02:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
the affidavit process is that now it's
 
02:07:23.870 --> 02:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
been sealed and there's an eyewitness so
 
02:07:27.189 --> 02:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
that when you go to check C and this is
 
02:07:29.069 --> 02:07:29.079 align:start position:0%
what they didn't tell the federal court
 
02:07:31.109 --> 02:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
is that you have an authenticated
 
02:07:34.229 --> 02:07:34.239 align:start position:0%
signature to verify if you don't have a
 
02:07:37.470 --> 02:07:37.480 align:start position:0%
notary or an eyewitness to the inserting
 
02:07:39.830 --> 02:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
the ballot in the envelope how can you
 
02:07:41.669 --> 02:07:41.679 align:start position:0%
trust the signature the state brought in
 
02:07:44.109 --> 02:07:44.119 align:start position:0%
the S the ACLU brought in a signature
 
02:07:46.549 --> 02:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
verification expert Who convinced the
 
02:07:49.629 --> 02:07:49.639 align:start position:0%
federal judge that moderators lack the
 
02:07:51.629 --> 02:07:51.639 align:start position:0%
skill set the training or professional
 
02:07:55.669 --> 02:07:55.679 align:start position:0%
capacity to discern to a certain degree
 
02:07:58.629 --> 02:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
to disallow a ballot based on the fact
 
02:08:00.270 --> 02:08:00.280 align:start position:0%
that the signature didn't match
 
02:08:02.510 --> 02:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
moderators don't have that skill and I
 
02:08:04.470 --> 02:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't disagree with that opinion but
 
02:08:07.229 --> 02:08:07.239 align:start position:0%
they left out the important part that if
 
02:08:09.510 --> 02:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
they did the affidavit then the
 
02:08:11.149 --> 02:08:11.159 align:start position:0%
moderator would be looking at an
 
02:08:13.109 --> 02:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
authenticated signature and we're no
 
02:08:14.629 --> 02:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
long we we don't have that that hasn't
 
02:08:17.069 --> 02:08:17.079 align:start position:0%
happened since 79 right so the
 
02:08:19.750 --> 02:08:19.760 align:start position:0%
authenticated signature being the not
 
02:08:22.470 --> 02:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
not the public notary not the actual
 
02:08:24.549 --> 02:08:24.559 align:start position:0%
voter in this case right the notary
 
02:08:26.830 --> 02:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
verified that that was a signature right
 
02:08:28.629 --> 02:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
so the moderator could trust it because
 
02:08:31.709 --> 02:08:31.719 align:start position:0%
he he personally had an eyewitness right
 
02:08:34.229 --> 02:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
and and part of the notary process would
 
02:08:37.030 --> 02:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
have been to confirm identity and
 
02:08:39.470 --> 02:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
confirm that all the other attributes
 
02:08:42.270 --> 02:08:42.280 align:start position:0%
for voting were being followed as I.E
 
02:08:43.910 --> 02:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
different than what representative Lane
 
02:08:46.990 --> 02:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
was talking about which is an unsworn
 
02:08:48.990 --> 02:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
declaration that's the legal term and in
 
02:08:51.589 --> 02:08:51.599 align:start position:0%
some jurisdiction it is permissible and
 
02:08:52.910 --> 02:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
I would say that it would have to be
 
02:08:54.709 --> 02:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
done by the legislature in order for
 
02:08:56.270 --> 02:08:56.280 align:start position:0%
that to be done but not the ball law
 
02:08:59.990 --> 02:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
commission I'm sorry frean slip um not
 
02:09:02.390 --> 02:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
by the uh the secretary of state of the
 
02:09:06.189 --> 02:09:06.199 align:start position:0%
AG um next I have for you hopefully the
 
02:09:08.830 --> 02:09:08.840 align:start position:0%
solution your do so uh because there
 
02:09:10.629 --> 02:09:10.639 align:start position:0%
have been a number of questions you're
 
02:09:13.629 --> 02:09:13.639 align:start position:0%
certainly extended Beyond 3:15 um the
 
02:09:16.709 --> 02:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
meeting is supposed to last till 4 so I
 
02:09:22.750 --> 02:09:22.760 align:start position:0%
I um uh please continue uh but but uh
 
02:09:26.109 --> 02:09:26.119 align:start position:0%
don't feel pressure to end by 3:15 I I
 
02:09:28.669 --> 02:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
want to you know extend as much courtesy
 
02:09:31.109 --> 02:09:31.119 align:start position:0%
as I to you as I possibly can because
 
02:09:33.589 --> 02:09:33.599 align:start position:0%
this has been I think very informative
 
02:09:35.390 --> 02:09:35.400 align:start position:0%
and I think the subcommittee greatly
 
02:09:37.790 --> 02:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
appreciates your testimony here today so
 
02:09:40.390 --> 02:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
if you would uh continue but I will
 
02:09:43.750 --> 02:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
advise you you're on page nine of 17 and
 
02:09:47.790 --> 02:09:47.800 align:start position:0%
it is 306 so I I ask you to your best
 
02:09:50.910 --> 02:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
and I know I know uh from your dog
 
02:09:52.709 --> 02:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
training skills that you'll be able to
 
02:09:55.069 --> 02:09:55.079 align:start position:0%
do this sool confident in you all right
 
02:09:57.709 --> 02:09:57.719 align:start position:0%
for you non-lawyers here um I'm going to
 
02:09:59.910 --> 02:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
close out on my point about my the state
 
02:10:02.030 --> 02:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
supreme court the court said the
 
02:10:03.430 --> 02:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
following applying our standard of
 
02:10:05.149 --> 02:10:05.159 align:start position:0%
review based on the alleged facts we
 
02:10:06.350 --> 02:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
determined that the plaintiff is
 
02:10:08.069 --> 02:10:08.079 align:start position:0%
sufficiently demonstrated his right to
 
02:10:09.830 --> 02:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
claim relief and he's therefore
 
02:10:11.350 --> 02:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
demonstrated standing in his equal
 
02:10:13.629 --> 02:10:13.639 align:start position:0%
protection claim and they cited several
 
02:10:16.589 --> 02:10:16.599 align:start position:0%
cases noting in this applies to everyone
 
02:10:18.950 --> 02:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
to should all know this noting that
 
02:10:20.790 --> 02:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
voters have standing to bring equal
 
02:10:22.549 --> 02:10:22.559 align:start position:0%
protection challenges to complain on
 
02:10:25.310 --> 02:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
vote delusion and observing that quote
 
02:10:27.830 --> 02:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
many of the cases have assumed rather
 
02:10:30.229 --> 02:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
than articulated the premise of deciding
 
02:10:32.229 --> 02:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
the me merits of similar claims in other
 
02:10:34.589 --> 02:10:34.599 align:start position:0%
words proving fraud is very difficult
 
02:10:36.109 --> 02:10:36.119 align:start position:0%
the fact that I went down this road is
 
02:10:37.510 --> 02:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
why I was able to convince the state
 
02:10:39.549 --> 02:10:39.559 align:start position:0%
supreme court that this should move
 
02:10:42.589 --> 02:10:42.599 align:start position:0%
forward um because the trial court did
 
02:10:44.109 --> 02:10:44.119 align:start position:0%
not address the plaintiff's equal
 
02:10:45.990 --> 02:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
protection claim we remand for further
 
02:10:47.430 --> 02:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
proceedings consistent with this
 
02:10:49.350 --> 02:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
decision in doing so we express no
 
02:10:51.390 --> 02:10:51.400 align:start position:0%
opinion on the merits of the claim
 
02:10:53.030 --> 02:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
that's because the TR the state supreme
 
02:10:55.549 --> 02:10:55.559 align:start position:0%
court is an appell at court and so it
 
02:10:58.069 --> 02:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
didn't want to taint beyond the finding
 
02:11:00.709 --> 02:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
of standing and again for the non-
 
02:11:03.310 --> 02:11:03.320 align:start position:0%
lawyers standing Doctrine is layman's
 
02:11:05.549 --> 02:11:05.559 align:start position:0%
term a good example is that there's an
 
02:11:07.629 --> 02:11:07.639 align:start position:0%
injury in fact that I suffered some type
 
02:11:10.310 --> 02:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
of legal or concrete injury number two
 
02:11:12.350 --> 02:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
the causation that the alleged injury is
 
02:11:15.109 --> 02:11:15.119 align:start position:0%
fairly traceable and challenge to the
 
02:11:17.629 --> 02:11:17.639 align:start position:0%
challenge conduct and lastly
 
02:11:20.310 --> 02:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
redressability the court can redress the
 
02:11:22.229 --> 02:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
alleged injury if grants the plaintiff
 
02:11:25.830 --> 02:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
the requested relief and that's a close
 
02:11:30.390 --> 02:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
out on the um on this on my case um one
 
02:11:32.750 --> 02:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
of my favorite subjects State
 
02:11:35.109 --> 02:11:35.119 align:start position:0%
citizenship not knowing the difference
 
02:11:37.510 --> 02:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
between state and federal jurisdiction
 
02:11:40.030 --> 02:11:40.040 align:start position:0%
has caused us all kinds of trouble and
 
02:11:41.950 --> 02:11:41.960 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping to make it really simple for
 
02:11:45.189 --> 02:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
you here today so that's the header of
 
02:11:47.790 --> 02:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
my third cat third and final category
 
02:11:50.589 --> 02:11:50.599 align:start position:0%
today question number three question of
 
02:11:52.430 --> 02:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
citizenship citizen of the State of New
 
02:11:54.470 --> 02:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire versus a citizen of the United
 
02:11:56.709 --> 02:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
States what's the difference and how
 
02:11:58.629 --> 02:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
does it affect voting rights and
 
02:12:00.629 --> 02:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
immigration Naturalization rights most
 
02:12:02.149 --> 02:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
people don't put the two together but
 
02:12:03.629 --> 02:12:03.639 align:start position:0%
they're directly connected and you'll
 
02:12:06.149 --> 02:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
see why when I get there I'm going to
 
02:12:08.790 --> 02:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
quote an old case it's uh one of my
 
02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
favorites Susan B Anthony was famous for
 
02:12:13.549 --> 02:12:13.559 align:start position:0%
women's suffrage but she's also famous
 
02:12:15.990 --> 02:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
for another issue which is her case in
 
02:12:18.270 --> 02:12:18.280 align:start position:0%
1873 which I'm going to quote the US
 
02:12:20.910 --> 02:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court on the right of privilege
 
02:12:23.589 --> 02:12:23.599 align:start position:0%
of voting is one arising under the
 
02:12:26.109 --> 02:12:26.119 align:start position:0%
constitution of the state and not under
 
02:12:28.709 --> 02:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
the Constitution of the United States
 
02:12:30.709 --> 02:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
the qualifications are different in
 
02:12:34.149 --> 02:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
different states citizenship age sex
 
02:12:36.270 --> 02:12:36.280 align:start position:0%
residence are virt are variously
 
02:12:38.430 --> 02:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
required in the different states or may
 
02:12:41.229 --> 02:12:41.239 align:start position:0%
be so if the right belongs to any
 
02:12:43.069 --> 02:12:43.079 align:start position:0%
particular person it's because such a
 
02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
person is entitled to it by the laws of
 
02:12:48.750 --> 02:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
the state where he offers to exercise it
 
02:12:50.629 --> 02:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
and not because of citizenship of the
 
02:12:54.189 --> 02:12:54.199 align:start position:0%
United States States US versus
 
02:12:56.990 --> 02:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
Anthony the excuse me the confusion for
 
02:12:58.709 --> 02:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
most people begins with the wrong
 
02:13:00.189 --> 02:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
understanding of the US Constitution
 
02:13:03.149 --> 02:13:03.159 align:start position:0%
14th Amendment which states quote all
 
02:13:05.109 --> 02:13:05.119 align:start position:0%
persons born or naturalized in the
 
02:13:06.950 --> 02:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
United States and subject to the
 
02:13:09.629 --> 02:13:09.639 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the
 
02:13:12.950 --> 02:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
United States and the state wherein they
 
02:13:15.990 --> 02:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
reside article 4 section two of the US
 
02:13:18.910 --> 02:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution provides citizens of each
 
02:13:21.470 --> 02:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
state shall be entitled to privilege and
 
02:13:23.270 --> 02:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
immunities of citizens of the several
 
02:13:26.950 --> 02:13:26.960 align:start position:0%
States citing or citing US versus
 
02:13:29.589 --> 02:13:29.599 align:start position:0%
Anthony this right to travel and its
 
02:13:31.830 --> 02:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
protections afforded to citizens of the
 
02:13:34.350 --> 02:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
several states does not include the
 
02:13:36.589 --> 02:13:36.599 align:start position:0%
right of suffrage under the state or US
 
02:13:38.709 --> 02:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
Constitution so let me break this all
 
02:13:41.069 --> 02:13:41.079 align:start position:0%
down for you what they're basically
 
02:13:43.549 --> 02:13:43.559 align:start position:0%
saying is that the 14th amendment was a
 
02:13:46.750 --> 02:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
solution uh to the the free slave
 
02:13:49.830 --> 02:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
problem right so what did they do the
 
02:13:52.109 --> 02:13:52.119 align:start position:0%
the black codes and the black rules were
 
02:13:54.950 --> 02:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
excluding freed African slaves from
 
02:13:56.549 --> 02:13:56.559 align:start position:0%
their their right of suffrage and to be
 
02:14:00.470 --> 02:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
treated like other state citizens and so
 
02:14:02.669 --> 02:14:02.679 align:start position:0%
what happened for many years I believed
 
02:14:04.830 --> 02:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
wrongly that the US Constitution or the
 
02:14:06.870 --> 02:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
14th amendment created two class of
 
02:14:10.229 --> 02:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
citizenship one state One Federal until
 
02:14:12.189 --> 02:14:12.199 align:start position:0%
I figured out that no it didn't do that
 
02:14:15.549 --> 02:14:15.559 align:start position:0%
at all 14th amendment made very clear
 
02:14:17.950 --> 02:14:17.960 align:start position:0%
that if you are a citizen of a state
 
02:14:19.709 --> 02:14:19.719 align:start position:0%
you're also a citizen of the United
 
02:14:21.830 --> 02:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
States and then the rest of the 14th
 
02:14:24.229 --> 02:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment would apply to you right the
 
02:14:27.069 --> 02:14:27.079 align:start position:0%
equal protection the due process clause
 
02:14:29.310 --> 02:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
those Provisions would apply to you as a
 
02:14:32.549 --> 02:14:32.559 align:start position:0%
citizen of a state and whenever from
 
02:14:34.629 --> 02:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
that point on it's my opinion from that
 
02:14:37.189 --> 02:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
point on whenever you see the word
 
02:14:39.149 --> 02:14:39.159 align:start position:0%
citizen of the United States you're
 
02:14:42.669 --> 02:14:42.679 align:start position:0%
looking at Federal jurisdiction key
 
02:14:45.430 --> 02:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
because I pointed out article 4 section
 
02:14:47.870 --> 02:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
two the privileges and immunities clause
 
02:14:49.750 --> 02:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
and by the way your right to travel
 
02:14:51.910 --> 02:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
under that provision deals with Commerce
 
02:14:54.350 --> 02:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
and it's articulated very eloquently in
 
02:14:58.709 --> 02:14:58.719 align:start position:0%
the article four of the um Articles of
 
02:15:00.510 --> 02:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
Confederation and the Supreme Court has
 
02:15:02.030 --> 02:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
reaffirmed if you really want to know
 
02:15:03.189 --> 02:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
what the privileges and immunities
 
02:15:04.910 --> 02:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
clause says read that because that's
 
02:15:06.910 --> 02:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
what the Supreme Court says it should be
 
02:15:08.629 --> 02:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
what its interpretation and what does
 
02:15:10.750 --> 02:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
that mean you have the protected right
 
02:15:12.470 --> 02:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
under the US Constitution to travel
 
02:15:14.390 --> 02:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
anywhere you want you can go from New
 
02:15:16.109 --> 02:15:16.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to California to Alaska to
 
02:15:18.830 --> 02:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
Hawaii unfettered no checking at the
 
02:15:21.910 --> 02:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
border um and
 
02:15:24.109 --> 02:15:24.119 align:start position:0%
the right to be treated for example
 
02:15:25.950 --> 02:15:25.960 align:start position:0%
you're born in Massachusetts you're a
 
02:15:28.790 --> 02:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts citizens citizen by birth
 
02:15:30.350 --> 02:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
but you want to run a business in New
 
02:15:32.350 --> 02:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire across the border New
 
02:15:34.790 --> 02:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has to treat you the same as
 
02:15:36.790 --> 02:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
its own citizens it can't treat you
 
02:15:39.189 --> 02:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
differently but guess what there isn't
 
02:15:42.109 --> 02:15:42.119 align:start position:0%
there is no case precedent there is no
 
02:15:45.270 --> 02:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh Provisions whatsoever where the 14th
 
02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:46.510 align:start position:0%
uh Provisions whatsoever where the 14th
Amendment

02:15:46.510 --> 02:15:46.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
02:15:49.069 --> 02:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
nullifies the the uh privileges and
 
02:15:50.549 --> 02:15:50.559 align:start position:0%
immunities clause in other words the
 
02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
privileg an immunities clause when you
 
02:15:53.790 --> 02:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
move from California let's say you were
 
02:15:55.310 --> 02:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
born there and you move and you want to
 
02:15:56.910 --> 02:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
go to school at UNH or Dartmouth or
 
02:15:59.470 --> 02:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
wherever right you don't automatically
 
02:16:01.270 --> 02:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
inherit the right to vote when you
 
02:16:03.189 --> 02:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
arrive here and I'm going to use my
 
02:16:05.430 --> 02:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
personal uh my personal story as an
 
02:16:08.229 --> 02:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
example I was born in Canada was
 
02:16:10.189 --> 02:16:10.199 align:start position:0%
naturalized in New Hampshire when I
 
02:16:12.109 --> 02:16:12.119 align:start position:0%
joined the military they shipped me to
 
02:16:14.589 --> 02:16:14.599 align:start position:0%
Texas I was still a citizen of New
 
02:16:16.950 --> 02:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and when I lived in Texas I
 
02:16:19.589 --> 02:16:19.599 align:start position:0%
was a Texas resident see the words have
 
02:16:22.069 --> 02:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
been manipulated in flipped around
 
02:16:24.430 --> 02:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
causing a lot of confusion but I was a
 
02:16:26.629 --> 02:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
resident of Texas residing there because
 
02:16:29.589 --> 02:16:29.599 align:start position:0%
of military duty and I had to vote
 
02:16:31.350 --> 02:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
absentee in New Hampshire just like the
 
02:16:33.429 --> 02:16:33.439 align:start position:0%
college kids should in my opinion and
 
02:16:35.389 --> 02:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
then when I was deployed to the deployed
 
02:16:37.950 --> 02:16:37.960 align:start position:0%
to Europe was a living in the United
 
02:16:39.910 --> 02:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
Kingdom for three years I was a resident
 
02:16:41.910 --> 02:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
of the United Kingdom but I was still a
 
02:16:44.230 --> 02:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
citizen of New Hampshire and for federal
 
02:16:46.790 --> 02:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
purposes a citizen of the United States
 
02:16:49.830 --> 02:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
so this is the key to this change and I
 
02:16:52.910 --> 02:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
found the evidence in the original 1808
 
02:16:55.110 --> 02:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
law of New Hampshire where there is the
 
02:16:58.150 --> 02:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
provision to make this all
 
02:17:01.110 --> 02:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
happen now currently this is really
 
02:17:04.190 --> 02:17:04.200 align:start position:0%
important part the word inhabitant is
 
02:17:06.309 --> 02:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
defined by the Constitution in part two
 
02:17:09.349 --> 02:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
article 30 and it means specifically
 
02:17:12.190 --> 02:17:12.200 align:start position:0%
someone that possesses political Rights
 
02:17:14.110 --> 02:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
Article 30 when it was first written in
 
02:17:16.709 --> 02:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
1784 before it was altered in
 
02:17:19.669 --> 02:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
1976 said that all persons born or
 
02:17:21.349 --> 02:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
naturalized I'm sorry I'm quoting the
 
02:17:25.270 --> 02:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
14th Amendment uh it says every person
 
02:17:27.870 --> 02:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
qualified and sub excuse me I keep
 
02:17:32.429 --> 02:17:32.439 align:start position:0%
flipping the two around article 30 and
 
02:17:33.709 --> 02:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
every person qualified as the
 
02:17:34.910 --> 02:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution provides shall be
 
02:17:36.150 --> 02:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
considered an inhabitant for the
 
02:17:38.150 --> 02:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
purposes of electing or being elected
 
02:17:39.669 --> 02:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
into that office where he dwelleth and
 
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
hath his home that's pretty close so
 
02:17:45.429 --> 02:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
what does that word mean in 1976 the
 
02:17:47.429 --> 02:17:47.439 align:start position:0%
state legislature did something it
 
02:17:49.910 --> 02:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have done it posed five yes or
 
02:17:52.389 --> 02:17:52.399 align:start position:0%
no questions to the voters and the
 
02:17:55.830 --> 02:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
domicile question comes to life now I
 
02:17:57.790 --> 02:17:57.800 align:start position:0%
know for sure the the meaning of
 
02:18:00.270 --> 02:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
domicile because there's a famous case
 
02:18:01.950 --> 02:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire called Newberg
 
02:18:04.750 --> 02:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
versus Peterson Newberg versus Peterson
 
02:18:07.669 --> 02:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
the backstory was a a young man born in
 
02:18:10.190 --> 02:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in the area of
 
02:18:14.270 --> 02:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth was um went to vote and he
 
02:18:15.830 --> 02:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
told the supervisor of the checklist
 
02:18:17.270 --> 02:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
that when he graduated from school he
 
02:18:19.709 --> 02:18:19.719 align:start position:0%
was going to move to Hawaii well they
 
02:18:22.070 --> 02:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
they disallowed him casting his ballot
 
02:18:24.349 --> 02:18:24.359 align:start position:0%
so he sued in federal court and won
 
02:18:26.429 --> 02:18:26.439 align:start position:0%
because they had no right cuz he had the
 
02:18:29.070 --> 02:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
birth right he was born here and there
 
02:18:31.349 --> 02:18:31.359 align:start position:0%
he was a qualified voter by birth
 
02:18:34.150 --> 02:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
because of the immigration of
 
02:18:37.110 --> 02:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
naturalization and the federal court had
 
02:18:39.629 --> 02:18:39.639 align:start position:0%
to figure out what dwelleth in ha's home
 
02:18:42.309 --> 02:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
means because domicile doesn't exist
 
02:18:42.319 --> 02:18:43.549 align:start position:0%
means because domicile doesn't exist
until

02:18:43.549 --> 02:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
until
 
02:18:46.230 --> 02:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
1976 so they considered that and the
 
02:18:49.709 --> 02:18:49.719 align:start position:0%
federal judge said that dwelleth in ha's
 
02:18:52.950 --> 02:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
home is an old style of English that
 
02:18:52.960 --> 02:18:54.110 align:start position:0%
home is an old style of English that
means

02:18:54.110 --> 02:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
means
 
02:18:56.589 --> 02:18:56.599 align:start position:0%
domicile so why did I tell you that
 
02:18:59.589 --> 02:18:59.599 align:start position:0%
story because in 1976 they POS five yes
 
02:19:02.509 --> 02:19:02.519 align:start position:0%
or no questions to the voters question
 
02:19:04.549 --> 02:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
one was already law the voting age had
 
02:19:06.990 --> 02:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
already been reduced from 21 to 18 why
 
02:19:11.389 --> 02:19:11.399 align:start position:0%
is it the lead question e question e
 
02:19:13.669 --> 02:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
absentee voting was supposed to be
 
02:19:16.389 --> 02:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
created by this amendment of 1976 which
 
02:19:19.030 --> 02:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't true cuz that happened in
 
02:19:21.230 --> 02:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
1942 question B
 
02:19:25.070 --> 02:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
and question d one was the doile
 
02:19:27.910 --> 02:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
question D was changing the month from
 
02:19:30.750 --> 02:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
January to December as to when we're
 
02:19:32.150 --> 02:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
going to announce the outcome of the
 
02:19:34.389 --> 02:19:34.399 align:start position:0%
election those have all those have been
 
02:19:36.230 --> 02:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
adjudicated already and have been struck
 
02:19:39.389 --> 02:19:39.399 align:start position:0%
down by the court so why did they go
 
02:19:41.709 --> 02:19:41.719 align:start position:0%
through all of this trouble to swap the
 
02:19:44.790 --> 02:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
word inhabitant in doile they told the
 
02:19:47.150 --> 02:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
voters that if you pass this that we're
 
02:19:49.710 --> 02:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
now going to focus on domicile instead
 
02:19:52.230 --> 02:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
of inhabitant and this was the beginning
 
02:19:53.349 --> 02:19:53.359 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:19:55.550 --> 02:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
chaos because they had done one other
 
02:19:58.670 --> 02:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
thing they had removed five words from
 
02:20:00.190 --> 02:20:00.200 align:start position:0%
the word citizen of the United States
 
02:20:03.150 --> 02:20:03.160 align:start position:0%
from the original Law quote being native
 
02:20:06.230 --> 02:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
born or naturalized citizen of the
 
02:20:07.750 --> 02:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
United States if you remove the
 
02:20:09.550 --> 02:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
modifying language in front of the word
 
02:20:12.070 --> 02:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
citizen of the United States you would
 
02:20:15.670 --> 02:20:15.680 align:start position:0%
now be saying that you have they they
 
02:20:17.309 --> 02:20:17.319 align:start position:0%
detailed the manner in which you became
 
02:20:19.630 --> 02:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
a state citizen this was a big deal
 
02:20:21.910 --> 02:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
because without it if you're going to
 
02:20:24.950 --> 02:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
refer to a qualified voter based on his
 
02:20:27.750 --> 02:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
citizenship status right and you use the
 
02:20:29.870 --> 02:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
word citizen of the United States that
 
02:20:33.469 --> 02:20:33.479 align:start position:0%
applies to every all 50 states every
 
02:20:35.230 --> 02:20:35.240 align:start position:0%
person born in the United States can
 
02:20:37.750 --> 02:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
move here tomorrow check into a hotel
 
02:20:41.110 --> 02:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
room take that receipt go register at
 
02:20:44.190 --> 02:20:44.200 align:start position:0%
the local new town hall because you said
 
02:20:45.710 --> 02:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
a citizen of the United well that's
 
02:20:47.590 --> 02:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
every American who's been born or
 
02:20:49.990 --> 02:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
naturalized because you weren't focusing
 
02:20:51.910 --> 02:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
on State citizenship so if you're not
 
02:20:54.469 --> 02:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
going to refer to State citizenship they
 
02:20:56.750 --> 02:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
started using the word residence and
 
02:20:59.630 --> 02:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
they started using the word domicile and
 
02:21:03.110 --> 02:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
both of them only declare one thing that
 
02:21:06.429 --> 02:21:06.439 align:start position:0%
you live somewhere the word reside
 
02:21:09.270 --> 02:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
residence or resident don't mean
 
02:21:11.190 --> 02:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
anything in anyone's dictionary going
 
02:21:13.550 --> 02:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
back to before the Revolution other than
 
02:21:16.429 --> 02:21:16.439 align:start position:0%
you live there but State citizenship on
 
02:21:18.630 --> 02:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
the other hand and here's the key Point
 
02:21:20.389 --> 02:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
under federal law most people don't know
 
02:21:20.399 --> 02:21:21.150 align:start position:0%
under federal law most people don't know
this

02:21:21.150 --> 02:21:21.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:21:23.590 --> 02:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
under federal law it's illegal since the
 
02:21:27.030 --> 02:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
early 1970s to apply a durational
 
02:21:29.349 --> 02:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
residency requirement in order to cast a
 
02:21:31.590 --> 02:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
ballot or to register to vote so in
 
02:21:33.190 --> 02:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
other words the state legislature is
 
02:21:35.309 --> 02:21:35.319 align:start position:0%
precluded by federal law to say you got
 
02:21:38.070 --> 02:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
to live here for 30 days can't do that
 
02:21:40.830 --> 02:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
but here's the hook if you make it State
 
02:21:43.030 --> 02:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
citizenship the state has its Sovereign
 
02:21:46.030 --> 02:21:46.040 align:start position:0%
authority to Define who its citizens are
 
02:21:47.429 --> 02:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
this goes back to the beginning of the
 
02:21:49.070 --> 02:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
found the beginning of the Republic
 
02:21:50.590 --> 02:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
under the first immigration
 
02:21:53.190 --> 02:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
Naturalization Act of 1790 won't bore
 
02:21:54.670 --> 02:21:54.680 align:start position:0%
you with all the details but from that
 
02:21:56.710 --> 02:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
point forward the states retained under
 
02:21:58.190 --> 02:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
their Sovereign Authority Under the 9th
 
02:22:00.790 --> 02:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
and 10th Amendment the ability to retain
 
02:22:02.910 --> 02:22:02.920 align:start position:0%
their right to Def to Define who their
 
02:22:06.230 --> 02:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
citizens are now this was in effect from
 
02:22:10.230 --> 02:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
1808 all the way to
 
02:22:13.190 --> 02:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
1973 and then it went away they they n
 
02:22:14.830 --> 02:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
three years later we get the domile
 
02:22:16.630 --> 02:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
question and everything's been a chaos
 
02:22:18.710 --> 02:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
ever since and only thing we've gotten
 
02:22:21.270 --> 02:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
out of it is billable hours
 
02:22:23.190 --> 02:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
because it just doesn't get solved and
 
02:22:25.230 --> 02:22:25.240 align:start position:0%
we keep looking for solutions that don't
 
02:22:27.230 --> 02:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
and so article 38 of the Bill of Rights
 
02:22:29.389 --> 02:22:29.399 align:start position:0%
says that the best thing to do is to go
 
02:22:32.469 --> 02:22:32.479 align:start position:0%
backwards and to look at what was there
 
02:22:35.750 --> 02:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
before so that is the issue on state
 
02:22:40.389 --> 02:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
citizenship inhabitant defined now um
 
02:22:42.670 --> 02:22:42.680 align:start position:0%
bottom of page 10 is my first provision
 
02:22:44.830 --> 02:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
to inhabitant defined and I'll run
 
02:22:47.030 --> 02:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
through the list very quickly this court
 
02:22:48.670 --> 02:22:48.680 align:start position:0%
reaffirmed the definition of the word
 
02:22:50.309 --> 02:22:50.319 align:start position:0%
inhabitant in the following opinion of
 
02:22:52.110 --> 02:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
the justices in
 
02:22:55.150 --> 02:22:55.160 align:start position:0%
1927 same thing here another decision
 
02:22:56.550 --> 02:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
every person qualified as the
 
02:22:57.830 --> 02:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution provides shall be
 
02:22:59.230 --> 02:22:59.240 align:start position:0%
considered an inhabitant for the
 
02:23:01.389 --> 02:23:01.399 align:start position:0%
purposes of electing or being elected
 
02:23:04.030 --> 02:23:04.040 align:start position:0%
into office the state constitution says
 
02:23:06.550 --> 02:23:06.560 align:start position:0%
the same why do we keep in statute
 
02:23:08.910 --> 02:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
referring to people as residents and
 
02:23:11.150 --> 02:23:11.160 align:start position:0%
domicile when the Constitution requires
 
02:23:13.469 --> 02:23:13.479 align:start position:0%
the use of
 
02:23:17.830 --> 02:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
inhabitant and with that I need a
 
02:23:33.469 --> 02:23:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:19.349 --> 02:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:19.359 --> 02:24:49.309 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:24:49.309 --> 02:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:49.319 --> 02:25:19.309 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:25:19.309 --> 02:25:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:19.319 --> 02:25:49.230 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:25:49.230 --> 02:25:49.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:49.240 --> 02:26:19.230 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:26:19.230 --> 02:26:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:19.240 --> 02:26:49.230 align:start position:0%

will reconvene and continue to hear Mr
 
02:30:07.070 --> 02:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
Richard's testimony um just uh for
 
02:30:09.150 --> 02:30:09.160 align:start position:0%
context we were on the topic of
 
02:30:12.110 --> 02:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
citizenship I think this is of uh great
 
02:30:15.110 --> 02:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
interest to the subcommittee and perhaps
 
02:30:17.190 --> 02:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
the election law committee at large so
 
02:30:20.550 --> 02:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh please continue and uh
 
02:30:25.510 --> 02:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:29.950 --> 02:30:29.960 align:start position:0%
time thank you so much uh page 13 of my
 
02:30:32.429 --> 02:30:32.439 align:start position:0%
testimony how to become a state citizen
 
02:30:34.910 --> 02:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
this is the 1808
 
02:30:38.269 --> 02:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
law and um what's fascinating about this
 
02:30:41.750 --> 02:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
chapter 49 is that it happened 18 years
 
02:30:43.630 --> 02:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
after the US Constitution went into
 
02:30:47.590 --> 02:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
effect so what's important is the
 
02:30:50.870 --> 02:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
understanding of how both the state
 
02:30:53.030 --> 02:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
and federal constitutions work together
 
02:30:55.750 --> 02:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
in this document and so let me go
 
02:30:58.990 --> 02:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
through it uh this was the original text
 
02:31:01.349 --> 02:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
um being enacted by the Senate and the
 
02:31:03.070 --> 02:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives in the general
 
02:31:05.030 --> 02:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
court convened that every male
 
02:31:07.030 --> 02:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
inhabitant of each town and Parish with
 
02:31:09.269 --> 02:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
it with Town Privileges and places
 
02:31:12.950 --> 02:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
unincorporated the state being a natural
 
02:31:15.309 --> 02:31:15.319 align:start position:0%
born or naturalized citizen of the
 
02:31:17.590 --> 02:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
United States that's what I was alluding
 
02:31:20.710 --> 02:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
to earlier of 21 years of age and
 
02:31:23.469 --> 02:31:23.479 align:start position:0%
upwards again 1808 women were excluded
 
02:31:26.510 --> 02:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
and you had to be 21 and and just uh
 
02:31:30.150 --> 02:31:30.160 align:start position:0%
just to clarify Mr Richard uh the
 
02:31:32.910 --> 02:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
underline bolded text is your
 
02:31:35.429 --> 02:31:35.439 align:start position:0%
highlighting of that text it was not in
 
02:31:38.389 --> 02:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
that original no it's there it's there
 
02:31:41.349 --> 02:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
to for a special Focus because that is
 
02:31:43.389 --> 02:31:43.399 align:start position:0%
what was modified by representative
 
02:31:46.910 --> 02:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
Sanborn House Bill 363 in
 
02:31:49.630 --> 02:31:49.640 align:start position:0%
1973 he was concerned he must have been
 
02:31:52.710 --> 02:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
a Soldier he was concerned that he his
 
02:31:57.269 --> 02:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
children would have um without fixing
 
02:31:59.469 --> 02:31:59.479 align:start position:0%
what he perceived as a problem that they
 
02:32:02.870 --> 02:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
would be impacted by being born
 
02:32:05.349 --> 02:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
abroad and so that's why he wanted the
 
02:32:07.830 --> 02:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
language change to citizen of the United
 
02:32:10.070 --> 02:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
States instead of a citizen of the state
 
02:32:11.349 --> 02:32:11.359 align:start position:0%
thinking he wouldn't have the same
 
02:32:13.190 --> 02:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
protections but he didn't know the
 
02:32:16.230 --> 02:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
immigration policy which was if you are
 
02:32:17.750 --> 02:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
if you are born in the United States
 
02:32:20.389 --> 02:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
like John McCain or Ted Cruz right and
 
02:32:22.710 --> 02:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
then you're born of American parents
 
02:32:25.110 --> 02:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
while deployed for any reason or it
 
02:32:26.429 --> 02:32:26.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter as long as your parents
 
02:32:30.429 --> 02:32:30.439 align:start position:0%
were were Americans um but anyway that
 
02:32:32.429 --> 02:32:32.439 align:start position:0%
language was removed being a
 
02:32:34.990 --> 02:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
natural-born or a naturalized citizen of
 
02:32:37.110 --> 02:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
the United States when I first read this
 
02:32:40.070 --> 02:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
I was confused I said if the federal
 
02:32:41.990 --> 02:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
government under Article 1 Section 8 of
 
02:32:43.630 --> 02:32:43.640 align:start position:0%
the enumerated powers for the federal
 
02:32:45.790 --> 02:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
Congress gives them the responsibility
 
02:32:48.150 --> 02:32:48.160 align:start position:0%
to naturalize people what are they
 
02:32:50.830 --> 02:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
talking about in a state statute
 
02:32:53.590 --> 02:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
and then the following chapter gives us
 
02:32:53.600 --> 02:32:54.550 align:start position:0%
and then the following chapter gives us
the

02:32:54.550 --> 02:32:54.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:32:57.710 --> 02:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
answer 21 years of excuse me 21 years of
 
02:32:59.469 --> 02:32:59.479 align:start position:0%
age and upwards accepting poppers and
 
02:33:01.309 --> 02:33:01.319 align:start position:0%
persons excused from paying taxes at
 
02:33:03.950 --> 02:33:03.960 align:start position:0%
their own expense shall have a right at
 
02:33:05.510 --> 02:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
the annual or other meetings of the
 
02:33:07.630 --> 02:33:07.640 align:start position:0%
inhabitant of said town and parishes to
 
02:33:09.790 --> 02:33:09.800 align:start position:0%
vote in the town or Parish where he
 
02:33:12.630 --> 02:33:12.640 align:start position:0%
dwells and has hath his home there's
 
02:33:15.349 --> 02:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
that language again that no person shall
 
02:33:17.469 --> 02:33:17.479 align:start position:0%
be considered an inhabitant in any Town
 
02:33:19.469 --> 02:33:19.479 align:start position:0%
Parish in the state for the purposes of
 
02:33:22.030 --> 02:33:22.040 align:start position:0%
voting unless he have resided in such a
 
02:33:24.190 --> 02:33:24.200 align:start position:0%
place for 6 months or it become a
 
02:33:26.510 --> 02:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
Freeholder that was common practice to
 
02:33:29.309 --> 02:33:29.319 align:start position:0%
be holding land and having
 
02:33:31.910 --> 02:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
resources now here's the here's the part
 
02:33:33.550 --> 02:33:33.560 align:start position:0%
that I think that we can incorporate
 
02:33:35.469 --> 02:33:35.479 align:start position:0%
into the legislature now to fix this
 
02:33:38.630 --> 02:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
problem and I've I think I sent you a
 
02:33:42.150 --> 02:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
copy of I've consolidating 50 chapters
 
02:33:43.790 --> 02:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
of election law in the five and a half
 
02:33:45.510 --> 02:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
pages I did it three years ago and I got
 
02:33:47.790 --> 02:33:47.800 align:start position:0%
Bill Gardner he loved the idea he says
 
02:33:50.309 --> 02:33:50.319 align:start position:0%
the only problem Dan is politics
 
02:33:52.110 --> 02:33:52.120 align:start position:0%
neither party is likely to let you move
 
02:33:53.750 --> 02:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
this forward but there wasn't an
 
02:33:55.790 --> 02:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
appetite to fix the problem then and
 
02:33:58.670 --> 02:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
that's where the affidavit uh ballot
 
02:34:00.670 --> 02:34:00.680 align:start position:0%
came from I work with various people on
 
02:34:03.790 --> 02:34:03.800 align:start position:0%
that but this is the solution right here
 
02:34:06.469 --> 02:34:06.479 align:start position:0%
section two and be it further enacted
 
02:34:09.830 --> 02:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
that no person not being a citizen of
 
02:34:12.389 --> 02:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
this state that's very clear of the
 
02:34:14.190 --> 02:34:14.200 align:start position:0%
state or of the United States shall be
 
02:34:16.590 --> 02:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
entitled to vote at any town meeting for
 
02:34:18.790 --> 02:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
the choice of state county or town
 
02:34:21.389 --> 02:34:21.399 align:start position:0%
offices unless he shall have resided
 
02:34:23.670 --> 02:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
within the state for 2 years and shall
 
02:34:25.630 --> 02:34:25.640 align:start position:0%
have made an oath before some justice of
 
02:34:27.950 --> 02:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
the peace or other person authorized to
 
02:34:30.389 --> 02:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
administer oath that he will bear faith
 
02:34:31.910 --> 02:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
and true allegiance to the state of New
 
02:34:34.469 --> 02:34:34.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and to the United States and
 
02:34:37.269 --> 02:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
will support the Constitutions plural
 
02:34:39.870 --> 02:34:39.880 align:start position:0%
constitutions thereof provided however
 
02:34:41.950 --> 02:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
and they repeat themselves that no
 
02:34:44.790 --> 02:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
person not a citizen of this state of
 
02:34:46.870 --> 02:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
the United or of the United States shall
 
02:34:49.150 --> 02:34:49.160 align:start position:0%
be considered qualified to fill any
 
02:34:51.950 --> 02:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
County or State office the rest of it is
 
02:34:53.830 --> 02:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
there for your reading pleasure I won't
 
02:34:55.469 --> 02:34:55.479 align:start position:0%
bore you with any details that was the
 
02:34:58.429 --> 02:34:58.439 align:start position:0%
point I wanted to make that the the key
 
02:35:00.429 --> 02:35:00.439 align:start position:0%
is and by the way the 2-year durational
 
02:35:03.469 --> 02:35:03.479 align:start position:0%
residency in this law in 1808 was in
 
02:35:05.389 --> 02:35:05.399 align:start position:0%
harmony with the same durational
 
02:35:07.630 --> 02:35:07.640 align:start position:0%
residency for immigration at the federal
 
02:35:10.710 --> 02:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
level so they adopted the same policy if
 
02:35:13.670 --> 02:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
we were to adopt it here it it could be
 
02:35:16.429 --> 02:35:16.439 align:start position:0%
I know that there's talk about college
 
02:35:19.070 --> 02:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
kids and instate tuition right when are
 
02:35:21.630 --> 02:35:21.640 align:start position:0%
you elig and I believe the rule used to
 
02:35:23.469 --> 02:35:23.479 align:start position:0%
be you had to live here for a year
 
02:35:24.750 --> 02:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
before you'd be
 
02:35:27.230 --> 02:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
entitled uh just just to clarify we
 
02:35:30.230 --> 02:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
actually heard um testimony from Mr
 
02:35:32.510 --> 02:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
O'Brien earlier today from America votes
 
02:35:34.630 --> 02:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
that actually the
 
02:35:38.710 --> 02:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
current um criteria is at the time of
 
02:35:41.110 --> 02:35:41.120 align:start position:0%
admission and that is their status
 
02:35:44.349 --> 02:35:44.359 align:start position:0%
throughout their duration at the college
 
02:35:46.830 --> 02:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
so you know the in state if they're in
 
02:35:48.910 --> 02:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
state at the time of admission they're
 
02:35:51.150 --> 02:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
out of state at the time they're out of
 
02:35:53.990 --> 02:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
state at the time of of admission
 
02:35:56.790 --> 02:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether or not they change
 
02:36:01.910 --> 02:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
residency um statewise so um I would say
 
02:36:04.469 --> 02:36:04.479 align:start position:0%
also I I would say for some people may
 
02:36:09.389 --> 02:36:09.399 align:start position:0%
may think that this um taking an oath to
 
02:36:09.399 --> 02:36:11.110 align:start position:0%
may think that this um taking an oath to
and

02:36:11.110 --> 02:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:36:13.790 --> 02:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh with uh allegiance to the state of
 
02:36:14.990 --> 02:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and the United States
 
02:36:18.349 --> 02:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
might seem archaic and um but that is
 
02:36:19.870 --> 02:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
exactly the same oath that all
 
02:36:22.110 --> 02:36:22.120 align:start position:0%
Representatives Senators Governor etc
 
02:36:24.990 --> 02:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
etc take when we're sworn in so this is
 
02:36:28.070 --> 02:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
not really an unusual practice or an
 
02:36:30.110 --> 02:36:30.120 align:start position:0%
outdated practice it's something that
 
02:36:32.230 --> 02:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
all your elected officials
 
02:36:36.910 --> 02:36:36.920 align:start position:0%
are um required to do at that um at the
 
02:36:40.750 --> 02:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
time that they become uh uh accept that
 
02:36:42.389 --> 02:36:42.399 align:start position:0%
that election result and become an
 
02:36:46.910 --> 02:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
elected official so
 
02:36:52.630 --> 02:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:55.230 --> 02:36:55.240 align:start position:0%
on all right was there were there any
 
02:36:58.030 --> 02:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
other uh I so I thank you for
 
02:37:00.510 --> 02:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
highlighting that let me if if I could
 
02:37:04.910 --> 02:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
just ask a couple of questions yes um
 
02:37:08.349 --> 02:37:08.359 align:start position:0%
so how so if someone you know how would
 
02:37:12.150 --> 02:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
you handle this so suppose um we we have
 
02:37:14.870 --> 02:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh what we refer to as snowbirds who uh
 
02:37:18.510 --> 02:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
live in two places you know uh Southern
 
02:37:21.110 --> 02:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
climates um I'm not talking
 
02:37:24.389 --> 02:37:24.399 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts but uh uh Florida and uh
 
02:37:26.790 --> 02:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
the Carolinas or something like that and
 
02:37:29.110 --> 02:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
people who are up here portion of the
 
02:37:32.830 --> 02:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
year if under this scenario if you had
 
02:37:35.309 --> 02:37:35.319 align:start position:0%
I'm again I I'm asking a hypothetical so
 
02:37:38.070 --> 02:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
I understand that as well if you have
 
02:37:40.309 --> 02:37:40.319 align:start position:0%
someone who were to take such an oath to
 
02:37:43.670 --> 02:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
be a citizen of the State of New
 
02:37:46.910 --> 02:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and then they decide
 
02:37:51.190 --> 02:37:51.200 align:start position:0%
to uh well maintaining a residence here
 
02:37:54.469 --> 02:37:54.479 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire also obtain a residence
 
02:37:56.429 --> 02:37:56.439 align:start position:0%
down in
 
02:37:56.439 --> 02:37:59.269 align:start position:0%
down in
Florida

02:37:59.269 --> 02:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
Florida
 
02:38:02.469 --> 02:38:02.479 align:start position:0%
um at that point I don't see any problem
 
02:38:04.230 --> 02:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
if they
 
02:38:06.550 --> 02:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
maintain uh New Hampshire as their
 
02:38:09.710 --> 02:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
primary residence and they visit they
 
02:38:12.950 --> 02:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
they take a temporary absence and visit
 
02:38:17.790 --> 02:38:17.800 align:start position:0%
Florida occasionally but if they
 
02:38:21.830 --> 02:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
conversely move to Florida and while
 
02:38:24.349 --> 02:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
maintaining the New Hampshire residence
 
02:38:27.389 --> 02:38:27.399 align:start position:0%
but then get a driver's
 
02:38:30.030 --> 02:38:30.040 align:start position:0%
license establish that as their primary
 
02:38:32.950 --> 02:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
residence for federal tax purposes
 
02:38:34.830 --> 02:38:34.840 align:start position:0%
for uh you
 
02:38:37.590 --> 02:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
know uh minimum required distributions
 
02:38:42.429 --> 02:38:42.439 align:start position:0%
of 401ks Etc you know what how how would
 
02:38:45.910 --> 02:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
you handle that scenario what what is
 
02:38:47.790 --> 02:38:47.800 align:start position:0%
there any have you thought about that I
 
02:38:49.790 --> 02:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
have I have yeah the answer answer is
 
02:38:52.150 --> 02:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
straightforward and that is that this is
 
02:38:54.150 --> 02:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
where this this state citizenship
 
02:38:57.790 --> 02:38:57.800 align:start position:0%
solution is is is really a great idea
 
02:39:01.910 --> 02:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
and that is that if you you can swap
 
02:39:04.910 --> 02:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
State citizen with doile the effect of
 
02:39:07.469 --> 02:39:07.479 align:start position:0%
domicile see doile is is elective
 
02:39:09.469 --> 02:39:09.479 align:start position:0%
franchise you elect to declare a
 
02:39:12.349 --> 02:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
domicile when you choose to move right
 
02:39:15.150 --> 02:39:15.160 align:start position:0%
and by the way back on the oath factor
 
02:39:17.630 --> 02:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
that was in effect until 1973 in the
 
02:39:20.630 --> 02:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
last qva before these modifications came
 
02:39:22.910 --> 02:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
to be that's what was in place is that
 
02:39:25.349 --> 02:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
you declared that you met the durational
 
02:39:26.910 --> 02:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
residency requirement to become a
 
02:39:28.150 --> 02:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
citizen of the
 
02:39:31.309 --> 02:39:31.319 align:start position:0%
state and so let's walk through it from
 
02:39:33.349 --> 02:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
my perspective the college kid or the
 
02:39:35.429 --> 02:39:35.439 align:start position:0%
other person as I said earlier in my
 
02:39:38.110 --> 02:39:38.120 align:start position:0%
testimony I was born I was naturalized
 
02:39:40.670 --> 02:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
here so I became a citizen of the state
 
02:39:43.630 --> 02:39:43.640 align:start position:0%
moved to Texas where I was a resident
 
02:39:45.950 --> 02:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
but I still had to vote absentee in New
 
02:39:48.469 --> 02:39:48.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because I wasn't a citizen of
 
02:39:50.910 --> 02:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
Texas the same when you when I went to
 
02:39:54.309 --> 02:39:54.319 align:start position:0%
the UK for 3 years now college kids same
 
02:39:56.790 --> 02:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
thing a college kid born in California
 
02:39:58.910 --> 02:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
has automatic Birthright in the state
 
02:40:01.030 --> 02:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
where they're born and they are citizens
 
02:40:02.590 --> 02:40:02.600 align:start position:0%
of the United States under the 14th
 
02:40:05.750 --> 02:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment if they move to New Hampshire
 
02:40:08.110 --> 02:40:08.120 align:start position:0%
the process used to be the state
 
02:40:10.110 --> 02:40:10.120 align:start position:0%
citizenship route but it got changed to
 
02:40:12.790 --> 02:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
a domicile and what I found that I I
 
02:40:15.030 --> 02:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
spoke I spent some time with um with
 
02:40:17.269 --> 02:40:17.279 align:start position:0%
attorney Brian gold and Bill Gardner
 
02:40:19.429 --> 02:40:19.439 align:start position:0%
about how they disappointed they they
 
02:40:22.910 --> 02:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
were with sb3 collapsing on itself and I
 
02:40:24.950 --> 02:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
thought to myself yeah if anyone had
 
02:40:26.230 --> 02:40:26.240 align:start position:0%
done their homework they'd have figured
 
02:40:28.389 --> 02:40:28.399 align:start position:0%
out why are you attaching durational
 
02:40:30.230 --> 02:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
residency requirement when it's
 
02:40:32.990 --> 02:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
prohibited by federal law because they
 
02:40:36.309 --> 02:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
they spent the GOP spent all of its time
 
02:40:39.230 --> 02:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
trying to Define all the things that
 
02:40:42.190 --> 02:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
apply to a state citizen but make them
 
02:40:44.910 --> 02:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
stick to a resident and and it's the
 
02:40:48.030 --> 02:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
same with um statute 20 in the statutory
 
02:40:51.590 --> 02:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
construction 21 and 216a
 
02:40:55.429 --> 02:40:55.439 align:start position:0%
216 commingles inhabitant and Resident
 
02:40:57.389 --> 02:40:57.399 align:start position:0%
together well how are you going to do
 
02:40:59.190 --> 02:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
that if the Constitution says you got to
 
02:41:01.590 --> 02:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
be an inhabitant but the statute says
 
02:41:04.710 --> 02:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
that an inhabitant or a resident who
 
02:41:06.910 --> 02:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
establish a
 
02:41:09.710 --> 02:41:09.720 align:start position:0%
doile well here's here's a little trivia
 
02:41:11.190 --> 02:41:11.200 align:start position:0%
for you how many times is the word
 
02:41:13.590 --> 02:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
resident used in the state constitution
 
02:41:16.269 --> 02:41:16.279 align:start position:0%
once and it's not in the Bill of Rights
 
02:41:18.269 --> 02:41:18.279 align:start position:0%
it is in contradistinction to the word
 
02:41:21.670 --> 02:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
inhabitant with the word
 
02:41:25.429 --> 02:41:25.439 align:start position:0%
reside uh let me let me uh ask a
 
02:41:27.349 --> 02:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
clarifying question because I want to
 
02:41:29.590 --> 02:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
make sure I'm sometimes slow on the
 
02:41:32.790 --> 02:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
uptake so you're saying that in fact
 
02:41:34.710 --> 02:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
inhabitant is distinguished from
 
02:41:36.910 --> 02:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
Resident absolutely it has a
 
02:41:39.030 --> 02:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional definition and I would
 
02:41:42.070 --> 02:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
argue in 1976 what was really a foot
 
02:41:44.950 --> 02:41:44.960 align:start position:0%
with the domicile game was prior to that
 
02:41:47.389 --> 02:41:47.399 align:start position:0%
it was well understood I have a long
 
02:41:49.309 --> 02:41:49.319 align:start position:0%
list of the diff definitions of
 
02:41:51.389 --> 02:41:51.399 align:start position:0%
inhabitant I read a couple of lines the
 
02:41:53.190 --> 02:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
rest of it is there it's like 30
 
02:41:54.990 --> 02:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
different places where the word
 
02:41:56.990 --> 02:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
inhabitant is defined by the
 
02:41:59.309 --> 02:41:59.319 align:start position:0%
Constitution and what the legislature at
 
02:42:01.590 --> 02:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
the time didn't like is that voter
 
02:42:03.230 --> 02:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
qualifications were defined by the
 
02:42:06.070 --> 02:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution and not the legislature so
 
02:42:09.750 --> 02:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
the domicile game became well if we qual
 
02:42:11.990 --> 02:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
if we use the word domicile someone
 
02:42:14.870 --> 02:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
establishing a domicile the legislature
 
02:42:17.910 --> 02:42:17.920 align:start position:0%
gets to Define what those qualifications
 
02:42:20.950 --> 02:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
are where it shouldn't be imagine your
 
02:42:23.309 --> 02:42:23.319 align:start position:0%
employees you start a company and you
 
02:42:25.990 --> 02:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
write an an employment manual on how to
 
02:42:28.230 --> 02:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
elect more or how to hire more employees
 
02:42:31.870 --> 02:42:31.880 align:start position:0%
Freudian slip sorry but what happens is
 
02:42:33.870 --> 02:42:33.880 align:start position:0%
and then all of a sudden the manual that
 
02:42:35.830 --> 02:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
you wrote on how you want your employees
 
02:42:37.550 --> 02:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
the qualifications you want for anyone
 
02:42:40.269 --> 02:42:40.279 align:start position:0%
working for you and now you change it
 
02:42:41.389 --> 02:42:41.399 align:start position:0%
and now your
 
02:42:44.030 --> 02:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
employees that's the problem right the
 
02:42:46.710 --> 02:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
elected class Article 1 Section 8 our
 
02:42:50.030 --> 02:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative body are now deciding who
 
02:42:53.190 --> 02:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
gets how they reelect themselves that's
 
02:42:55.269 --> 02:42:55.279 align:start position:0%
what's flawed about that about that line
 
02:43:00.070 --> 02:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
of of logic but I I digress um did I
 
02:43:02.750 --> 02:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
answer the question yeah yes I think so
 
02:43:06.710 --> 02:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
because what you're if I'm uh if I'm
 
02:43:09.070 --> 02:43:09.080 align:start position:0%
understanding um
 
02:43:11.670 --> 02:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
there's there's almost an implicit
 
02:43:15.710 --> 02:43:15.720 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest if we remove the
 
02:43:17.550 --> 02:43:17.560 align:start position:0%
voter qualifications from the
 
02:43:20.190 --> 02:43:20.200 align:start position:0%
Constitution and put it into to
 
02:43:23.150 --> 02:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
the uh rsas right do what the
 
02:43:25.349 --> 02:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
Constitution doesn't provide if you
 
02:43:26.830 --> 02:43:26.840 align:start position:0%
study the amount of times the state
 
02:43:28.269 --> 02:43:28.279 align:start position:0%
constitution has been amended you'll
 
02:43:31.750 --> 02:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
find in the 19th century from the from
 
02:43:33.630 --> 02:43:33.640 align:start position:0%
the 18th into the 19th century there
 
02:43:35.550 --> 02:43:35.560 align:start position:0%
were relatively few changes until we get
 
02:43:37.830 --> 02:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
to the 20th century I'll give you an
 
02:43:40.110 --> 02:43:40.120 align:start position:0%
example the Department of Education in
 
02:43:42.750 --> 02:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
1850 the state legislature proposed 12
 
02:43:45.150 --> 02:43:45.160 align:start position:0%
amendments to the State Constitution and
 
02:43:48.590 --> 02:43:48.600 align:start position:0%
of those 12 uh I'll focus on five they
 
02:43:50.550 --> 02:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to get rid of the executive
 
02:43:53.030 --> 02:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
Council that's amendment number one two
 
02:43:54.870 --> 02:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
and its replace replace it with the
 
02:43:56.870 --> 02:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
lieutenant governor number three created
 
02:43:58.950 --> 02:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
a department of railroad number four
 
02:44:01.070 --> 02:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
create a Department of Education create
 
02:44:02.910 --> 02:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
a Department of Agriculture and seven
 
02:44:04.510 --> 02:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
other things they woke up the next
 
02:44:06.349 --> 02:44:06.359 align:start position:0%
morning and the people said no we're not
 
02:44:07.990 --> 02:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
giving the state government any more
 
02:44:10.070 --> 02:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
power because that's what article one
 
02:44:12.269 --> 02:44:12.279 align:start position:0%
says all power we are constitutional
 
02:44:15.230 --> 02:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
republic that uses a democratic process
 
02:44:16.750 --> 02:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
but we've started acting like a
 
02:44:19.150 --> 02:44:19.160 align:start position:0%
democracy in the last few years where a
 
02:44:21.950 --> 02:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
majority rule of either party leave
 
02:44:24.429 --> 02:44:24.439 align:start position:0%
leaves legislation put in place that's
 
02:44:27.590 --> 02:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
passed on along political lines that is
 
02:44:29.309 --> 02:44:29.319 align:start position:0%
not in harmony with the
 
02:44:31.429 --> 02:44:31.439 align:start position:0%
Constitution because that is ultimately
 
02:44:33.110 --> 02:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
our constraint that is the limiting
 
02:44:36.389 --> 02:44:36.399 align:start position:0%
governing document in all of
 
02:44:38.389 --> 02:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
this if that's good I'm going to move on
 
02:44:41.630 --> 02:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
to the next piece federal law us code
 
02:44:44.510 --> 02:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
title 8 aliens and nationality I'm going
 
02:44:46.910 --> 02:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
here to point out help us with the page
 
02:44:52.590 --> 02:44:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:57.349 --> 02:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
you US law defines under uh definitions
 
02:45:00.469 --> 02:45:00.479 align:start position:0%
1101 the term naturalization means the
 
02:45:03.309 --> 02:45:03.319 align:start position:0%
conferring the nationality of a state
 
02:45:05.950 --> 02:45:05.960 align:start position:0%
upon any person after birth by any means
 
02:45:08.349 --> 02:45:08.359 align:start position:0%
whatsoever back to the state citizenship
 
02:45:11.990 --> 02:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
point right right understand because
 
02:45:13.990 --> 02:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
again we have concurrent jurisdiction we
 
02:45:16.070 --> 02:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
must be mindful that we have a state
 
02:45:18.030 --> 02:45:18.040 align:start position:0%
constitution and a Federal Constitution
 
02:45:20.309 --> 02:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
both of them which have effect on the
 
02:45:20.319 --> 02:45:21.830 align:start position:0%
both of them which have effect on the
election

02:45:21.830 --> 02:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
election
 
02:45:25.670 --> 02:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
process now State Constitution Article
 
02:45:29.230 --> 02:45:29.240 align:start position:0%
11 I put this uh I found it fascinating
 
02:45:32.349 --> 02:45:32.359 align:start position:0%
that it was one sentence in 1784 today
 
02:45:35.429 --> 02:45:35.439 align:start position:0%
it's a page and a half the first the
 
02:45:37.469 --> 02:45:37.479 align:start position:0%
first article 11 controlling our
 
02:45:40.070 --> 02:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
elections in in New Hampshire all
 
02:45:42.389 --> 02:45:42.399 align:start position:0%
elections ought to be free and every
 
02:45:44.030 --> 02:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
inhabitant of the state having the
 
02:45:46.429 --> 02:45:46.439 align:start position:0%
proper qualifications has an equal right
 
02:45:48.590 --> 02:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
to elect or be elected into office that
 
02:45:53.070 --> 02:45:53.080 align:start position:0%
was June 2nd 1784 today it's long so I
 
02:45:55.429 --> 02:45:55.439 align:start position:0%
highlighted the relevant points article
 
02:45:58.469 --> 02:45:58.479 align:start position:0%
11 and elective franchise all elections
 
02:46:00.870 --> 02:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
are to be free and here's that word and
 
02:46:02.670 --> 02:46:02.680 align:start position:0%
every inhabitant not
 
02:46:05.190 --> 02:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
resident of the state 18 years of age
 
02:46:07.110 --> 02:46:07.120 align:start position:0%
and upwards she'll have an equal right
 
02:46:09.469 --> 02:46:09.479 align:start position:0%
to vote in any election that is another
 
02:46:11.349 --> 02:46:11.359 align:start position:0%
constraint on this on this B on the
 
02:46:13.870 --> 02:46:13.880 align:start position:0%
committee uh both sub and Committee of
 
02:46:16.269 --> 02:46:16.279 align:start position:0%
the whole is to please pay attention to
 
02:46:18.030 --> 02:46:18.040 align:start position:0%
that point it's re it's reaffirming
 
02:46:20.389 --> 02:46:20.399 align:start position:0%
itself and and then down at the bottom
 
02:46:23.510 --> 02:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
absentee voting now I testified last
 
02:46:26.389 --> 02:46:26.399 align:start position:0%
time that in during the Civil War period
 
02:46:29.269 --> 02:46:29.279 align:start position:0%
in 1863 was the first time the state
 
02:46:29.279 --> 02:46:30.830 align:start position:0%
in 1863 was the first time the state
legislature

02:46:30.830 --> 02:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
02:46:33.309 --> 02:46:33.319 align:start position:0%
considered uh absentee voting because of
 
02:46:34.349 --> 02:46:34.359 align:start position:0%
the Civil
 
02:46:37.790 --> 02:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
War and the Supreme Court said no the
 
02:46:39.870 --> 02:46:39.880 align:start position:0%
legislature has no authority to
 
02:46:42.870 --> 02:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
establish any exemption for absentee
 
02:46:48.070 --> 02:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
voting next World 1921 World War I same
 
02:46:50.630 --> 02:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
question same problems same people
 
02:46:52.630 --> 02:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court said we told you 50 years
 
02:46:55.510 --> 02:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
ago you have no Authority by Statute to
 
02:46:58.910 --> 02:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
create a new exemption to vote absentee
 
02:47:02.150 --> 02:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
so that leads to 1942 where they
 
02:47:03.630 --> 02:47:03.640 align:start position:0%
actually go ahead and do it and that's
 
02:47:05.349 --> 02:47:05.359 align:start position:0%
part of the record here along the list
 
02:47:07.389 --> 02:47:07.399 align:start position:0%
of exhibits I've got seven exhibits for
 
02:47:10.110 --> 02:47:10.120 align:start position:0%
you to review and they're made up of the
 
02:47:13.630 --> 02:47:13.640 align:start position:0%
original Amendment and the subsequent
 
02:47:18.469 --> 02:47:18.479 align:start position:0%
changes and um but yeah 1942 so I would
 
02:47:21.349 --> 02:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
argue and I did argue that if it took an
 
02:47:23.070 --> 02:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
amendment to the state constitution to
 
02:47:25.030 --> 02:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
permit the two Provisions that exist
 
02:47:27.070 --> 02:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
because you be out of town or two that
 
02:47:29.429 --> 02:47:29.439 align:start position:0%
you're physically disabled I would say
 
02:47:31.750 --> 02:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
that in 1979 when they created by
 
02:47:33.630 --> 02:47:33.640 align:start position:0%
Statute a religious
 
02:47:36.389 --> 02:47:36.399 align:start position:0%
exemption that that was wrong and that's
 
02:47:40.190 --> 02:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
how the notary certificate went away see
 
02:47:43.110 --> 02:47:43.120 align:start position:0%
you only had two exemptions you had
 
02:47:43.120 --> 02:47:44.590 align:start position:0%
you only had two exemptions you had
physical

02:47:44.590 --> 02:47:44.600 align:start position:0%
physical
 
02:47:47.190 --> 02:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
disability uh I'm sorry I'm out of town
 
02:47:48.870 --> 02:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
physically disabled and the notary
 
02:47:51.469 --> 02:47:51.479 align:start position:0%
certificates right well now if you're
 
02:47:55.150 --> 02:47:55.160 align:start position:0%
going to add a third exemption now a new
 
02:47:57.190 --> 02:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
set of instructions for the Secretary of
 
02:48:00.030 --> 02:48:00.040 align:start position:0%
State came to be and that's where the
 
02:48:02.550 --> 02:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
defect came to be by Omission because
 
02:48:03.990 --> 02:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's part of the record that I've left
 
02:48:06.750 --> 02:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
for you is that they that's all they did
 
02:48:09.309 --> 02:48:09.319 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't the recodification either
 
02:48:11.590 --> 02:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
it was they recodified all the laws and
 
02:48:13.870 --> 02:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
the affidavit process stayed with it
 
02:48:17.309 --> 02:48:17.319 align:start position:0%
like secretary scandin testified to but
 
02:48:18.870 --> 02:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
that's how they made the notary
 
02:48:20.990 --> 02:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
certificate go away it wasn't a
 
02:48:23.309 --> 02:48:23.319 align:start position:0%
thoughtful legislative process and now
 
02:48:25.389 --> 02:48:25.399 align:start position:0%
has left this
 
02:48:27.630 --> 02:48:27.640 align:start position:0%
deficiency but let me read you what it
 
02:48:30.349 --> 02:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
says the general court shall provide by
 
02:48:32.750 --> 02:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
law for voting by qualified voters I
 
02:48:34.750 --> 02:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
interpret that as people who are already
 
02:48:37.349 --> 02:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
registered to vote qualify voters who at
 
02:48:38.790 --> 02:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
the time of the biannual or state
 
02:48:41.230 --> 02:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
elections or of the primary elections
 
02:48:43.389 --> 02:48:43.399 align:start position:0%
therefore or the city elections or the
 
02:48:45.990 --> 02:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
town elections by official ballot are
 
02:48:48.110 --> 02:48:48.120 align:start position:0%
absent from the city or town of which
 
02:48:51.790 --> 02:48:51.800 align:start position:0%
they are in habitants or by who by re or
 
02:48:54.710 --> 02:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
or or who by reason of physical
 
02:48:57.990 --> 02:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
disability are unable to vote in person
 
02:49:00.910 --> 02:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
in the choice of any officer or officers
 
02:49:02.670 --> 02:49:02.680 align:start position:0%
to be elected upon the question
 
02:49:05.269 --> 02:49:05.279 align:start position:0%
submitted at such election and then at
 
02:49:07.750 --> 02:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
the bottom of of article 11 every
 
02:49:09.630 --> 02:49:09.640 align:start position:0%
inhabitant of the state having the
 
02:49:11.389 --> 02:49:11.399 align:start position:0%
proper qualifications has the equal
 
02:49:13.230 --> 02:49:13.240 align:start position:0%
right to be elected into office
 
02:49:16.190 --> 02:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
repeating article 30 that inhabitant
 
02:49:18.750 --> 02:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
applies to those who want to vote def
 
02:49:21.030 --> 02:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
defining those who possess political
 
02:49:22.630 --> 02:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
rights that's what the word means and
 
02:49:24.389 --> 02:49:24.399 align:start position:0%
it's defined by the con by the state
 
02:49:27.070 --> 02:49:27.080 align:start position:0%
supreme court in multiple cases now
 
02:49:30.389 --> 02:49:30.399 align:start position:0%
closing out qualification Clauses US
 
02:49:33.349 --> 02:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
Constitution is Article 1 Section 2 the
 
02:49:34.710 --> 02:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives shall be
 
02:49:36.590 --> 02:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
composed by members chosen every second
 
02:49:39.190 --> 02:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
year by the people of the several states
 
02:49:41.710 --> 02:49:41.720 align:start position:0%
that phrase right there I can tell you
 
02:49:43.429 --> 02:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
with great certainty what it means the
 
02:49:45.590 --> 02:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
people of the several States means the
 
02:49:48.030 --> 02:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
citizens of the several States and that
 
02:49:50.790 --> 02:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
opinion comes from Dread Scott for those
 
02:49:52.870 --> 02:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
of you uh in this committee who don't
 
02:49:54.910 --> 02:49:54.920 align:start position:0%
know the case Dread Scott is a racist
 
02:49:57.349 --> 02:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
decision a black eye on the US Supreme
 
02:50:00.550 --> 02:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
Court where they said it only apply the
 
02:50:02.309 --> 02:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
Constitution only applies to white
 
02:50:04.990 --> 02:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
people and and so that's why part of
 
02:50:06.469 --> 02:50:06.479 align:start position:0%
what the 14th amendment was all about
 
02:50:10.030 --> 02:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
was to solve that problem but either way
 
02:50:12.309 --> 02:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
that's what it means and the electors
 
02:50:13.590 --> 02:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
that's why they refer to this as the
 
02:50:15.590 --> 02:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
qualification clause and the electors in
 
02:50:17.790 --> 02:50:17.800 align:start position:0%
each state shall have the qualifications
 
02:50:20.110 --> 02:50:20.120 align:start position:0%
requisite for electors of the most
 
02:50:22.630 --> 02:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
numerous branch of the state legislature
 
02:50:25.670 --> 02:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
this is where history is important in
 
02:50:28.510 --> 02:50:28.520 align:start position:0%
1784 the Senate was the first chamber in
 
02:50:30.229 --> 02:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
the state government it was not the
 
02:50:33.349 --> 02:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
second as it is today so you find all of
 
02:50:35.670 --> 02:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
the election Provisions in the Senate
 
02:50:38.510 --> 02:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
and not the house when it was inverted
 
02:50:40.469 --> 02:50:40.479 align:start position:0%
so a lot of people who try to do their
 
02:50:43.070 --> 02:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
own homework run into an obstacle there
 
02:50:45.309 --> 02:50:45.319 align:start position:0%
but I wanted to point that out to you so
 
02:50:47.110 --> 02:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
whatever the ru so basically what they
 
02:50:49.870 --> 02:50:49.880 align:start position:0%
said was the Senate rules are the rules
 
02:50:52.950 --> 02:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
for election process and by the way the
 
02:50:55.110 --> 02:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
same applies for the House of
 
02:50:58.429 --> 02:50:58.439 align:start position:0%
Representatives so that's why the Senate
 
02:51:01.710 --> 02:51:01.720 align:start position:0%
rules govern how we elect senators and
 
02:51:01.720 --> 02:51:02.630 align:start position:0%
rules govern how we elect senators and
US

02:51:02.630 --> 02:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
US
 
02:51:05.830 --> 02:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
congressmen any questions on that did I
 
02:51:07.870 --> 02:51:07.880 align:start position:0%
lus you it's a
 
02:51:12.710 --> 02:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
lot no okay all right and then no sh no
 
02:51:14.229 --> 02:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
person shall be a representative who
 
02:51:16.590 --> 02:51:16.600 align:start position:0%
shall have attained the age of 35 and
 
02:51:18.309 --> 02:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
been seven years a citizen of the United
 
02:51:18.319 --> 02:51:19.510 align:start position:0%
been seven years a citizen of the United
States

02:51:19.510 --> 02:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
States
 
02:51:21.550 --> 02:51:21.560 align:start position:0%
and who shall not when elected be an
 
02:51:23.510 --> 02:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
inhabitant in other words you can't have
 
02:51:25.309 --> 02:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
you can't hold political office in two
 
02:51:27.190 --> 02:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
places so you can't be a member of the
 
02:51:28.630 --> 02:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives here and be a
 
02:51:30.630 --> 02:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
us Congressman at the same
 
02:51:33.550 --> 02:51:33.560 align:start position:0%
time Article 1 Section 4 and this is a
 
02:51:35.469 --> 02:51:35.479 align:start position:0%
big deal times places in manner of
 
02:51:36.950 --> 02:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
holding elections for senators and
 
02:51:38.429 --> 02:51:38.439 align:start position:0%
representatives shall be prescribed in
 
02:51:41.590 --> 02:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
each state by the legislature thereof
 
02:51:43.150 --> 02:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
this is where the ballot law commission
 
02:51:45.469 --> 02:51:45.479 align:start position:0%
gets into trouble I know I'm off track
 
02:51:47.590 --> 02:51:47.600 align:start position:0%
but this is why it can't make law it
 
02:51:50.630 --> 02:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
can't make rules and regulations for an
 
02:51:52.750 --> 02:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
alternate method of counting other than
 
02:51:54.190 --> 02:51:54.200 align:start position:0%
that which the legislature has
 
02:51:56.229 --> 02:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
prescribed and this is reaffirmed by
 
02:51:59.630 --> 02:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
more V Harper but that's the point here
 
02:52:01.750 --> 02:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
I also included remember I told you
 
02:52:04.950 --> 02:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
earlier durational residency that's 52
 
02:52:06.389 --> 02:52:06.399 align:start position:0%
us code
 
02:52:09.389 --> 02:52:09.399 align:start position:0%
10,502 residency requirement for voting
 
02:52:11.309 --> 02:52:11.319 align:start position:0%
no citizen of the United States who is
 
02:52:12.950 --> 02:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise qualified to vote in any
 
02:52:14.950 --> 02:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
election for President vice president
 
02:52:17.030 --> 02:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
shall be denied the right to vote for
 
02:52:18.830 --> 02:52:18.840 align:start position:0%
electors of the president and vice
 
02:52:20.830 --> 02:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
president or president vice president in
 
02:52:23.110 --> 02:52:23.120 align:start position:0%
such election because of failure of such
 
02:52:25.790 --> 02:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
citizen to comply with any durational
 
02:52:27.910 --> 02:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
residency requirement of such state
 
02:52:30.670 --> 02:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
state or political subdivision again
 
02:52:32.790 --> 02:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
this body and the legislature can't say
 
02:52:34.510 --> 02:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
you got to live here for x amount of
 
02:52:37.870 --> 02:52:37.880 align:start position:0%
time if it impedes on your right to vote
 
02:52:40.550 --> 02:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
you can do it for citizenship you can
 
02:52:42.550 --> 02:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
Define that you've got to live here for
 
02:52:44.910 --> 02:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
x amount of time before we're going to
 
02:52:46.790 --> 02:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
allow you to become a state citizen
 
02:52:48.590 --> 02:52:48.600 align:start position:0%
because that carries forward under the
 
02:52:51.590 --> 02:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
common law under Article 90 but for for
 
02:52:53.830 --> 02:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
this for this case that that's what it's
 
02:52:56.870 --> 02:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
talking about now lastly here uh voting
 
02:52:58.550 --> 02:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
rights uh
 
02:53:01.309 --> 02:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
10,101 and this is what's wrong with the
 
02:53:03.590 --> 02:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
affidavit problem as we look at it today
 
02:53:05.790 --> 02:53:05.800 align:start position:0%
no person acting under color of law for
 
02:53:07.309 --> 02:53:07.319 align:start position:0%
those who are not lawyers that's the
 
02:53:10.750 --> 02:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
illusion of government Authority okay
 
02:53:12.510 --> 02:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
operating under color of Law and
 
02:53:14.110 --> 02:53:14.120 align:start position:0%
determining whether any individuals
 
02:53:17.110 --> 02:53:17.120 align:start position:0%
qualified under state laws or law to
 
02:53:20.630 --> 02:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
vote in any election apply any standard
 
02:53:23.190 --> 02:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
practice or procedure different from the
 
02:53:25.429 --> 02:53:25.439 align:start position:0%
standards practices or procedures
 
02:53:28.389 --> 02:53:28.399 align:start position:0%
applied under such law or laws to other
 
02:53:30.389 --> 02:53:30.399 align:start position:0%
individuals within the same County
 
02:53:32.750 --> 02:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
Parish or similar political subdivision
 
02:53:34.269 --> 02:53:34.279 align:start position:0%
who have been found by state officials
 
02:53:37.110 --> 02:53:37.120 align:start position:0%
to be qualified to vote that's the big
 
02:53:39.510 --> 02:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
that's the big Federal prohibition right
 
02:53:41.229 --> 02:53:41.239 align:start position:0%
that you can't have two different sets
 
02:53:43.670 --> 02:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
of rules in the same town or voting
 
02:53:47.349 --> 02:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
district Danville just had a case go to
 
02:53:50.070 --> 02:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
this rock Rockingham County Superior
 
02:53:52.389 --> 02:53:52.399 align:start position:0%
Court there was a challenge where the
 
02:53:56.070 --> 02:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
moderator wanted to do a separate count
 
02:53:58.990 --> 02:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
to verify his certification to run
 
02:54:01.229 --> 02:54:01.239 align:start position:0%
parallel to the machine count and the
 
02:54:03.309 --> 02:54:03.319 align:start position:0%
state supreme court upheld this not the
 
02:54:04.910 --> 02:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court the Rockingham Court
 
02:54:07.030 --> 02:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
upheld as principal and said that's
 
02:54:09.070 --> 02:54:09.080 align:start position:0%
right if your town chooses to use a
 
02:54:11.349 --> 02:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
machine you got to use a machine you
 
02:54:14.429 --> 02:54:14.439 align:start position:0%
can't do both can't be hand counting and
 
02:54:16.309 --> 02:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
machine counting at the same time
 
02:54:17.510 --> 02:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
because you have two different ways of
 
02:54:20.070 --> 02:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
doing it so that's the recent decision
 
02:54:22.110 --> 02:54:22.120 align:start position:0%
out of our Superior Court out of the
 
02:54:24.790 --> 02:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
Danville decision and and that brought
 
02:54:28.670 --> 02:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:31.150 --> 02:54:31.160 align:start position:0%
forward um not to not to get too
 
02:54:33.830 --> 02:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
sidetracked onto the Danville case but
 
02:54:39.110 --> 02:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
was that a uh um because we had the the
 
02:54:41.590 --> 02:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
larger committee heard some testimony
 
02:54:46.469 --> 02:54:46.479 align:start position:0%
about a similar subject recently and
 
02:54:48.670 --> 02:54:48.680 align:start position:0%
were they trying were they doing that in
 
02:54:50.389 --> 02:54:50.399 align:start position:0%
parallel or were they that's what they
 
02:54:51.790 --> 02:54:51.800 align:start position:0%
were trying to do and I believe that is
 
02:54:54.910 --> 02:54:54.920 align:start position:0%
their testimony and the court in my
 
02:54:57.110 --> 02:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
opinion I read the decision they were
 
02:54:59.269 --> 02:54:59.279 align:start position:0%
right on their conclusions but they got
 
02:55:01.830 --> 02:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
to it in in my opinion a wrong way to
 
02:55:03.830 --> 02:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
get there but either way they still
 
02:55:06.110 --> 02:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
we're still of the same mind and that is
 
02:55:08.429 --> 02:55:08.439 align:start position:0%
that you have to have and again back to
 
02:55:09.990 --> 02:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
what were they doing to the freed slaves
 
02:55:11.309 --> 02:55:11.319 align:start position:0%
back in the day they were applying
 
02:55:12.910 --> 02:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
different practices procedures and
 
02:55:15.309 --> 02:55:15.319 align:start position:0%
policies to disenfranchise them and so
 
02:55:17.510 --> 02:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
this carries forward and finally uh
 
02:55:18.990 --> 02:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
criminal pen another part of the
 
02:55:20.590 --> 02:55:20.600 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties and this deals with
 
02:55:22.670 --> 02:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
the lack of certifying the absentee
 
02:55:25.750 --> 02:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
ballots knowing criminal penalties
 
02:55:27.910 --> 02:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
number two knowingly and willfully
 
02:55:30.349 --> 02:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
deprives defrauds or attempts to deprive
 
02:55:32.550 --> 02:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
or defraud the residents of the state of
 
02:55:34.269 --> 02:55:34.279 align:start position:0%
a fair and impartially conducted
 
02:55:38.030 --> 02:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
election process by a the procurement or
 
02:55:39.790 --> 02:55:39.800 align:start position:0%
submission of voter registration
 
02:55:41.870 --> 02:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
applications that are known by the
 
02:55:43.990 --> 02:55:44.000 align:start position:0%
persons to be materially false
 
02:55:45.990 --> 02:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
fictitious or fraudulent under the laws
 
02:55:47.710 --> 02:55:47.720 align:start position:0%
of the state in which the election is
 
02:55:51.070 --> 02:55:51.080 align:start position:0%
held or B the procurement casting or
 
02:55:53.590 --> 02:55:53.600 align:start position:0%
tabulation of ballots that are known by
 
02:55:55.309 --> 02:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
the person to be materially false
 
02:55:57.590 --> 02:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
fictitious or fraudulent under the laws
 
02:55:59.389 --> 02:55:59.399 align:start position:0%
of the state in which the election is
 
02:56:01.910 --> 02:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
held these Federal issues the state
 
02:56:03.469 --> 02:56:03.479 align:start position:0%
hasn't touched and doesn't want to touch
 
02:56:05.469 --> 02:56:05.479 align:start position:0%
because they lose so they have not
 
02:56:07.510 --> 02:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
answered so they've avoided this until
 
02:56:10.630 --> 02:56:10.640 align:start position:0%
secretary scanland opened that door but
 
02:56:13.429 --> 02:56:13.439 align:start position:0%
either way um that's what I'm arguing in
 
02:56:17.349 --> 02:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
my case and that they and look my
 
02:56:19.070 --> 02:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
position is simple
 
02:56:20.950 --> 02:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state has the benefit
 
02:56:23.710 --> 02:56:23.720 align:start position:0%
of legal counsel how do you do this
 
02:56:26.790 --> 02:56:26.800 align:start position:0%
wrong how do you not know that there's a
 
02:56:28.630 --> 02:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
problem there's an affidavit problem and
 
02:56:30.309 --> 02:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
you write a new solution with an
 
02:56:32.229 --> 02:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
election procedure
 
02:56:34.389 --> 02:56:34.399 align:start position:0%
manual and so that's something that you
 
02:56:36.229 --> 02:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
guys will have to take up at your own at
 
02:56:38.269 --> 02:56:38.279 align:start position:0%
your own speed that's your that's your
 
02:56:41.389 --> 02:56:41.399 align:start position:0%
business and I also there's another
 
02:56:42.950 --> 02:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
document I'm not going to read it to you
 
02:56:46.830 --> 02:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
now the bottom here on um it's header
 
02:56:48.229 --> 02:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
criminal interference with State and
 
02:56:50.510 --> 02:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
Federal elections when the state supreme
 
02:56:52.830 --> 02:56:52.840 align:start position:0%
court remanded my case back to the trial
 
02:56:55.710 --> 02:56:55.720 align:start position:0%
court the trial judge because they
 
02:56:57.150 --> 02:56:57.160 align:start position:0%
didn't address the equal protection
 
02:56:59.429 --> 02:56:59.439 align:start position:0%
arguments that I had raised went ahead
 
02:57:01.790 --> 02:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
and gave the state defendants a a
 
02:57:04.910 --> 02:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
seventh bite at the Apple to brief the
 
02:57:07.389 --> 02:57:07.399 align:start position:0%
equal protection issues and when they
 
02:57:09.750 --> 02:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
did so I pointed out that you're
 
02:57:11.429 --> 02:57:11.439 align:start position:0%
violating federal law that's where my
 
02:57:13.309 --> 02:57:13.319 align:start position:0%
allegation of criminal interference and
 
02:57:14.910 --> 02:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
I'll let you read that but that is now
 
02:57:16.670 --> 02:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
before the Rockingham County Court were
 
02:57:19.950 --> 02:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
waiting on uh we're waiting on that that
 
02:57:24.110 --> 02:57:24.120 align:start position:0%
decision to move forward to a um a uh
 
02:57:27.269 --> 02:57:27.279 align:start position:0%
scheduling conference
 
02:57:30.950 --> 02:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
so very good um thank so representative
 
02:57:32.550 --> 02:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
Lane you have a
 
02:57:35.469 --> 02:57:35.479 align:start position:0%
question I just want to make sure that I
 
02:57:38.590 --> 02:57:38.600 align:start position:0%
understand the state citizenship piece
 
02:57:43.550 --> 02:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
yes versus the uh res I know it's not
 
02:57:45.990 --> 02:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
called res domicile requirement the
 
02:57:48.349 --> 02:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
length of the years yes so I just want
 
02:57:49.910 --> 02:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure
 
02:57:53.070 --> 02:57:53.080 align:start position:0%
that were you suggesting that you could
 
02:57:56.790 --> 02:57:56.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps get around that requirement by
 
02:57:59.590 --> 02:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
putting it in the requirement of State
 
02:58:01.349 --> 02:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
citizenship that you had to live here
 
02:58:03.590 --> 02:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
durational residency under the
 
02:58:05.229 --> 02:58:05.239 align:start position:0%
sovereignty of the State under the 9th
 
02:58:07.750 --> 02:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
and 10th Amendment and the original
 
02:58:10.429 --> 02:58:10.439 align:start position:0%
naturalization law still has that
 
02:58:12.750 --> 02:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
authority to do so they can say you need
 
02:58:15.630 --> 02:58:15.640 align:start position:0%
to live here for 30 days 60 days a year
 
02:58:17.110 --> 02:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
in order to become a citizen of the
 
02:58:20.429 --> 02:58:20.439 align:start position:0%
state if you use doile or residency as
 
02:58:22.790 --> 02:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
qualifying language if you're going to
 
02:58:25.229 --> 02:58:25.239 align:start position:0%
write that into your statute you cannot
 
02:58:29.150 --> 02:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
you cannot use a durational residency
 
02:58:32.030 --> 02:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
test under the federal law that that's
 
02:58:33.790 --> 02:58:33.800 align:start position:0%
why I was asking the question I just
 
02:58:37.469 --> 02:58:37.479 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure IOD so where in I
 
02:58:40.030 --> 02:58:40.040 align:start position:0%
and I don't know this where do are the
 
02:58:41.910 --> 02:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
requirements to be a New Hampshire
 
02:58:44.710 --> 02:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
citizen laid out in our statute chapter
 
02:58:46.630 --> 02:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
49 that I read to you earlier the
 
02:58:48.830 --> 02:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
original 1808 law
 
02:58:50.790 --> 02:58:50.800 align:start position:0%
and the I gave you the Consolidated
 
02:58:52.870 --> 02:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
updated version to include women and the
 
02:58:54.910 --> 02:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
voting age down to 18 and I can put it
 
02:58:57.070 --> 02:58:57.080 align:start position:0%
all together and in the definitions
 
02:58:59.269 --> 02:58:59.279 align:start position:0%
chapter which is key in my work that I
 
02:59:02.070 --> 02:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
sent you uh has all the proper
 
02:59:04.150 --> 02:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
definitions written there based on the
 
02:59:06.910 --> 02:59:06.920 align:start position:0%
historical context I I have one more
 
02:59:10.590 --> 02:59:10.600 align:start position:0%
question um I just have question related
 
02:59:14.790 --> 02:59:14.800 align:start position:0%
to that answer no no I just want to make
 
02:59:14.800 --> 02:59:15.910 align:start position:0%
to that answer no no I just want to make
representative

02:59:15.910 --> 02:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:59:20.469 --> 02:59:20.479 align:start position:0%
Lane um on page 10 when you were reading
 
02:59:23.670 --> 02:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
the uh down towards the bottom the
 
02:59:25.710 --> 02:59:25.720 align:start position:0%
citizens of each state shall be entitled
 
02:59:27.710 --> 02:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
to all privileges and
 
02:59:30.950 --> 02:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
immunities did you say that the citizens
 
02:59:34.229 --> 02:59:34.239 align:start position:0%
of the several states does not include
 
02:59:36.630 --> 02:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
because it says does include well the
 
02:59:38.269 --> 02:59:38.279 align:start position:0%
privileges and immunities clause
 
02:59:40.670 --> 02:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
involves all citizens of the several
 
02:59:42.750 --> 02:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
States so that is your right to travel
 
02:59:45.309 --> 02:59:45.319 align:start position:0%
and it does not include elections
 
02:59:48.469 --> 02:59:48.479 align:start position:0%
there's no okay so the word not is it's
 
02:59:50.550 --> 02:59:50.560 align:start position:0%
left out I think in what I'm reading and
 
02:59:52.309 --> 02:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
I may have I may have goofed in a hurry
 
02:59:54.590 --> 02:59:54.600 align:start position:0%
to get this all done so please forgive
 
02:59:55.830 --> 02:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
me if there's no I just want to make
 
02:59:57.630 --> 02:59:57.640 align:start position:0%
sure I heard you correctly okay thank
 
02:59:59.790 --> 02:59:59.800 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome that's it and the
 
03:00:02.030 --> 03:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
only other thing that I had go ahead uh
 
03:00:03.550 --> 03:00:03.560 align:start position:0%
representative Newsome has a question
 
03:00:05.910 --> 03:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
I'd like to entertain his question um
 
03:00:07.870 --> 03:00:07.880 align:start position:0%
you when um representative Lane asked
 
03:00:09.750 --> 03:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
you about the statute to become a state
 
03:00:12.429 --> 03:00:12.439 align:start position:0%
citizen yes you referred to the law in
 
03:00:15.710 --> 03:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
1808 that you handed out yes um are you
 
03:00:18.150 --> 03:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
aware that that Act was repealed less
 
03:00:20.070 --> 03:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
than 6 months later yes is there a
 
03:00:22.590 --> 03:00:22.600 align:start position:0%
current definition yes in what section
 
03:00:24.790 --> 03:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
would that be in today's rsas let me
 
03:00:28.229 --> 03:00:28.239 align:start position:0%
back up and re restate my answer thank
 
03:00:32.030 --> 03:00:32.040 align:start position:0%
you it existed from 1808 till
 
03:00:33.950 --> 03:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
1973 and in
 
03:00:37.990 --> 03:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
1973 that was removed so the process the
 
03:00:40.269 --> 03:00:40.279 align:start position:0%
qva was the last evidence that was in
 
03:00:42.670 --> 03:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
the 1950s in the
 
03:00:47.150 --> 03:00:47.160 align:start position:0%
1950s uh chapter 50 and so on forget
 
03:00:49.229 --> 03:00:49.239 align:start position:0%
forgive me on the numbers but whatever
 
03:00:52.750 --> 03:00:52.760 align:start position:0%
came from the 1950s lasted until the 70s
 
03:00:54.469 --> 03:00:54.479 align:start position:0%
and that's where that language went away
 
03:00:56.309 --> 03:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
about being a citizen of the state
 
03:00:57.990 --> 03:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
because now we're referring to
 
03:01:00.950 --> 03:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
citizenship as National citizenship by
 
03:01:03.790 --> 03:01:03.800 align:start position:0%
by removing those words native born or
 
03:01:05.750 --> 03:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
naturalized so you're right it doesn't
 
03:01:08.070 --> 03:01:08.080 align:start position:0%
exist in statutes today okay so if we
 
03:01:10.670 --> 03:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
were to to go down that route and use
 
03:01:13.030 --> 03:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
that we would then need to reinstate
 
03:01:14.790 --> 03:01:14.800 align:start position:0%
that as part of it the old policy
 
03:01:17.150 --> 03:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
correct yes yes um and sorry one more
 
03:01:19.590 --> 03:01:19.600 align:start position:0%
follow up on this um do any other states
 
03:01:22.150 --> 03:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
use a state citizenship standard Curr I
 
03:01:23.910 --> 03:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
haven't cross referenced anyone
 
03:01:26.190 --> 03:01:26.200 align:start position:0%
currently and I don't think they do okay
 
03:01:28.830 --> 03:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and and I believe that the the
 
03:01:31.950 --> 03:01:31.960 align:start position:0%
the start of all of this starts in a in
 
03:01:35.830 --> 03:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
Tennessee there was a um a law professor
 
03:01:38.790 --> 03:01:38.800 align:start position:0%
who moved to Tennessee he was taking a
 
03:01:41.990 --> 03:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
job at the University there and they had
 
03:01:44.630 --> 03:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
already changed their language to
 
03:01:47.429 --> 03:01:47.439 align:start position:0%
residency as a prerequisite and so he
 
03:01:49.349 --> 03:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
went to register and was denied the
 
03:01:51.030 --> 03:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
right to vote and he sued and won it
 
03:01:52.429 --> 03:01:52.439 align:start position:0%
made it all the way I think to the
 
03:01:56.030 --> 03:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
federal courts and he said hey I'm a new
 
03:01:59.190 --> 03:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
Resident why does an old resident why am
 
03:02:01.550 --> 03:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
I being disenfranchised because why are
 
03:02:03.550 --> 03:02:03.560 align:start position:0%
you treating me differently we're still
 
03:02:06.469 --> 03:02:06.479 align:start position:0%
focusing on the word resident and word
 
03:02:09.150 --> 03:02:09.160 align:start position:0%
resident based on State Statute gets
 
03:02:10.950 --> 03:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
applied based on what the legislature
 
03:02:13.469 --> 03:02:13.479 align:start position:0%
has decided so that's the problem that's
 
03:02:15.030 --> 03:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
where that's where all of this really
 
03:02:17.190 --> 03:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
stems from is we stopped focusing on
 
03:02:18.990 --> 03:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
state citizens ship and from that point
 
03:02:20.670 --> 03:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
on if we're not going to refer to
 
03:02:22.550 --> 03:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
someone as a state citizen we're left
 
03:02:25.710 --> 03:02:25.720 align:start position:0%
with only two other words residency or
 
03:02:28.110 --> 03:02:28.120 align:start position:0%
domicile and that's what we're using
 
03:02:31.309 --> 03:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
now and just uh
 
03:02:34.710 --> 03:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
so and no other are there other states
 
03:02:37.830 --> 03:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
that are using this domicile aspect do
 
03:02:39.150 --> 03:02:39.160 align:start position:0%
you know about that I believe almost all
 
03:02:41.469 --> 03:02:41.479 align:start position:0%
of them are okay all of them are because
 
03:02:43.510 --> 03:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
again if we're not and I think that this
 
03:02:46.150 --> 03:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
should be a 50 f a 50-state solution not
 
03:02:48.870 --> 03:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
just one state because if we finally get
 
03:02:51.910 --> 03:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
to that my solution to anyone who is
 
03:02:53.950 --> 03:02:53.960 align:start position:0%
here temporarily going to school or
 
03:02:56.190 --> 03:02:56.200 align:start position:0%
otherwise is you still get the vote
 
03:02:57.790 --> 03:02:57.800 align:start position:0%
absentee and we do need to do a better
 
03:03:00.110 --> 03:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
job at making sure that they have those
 
03:03:02.630 --> 03:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
Provisions especially for our citizens
 
03:03:04.269 --> 03:03:04.279 align:start position:0%
who are deployed elsewhere because
 
03:03:05.710 --> 03:03:05.720 align:start position:0%
that's where absentee voting really came
 
03:03:08.429 --> 03:03:08.439 align:start position:0%
to be in the first place is to address
 
03:03:10.030 --> 03:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
deployed veterans and those supporting
 
03:03:13.229 --> 03:03:13.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:16.469 --> 03:03:16.479 align:start position:0%
effort uh representative vernham thank
 
03:03:18.469 --> 03:03:18.479 align:start position:0%
you um so
 
03:03:22.349 --> 03:03:22.359 align:start position:0%
going back to pre is it 1973 or 1976 I'm
 
03:03:25.990 --> 03:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
kind of uh there's three events 77 7 79
 
03:03:30.830 --> 03:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
77 76 and 73 which one so 73 I believe
 
03:03:33.510 --> 03:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
is the last time it was or that's the
 
03:03:36.190 --> 03:03:36.200 align:start position:0%
year ex change for the state citizenship
 
03:03:40.710 --> 03:03:40.720 align:start position:0%
correct okay so um was it before that
 
03:03:44.309 --> 03:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
were um voters required to show a state
 
03:03:46.349 --> 03:03:46.359 align:start position:0%
citizenship document is there a
 
03:03:48.389 --> 03:03:48.399 align:start position:0%
documentation they would have shown to
 
03:03:54.550 --> 03:03:54.560 align:start position:0%
vote the law the the 1808 Law chapter 49
 
03:03:57.150 --> 03:03:57.160 align:start position:0%
ultimately is modified to the point that
 
03:03:59.229 --> 03:03:59.239 align:start position:0%
by the time that we see the last
 
03:04:00.790 --> 03:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
evidence of State
 
03:04:04.190 --> 03:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
citizenship is uh at that period of time
 
03:04:07.630 --> 03:04:07.640 align:start position:0%
and they did so um lost my
 
03:04:12.190 --> 03:04:12.200 align:start position:0%
way 73 on the state citizenship oh the
 
03:04:15.590 --> 03:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
qva qva there it is the qva so the qva
 
03:04:17.309 --> 03:04:17.319 align:start position:0%
that we have today the qualified voter
 
03:04:21.150 --> 03:04:21.160 align:start position:0%
affid David was the the something to the
 
03:04:25.110 --> 03:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
effect that that you swear to the fact
 
03:04:27.030 --> 03:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
that you have met the durational
 
03:04:28.790 --> 03:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
residency requirement to become a
 
03:04:31.950 --> 03:04:31.960 align:start position:0%
citizen of the state and that went away
 
03:04:33.710 --> 03:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
when that went away was all part of
 
03:04:36.070 --> 03:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
these changes in the 70s in that way we
 
03:04:39.070 --> 03:04:39.080 align:start position:0%
were now focused on doile and residency
 
03:04:41.389 --> 03:04:41.399 align:start position:0%
as the focal point for legislation
 
03:04:45.030 --> 03:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
establishing that as the basis and I
 
03:04:46.790 --> 03:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
I've also attached in these exhibits
 
03:04:50.150 --> 03:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
I've also given you the um the voters
 
03:04:52.750 --> 03:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
guides and I just have a followup do you
 
03:04:56.469 --> 03:04:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:00.630 --> 03:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
what new uh State residents would have
 
03:05:04.190 --> 03:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
to do in order to vote say they moved um
 
03:05:06.870 --> 03:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
you know previous to 1973 moved to New
 
03:05:09.830 --> 03:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for voting they would swear at
 
03:05:11.670 --> 03:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
this the same process or was there do
 
03:05:12.990 --> 03:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
you know if there's a was a different
 
03:05:16.110 --> 03:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
process with new people moving into New
 
03:05:17.910 --> 03:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from what period are you
 
03:05:19.469 --> 03:05:19.479 align:start position:0%
asking me about the period when it was
 
03:05:22.750 --> 03:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
in effect prior to 1973 what was the
 
03:05:24.670 --> 03:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
process for them to vote if they were
 
03:05:27.190 --> 03:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
new I don't want to say residents but
 
03:05:30.030 --> 03:05:30.040 align:start position:0%
new citizens of New Hampshire they
 
03:05:31.870 --> 03:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't become a citizen until they had
 
03:05:34.030 --> 03:05:34.040 align:start position:0%
met the durational residency requirement
 
03:05:36.030 --> 03:05:36.040 align:start position:0%
established by the legislature to be a
 
03:05:38.830 --> 03:05:38.840 align:start position:0%
state Citizen and once that went away
 
03:05:40.830 --> 03:05:40.840 align:start position:0%
now you're dealing with the federal law
 
03:05:43.510 --> 03:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
on durational residency for voting you
 
03:05:45.269 --> 03:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
can't go there for voting if you go
 
03:05:50.830 --> 03:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:53.309 --> 03:05:53.319 align:start position:0%
okay you're
 
03:05:55.870 --> 03:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
welcome all right I think uh I got one
 
03:05:58.429 --> 03:05:58.439 align:start position:0%
more thing for you okay federal law and
 
03:06:00.469 --> 03:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
I'll wrap up real quick very quickly you
 
03:06:01.990 --> 03:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
asked me about the Brewin decision so
 
03:06:04.030 --> 03:06:04.040 align:start position:0%
what's happened is the US Supreme Court
 
03:06:06.190 --> 03:06:06.200 align:start position:0%
in the in the Second Amendment case took
 
03:06:08.710 --> 03:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
on uh this Perpetual problem of the
 
03:06:10.269 --> 03:06:10.279 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment and what they've done
 
03:06:12.469 --> 03:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
that's radically changed the landscape
 
03:06:14.110 --> 03:06:14.120 align:start position:0%
is they I know that the attorneys will
 
03:06:16.710 --> 03:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
get this they've abolished means ands
 
03:06:19.110 --> 03:06:19.120 align:start position:0%
scrutiny means and scrutiny for a
 
03:06:21.750 --> 03:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
Layman's perspective is that the courts
 
03:06:24.429 --> 03:06:24.439 align:start position:0%
for the last 60 70 years have been
 
03:06:26.110 --> 03:06:26.120 align:start position:0%
applying a balancing test when they
 
03:06:29.309 --> 03:06:29.319 align:start position:0%
examine any proposed legislation that is
 
03:06:31.870 --> 03:06:31.880 align:start position:0%
being uh there's an allegation that it
 
03:06:34.030 --> 03:06:34.040 align:start position:0%
infringes upon any of the rights so the
 
03:06:35.790 --> 03:06:35.800 align:start position:0%
second amendment's been back and forth
 
03:06:37.830 --> 03:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
and what the Supreme Court said look why
 
03:06:39.510 --> 03:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
do we treat the Second Amendment
 
03:06:41.229 --> 03:06:41.239 align:start position:0%
different than the first amendment than
 
03:06:43.070 --> 03:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
the confrontation clause in the sixth
 
03:06:45.990 --> 03:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
amendment and or uh the freedom of
 
03:06:49.309 --> 03:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
religion so it address four other issues
 
03:06:51.870 --> 03:06:51.880 align:start position:0%
and it said look from now on we're
 
03:06:54.670 --> 03:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
abolishing means and scrutiny from which
 
03:06:57.670 --> 03:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
is three different levels of of a
 
03:07:00.229 --> 03:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
balancing test in other words the court
 
03:07:02.630 --> 03:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
the judge would say all right we have
 
03:07:04.510 --> 03:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
the Bill of Rights here but we have the
 
03:07:07.950 --> 03:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
public interest here and so how much
 
03:07:11.150 --> 03:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
should anyone tolerate public policy
 
03:07:14.309 --> 03:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
infringing upon your rights and so they
 
03:07:16.469 --> 03:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
said you can't do this anymore from now
 
03:07:20.750 --> 03:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
on when ever a a legislative act
 
03:07:23.190 --> 03:07:23.200 align:start position:0%
infringes upon any of the enumerated
 
03:07:25.950 --> 03:07:25.960 align:start position:0%
rights the burden of proof shifts from
 
03:07:28.429 --> 03:07:28.439 align:start position:0%
the go from the people to the government
 
03:07:30.510 --> 03:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
to prove their statutory scheme was
 
03:07:32.030 --> 03:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
permissible when the Bill of Rights was
 
03:07:35.070 --> 03:07:35.080 align:start position:0%
written let me give you an example in
 
03:07:37.870 --> 03:07:37.880 align:start position:0%
1791 there was a militia Act and the
 
03:07:39.550 --> 03:07:39.560 align:start position:0%
militia act required that all
 
03:07:41.790 --> 03:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
able-bodied men had to carry a musket
 
03:07:44.150 --> 03:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
Gunpowder and Lead and that they had to
 
03:07:47.590 --> 03:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
be 18 years of age so today it would be
 
03:07:49.429 --> 03:07:49.439 align:start position:0%
permissible for the state legislature to
 
03:07:52.150 --> 03:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
say open carry of firearms you got to be
 
03:07:54.710 --> 03:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
18 why because they could point to a
 
03:07:57.950 --> 03:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
historical analogy of going back in time
 
03:08:01.110 --> 03:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
and saying in 1791 it was permissible to
 
03:08:03.990 --> 03:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
restrict gun ownership in public to
 
03:08:07.550 --> 03:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
people who are 18 and so this is now
 
03:08:10.910 --> 03:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
morphed into the examination of all of
 
03:08:14.590 --> 03:08:14.600 align:start position:0%
our rights and uh I also quoted another
 
03:08:16.070 --> 03:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
case that just came down this summer
 
03:08:21.190 --> 03:08:21.200 align:start position:0%
which is the NAACP case um the NAACP of
 
03:08:23.150 --> 03:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
South Carolina accused the South
 
03:08:24.830 --> 03:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
Carolina legislature of being racist
 
03:08:26.070 --> 03:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
they accused the whole body of being
 
03:08:28.229 --> 03:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
racist Clarence Thomas writes a
 
03:08:31.030 --> 03:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
concurring opinion uh with the majority
 
03:08:34.750 --> 03:08:34.760 align:start position:0%
joining the majority that now ties the
 
03:08:37.070 --> 03:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
federal elections clause and the Second
 
03:08:40.429 --> 03:08:40.439 align:start position:0%
Amendment case of bruan heler and so
 
03:08:42.309 --> 03:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
there wasn't that bridge as the
 
03:08:44.070 --> 03:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
attorneys will tell you is that in order
 
03:08:46.670 --> 03:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
to have precedent you have to have a
 
03:08:48.630 --> 03:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
case that moves into the court so right
 
03:08:50.190 --> 03:08:50.200 align:start position:0%
now those Second Amendment cases that
 
03:08:51.990 --> 03:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
I've just talked about those Federal
 
03:08:54.910 --> 03:08:54.920 align:start position:0%
decisions that decision now creates a
 
03:08:56.870 --> 03:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
bridge in my opinion that didn't exist
 
03:08:58.790 --> 03:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
because that would only apply to the
 
03:09:00.670 --> 03:09:00.680 align:start position:0%
federal Bill of Rights it wouldn't apply
 
03:09:02.670 --> 03:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
to the state because it's not State case
 
03:09:05.389 --> 03:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
law and it's not a state issue even
 
03:09:07.870 --> 03:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
though there may be a correlating event
 
03:09:09.870 --> 03:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
but either way that's the point that
 
03:09:12.389 --> 03:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
they made so from now on when we look at
 
03:09:14.950 --> 03:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with those issues and again it's
 
03:09:17.950 --> 03:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
because election law is current
 
03:09:19.830 --> 03:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction with both the state and
 
03:09:22.150 --> 03:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
federal Constitution so I believe and
 
03:09:24.389 --> 03:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
those documents by the way are what I
 
03:09:27.349 --> 03:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
called late authorities the Supreme
 
03:09:29.710 --> 03:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
Court has a rule because it takes such a
 
03:09:31.910 --> 03:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
long time to go through the process they
 
03:09:34.030 --> 03:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
have a rule that permits that any
 
03:09:36.590 --> 03:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
decisions of scotus or of our state
 
03:09:38.469 --> 03:09:38.479 align:start position:0%
supreme court or of the legislature that
 
03:09:40.630 --> 03:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
comes down the pike that they can be
 
03:09:43.030 --> 03:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
added as a l Authority and I did submit
 
03:09:45.030 --> 03:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
three of them and I've given you two and
 
03:09:46.750 --> 03:09:46.760 align:start position:0%
that will lay out the boundaries at your
 
03:09:49.190 --> 03:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
own leisure to understand what those
 
03:09:52.790 --> 03:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
Federal boundaries are as to how to
 
03:09:54.510 --> 03:09:54.520 align:start position:0%
legislate here in New Hampshire what are
 
03:09:56.790 --> 03:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
those constraints like I said earlier
 
03:09:58.670 --> 03:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
you're not the two constraints are your
 
03:10:00.309 --> 03:10:00.319 align:start position:0%
state and federal Constitution other
 
03:10:01.990 --> 03:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
than that you're unlimited at your
 
03:10:04.110 --> 03:10:04.120 align:start position:0%
problem solving I know some people don't
 
03:10:11.110 --> 03:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:13.469 --> 03:10:13.479 align:start position:0%
true all right with that I will thank
 
03:10:17.389 --> 03:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
you uh for your testimony uh and for um
 
03:10:19.469 --> 03:10:19.479 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you could have talked for hours
 
03:10:21.590 --> 03:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
more so I I appreciate this all lives in
 
03:10:24.030 --> 03:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
my head just so you know I'm sure I I'm
 
03:10:27.550 --> 03:10:27.560 align:start position:0%
sure that's an interesting place as well
 
03:10:32.510 --> 03:10:32.520 align:start position:0%
so right so um uh thank you very much um
 
03:10:35.870 --> 03:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
that concludes uh our Our Testimony
 
03:10:37.710 --> 03:10:37.720 align:start position:0%
today we're not taking anything other
 
03:10:40.150 --> 03:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
there are some matters that we do need
 
03:10:40.160 --> 03:10:41.070 align:start position:0%
there are some matters that we do need
to

03:10:41.070 --> 03:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:10:41.080 --> 03:10:42.630 align:start position:0%
to
discuss

03:10:42.630 --> 03:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
03:10:44.550 --> 03:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
03:10:47.469 --> 03:10:47.479 align:start position:0%
just uh
 
03:10:49.910 --> 03:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
some Logistics here I'm sure please
 
03:10:52.630 --> 03:10:52.640 align:start position:0%
forgive me for any this was not proofed
 
03:10:54.429 --> 03:10:54.439 align:start position:0%
and if you need it redone I'd be glad to
 
03:10:56.229 --> 03:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
resubmit it and if there's any mistakes
 
03:10:57.830 --> 03:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
or further questions don't hesitate to
 
03:10:59.830 --> 03:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
reach out to me can I actually just get
 
03:11:02.150 --> 03:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
another copy of the packet that you gave
 
03:11:04.190 --> 03:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
yes for filing purposes than I know

Shop I was working with someone who was
 
03:11:17.349 --> 03:11:17.359 align:start position:0%
less than skilled
 
03:11:19.510 --> 03:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
I I just I think it would be good to
 
03:11:21.710 --> 03:11:21.720 align:start position:0%
have it for the record as well just have
 
03:11:24.469 --> 03:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
a copy absolutely I've already marked up
 
03:11:28.150 --> 03:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
mine so it's not gonna be good okay
 
03:11:32.389 --> 03:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
um I will I will hang so I have that
 
03:11:34.429 --> 03:11:34.439 align:start position:0%
here and I
 
03:11:34.439 --> 03:11:36.110 align:start position:0%
here and I
will

03:11:36.110 --> 03:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
will
 
03:11:38.830 --> 03:11:38.840 align:start position:0%
um I will figure out a way to make sure
 
03:11:41.269 --> 03:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
we get copies of
 
03:11:43.710 --> 03:11:43.720 align:start position:0%
this upstairs yeah and they can make
 
03:11:49.910 --> 03:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:51.950 --> 03:11:51.960 align:start position:0%

03:12:13.710 --> 03:12:13.720 align:start position:0%
did have some follow-up questions to one
 
03:12:16.110 --> 03:12:16.120 align:start position:0%
of the memos that Mr Allen provided to
 
03:12:20.910 --> 03:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
us I have uh forwarded that email to Mr
 
03:12:24.070 --> 03:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
Allen and he will respond in uh Due Time
 
03:12:26.150 --> 03:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
according with his excellent responses
 
03:12:28.710 --> 03:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
as always so we appreciate that we
 
03:12:30.389 --> 03:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
appreciate all the research that he's
 
03:12:34.110 --> 03:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
been doing um on behalf of the
 
03:12:38.830 --> 03:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um I think also um just I
 
03:12:40.510 --> 03:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
want to reiterate something I said at
 
03:12:43.870 --> 03:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
the beginning uh we had on the public
 
03:12:46.870 --> 03:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
notice that house bill 608 was would be
 
03:12:49.910 --> 03:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
part of today's working session but um
 
03:12:53.710 --> 03:12:53.720 align:start position:0%
due to some errors that had been already
 
03:12:57.710 --> 03:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
exec and so um we are not doing any
 
03:13:00.349 --> 03:13:00.359 align:start position:0%
action on that today whatsoever Al
 
03:13:03.429 --> 03:13:03.439 align:start position:0%
though we did hear some related um just
 
03:13:03.439 --> 03:13:04.990 align:start position:0%
though we did hear some related um just
what's

03:13:04.990 --> 03:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
what's
 
03:13:05.000 --> 03:13:09.150 align:start position:0%
what's
that

03:13:09.150 --> 03:13:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:15.670 --> 03:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
um to be honest I I computer whz wait so
 
03:13:18.750 --> 03:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
wait it's it's requiring moderators to
 
03:13:20.830 --> 03:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
inspect absentee badat for Davids for
 
03:13:20.840 --> 03:13:27.309 align:start position:0%
inspect absentee badat for Davids for
full

03:13:27.309 --> 03:13:27.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:30.389 --> 03:13:30.399 align:start position:0%
execution I I I honestly can't remember
 
03:13:32.790 --> 03:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry we've we've had 75 bills this
 
03:13:35.830 --> 03:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
year in election law and so it's keeping
 
03:13:38.429 --> 03:13:38.439 align:start position:0%
I've got kind of not alphabet soup but
 
03:13:42.269 --> 03:13:42.279 align:start position:0%
number soup in my brain right now so
 
03:13:44.750 --> 03:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
um respect
 
03:13:51.550 --> 03:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:51.560 --> 03:13:54.510 align:start position:0%
 
I've

03:13:54.510 --> 03:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:56.590 --> 03:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
got I have it as
 
03:14:03.429 --> 03:14:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:07.030 --> 03:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
calendar all right so so I believe I itl
 
03:14:07.040 --> 03:14:08.429 align:start position:0%
calendar all right so so I believe I itl
was

03:14:08.429 --> 03:14:08.439 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:14:11.830 --> 03:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh the outcome of 608 and that's
 
03:14:13.870 --> 03:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
that's why this committee is not uh
 
03:14:16.190 --> 03:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is not working on it so I
 
03:14:20.349 --> 03:14:20.359 align:start position:0%
just want to that was part of the um
 
03:14:23.150 --> 03:14:23.160 align:start position:0%
opening discussion or opening points and
 
03:14:24.870 --> 03:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to reiterate that to make
 
03:14:26.389 --> 03:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
sure that that was
 
03:14:26.399 --> 03:14:29.269 align:start position:0%
sure that that was
understood

03:14:29.269 --> 03:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
understood
 
03:14:33.349 --> 03:14:33.359 align:start position:0%
um we are on a uh pretty aggressive
 
03:14:36.389 --> 03:14:36.399 align:start position:0%
timeline because I think crossover day
 
03:14:39.190 --> 03:14:39.200 align:start position:0%
is the
 
03:14:42.229 --> 03:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
27th whatever that th last Thursday in
 
03:14:45.630 --> 03:14:45.640 align:start position:0%
March is hang on just a
 
03:14:48.309 --> 03:14:48.319 align:start position:0%
second um
 
03:14:50.110 --> 03:14:50.120 align:start position:0%
let me just check
 
03:14:54.349 --> 03:14:54.359 align:start position:0%
that uh yeah 27th so and everyone saw
 
03:14:55.830 --> 03:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
the note that we might be meeting for a
 
03:14:58.150 --> 03:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
house session on the 26 as well just
 
03:15:03.190 --> 03:15:03.200 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind um yes of course so I
 
03:15:03.200 --> 03:15:05.070 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind um yes of course so I
wanted

03:15:05.070 --> 03:15:05.080 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
03:15:07.990 --> 03:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
to yes we are
 
03:15:13.429 --> 03:15:13.439 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to just say um I I will be
 
03:15:17.309 --> 03:15:17.319 align:start position:0%
attempting to uh
 
03:15:20.150 --> 03:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh put together a report over the next
 
03:15:20.160 --> 03:15:21.229 align:start position:0%
uh put together a report over the next
several

03:15:21.229 --> 03:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
several
 
03:15:21.239 --> 03:15:22.950 align:start position:0%
several
days

03:15:22.950 --> 03:15:22.960 align:start position:0%
days
 
03:15:22.960 --> 03:15:25.670 align:start position:0%
days
um

03:15:25.670 --> 03:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:30.510 --> 03:15:30.520 align:start position:0%
and uh as soon as I
 
03:15:33.510 --> 03:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
am done with that I will get it to this
 
03:15:35.269 --> 03:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
committee my my
 
03:15:42.030 --> 03:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:42.040 --> 03:15:44.030 align:start position:0%
 
done

03:15:44.030 --> 03:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
done
 
03:15:47.110 --> 03:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
um yeah it's going to have to be soon so
 
03:15:51.030 --> 03:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
to get it done um early next week so
 
03:15:55.269 --> 03:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
that we may discuss it as best we can on
 
03:15:55.279 --> 03:15:56.229 align:start position:0%
that we may discuss it as best we can on
the

03:15:56.229 --> 03:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:15:59.189 --> 03:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
14th um that still gives us a little
 
03:16:02.349 --> 03:16:02.359 align:start position:0%
time we may not we we're not obligated
 
03:16:02.359 --> 03:16:04.070 align:start position:0%
time we may not we we're not obligated
to

03:16:04.070 --> 03:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:16:07.150 --> 03:16:07.160 align:start position:0%
make um actions on every bill because
 
03:16:09.189 --> 03:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
the larger committee can do that
 
03:16:12.030 --> 03:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
independent of us and so they're not the
 
03:16:13.349 --> 03:16:13.359 align:start position:0%
larger committee is certainly not
 
03:16:16.229 --> 03:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
beholden to the subcommittee it's the
 
03:16:21.469 --> 03:16:21.479 align:start position:0%
opposite so um as proofed by HB 608 and
 
03:16:21.479 --> 03:16:23.550 align:start position:0%
opposite so um as proofed by HB 608 and
so

03:16:23.550 --> 03:16:23.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:16:27.269 --> 03:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
um we may not we may not take action on
 
03:16:29.550 --> 03:16:29.560 align:start position:0%
every bill that that we've identified as
 
03:16:31.630 --> 03:16:31.640 align:start position:0%
being before this subcommittee but I
 
03:16:32.870 --> 03:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
will try
 
03:16:36.670 --> 03:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
to um to some degree acknowledge each
 
03:16:39.870 --> 03:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
bill that was originally listed and say
 
03:16:42.389 --> 03:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
what you know what was the you know
 
03:16:44.550 --> 03:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
aspect that was gerine to the
 
03:16:47.389 --> 03:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
subcommittee's uh interests
 
03:16:50.189 --> 03:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
I'll try to include that in the report
 
03:16:53.550 --> 03:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
um and my my goal is again to try and
 
03:16:56.349 --> 03:16:56.359 align:start position:0%
get this to the committee by the
 
03:16:59.150 --> 03:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
11th at least a a
 
03:17:03.550 --> 03:17:03.560 align:start position:0%
fairly decent draft and then um we will
 
03:17:06.830 --> 03:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
have further discussion on the 14th and
 
03:17:09.870 --> 03:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
the minority party is always welcome to
 
03:17:13.070 --> 03:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
submit a minority version to as an
 
03:17:15.670 --> 03:17:15.680 align:start position:0%
addendum to the
 
03:17:21.269 --> 03:17:21.279 align:start position:0%
um uh report so and we will
 
03:17:21.279 --> 03:17:24.830 align:start position:0%
um uh report so and we will
include

03:17:24.830 --> 03:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:28.189 --> 03:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Allen's research
 
03:17:31.189 --> 03:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
memos as well
 
03:17:35.389 --> 03:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
as um this testimony if I have time I
 
03:17:38.750 --> 03:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
will also try and capture a few of the
 
03:17:42.469 --> 03:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
salent points of testimony from um the
 
03:17:44.670 --> 03:17:44.680 align:start position:0%
various people that we've heard speak
 
03:17:47.469 --> 03:17:47.479 align:start position:0%
which includes uh secretary scanland
 
03:17:49.229 --> 03:17:49.239 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary
 
03:17:52.429 --> 03:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
Hennessy um Mr Clement totz
 
03:17:57.870 --> 03:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
from um the ACLU Mr O'Brien from uh on
 
03:18:02.030 --> 03:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
behalf of America votes and um of course
 
03:18:04.710 --> 03:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
Mr Richard so I I will not try to
 
03:18:07.309 --> 03:18:07.319 align:start position:0%
summarize Mr Richard's testimony but of
 
03:18:09.630 --> 03:18:09.640 align:start position:0%
course he h he has his own summary so
 
03:18:13.830 --> 03:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll include that and and
 
03:18:16.790 --> 03:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
um uh and those will be a you know
 
03:18:19.189 --> 03:18:19.199 align:start position:0%
addendums or attachments to the report
 
03:18:19.199 --> 03:18:20.710 align:start position:0%
addendums or attachments to the report
as

03:18:20.710 --> 03:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:18:20.720 --> 03:18:22.269 align:start position:0%
as
necessary

03:18:22.269 --> 03:18:22.279 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
03:18:25.670 --> 03:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
um so that those are the you know my my
 
03:18:28.830 --> 03:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
sort of main thoughts I want to discuss
 
03:18:32.349 --> 03:18:32.359 align:start position:0%
um actions or or whether or not we need
 
03:18:35.349 --> 03:18:35.359 align:start position:0%
to take any actions on on the uh
 
03:18:37.590 --> 03:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
remaining bills within the
 
03:18:40.990 --> 03:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um and I want to discuss
 
03:18:42.750 --> 03:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
the aspects of the
 
03:18:45.349 --> 03:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
report and
 
03:18:48.870 --> 03:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
um it any other comments I welcome uh
 
03:18:52.349 --> 03:18:52.359 align:start position:0%
comments or responses to what I've just
 
03:18:55.990 --> 03:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
said M representative C I was just uh
 
03:18:57.870 --> 03:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
wondering what were we going to try to
 
03:19:00.790 --> 03:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
come up with recommendations for
 
03:19:03.189 --> 03:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
correcting the bills that are in front
 
03:19:06.710 --> 03:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
of us uh or just try to
 
03:19:09.070 --> 03:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
summarize the
 
03:19:13.950 --> 03:19:13.960 align:start position:0%
areas um and whether or not we should be
 
03:19:18.030 --> 03:19:18.040 align:start position:0%
U coming up with a overall all solution
 
03:19:21.030 --> 03:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
possibly as legislation for next
 
03:19:24.349 --> 03:19:24.359 align:start position:0%
year I uh that's an excellent question I
 
03:19:27.830 --> 03:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
I do think it is uh yes all of the above
 
03:19:29.910 --> 03:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
um so I think if if we have
 
03:19:31.550 --> 03:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
opportunities to do something in the
 
03:19:33.309 --> 03:19:33.319 align:start position:0%
short term I think we certainly want to
 
03:19:38.269 --> 03:19:38.279 align:start position:0%
do that if we want to take a longer term
 
03:19:40.429 --> 03:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
solution and I use this merely as an
 
03:19:43.389 --> 03:19:43.399 align:start position:0%
example you know citizenship within New
 
03:19:46.309 --> 03:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that that that uh is certainly
 
03:19:48.229 --> 03:19:48.239 align:start position:0%
not something you know that would
 
03:19:51.830 --> 03:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
involve uh cacr it would involve changes
 
03:19:54.790 --> 03:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
to the rsas it would in it would require
 
03:19:57.469 --> 03:19:57.479 align:start position:0%
a comprehensive approach and it would
 
03:19:59.750 --> 03:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
require a lot of coordination
 
03:20:04.990 --> 03:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
between um you know our uh Secretary of
 
03:20:08.309 --> 03:20:08.319 align:start position:0%
State um the uh people on the other side
 
03:20:10.790 --> 03:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
of the wall
 
03:20:13.510 --> 03:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
and and the attorney general for certain
 
03:20:15.710 --> 03:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
yes thank you thank you very much thank
 
03:20:17.990 --> 03:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
you for on behalf of all the lawyers yes
 
03:20:21.229 --> 03:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
uh thank thank you very much so um we we
 
03:20:24.349 --> 03:20:24.359 align:start position:0%
certainly need to
 
03:20:27.110 --> 03:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh keep that in mind for any long-term
 
03:20:29.950 --> 03:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
Solutions so I don't think
 
03:20:33.269 --> 03:20:33.279 align:start position:0%
that what this committee could do is
 
03:20:37.550 --> 03:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
comment perhaps uh in the report on
 
03:20:39.189 --> 03:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
possible long-term
 
03:20:43.030 --> 03:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
Solutions and you know really
 
03:20:45.990 --> 03:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
just make notes of what I said I think
 
03:20:49.189 --> 03:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
you know then it is up to the chair or
 
03:20:52.309 --> 03:20:52.319 align:start position:0%
or individuals if the it'll be up to the
 
03:20:54.750 --> 03:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
chair of the election law committee if
 
03:20:56.870 --> 03:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
he then wishes
 
03:21:00.710 --> 03:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
to form a a subcommittee to further
 
03:21:02.630 --> 03:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
review the that
 
03:21:06.030 --> 03:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
aspect um you know pursuant to what was
 
03:21:08.950 --> 03:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
done last year for the uh Finance
 
03:21:11.309 --> 03:21:11.319 align:start position:0%
aspects so I think you know it's really
 
03:21:14.229 --> 03:21:14.239 align:start position:0%
would be up to Chairman Barry at that
 
03:21:17.189 --> 03:21:17.199 align:start position:0%
point and but but it's c within the
 
03:21:19.870 --> 03:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
purview and the mission statement of the
 
03:21:21.189 --> 03:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
oh I forgot to read the mission
 
03:21:24.550 --> 03:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
statement uh earlier but it's within the
 
03:21:27.309 --> 03:21:27.319 align:start position:0%
perview of this subcommittee to make
 
03:21:29.630 --> 03:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
those sort of recommendations I think if
 
03:21:32.189 --> 03:21:32.199 align:start position:0%
there is any short-term long
 
03:21:34.950 --> 03:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
short-term recommendations those should
 
03:21:38.830 --> 03:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
be with you know proposals to changes to
 
03:21:38.840 --> 03:21:39.790 align:start position:0%
be with you know proposals to changes to
the

03:21:39.790 --> 03:21:39.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:21:42.469 --> 03:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
RSA that we or the bills that amendments
 
03:21:44.710 --> 03:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
to the bills that we have before so if
 
03:21:47.550 --> 03:21:47.560 align:start position:0%
anyone has thoughts along those lines
 
03:21:50.950 --> 03:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
um let me know
 
03:21:55.229 --> 03:21:55.239 align:start position:0%
um yeah representative Lane um I'm gonna
 
03:21:57.349 --> 03:21:57.359 align:start position:0%
I'll give uh representative
 
03:22:00.429 --> 03:22:00.439 align:start position:0%
Nome credit for this but when we were
 
03:22:04.110 --> 03:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
talking um in the break one thought we
 
03:22:05.990 --> 03:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
had because we've got all this
 
03:22:07.590 --> 03:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
information and we're missing the
 
03:22:09.630 --> 03:22:09.640 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's information because
 
03:22:11.950 --> 03:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
they can't come in and I just think
 
03:22:15.030 --> 03:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
that's really critical when we make our
 
03:22:18.030 --> 03:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations so you suggested maybe
 
03:22:21.910 --> 03:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
we retain a lot of these bills or retain
 
03:22:23.630 --> 03:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
some of them with the idea that we would
 
03:22:25.510 --> 03:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
be because some of them are kind of on
 
03:22:28.030 --> 03:22:28.040 align:start position:0%
the same topic so do we
 
03:22:32.150 --> 03:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
retain but I it because that's kind of
 
03:22:35.550 --> 03:22:35.560 align:start position:0%
what we did in the campaign Finance one
 
03:22:38.229 --> 03:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
is that then we spent the summer God
 
03:22:41.229 --> 03:22:41.239 align:start position:0%
forbid I'm sorry everybody but spent the
 
03:22:45.990 --> 03:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
summer and fall working on those bills
 
03:22:49.110 --> 03:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
and so that they were able to come in
 
03:22:51.790 --> 03:22:51.800 align:start position:0%
with amendments and really thought out
 
03:22:54.990 --> 03:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
and worked on and very comprehensive and
 
03:22:56.710 --> 03:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
and because this is a big issue big
 
03:22:59.469 --> 03:22:59.479 align:start position:0%
issues here and I I hate to feel rushed
 
03:23:01.990 --> 03:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
and that's you know and I we learned a
 
03:23:04.229 --> 03:23:04.239 align:start position:0%
lot today I think around the absentee
 
03:23:07.830 --> 03:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
voting piece and I know that and I I'm
 
03:23:09.990 --> 03:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
not even sure if any of these bills
 
03:23:13.349 --> 03:23:13.359 align:start position:0%
really touch on that custody piece that
 
03:23:16.590 --> 03:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
we have I I don't recall but anyway that
 
03:23:18.229 --> 03:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
that would be my and I think just along
 
03:23:19.510 --> 03:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
those lines and I think representative
 
03:23:21.389 --> 03:23:21.399 align:start position:0%
CU you had kind of touched on that idea
 
03:23:24.389 --> 03:23:24.399 align:start position:0%
about retaining some of these as well um
 
03:23:26.469 --> 03:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
but especially in consideration of the
 
03:23:31.309 --> 03:23:31.319 align:start position:0%
ACLU case and Mr Richard's case that I'd
 
03:23:33.950 --> 03:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
hate to kind of go out
 
03:23:38.150 --> 03:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
and do a couple rsas now and then have
 
03:23:41.030 --> 03:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
the legal framework with with which in W
 
03:23:43.269 --> 03:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
within which we need to act kind of
 
03:23:45.429 --> 03:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
pulled the rug out from under us and be
 
03:23:46.990 --> 03:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
in the same exact
 
03:23:48.389 --> 03:23:48.399 align:start position:0%
area next
 
03:23:50.550 --> 03:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
year although I know it's it's always a
 
03:23:51.990 --> 03:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
moving battle there'll always be court
 
03:23:54.790 --> 03:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
cases but I think we may want to let the
 
03:23:56.670 --> 03:23:56.680 align:start position:0%
dust settle from last
 
03:23:56.680 --> 03:23:59.150 align:start position:0%
dust settle from last
year's

03:23:59.150 --> 03:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
year's
 
03:24:02.070 --> 03:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
amendments and and I think retaining
 
03:24:04.030 --> 03:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
would give us that opportunity to let
 
03:24:06.110 --> 03:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
that let that dust settle take a
 
03:24:09.349 --> 03:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
holistic approach to all of this because
 
03:24:12.670 --> 03:24:12.680 align:start position:0%
I think from my point of view while the
 
03:24:13.790 --> 03:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
and correct me if I'm wrong with the
 
03:24:15.550 --> 03:24:15.560 align:start position:0%
mission kind of started out as a
 
03:24:19.429 --> 03:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
non-resident voting concept but I think
 
03:24:21.269 --> 03:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
a lot of what we've talked about and
 
03:24:23.830 --> 03:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
heard and learned is that it really is
 
03:24:27.189 --> 03:24:27.199 align:start position:0%
coming down to two classes of Voters and
 
03:24:29.750 --> 03:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
we need to kind of bring everything in a
 
03:24:31.550 --> 03:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
line to one
 
03:24:35.349 --> 03:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
class and I think that I I think it kind
 
03:24:38.990 --> 03:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
of misses the original intent but I
 
03:24:42.870 --> 03:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
think it was a the right path to go on
 
03:24:46.990 --> 03:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
um and I think that that retaining
 
03:24:49.870 --> 03:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
some all almost I I don't have an idea
 
03:24:52.030 --> 03:24:52.040 align:start position:0%
yet on which ones to kind of keep around
 
03:24:54.189 --> 03:24:54.199 align:start position:0%
for that but to then have it as a study
 
03:24:56.510 --> 03:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
to really get a
 
03:24:59.269 --> 03:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
holistic approach for
 
03:25:03.309 --> 03:25:03.319 align:start position:0%
everything uh might be just as a
 
03:25:05.510 --> 03:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
suggestion uh thank you for that
 
03:25:09.469 --> 03:25:09.479 align:start position:0%
representative Newsome I think um my so
 
03:25:12.389 --> 03:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
first of all um we have no power to
 
03:25:15.990 --> 03:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
retain U but but the but but we can make
 
03:25:20.189 --> 03:25:20.199 align:start position:0%
that a recommendation so um I need so I
 
03:25:22.189 --> 03:25:22.199 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to clarify in case anyone
 
03:25:25.469 --> 03:25:25.479 align:start position:0%
listening uh I have no illusions of
 
03:25:27.309 --> 03:25:27.319 align:start position:0%
power I just want people to understand
 
03:25:32.630 --> 03:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
that so um uh but I I do think you know
 
03:25:34.550 --> 03:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
I do think that there are some you know
 
03:25:37.469 --> 03:25:37.479 align:start position:0%
obviously some merits to that we want to
 
03:25:39.460 --> 03:25:39.470 align:start position:0%
think through this and we we want
 
03:25:39.470 --> 03:25:41.229 align:start position:0%
think through this and we we want
[Music]

03:25:41.229 --> 03:25:41.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:25:43.790 --> 03:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
to I think we want to improve things but
 
03:25:47.429 --> 03:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
we also uh don't want to create a lot of
 
03:25:49.950 --> 03:25:49.960 align:start position:0%
double work where we're fixing something
 
03:25:51.790 --> 03:25:51.800 align:start position:0%
this year and then fixing it again next
 
03:25:54.469 --> 03:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
year and then the following year if we
 
03:25:58.349 --> 03:25:58.359 align:start position:0%
all are elected um fixing it one more
 
03:26:00.750 --> 03:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
time or Cho yeah or choose choose to
 
03:26:03.110 --> 03:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
continue to uh inflict this upon
 
03:26:05.550 --> 03:26:05.560 align:start position:0%
ourselves so
 
03:26:09.389 --> 03:26:09.399 align:start position:0%
um representative C I was just thinking
 
03:26:12.030 --> 03:26:12.040 align:start position:0%
that one of the things that we probably
 
03:26:17.830 --> 03:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
should um uh talk about is an idea
 
03:26:19.349 --> 03:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
because that's one of the things that
 
03:26:22.790 --> 03:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
seems to be more urgent than than a lot
 
03:26:25.990 --> 03:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
of other things and I thought it was
 
03:26:30.030 --> 03:26:30.040 align:start position:0%
interesting uh what the gentleman from
 
03:26:34.870 --> 03:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
ACLU was speaking about in particular if
 
03:26:37.510 --> 03:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
a person doesn't drive he doesn't need a
 
03:26:41.229 --> 03:26:41.239 align:start position:0%
driver's license and in fact if if
 
03:26:44.389 --> 03:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
there's no other issue he doesn't need
 
03:26:46.910 --> 03:26:46.920 align:start position:0%
any kind of photo ID on on
 
03:26:49.550 --> 03:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
him and it's not a requirement to live
 
03:26:52.189 --> 03:26:52.199 align:start position:0%
in the state to have an
 
03:26:55.630 --> 03:26:55.640 align:start position:0%
ID but he still should be allowed to
 
03:26:58.950 --> 03:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:03.030 --> 03:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
that's yeah and and um right and there
 
03:27:05.510 --> 03:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
is a there is a non-driver
 
03:27:08.710 --> 03:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
identification that the DMV provides I
 
03:27:11.630 --> 03:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
think we you know that is something that
 
03:27:16.309 --> 03:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
is a current capability we are not if if
 
03:27:18.670 --> 03:27:18.680 align:start position:0%
we pursue that for identification
 
03:27:21.389 --> 03:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
purposes for those people who are not
 
03:27:23.550 --> 03:27:23.560 align:start position:0%
driving that is
 
03:27:26.870 --> 03:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
not we're not asking for the DMV to take
 
03:27:29.750 --> 03:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
on a new capacity it's something they
 
03:27:33.710 --> 03:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
currently do I think um and that has
 
03:27:36.469 --> 03:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
some merits to consider but um so you
 
03:27:39.950 --> 03:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
have followup Mr represent as a followup
 
03:27:44.269 --> 03:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
on that uh it may be that we might want
 
03:27:46.710 --> 03:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
to specify a certain situation
 
03:27:49.830 --> 03:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
where the fee for getting the non-
 
03:27:54.870 --> 03:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:58.229 --> 03:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
waved yes I I I think that's that's that
 
03:28:01.870 --> 03:28:01.880 align:start position:0%
makes sense we we certainly do not want
 
03:28:05.950 --> 03:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
um any perception of that to be a you
 
03:28:09.030 --> 03:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
know the proverbial pull tax or anything
 
03:28:13.670 --> 03:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:18.429 --> 03:28:18.439 align:start position:0%
um the the key is that no voter is
 
03:28:21.630 --> 03:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
overly burdened I think that's certainly
 
03:28:26.150 --> 03:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
what I have seen from the uh court cases
 
03:28:29.110 --> 03:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
that we've been uh that have been
 
03:28:35.590 --> 03:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:38.349 --> 03:28:38.359 align:start position:0%
any the comment representative Lane I
 
03:28:40.750 --> 03:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
was just gonna say I think that that
 
03:28:43.429 --> 03:28:43.439 align:start position:0%
that might be the kind of in the report
 
03:28:45.510 --> 03:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
when it comes out is that we kind of
 
03:28:46.710 --> 03:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
look at the
 
03:28:49.309 --> 03:28:49.319 align:start position:0%
because we heard that for purposes of
 
03:28:52.269 --> 03:28:52.279 align:start position:0%
just identifying who you are you know
 
03:28:55.309 --> 03:28:55.319 align:start position:0%
any kind of picture that shows that you
 
03:28:58.229 --> 03:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
are who you are may be acceptable but it
 
03:29:00.030 --> 03:29:00.040 align:start position:0%
may be different in different
 
03:29:02.830 --> 03:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances and so um and that might
 
03:29:05.309 --> 03:29:05.319 align:start position:0%
be something that comes out of the
 
03:29:08.830 --> 03:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
report and we could maybe amend those
 
03:29:12.910 --> 03:29:12.920 align:start position:0%
statutes and kind of do those if we want
 
03:29:16.910 --> 03:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
if not retain them I mean I'm not in um
 
03:29:18.349 --> 03:29:18.359 align:start position:0%
I had another thought but I don't
 
03:29:20.309 --> 03:29:20.319 align:start position:0%
remember um because I'm I'm getting
 
03:29:22.550 --> 03:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
really tired we had an interesting
 
03:29:24.870 --> 03:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
meeting earlier
 
03:29:27.110 --> 03:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
today I I think I'm about to hit the
 
03:29:29.870 --> 03:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
wall so okay all right well I I resp
 
03:29:32.469 --> 03:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
representative C you mentioned one word
 
03:29:34.910 --> 03:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
that just caught my ear was overburdened
 
03:29:37.229 --> 03:29:37.239 align:start position:0%
and I just thought about people standing
 
03:29:39.070 --> 03:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
in lines because last night I stood in
 
03:29:41.590 --> 03:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
line for over half an hour to vote at my
 
03:29:44.070 --> 03:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
school district meeting and it was
 
03:29:46.670 --> 03:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
interesting because
 
03:29:49.750 --> 03:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh everybody in the long line was from
 
03:29:53.750 --> 03:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
my town ofden everybody else they were
 
03:29:55.469 --> 03:29:55.479 align:start position:0%
going out and saying anybody from any of
 
03:29:57.830 --> 03:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
the other towns there's no line at your
 
03:30:03.269 --> 03:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
station wow wow okay that's uh yeah I
 
03:30:05.790 --> 03:30:05.800 align:start position:0%
mean that is something that uh election
 
03:30:07.910 --> 03:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
law and the municipalities certainly
 
03:30:10.710 --> 03:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
have to wrestle with we do not want long
 
03:30:13.950 --> 03:30:13.960 align:start position:0%
lines and our voters to be burdened by
 
03:30:17.830 --> 03:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
that aspect and we need to really uh but
 
03:30:19.910 --> 03:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's not merely an election law
 
03:30:21.670 --> 03:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
problem election law committee problem
 
03:30:26.030 --> 03:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
it is a problem for the Ws to consider
 
03:30:29.030 --> 03:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
um let me go around
 
03:30:34.110 --> 03:30:34.120 align:start position:0%
um uh and ask for any final comments um
 
03:30:37.950 --> 03:30:37.960 align:start position:0%
representative Nome not at this time
 
03:30:42.590 --> 03:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:46.990 --> 03:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
Burnham I um am over welmed with some
 
03:30:49.630 --> 03:30:49.640 align:start position:0%

03:30:53.309 --> 03:30:53.319 align:start position:0%
today thank you very much representative
 
03:30:56.309 --> 03:30:56.319 align:start position:0%

03:31:00.070 --> 03:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
full and representative blade I'll I'll
 
03:31:02.870 --> 03:31:02.880 align:start position:0%

chair I went through um 385 which was my
 
03:31:14.389 --> 03:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
bill that was undoing
 
03:31:17.950 --> 03:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
1569 and um I found uh a couple of
 
03:31:20.070 --> 03:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
things that should have been omitted and
 
03:31:24.309 --> 03:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
I've put in to OS to do an amendment um
 
03:31:27.389 --> 03:31:27.399 align:start position:0%
but I do have copies of what I sent to
 
03:31:30.550 --> 03:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
