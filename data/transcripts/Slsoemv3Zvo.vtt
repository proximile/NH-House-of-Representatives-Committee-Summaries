West prior to that they lost their big
 
00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
for the five consecutive games prior to
 
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 align:start position:0%

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.029 align:start position:0%
the conference Championship and lost all
five

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 align:start position:0%
games the athletic director out at they
 
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 align:start position:0%
call it Beach Long Beach okay at beach
 
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
um came up to the coach and said we want
 
00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
you to retire well you're done he said
 
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
please let me play through the
 
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
conference Championship with my kids and
 
00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
he said no you're going to have to
 
00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
retire and he says no I won't
 
00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
retire and so he played the
 
00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
championship in the big West they won
 
00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 align:start position:0%
the first game the second game and the
 
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 align:start position:0%
third game and took the
 
00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
championship and what they are now
 
00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
they're the 15th seed into the
 
00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
NCAA uh March Madness right now yeah
 
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
they have to play Arizona the second
 
00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
seed but that is a miracle what happened
 
00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:54.199 align:start position:0%
there and we talk often times about the
 
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
Cinderella teams I think Cinderella
 
00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 align:start position:0%
already occurred and you know I'll be
 
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
I'll be on Thursday if we're in session
 
00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 align:start position:0%
Rick lad will be looking at that game
 
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
when we're in session because I'm really
 
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 align:start position:0%
excited to see something like that and
 
00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
looking at coach Monson you just wonder
 
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
what's so special about
 
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
him he's been with Long Beach for 17
 
00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 align:start position:0%
years prior to that he was pulled by
 
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
Minnesota and Minnesota was having a
 
00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
real problem with their athletes and
 
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
academics he cleaned that up but the
 
00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
most important thing to look at in his
 
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 align:start position:0%
career should go back to
 
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 align:start position:0%
1999 and and he was one that brought in
 
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
a real small College into the uh March
 
00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:37.639 align:start position:0%
Madness that small College was called
 
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
Gonzaga and he took him to the elite
 
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
elite 8 in his first season with Gonzaga
 
00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 align:start position:0%
and so this man is really and what the
 
00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:49.759 align:start position:0%
kids said to him before they went into
 
00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 align:start position:0%
this championship in their conference
 
00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
League he they said to him Coach don't
 
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 align:start position:0%
worry we got you back and they came
 
00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
together and they did it so that's what
 
00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
you know what a good coach and a good
 
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:05.560 align:start position:0%
teacher can do and and uh I hope we you
 
00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:07.360 align:start position:0%
know can just watch a little bit of that
 
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
and see what happens I'm going to hand
 
00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
the gavl over right now and give it to
 
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.280 align:start position:0%

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chair I have forwarded
 
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
to the committee a front page article on
 
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.350 align:start position:0%
to the committee a front page article on
Art

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
Art
 
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
Ellison you may recall art has not been

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
and he's been hospice for uh about three
 
00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:37.479 align:start position:0%
weeks now and uh so the uh the article I
 
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
think uh captures his Spirit uh and his
 
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
priorities as a legislator and as a
 
00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:46.879 align:start position:0%

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:11.480 align:start position:0%
systems who was talking about
 
00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
consolidation and consolidation was
 
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:16.600 align:start position:0%
taken many many different ways and as as
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
I mentioned to you uh when I introduced
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
1450 originally consolidation as I saw
 
00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
was trying to merge different programs
 
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
together between campuses it was not
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
aimed at that word that some are not
 
00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
wanting spoken merger that's not what we
 
00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
were talking about but what we have now
 
00:10:38.829 --> 00:10:38.839 align:start position:0%
before us is an amendment which is the
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
whole bill and it's been declared non-
 
00:10:44.949 --> 00:10:44.959 align:start position:0%
gerine by the speaker and the the house
 
00:10:47.069 --> 00:10:47.079 align:start position:0%
clerk doe to the fact we're changing
 
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
statutory reference from 188j to
 
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:55.480 align:start position:0%
1898 um 7 a that's one part but the
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
title of the bill has also been changed
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
I'll read the title here so you can see
 
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
that the word consolidation it's not
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
there requiring the university system of
 
00:11:04.509 --> 00:11:04.519 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and the community college
 
00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:06.200 align:start position:0%
system of New Hampshire to further work
 
00:11:07.949 --> 00:11:07.959 align:start position:0%
toward implementing comprehensive higher
 
00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
education alignment strategies and
 
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
findings identified in the governor's
 
00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
public higher education task force
 
00:11:17.069 --> 00:11:17.079 align:start position:0%
report so the governor's task force
 
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:19.000 align:start position:0%
report has been we've been working on
 
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
Fridays I'm kind of getting burned out
 
00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
on Fridays and but we've been doing this
 
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
for I don't know how long Mr Apple be 10
 
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:29.560 align:start position:0%
weeks 10 weeks and it's been you know
 
00:11:32.069 --> 00:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
constant that and and when we didn't
 
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:34.360 align:start position:0%
didn't get one on on on higher education
 
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
of course the trustees decide to have
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
their meeting on the same Friday so it's
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
been just full boore and what we've done
 
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
through that is we've looked at where we
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
are with higher education today and what
 
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
we need to have to do to align
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
strategies and develop these findings to
 
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
bring some of these efficiencies into
 
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
our system to to address some of the
 
00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
issues that we hear spoken to in our
 
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
public and amongst
 
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
ourselves so some of the changes which
 
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
we see there you can see there's a
 
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
change in the act itself the title
 
00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:09.750 align:start position:0%
change in the act itself the title
that's

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:12:13.069 --> 00:12:13.079 align:start position:0%
important we we can't stand still and
 
00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
watch our demographic in the state slide
 
00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
down from 210,000 students when I came
 
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:21.519 align:start position:0%
on board here to now roughly 154 to
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
160,000 K through2 students that means
 
00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
we're feeding fewer students we have
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
fewer population moving in that's not
 
00:12:31.389 --> 00:12:31.399 align:start position:0%
just similar to New Hampshire but it's
 
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:33.560 align:start position:0%
it's similar to all New England states
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
and in fact our country so we're all
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
challenged to draw these students to our
 
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:39.560 align:start position:0%
University system and I want to make
 
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
sure that everybody's aware that the
 
00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
university system right now and the
 
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
community college system are wonderful
 
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
wonderful institutions when you look at
 
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
the three uh four-year systems we have
 
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
UNH has an exemplary research program
 
00:12:59.389 --> 00:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
when you look at Keen there's a
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
wonderful education preparation program
 
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
there and and getting some of the
 
00:13:06.269 --> 00:13:06.279 align:start position:0%
theater areas and and the music programs
 
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
which they have exceptional and when you
 
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
get to the cluster program which
 
00:13:11.949 --> 00:13:11.959 align:start position:0%
Plymouth state has and dealing with the
 
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
community and their teacher programs and
 
00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
their business programs they have a
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
wonderful program and staff that is
 
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
really working as Mr Monson works with
 
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
his coaches and that's the way I see it
 
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
in these schools the community college
 
00:13:27.189 --> 00:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
system is equal in providing that
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
Regional services that are NE necessary
 
00:13:33.629 --> 00:13:33.639 align:start position:0%
in the state to a bring in affordability
 
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
the Dual con concurrent enrollment
 
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
program is an exceptional program which
 
00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
has led to that but also what those uh
 
00:13:42.509 --> 00:13:42.519 align:start position:0%
schools are doing in terms of trying to
 
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
get the not the traditional young 18 19
 
00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:47.839 align:start position:0%
year old student but they're drafting in
 
00:13:50.189 --> 00:13:50.199 align:start position:0%
the students are coming back for career
 
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
change and Workforce need to meet
 
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
Workforce needs that are oft times in
 
00:13:56.749 --> 00:13:56.759 align:start position:0%
their mid 20s 30s 40s and I'm sure that
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
the chanc behind me can say there's some
 
00:14:01.749 --> 00:14:01.759 align:start position:0%
even higher than that in age uh that are
 
00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
retooling so looking at the amendment
 
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
itself the non- gerain amendment the on
 
00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:10.759 align:start position:0%
line 17 the university system New
 
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Community College system
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
shall in accordance with findings
 
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
identified in the public higher
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
education task force report develop and
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
Implement systemwide higher education
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
alignment strategies too doe a through
 
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
uh F there those strategies were in the
 
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh Governor's executive report so that's
 
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
not changed at all we did add in a g
 
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
that's on line 28 and that simply says
 
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
continue collaborative work establishing
 
00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
curricular Pathways for transfer a
 
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
program and a degree credit amongst the
 
00:14:44.829 --> 00:14:44.839 align:start position:0%
2-year and four-year systems that's
 
00:14:48.269 --> 00:14:48.279 align:start position:0%
hp53 and that is we're we're not saying
 
00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
we're there yet we've heard testimony
 
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
come in from our provos saying yes we
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
have 30 uh uh degree programs were
 
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
were're aligning between but we haven't
 
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
got there with all of them yet yet and
 
00:15:01.629 --> 00:15:01.639 align:start position:0%
but we're working towards that and we
 
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
should have that work all completed by
 
00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:07.839 align:start position:0%
uh June 30 of of this of this year but
 
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
we don't want to leave it at that so we
 
00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
put that in this report turning to the
 
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
sheet we're looking at what we want the
 
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
the the higher education uh task force
 
00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
uh was also setting up a commission a
 
00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:35.240 align:start position:0%
commission and we know that a commission
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't go in effect until a commission
 
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
to oversee this the commission wouldn't
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
go in effect until at least July 1 or
 
00:15:45.389 --> 00:15:45.399 align:start position:0%
when this is signed in the law we
 
00:15:48.309 --> 00:15:48.319 align:start position:0%
already have a higher education study
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
committee made up of senators and
 
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
representatives with that task if you
 
00:15:55.949 --> 00:15:55.959 align:start position:0%
look into our statutes they have the
 
00:15:57.949 --> 00:15:57.959 align:start position:0%
responsibility doing exactly what that
 
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
commission would do we don't need to
 
00:16:01.949 --> 00:16:01.959 align:start position:0%
establish another
 
00:16:05.309 --> 00:16:05.319 align:start position:0%
commission so we are advocating that
 
00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
there be a oversight committee and that
 
00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:10.680 align:start position:0%
oversight committee will receive
 
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
quarterly reports it's like a a a flight
 
00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
path where we're going from where we are
 
00:16:19.069 --> 00:16:19.079 align:start position:0%
to where we want to go and there are
 
00:16:21.629 --> 00:16:21.639 align:start position:0%
quarterly reports due along that flight
 
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
path each year and with an annual report
 
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
that's also due so there is going to be
 
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
open communication between where what's
 
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
going on now who's going to be doing the
 
00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
what's going on the report stipulates
 
00:16:39.949 --> 00:16:39.959 align:start position:0%
that we are going to be handing to them
 
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh I also want to look at you know you
 
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:44.680 align:start position:0%
have at the bottom I I think of of of
 
00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
the sheet that I handed out to you the
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
members of the governor's higher
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
education task
 
00:16:53.069 --> 00:16:53.079 align:start position:0%
force look down through those names and
 
00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
you can see folks that are from the
 
00:16:57.030 --> 00:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
business industry Association you see
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
them from doe you can see them from the
 
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
Department of Employment Security the
 
00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner you can see the
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
chancellors of both the the uh
 
00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
University system and the community
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
college system you can see Senator gray
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
on it myself on it representative luno
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
on it you can see Nick thus who has been
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
HHS commissioner and also with the
 
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
community college system Ed Smith uh
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
also with the college system George
 
00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
Hansel is from the trustees of the uh
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
University system New Hampshire
 
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:32.200 align:start position:0%
and Jackie Eastwood who's always a kick
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
she's also on the trustee board uh from
 
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
the University system and very much into
 
00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:39.160 align:start position:0%
business and small business uh and
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
George Hansel also being small business
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
oriented so that group coming together
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
and I feel honored to been a part of
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
that I you know I'm looking at these
 
00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
people that have all this wisdom and all
 
00:17:51.549 --> 00:17:51.559 align:start position:0%
this understanding where we need to go
 
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:54.760 align:start position:0%
and respond to so higher education can
 
00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
be responding to the everchanging needs
 
00:17:59.710 --> 00:17:59.720 align:start position:0%
of our Workforce and of the economy and
 
00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
of making education affordable for
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
students and that's one of the drivers
 
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:08.440 align:start position:0%
of this report we know that uh we cannot
 
00:18:10.909 --> 00:18:10.919 align:start position:0%
continue charging what we're charging
 
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:13.240 align:start position:0%
for Education it's it's hard for our New
 
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire kids it really is to come up
 
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
with that and come out with all this
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
huge debt and that's been an issue of
 
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
discussion amongst group so we have this
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
draft draft report right here and I want
 
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
to caution this is draft it hasn't been
 
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh final we meet again this Friday yeah
 
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
this Friday and possibly the Friday
 
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
after that to try and bring some closure
 
00:18:39.549 --> 00:18:39.559 align:start position:0%
to this um I I feel that this is a
 
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
wonderful report we're not getting down
 
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
and mentioning what's in that report in
 
00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
this bill that's not what it's all about
 
00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
we have tasked in the uh uh uh non-gain
 
00:18:53.789 --> 00:18:53.799 align:start position:0%
Amendment here it's the responsibility
 
00:18:56.029 --> 00:18:56.039 align:start position:0%
of the two chancellors to work
 
00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
collaboratively together and look at how
 
00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%
these efficiencies can occur we've
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
already heard discussion regarding that
 
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
of the idea of of merging or putting
 
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
administrative uh leadership in a
 
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
location a single colocation where you
 
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
have now people working together not
 
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:17.200 align:start position:0%
duplicating Services where you might
 
00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:18.799 align:start position:0%
have the university system hanging out
 
00:19:21.149 --> 00:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
at nhti now and University system
 
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
hanging out at the other end down by the
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
shopping mall they're going to be
 
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
together working cooperatively together
 
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:28.760 align:start position:0%
we need those efficiencies and those
 
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
efficiencies have already started and
 
00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:34.039 align:start position:0%
some of the specifics that are they are
 
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
driving at I'm sure will be spoken at to
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
when others come up to speak so in
 
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
conclusion I'd like to recommend that we
 
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
move this forward there there may be
 
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
some other additions to this amendment
 
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
when it gets to the Senate Side based
 
00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
upon the findings and recommendations
 
00:19:53.549 --> 00:19:53.559 align:start position:0%
that come out of this report uh but this
 
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
is something where there needs to be a
 
00:19:59.470 --> 00:19:59.480 align:start position:0%
uh a oversight type group looking at
 
00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:01.960 align:start position:0%
what's going on keeping people on task
 
00:20:03.789 --> 00:20:03.799 align:start position:0%
making sure reports are done making sure
 
00:20:06.149 --> 00:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
change occurs and that's the going to be
 
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
the responsibility as it stands right
 
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:10.360 align:start position:0%
now the high education study committee
 
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
so I'd be glad to take any any questions
 
00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
committee thank you representative
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%
representative Miler thank you Mr
 
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
chair as I look at your a through G here
 
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
um representing
 
00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
lad and you'd mentioned earlier
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
the question of student
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
debt is there a reason why that was not
 
00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
the the specific issue of student debt
 
00:20:41.669 --> 00:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
was not part of the aggregate here that
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:49.640 align:start position:0%
G um I I I understand that that these
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
are meant to streamline cost for the
 
00:20:52.559 --> 00:20:53.950 align:start position:0%
are meant to streamline cost for the
institution

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
institution
 
00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
Etc but we this committee has has also
 
00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
had a bill before us earlier that talked
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
about student debt so I was just it's
 
00:21:05.149 --> 00:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
just a question of why that wasn't
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
highlighted as part of the uh a a
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
through G there's a lot of reasons why
 
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:14.360 align:start position:0%
in see the optim optimizing access for
 
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
students that's part of it but we've
 
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
also identified other issues which are
 
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
relative to that and I think you you
 
00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
might get a better response uh rather
 
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
than I taking that time from we have the
 
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
chancellors behind us we recognize
 
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
that there's that part of the part of
 
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
that equation comes back to the
 
00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.310 align:start position:0%
that equation comes back to the
legislature

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
um we appropriated money last year for
 
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
the Dual concurrent enrollment program
 
00:21:46.029 --> 00:21:46.039 align:start position:0%
but when it came out of the house and
 
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
approved by the Senate the annual amount
 
00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
was knocked down a million dollar and so
 
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
that meant that few our students could
 
00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
take advantage of that program and that
 
00:21:58.909 --> 00:21:58.919 align:start position:0%
is a a cost-saving driver for for
 
00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:01.400 align:start position:0%
students so uh I believe that that
 
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
that's one area that we we need to be
 
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
looking at we have also looked at other
 
00:22:09.149 --> 00:22:09.159 align:start position:0%
ways of uh uh driving home and I I think
 
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
that U uh Chancellor Rubenstein or
 
00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
Chancellor Prov proventure can speak to
 
00:22:17.269 --> 00:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
the possibilities what Nei has just
 
00:22:20.269 --> 00:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
approved with the in relative relative
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
to a three-year degree um and and how
 
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
that might be a cost savings to students
 
00:22:28.669 --> 00:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
as well uh also we have Grant guarantee
 
00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
in there and expanding programs such as
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
that what you're often times looking at
 
00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:36.200 align:start position:0%
the actual cost of what a a a student
 
00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:38.799 align:start position:0%
has to pay for tuition it's not what
 
00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
you're actually seeing some of our
 
00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
students especially those that are
 
00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
coming from the lower income levels are
 
00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
having to pay Granite guarantee pays for
 
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
a good good hunk of that but that's
 
00:22:51.310 --> 00:22:51.320 align:start position:0%
never seen so so we ought to look at net
 
00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.510 align:start position:0%
never seen so so we ought to look at net
as

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
well coruption s thank you um and thank
 
00:22:58.990 --> 00:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
so I'm curious because you talked about
 
00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
the dual enrollment with high schools uh
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
the and and I forget the name of the
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
program because it's changed again but
 
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799 align:start position:0%
when um my older daughter is a high
 
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
school as a college first year student
 
00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
this year and many of her friends are
 
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:13.880 align:start position:0%
finding that the colleges are not
 
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
recognizing those credits and so I just
 
00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't sure if there was
 
00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
something um in this to make sure that
 
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
those dual enrollment between Community
 
00:23:24.029 --> 00:23:24.039 align:start position:0%
College and High School courses are
 
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
being truly recognized those those
 
00:23:28.029 --> 00:23:28.039 align:start position:0%
courses which are offered by the
 
00:23:29.789 --> 00:23:29.799 align:start position:0%
community know system here in the state
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
are recognized the issue we have is we
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
have a lot of players in the game right
 
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
now I know the the school where my my
 
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
grandkids are going to school the Dual
 
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment is through
 
00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:45.080 align:start position:0%
snow and that I I I'm not going to speak
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
to SN but uh I will speak to standards
 
00:23:50.029 --> 00:23:50.039 align:start position:0%
academic standards and what are the
 
00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
requirements for an individual who's Pro
 
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
providing that instruction in the
 
00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
classroom uh we have the re uh uh
 
00:23:58.269 --> 00:23:58.279 align:start position:0%
responsibity in this state to ensure
 
00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039 align:start position:0%
that that a instructor that's in the
 
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
high school providing the class meet the
 
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
standards of
 
00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:07.520 align:start position:0%
accreditation and that means they have
 
00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:09.640 align:start position:0%
to have a master's program excuse me in
 
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
the subject area um those all those
 
00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
courses will be approved if it's that
 
00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
way now there are some courses that you
 
00:24:20.029 --> 00:24:20.039 align:start position:0%
may see that one has earned and they're
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
gen Ed courses that may not be
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
transferable to a program like
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
engineering at UNH their math program
 
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
may require
 
00:24:31.149 --> 00:24:31.159 align:start position:0%
additional information or additional
 
00:24:33.549 --> 00:24:33.559 align:start position:0%
instruction yes and that's another area
 
00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
you might be asking those behind me um
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
but uh I have not heard that any of the
 
00:24:42.029 --> 00:24:42.039 align:start position:0%
courses the running Start programs or
 
00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:43.960 align:start position:0%
the Dual concurrent programs which are
 
00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:47.480 align:start position:0%
being offered through through nhti have
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
not been accepted in our community
 
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
college system they have to be accepted
 
00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
the money passes through them and and uh
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
from the legislature to them to provide
 
00:25:00.789 --> 00:25:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:04.159 align:start position:0%

um um what's on um Roman 3 on the the
 
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
page two of the amendment and um and and
 
00:25:40.029 --> 00:25:40.039 align:start position:0%
and basically how
 
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
how the amendment to um to
 
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
1450 is um uh re
 
00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:52.559 align:start position:0%
really puts the you know puts a focus on
 
00:25:56.269 --> 00:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
the uh the the task Force's final report
 
00:26:00.909 --> 00:26:00.919 align:start position:0%
and the um um really the cooperation and
 
00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
um and and work that will begin once the
 
00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
final report is issued uh and um you
 
00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
know to implement changes and and and
 
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
seek alignment uh among both the
 
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
community college system and the
 
00:26:17.950 --> 00:26:17.960 align:start position:0%
university system and how that connects
 
00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:19.880 align:start position:0%
with with a committee that exists
 
00:26:23.149 --> 00:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
currently in the um um in the
 
00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
legislature y the uh the committee
 
00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
report which this is very draft and
 
00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
everything I've given you as draft
 
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
speaks to those findings and
 
00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
recommendations that will be implemented
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
or worked towards because we're not
 
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
there on on on some some of this more
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
short term we are moving that direction
 
00:26:45.549 --> 00:26:45.559 align:start position:0%
but the long-term
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
Outlet is is going to be achieved and
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
what this does in paragraph Roman three
 
00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
it identifies the two people are
 
00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:54.830 align:start position:0%
it identifies the two people are
absolutely

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
responsible for reporting back the two
 
00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.549 align:start position:0%
responsible for reporting back the two
Chancellor

00:26:59.549 --> 00:26:59.559 align:start position:0%
Chancellor
 
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
and we're very fortunate to have these
 
00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
two chancellors I think we're in a
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
position now where we have people that
 
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
have individuals who have communicated
 
00:27:12.029 --> 00:27:12.039 align:start position:0%
worked with brought Provost in it's
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
their leadership that we we need to
 
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
engage with those chancellors were
 
00:27:18.669 --> 00:27:18.679 align:start position:0%
responsible for bringing in these
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
quarterly reports and notice that the
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
quarter ending June 30th
 
00:27:27.149 --> 00:27:27.159 align:start position:0%
2024 or as requested by the
 
00:27:29.789 --> 00:27:29.799 align:start position:0%
committee we have the ability even to
 
00:27:33.149 --> 00:27:33.159 align:start position:0%
back it off if we want uh however I I
 
00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
think that that and with the annual
 
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
report which starts right off there will
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
be an annual report summarizing what
 
00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:41.960 align:start position:0%
those quarterly reports are and where
 
00:27:44.509 --> 00:27:44.519 align:start position:0%
we're going in terms that will help us
 
00:27:44.519 --> 00:27:45.310 align:start position:0%
we're going in terms that will help us
and

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:45.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:48.669 --> 00:27:48.679 align:start position:0%
appropriating dollars where necessary so
 
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
we'll have that information for finance
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
to to work with and I'm hoping that
 
00:27:57.789 --> 00:27:57.799 align:start position:0%
education policy and the the fiscal
 
00:27:59.950 --> 00:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
people in the legislature will listen to
 
00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:02.799 align:start position:0%
these reports there are some real needs
 
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
that we're encountering and it's got to
 
00:28:07.149 --> 00:28:07.159 align:start position:0%
be a shared responsibility between
 
00:28:10.029 --> 00:28:10.039 align:start position:0%
business and industry manufacturing and
 
00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
it has to be shared with the legislature
 
00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
and of course there has to be some
 
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
ownership on the part of the students as
 
00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
well yes but we recognize there's many
 
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
needs here and I I just I I I I think
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
that that last Roman 3 paragraph is
 
00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:27.320 align:start position:0%
really important because it explains the
 
00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:31.240 align:start position:0%
process to be followed and without that
 
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
um it would have been another one of
 
00:28:34.269 --> 00:28:34.279 align:start position:0%
these reports is put in the circular
 
00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:38.200 align:start position:0%
file and we get what we get and so I'll
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
let the the folks behind me are really
 
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
into this not that I'm not but I know
 
00:28:48.509 --> 00:28:48.519 align:start position:0%
that I know that uh Mr applebe has been
 
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
busy over there dedicating with his
 
00:28:54.029 --> 00:28:54.039 align:start position:0%
associate their at least 25% of their
 
00:28:56.509 --> 00:28:56.519 align:start position:0%
time right now over doe working on this
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
report it's a lot of work a lot going
 
00:29:01.389 --> 00:29:01.399 align:start position:0%
into it and I know the chancellor just
 
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
I'm amazed each time I either call Kathy
 
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
or talk to Mark that there's something
 
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:08.200 align:start position:0%
else they're trying to do in terms of
 
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
how to work closer together I see that
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
bonding and that relationship now
 
00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
stronger than I've ever seen it in the
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
past and we need to take advantage of it
 
00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
and they are real quick follow up follow
 
00:29:23.149 --> 00:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr chair and and when you
 
00:29:25.389 --> 00:29:25.399 align:start position:0%
talk about um the Chancellor's reporting
 
00:29:27.149 --> 00:29:27.159 align:start position:0%
back to a committee you're not talking
 
00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
about this committee you're talking
 
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
about higher education study Comm higher
 
00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
education study that's correct committee
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
yes and uh and and how how it will then
 
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
put some structure to those meetings as
 
00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:43.720 align:start position:0%
well to uh to to look at progress
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
towards the recommendation in this
 
00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:46.799 align:start position:0%
report is that correct yes and the
 
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
higher education committee is mandated
 
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
by Statute to meet four times a year
 
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
more than that often uh the duties and
 
00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:55.480 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are in law right now
 
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
and they have to have the hearing
 
00:29:58.990 --> 00:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
process as we have a hearing process
 
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
every time they meet so it's very very
 
00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
transparent further questions from the
 
00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:07.720 align:start position:0%

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:50.120 align:start position:0%
committee yes represent s thank you just
 
00:31:54.149 --> 00:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
to follow so are are you saying as as I
 
00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:56.559 align:start position:0%
asked uh chairman lad my question has to
 
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
do at the running start because I'm
 
00:31:59.230 --> 00:31:59.240 align:start position:0%
hearing from students who are at
 
00:32:01.509 --> 00:32:01.519 align:start position:0%
University system schools that their
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
running starts are not necessarily being
 
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
recognized my school participates with
 
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
um Great Bay Community College for those
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
programs and and they are teachers that
 
00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:12.799 align:start position:0%
are supposedly doing this but kids are
 
00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:14.360 align:start position:0%
taking the courses and then getting
 
00:32:15.389 --> 00:32:15.399 align:start position:0%
there and discovering they have to
 
00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
retake classes that they thought they
 
00:32:19.509 --> 00:32:19.519 align:start position:0%
completed so just trying to understand
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
where the breakdown sure I I'm not aware
 
00:32:25.269 --> 00:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
of specific um credits that are not
 
00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
being transferred um I would love to
 
00:32:30.149 --> 00:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
touch base with you and find out what
 
00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
those courses are it's my understanding
 
00:32:34.990 --> 00:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
I know anecdotally that um some of my
 
00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
friends they're their um children their
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
credits did transfer so I I'd really
 
00:32:43.149 --> 00:32:43.159 align:start position:0%
like to um touch base offline and get
 
00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
some specifics and I'll dig into
 
00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
that thank you reg Miler thank you thank
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
you for being here question that I have
 
00:32:55.549 --> 00:32:55.559 align:start position:0%
is that as you look at this road map
 
00:32:55.559 --> 00:32:56.830 align:start position:0%
is that as you look at this road map
going

00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
going
 
00:32:59.710 --> 00:32:59.720 align:start position:0%
forward what role do students
 
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
play in the decision
 
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
making as you Mo move forward well
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
actually the task force um one of our
 
00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
meetings we did get input from students
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
um from all of the University system
 
00:33:18.269 --> 00:33:18.279 align:start position:0%
campuses as well as um community college
 
00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:20.519 align:start position:0%
students so there's absolutely an
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
awareness that we need to engage with
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
students and I will say we've also had a
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
lot of conversation around not just
 
00:33:29.110 --> 00:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
students students that are in our public
 
00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:31.519 align:start position:0%
higher ed institutions but
 
00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
students um in the K through2 system
 
00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
that that the community college system
 
00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
and the university system could be a
 
00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:41.960 align:start position:0%
little more intentional about our
 
00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
intersection with um working with k12
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
and the CTE centers so um representative
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
Miler I think that's we're well aware of
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
the importance of engaging with
 
00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:56.360 align:start position:0%
students and represent
 
00:33:59.710 --> 00:33:59.720 align:start position:0%
luno Thank you very much Mr chair so um
 
00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much um Chancellor
 
00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
for for um being here this morning one
 
00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:07.880 align:start position:0%
of the magic words I think in in the um
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
uh in the amendment and uh and it's in
 
00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:13.919 align:start position:0%
the um it's in the title and it's used
 
00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
in the in the draft report is the word
 
00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:19.240 align:start position:0%
alignment and uh and I think one of and
 
00:34:20.669 --> 00:34:20.679 align:start position:0%
this sort of goes to I think
 
00:34:24.750 --> 00:34:24.760 align:start position:0%
Representatives um SE and Myers's um
 
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
previous two
 
00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
questions alignment when it comes to
 
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
meeting student needs alignment when it
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
comes to um um
 
00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:38.919 align:start position:0%
meeting e or or achieving efficiencies
 
00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:41.720 align:start position:0%
within the um the and and we've most
 
00:34:44.109 --> 00:34:44.119 align:start position:0%
recently talked about the three systems
 
00:34:45.629 --> 00:34:45.639 align:start position:0%
the university system the community
 
00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:49.000 align:start position:0%
college system and K12 um in New
 
00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and then finally alignment
 
00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:52.919 align:start position:0%
when it comes to meeting the state's
 
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
needs for um for business development
 
00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
and Workforce and I was wondering if you
 
00:34:59.790 --> 00:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
could talk a little bit about what
 
00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
alignment uh means and I know that's a
 
00:35:06.589 --> 00:35:06.599 align:start position:0%
little bit of a of a report preview but
 
00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
uh but you know it's it's definitely
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
Central toh to this U uh Amendment as
 
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
well certainly the the task force and
 
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
again um I'll reiterate reiterate what
 
00:35:20.109 --> 00:35:20.119 align:start position:0%
representative Vlad previously stated
 
00:35:22.829 --> 00:35:22.839 align:start position:0%
around draft recommendations right now
 
00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
in the report because obviously it has
 
00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
not been issued but um a topic that the
 
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
task force has discussed and um is
 
00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
considering recommending are Regional
 
00:35:35.359 --> 00:35:36.950 align:start position:0%
considering recommending are Regional
and

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:40.990 --> 00:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
Statewide um councils if you will or
 
00:35:43.829 --> 00:35:43.839 align:start position:0%
tapping into so I'll go to Economic
 
00:35:46.109 --> 00:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
Development first there are already
 
00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
Regional um Economic
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
Development groups that meet and ccsnh
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
and usnh should be participating and
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
have a seat in the table there again be
 
00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
more intentional with um Economic
 
00:36:05.109 --> 00:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
Development Workforce of course as I've
 
00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:07.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned um really the only way we can
 
00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:09.800 align:start position:0%
impact a Workforce is if we have
 
00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:13.160 align:start position:0%
enrollment so and the same we've been
 
00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:18.200 align:start position:0%
discussing relative to K12 ccsnh usnh
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
more Regional ongoing not
 
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
oneandone um relationships around the
 
00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:24.990 align:start position:0%
oneandone um relationships around the
state

00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
between all of Education every level to
 
00:36:32.309 --> 00:36:32.319 align:start position:0%
ensure that we're um meeting the needs
 
00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:35.480 align:start position:0%
of all of our students who wish to go on
 
00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
to further their education however that
 
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
looks um Beyond high school did I answer
 
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
your question okay
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
great thank you further questions
 
00:36:45.359 --> 00:36:46.430 align:start position:0%
great thank you further questions
representative

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
your work and for helping us with this
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you could inform us a
 
00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
bit about line 22 where it says do
 
00:36:59.550 --> 00:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
improve accessibility and compatibility
 
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire students
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
specifically does that in some way
 
00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:08.200 align:start position:0%
Encompass um representative Myer's
 
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
earlier question about student debt and
 
00:37:13.109 --> 00:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
financing because I am also concerned
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
that that huge issue is not apparent
 
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
here so I I think it absolutely does
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
relative to accessibility and
 
00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
compatibility one size doesn't fit all
 
00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
for all students um so if students
 
00:37:31.309 --> 00:37:31.319 align:start position:0%
students can take those courses um in
 
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
high school that can then transfer to
 
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
the community college system you it's
 
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
possible that students could actually
 
00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
leave high school with an associates
 
00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:43.880 align:start position:0%
degree um and the other the other part
 
00:37:46.309 --> 00:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
of it is a degree
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
isn't maybe what everyone wants or needs
 
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
there are certificate programs um could
 
00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
work with business and industry on
 
00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
tailoring those so and and we've talked
 
00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:03.200 align:start position:0%
at the task force also about there are
 
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
likely many students in high school
 
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
where education Beyond high school isn't
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
even a twinkle in their eye so how do we
 
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
engage with those students um I will say
 
00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
as a former State Treasurer um relative
 
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
to student debt I think another big
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
piece of that is financial
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
literacy um for families and students
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
before they get to us um I don't know
 
00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:34.520 align:start position:0%
how to solve that but that's actually a
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
not just a state issue that's a national
 
00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:39.829 align:start position:0%
not just a state issue that's a national
issue

00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
so it's not exactly fall it's a separate
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
question okay um and now I just forgot
 
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
what it was sorry come back to me sorry
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:38:55.349 --> 00:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
questions one more chance representative
 
00:38:59.589 --> 00:38:59.599 align:start position:0%
Damon or afterwards thank you thank you
 
00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:02.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for being
 
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
Rubenstein I'm sorry comic relief on
 
00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:11.510 align:start position:0%
Rubenstein I'm sorry comic relief on
Monday

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
Monday
 
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
morning I just wanted to hear your
 
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
remarks in terms of what if anything the
 
00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:19.480 align:start position:0%
task force has been addressing in terms
 
00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:22.280 align:start position:0%
of collaboration with CTE programs and
 
00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
whether dual enrollment works with that
 
00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
student population as well
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
we haven't done a deep the task force
 
00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:34.280 align:start position:0%
has not done a deep dive into CTE and
 
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
dual enrollment we have had discussions
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
that many of the CTE programs in the
 
00:39:42.109 --> 00:39:42.119 align:start position:0%
state are over subscribed and there are
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
waiting lists um but that's that is
 
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
woven into the draft recommendations in
 
00:39:53.589 --> 00:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:56.309 --> 00:39:56.319 align:start position:0%
report thank
 
00:39:56.319 --> 00:40:05.470 align:start position:0%
report thank
you

00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:09.750 align:start position:0%
 
welcome

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
Chancellor do you want to press the
 
00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cordelli good
 
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
morning and thank you to the committee
 
00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:19.720 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you to director applebe and
 
00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:21.640 align:start position:0%
Dr marks for their leadership and
 
00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
stewardship of the task force and also
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
the chief administrative officer of
 
00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:27.800 align:start position:0%
preventure couldn't ask for a better
 
00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:29.800 align:start position:0%
partner in working with the university
 
00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
system um specific to House Bill 1450 I
 
00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.079 align:start position:0%
I support it uh we we share a set of
 
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
objectives and providing more access to
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
postsecondary education high quality
 
00:40:46.309 --> 00:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
postsecondary education in New Hampshire
 
00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
is really vital for folks who've heard
 
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
me speak before you know that I I
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
believe that this is an area of absolute
 
00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:55.240 align:start position:0%
growth in terms of need and as
 
00:40:57.630 --> 00:40:57.640 align:start position:0%
representative lad described earlier you
 
00:40:59.670 --> 00:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
know part part of the population we
 
00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:01.480 align:start position:0%
serve is not simply the students coming
 
00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
out of high school um about almost 40%
 
00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
of our students are 25 or older they
 
00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
account for about that proportion of our
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
graduates in fact more than 40% of our
 
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
graduates in that group specific to the
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
kinds of Education that they're looking
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
for the kinds of students that we're
 
00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:21.400 align:start position:0%
serving we are currently enrolling about
 
00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:23.480 align:start position:0%
400 students in our nursing programs
 
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:25.640 align:start position:0%
across the seven colleges one in five of
 
00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:27.560 align:start position:0%
those students already holds a bachelor
 
00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:29.800 align:start position:0%
degree in some other field these are
 
00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:32.200 align:start position:0%
adults who find what they need to do in
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
life find their calling at later stage
 
00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:37.480 align:start position:0%
and need education that's accessible in
 
00:41:40.390 --> 00:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
terms of place in terms of time and in
 
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
terms of affordability fitting into the
 
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:45.880 align:start position:0%
competing pressures that they face so I
 
00:41:48.069 --> 00:41:48.079 align:start position:0%
I believe that the work that the task
 
00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:50.200 align:start position:0%
force has been doing the work that this
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
committee would be asked to uh continue
 
00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
to oversee is part of a Statewide
 
00:41:57.589 --> 00:41:57.599 align:start position:0%
commitment to ensure that we are doing
 
00:41:59.670 --> 00:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
the best we can with the resources we
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
have to support all of our
 
00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
students um a number of questions have
 
00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:08.200 align:start position:0%
come up about um dual enrollment I think
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
I can proba probably try and answer some
 
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
of those one one of the considerations
 
00:42:16.829 --> 00:42:16.839 align:start position:0%
and this is true not just for our dual
 
00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:18.280 align:start position:0%
enrollment program sometimes for
 
00:42:20.589 --> 00:42:20.599 align:start position:0%
advanced placement other forms of of
 
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
college level learning that happens at
 
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
high school is that institutions decide
 
00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
that students are better served by
 
00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
having the Full Experience immersed in
 
00:42:31.309 --> 00:42:31.319 align:start position:0%
that College's uh
 
00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
programs but more often I think the
 
00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
barrier is simply that the courses that
 
00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:37.880 align:start position:0%
students take through dual enrollment
 
00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
are often just one or two
 
00:42:43.349 --> 00:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
courses and don't really move the needle
 
00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
on the issue of
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
affordability if you're a full-time
 
00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
student at UNH I believe you can take up
 
00:42:52.349 --> 00:42:52.359 align:start position:0%
to 18 credits before you might face a SE
 
00:42:55.309 --> 00:42:55.319 align:start position:0%
charge for overload uh in Community
 
00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
College our students are typic paying by
 
00:42:59.950 --> 00:42:59.960 align:start position:0%
the credit for the course because the
 
00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:01.640 align:start position:0%
majority of them are part-time students
 
00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
but at most four-year institutions Balor
 
00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
granting institutions students pay for a
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
semester and then they can consume as
 
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
much education as their as their brains
 
00:43:14.349 --> 00:43:14.359 align:start position:0%
uh can can handle and so a student who's
 
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
taken a couple of courses may just wash
 
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
through no real impact what
 
00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
representative lad was speaking about in
 
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
terms of access what we're really trying
 
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
to create are genuinely com
 
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
comprehensive structured Pathways for
 
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
students uh this body I believe now
 
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
three years ago passed House Bill U 1530
 
00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
the pathways Bill between the community
 
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
college system and the university system
 
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
one of our objectives would be to
 
00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:44.520 align:start position:0%
actually anchor those Pathways with
 
00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
Early College courses that students
 
00:43:48.309 --> 00:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
could take while still in high school
 
00:43:49.870 --> 00:43:49.880 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to begin that
 
00:43:52.270 --> 00:43:52.280 align:start position:0%
foundation and not just take one or two
 
00:43:55.349 --> 00:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
courses but over the course of their
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
High School careers potentially take a
 
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
full semester a full year or a complete
 
00:44:02.069 --> 00:44:02.079 align:start position:0%
associate degree that's where you're
 
00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
going to start to see meaningful savings
 
00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
the avoidance of debt that
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
representative Miler had asked about
 
00:44:09.549 --> 00:44:09.559 align:start position:0%
that's really the vision that we have
 
00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:11.960 align:start position:0%
for strengthening dual enrollment as an
 
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
antidote to cost for traditional age
 
00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
students still in high school where we
 
00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
can have that kind of impact and the
 
00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
primary consideration is it's not just
 
00:44:23.829 --> 00:44:23.839 align:start position:0%
affordability but it's access to Quality
 
00:44:26.349 --> 00:44:26.359 align:start position:0%
so part of the challenge is making sure
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
that the faculty and high schools have
 
00:44:31.109 --> 00:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
the academic preparation to deliver the
 
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
curriculum that we offer under our
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
accreditation through New England
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
Commission on higher education that
 
00:44:38.549 --> 00:44:38.559 align:start position:0%
typically requires a master's prepared
 
00:44:40.109 --> 00:44:40.119 align:start position:0%
individual in the discipline that
 
00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:42.440 align:start position:0%
they're teaching one of the objectives
 
00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:44.440 align:start position:0%
we have and one of the things that was
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
enabled through House Bill 2 last year
 
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
was some flexibility this body has in
 
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
the past granted us support for
 
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
scholarships for students to take those
 
00:44:55.309 --> 00:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
dual enrollment sometimes running
 
00:44:58.109 --> 00:44:58.119 align:start position:0%
running start eart more generally Early
 
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
College courses we also find that with
 
00:45:02.829 --> 00:45:02.839 align:start position:0%
flexibility in the language we can
 
00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
actually have our faculty delivering
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
some of those courses in high schools
 
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
that don't necessarily have the
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
academically qualified faculty to teach
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
a particular course in a particular
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
discipline Again part of the broader
 
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
vision of ensuring access to highquality
 
00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
Affordable post-secondary education for
 
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire students in the
 
00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
future um H happy to answer questions
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
the one piece that I would draw
 
00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
attention to from the uh the bill itself
 
00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
as a reference to um uh collocating
 
00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
spaces office spaces both the university
 
00:45:38.829 --> 00:45:38.839 align:start position:0%
system the community college system but
 
00:45:41.230 --> 00:45:41.240 align:start position:0%
also state agencies I I would take that
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
a step further legislature Governor
 
00:45:46.829 --> 00:45:46.839 align:start position:0%
invest significantly in our work I would
 
00:45:48.390 --> 00:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
like for us not just to have state
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
agencies collocated with us I'd really
 
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
like for the state to look at us as
 
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
partners in delivering the need
 
00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
responding to the needs that you have
 
00:45:58.950 --> 00:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
for the state's own work Force 11,000
 
00:46:00.829 --> 00:46:00.839 align:start position:0%
folks working on behalf of the state to
 
00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:03.720 align:start position:0%
serve the citizens of New Hampshire the
 
00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
same thing that I would say for any
 
00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:07.880 align:start position:0%
employer in this state changing
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
technology competitive environment you
 
00:46:11.910 --> 00:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
need the strongest Workforce you can
 
00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
have as Educators who specialize in
 
00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
supporting the learning for adults we we
 
00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:19.079 align:start position:0%
could be good partners in helping to
 
00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
ensure that the state continues to meet
 
00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
the needs of its citizens in that
 
00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:26.200 align:start position:0%

00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
TR thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
question um I had a son who went through
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
the community college system and then
 
00:46:36.589 --> 00:46:36.599 align:start position:0%
graduated from Plymouth it was a great
 
00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
experience for him are there any
 
00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
Community College deserts in the state
 
00:46:43.309 --> 00:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire where it's not
 
00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
accessible well I'm I'm reluctant to say
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
that there are genuine deserts uh White
 
00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:53.240 align:start position:0%
Mountains Community College has probably
 
00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
the largest geography similar to
 
00:46:58.309 --> 00:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
Executive counselor uh Kenny District uh
 
00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
uh pretty much the entire North Country
 
00:47:03.710 --> 00:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
Lakes past uh up to Canada uh but we
 
00:47:06.670 --> 00:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
have locations in Berlin and Littleton
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
we partner with kennet high school and
 
00:47:11.309 --> 00:47:11.319 align:start position:0%
Conway deliver courses maybe more
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
generally it's helpful to know that
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
about 30% of our instruction these days
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
is occurring online so that as long as
 
00:47:19.309 --> 00:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
somebody has access to the internet we
 
00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:21.160 align:start position:0%
can reach them with a lot of our
 
00:47:24.670 --> 00:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
programs um long-term Vision again along
 
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
with dual enrollment and trying to find
 
00:47:29.309 --> 00:47:29.319 align:start position:0%
better ways to serve adult workers is to
 
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
partner with employers throughout the
 
00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
state to be able to deliver courses both
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
on our locations and I partner uh
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
locations to be able to meet those needs
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
for things that are more tactile more
 
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
more Hands-On
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
learning yes thank you a different
 
00:47:45.549 --> 00:47:45.559 align:start position:0%
subject um I was on the commission to
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
study uh education U hospitality and and
 
00:47:52.349 --> 00:47:52.359 align:start position:0%
um that kind of education in the state
 
00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:54.040 align:start position:0%
and so I'm wondering
 
00:47:57.790 --> 00:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
if how well you stay on top of trends
 
00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
for where U jobs are going in the state
 
00:48:03.270 --> 00:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire um thank you
 
00:48:05.309 --> 00:48:05.319 align:start position:0%
representative drive that question that
 
00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
each of our colleges has an Advisory
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
Board that's more GE geographically
 
00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
based but each of our programs also has
 
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
an academic program Advisory Board
 
00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
specifically with that intention
 
00:48:19.829 --> 00:48:19.839 align:start position:0%
probably we can do better part of the
 
00:48:21.870 --> 00:48:21.880 align:start position:0%
discussion the task force with Deputy
 
00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:24.520 align:start position:0%
Commissioner lers has been ensuring that
 
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
we've got a good flow of information
 
00:48:28.109 --> 00:48:28.119 align:start position:0%
from new Hamp Employment Security about
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
Labor Trends to understand make sure
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
we're not missing U demands that are
 
00:48:35.069 --> 00:48:35.079 align:start position:0%
shifting you're
 
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
welcome further questions yeah
 
00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative C thank you and thank you
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
for taking my question in terms of the
 
00:48:44.829 --> 00:48:44.839 align:start position:0%
Community College uh instructors
 
00:48:46.990 --> 00:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
qualifications and the running starter
 
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
dual enrollment you said they have to
 
00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
have a master's degree can that be a
 
00:48:51.390 --> 00:48:51.400 align:start position:0%
masters in anything or does it need to
 
00:48:52.589 --> 00:48:52.599 align:start position:0%
be specific to the subject they're
 
00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:54.520 align:start position:0%
teaching the the intent is to be a
 
00:48:56.190 --> 00:48:56.200 align:start position:0%
master's in the subject that they're
 
00:48:58.870 --> 00:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
teaching that's consistent with our own
 
00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
uh requirements for faculty teaching on
 
00:49:04.789 --> 00:49:04.799 align:start position:0%
our campuses and and with an objective
 
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
in of ensuring the consistency of
 
00:49:09.069 --> 00:49:09.079 align:start position:0%
learning whether it's through dual
 
00:49:11.829 --> 00:49:11.839 align:start position:0%
enrollment on our campuses online and we
 
00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
believe that that's a critical element
 
00:49:17.829 --> 00:49:17.839 align:start position:0%
you're welcome further questions seen
 
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much for being
 
00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:25.720 align:start position:0%

I want to lead with letting everyone
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
know that on Friday uh before the close
 
00:49:53.230 --> 00:49:53.240 align:start position:0%
of the task force meeting we did take a
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
vote on the proposed amendment and it
 
00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
was unanimous
 
00:49:59.710 --> 00:49:59.720 align:start position:0%
uh in recommending uh to this committee
 
00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
that you have the support of the task
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
force uh for this
 
00:50:05.549 --> 00:50:05.559 align:start position:0%
amendment um we've been meeting pretty
 
00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
much weekly since New Year's every
 
00:50:09.789 --> 00:50:09.799 align:start position:0%
Friday as uh chair lad mentioned it's

been uh representative luno as well it's
 
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's been uh you know they've had their
 
00:50:16.109 --> 00:50:16.119 align:start position:0%
mail forwarded on Fridays to to the doe
 
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
and we're um uh getting through the work
 
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh many many great ideas I have to I
 
00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
want to publicly thank the task force
 
00:50:24.549 --> 00:50:24.559 align:start position:0%
because there's been tremendous
 
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
participation and uh lot lots of lots of
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
really good discussion lotss of really
 
00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:32.440 align:start position:0%
good ideas um you know and a couple of
 
00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
themes that we haven't really talked too
 
00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
much about one of which I want to I want
 
00:50:37.789 --> 00:50:37.799 align:start position:0%
to mention here because it's come up
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
this morning and that's the college debt
 
00:50:41.549 --> 00:50:41.559 align:start position:0%
issue right college debt is a real
 
00:50:45.309 --> 00:50:45.319 align:start position:0%
problem um I I I agree with uh Vice
 
00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:47.839 align:start position:0%
Chancellor prenta that um financial
 
00:50:50.589 --> 00:50:50.599 align:start position:0%
literacy in our country is a huge issue
 
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
uh not just of kids but of adults I have
 
00:50:55.309 --> 00:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
personally helped friends uh fill out
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
financial aid forms for their children
 
00:50:59.630 --> 00:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
children and these are friends who are
 
00:51:01.589 --> 00:51:01.599 align:start position:0%
Highly Educated uh one is an attorney
 
00:51:03.789 --> 00:51:03.799 align:start position:0%
and a very good attorney and that
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
financial aid uh process was very very
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
complex and convoluted so um you know
 
00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
the the debt piece I I I view it more of
 
00:51:12.319 --> 00:51:13.109 align:start position:0%
the the debt piece I I I view it more of
a

00:51:13.109 --> 00:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
symptom than um an end result and it's a
 
00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:17.480 align:start position:0%
symptom from the standpoint I think of
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
one financial literacy and I think two
 
00:51:21.789 --> 00:51:21.799 align:start position:0%
one of the issues at least that we face
 
00:51:23.109 --> 00:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and this brings back to
 
00:51:25.230 --> 00:51:25.240 align:start position:0%
the task force why it was formed is
 
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
declining enrollment if we look at our
 
00:51:29.789 --> 00:51:29.799 align:start position:0%
demographics Cher I mentioned this we're
 
00:51:32.309 --> 00:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
seeing a one to two% drop every year in
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
our uh K to2 enrollments in our state
 
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
which means there are less 18y olds
 
00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
right at the end of the at the end of
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
that um time and I think one of the one
 
00:51:44.069 --> 00:51:44.079 align:start position:0%
of the pieces that we we don't always
 
00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
keep in mind is that most colleges are
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
what in business we call the fixed cost
 
00:51:50.829 --> 00:51:50.839 align:start position:0%
model those buildings those
 
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
grounds you can't easily undo those
 
00:51:56.670 --> 00:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
costs right if you build a building you
 
00:51:58.910 --> 00:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
have to maintain it and whether you have
 
00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:00.760 align:start position:0%
a building that's half full of students
 
00:52:03.309 --> 00:52:03.319 align:start position:0%
taking classes or completely full that
 
00:52:05.910 --> 00:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
maintenance charge is not that different
 
00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:09.000 align:start position:0%
and so as as enrollments decline costs
 
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
per student go up it's the same problem
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
we're having in K12 those of youve
 
00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
looked at the K12 numbers so I think one
 
00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
of you know one of the problems
 
00:52:19.309 --> 00:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes with debt is we talk
 
00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
about you know the the the sticker price
 
00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
side but we don't look at the inputs
 
00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
that going into creating that debt and
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
you know one of the goals of this task
 
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
force was how can we increase
 
00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:33.160 align:start position:0%
enrollments because if we canre increase
 
00:52:36.910 --> 00:52:36.920 align:start position:0%
enrollments in our public systems 15 or
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
20% that would allow for cost
 
00:52:41.309 --> 00:52:41.319 align:start position:0%
stabilization because they'd be filling
 
00:52:43.789 --> 00:52:43.799 align:start position:0%
their classes and that would
 
00:52:46.069 --> 00:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
theoretically lower costs for students
 
00:52:49.789 --> 00:52:49.799 align:start position:0%
which would affect that so um just again
 
00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
keeping in mind the focus of the task
 
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
force is really looking at looking ahead
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
to the Future and what type of of postc
 
00:52:58.109 --> 00:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
educational system do we want in our
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
state what are the new trends out there
 
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
what can we do to arrest this declining
 
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
enrollment issue um and that that's been
 
00:53:09.069 --> 00:53:09.079 align:start position:0%
the focus so uh again task force uh was
 
00:53:11.309 --> 00:53:11.319 align:start position:0%
unanimous in support of this amendment
 
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
and um happy to take any
 
00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
questions thank you uh representative
 
00:53:19.069 --> 00:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
luno thanks very much Mr chair and thank
 
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
you very much director applebe for uh
 
00:53:23.789 --> 00:53:23.799 align:start position:0%
being with us this morning and for um
 
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
obviously your your leadership um uh on
 
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
the task force as well um I want to go
 
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
back to the um the amendment and and and
 
00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
pick up another important word right out
 
00:53:37.950 --> 00:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
of the the title but um it talks about
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
findings that are identified in the
 
00:53:41.829 --> 00:53:41.839 align:start position:0%
governor's public higher education task
 
00:53:43.870 --> 00:53:43.880 align:start position:0%
force report and you and I have spoken
 
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
about the importance of the the findings
 
00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
in here and um and I I guess I'd like to
 
00:53:57.349 --> 00:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
sort of hear from you uh about um how um
 
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
how we can make sure that the um that
 
00:54:05.829 --> 00:54:05.839 align:start position:0%
the as this report draft uh becomes you
 
00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:08.559 align:start position:0%
know more final in the next uh in the
 
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
next week literally that um that it it
 
00:54:15.789 --> 00:54:15.799 align:start position:0%
that it has the um the the necessary
 
00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
elements in the um in the report that
 
00:54:22.990 --> 00:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
will um uh really be consistent with the
 
00:54:25.549 --> 00:54:25.559 align:start position:0%
the you know the actions that are being
 
00:54:28.510 --> 00:54:28.520 align:start position:0%
required in the the amendment to
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
1450 thank you representative for the
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
question so um part of our process has
 
00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
been from the beginning of the uh uh
 
00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
from the first task force meeting has
 
00:54:40.109 --> 00:54:40.119 align:start position:0%
been to educate the members of the task
 
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
force um we have spent a great deal of
 
00:54:46.349 --> 00:54:46.359 align:start position:0%
time really looking at um whether it's
 
00:54:47.829 --> 00:54:47.839 align:start position:0%
studies that have been done around the
 
00:54:49.549 --> 00:54:49.559 align:start position:0%
country other initiatives in other
 
00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
states what's going on across highered
 
00:54:54.549 --> 00:54:54.559 align:start position:0%
around the country and as part of that
 
00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
process we've also identified some some
 
00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
key pieces in our own state which
 
00:55:00.349 --> 00:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
representative low Leno mentions uh
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
findings of various things for example
 
00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:05.480 align:start position:0%
findings such as uh the number of high
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
school seniors graduating in our state
 
00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh right now hovering uh just under
 
00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
15,000 around 15,000 a year is down
 
00:55:14.789 --> 00:55:14.799 align:start position:0%
significantly from 20 years ago when
 
00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
that number was um if I'm not mistaken
 
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
was up around 20,000 a year well that
 
00:55:21.789 --> 00:55:21.799 align:start position:0%
5,000 student dropped it's 25% drop in
 
00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:25.960 align:start position:0%
20 years right that uh that finding is a
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
drive of some of the recommendations uh
 
00:55:31.309 --> 00:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
another I think uh
 
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
recommendation having to do with um uh
 
00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:37.240 align:start position:0%
online education and availability of
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
classes online again finding is online
 
00:55:42.109 --> 00:55:42.119 align:start position:0%
education especially coming out of the
 
00:55:44.150 --> 00:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
pandemic has really gone mainstream so
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
to speak I mean we don't need to look
 
00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
much further than a college within our
 
00:55:50.510 --> 00:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
own state that has almost 150,000
 
00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
students because they've gone online and
 
00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:55.400 align:start position:0%
they've made that process of the process
 
00:55:59.549 --> 00:55:59.559 align:start position:0%
of of uh of applying and uh the
 
00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:01.400 align:start position:0%
admissions process the financial aid
 
00:56:03.789 --> 00:56:03.799 align:start position:0%
process they've streamlined all of it um
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
they're not Amazon right how easy it is
 
00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:09.160 align:start position:0%
to buy but they're not far off and again
 
00:56:11.710 --> 00:56:11.720 align:start position:0%
we've another Finding has been how hard
 
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
is it for students to to apply and get
 
00:56:16.029 --> 00:56:16.039 align:start position:0%
accepted and sign up for a class
 
00:56:17.789 --> 00:56:17.799 align:start position:0%
representative L you L know you had a
 
00:56:20.150 --> 00:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
great great example of that on Friday at
 
00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:22.559 align:start position:0%
our meeting around trying to take a
 
00:56:25.069 --> 00:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
class at one of our public institutions
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
and it was not a simple process to
 
00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
enroll in the class right so I think our
 
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
findings uh will be examples that
 
00:56:35.309 --> 00:56:35.319 align:start position:0%
support exactly the the the initiatives
 
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
and recommendations we're going to put
 
00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:41.240 align:start position:0%
forward thank you thank you represent D
 
00:56:43.829 --> 00:56:43.839 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for taking my question
 
00:56:47.870 --> 00:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
could you inform us what uh proportion
 
00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:49.400 align:start position:0%
of New
 
00:56:53.069 --> 00:56:53.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire freshman college
 
00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
students um go to school in New
 
00:56:58.349 --> 00:56:58.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as opposed to going to a
 
00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
private or public institution out of
 
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
state and whether that ratio has changed
 
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
in the last decade or
 
00:57:08.670 --> 00:57:08.680 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question that's a
 
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and I wish I had
 
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
a an answer um I do not we uh we collect
 
00:57:16.349 --> 00:57:16.359 align:start position:0%
some data at the department
 
00:57:19.829 --> 00:57:19.839 align:start position:0%
around uh the that the question that you
 
00:57:23.029 --> 00:57:23.039 align:start position:0%
asked however I am told um by one of my
 
00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
fellow directors who collects that data
 
00:57:26.349 --> 00:57:26.359 align:start position:0%
and it might be the worst data she
 
00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:28.280 align:start position:0%
collects because it is voluntarily
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
reported by guidance counselors around
 
00:57:31.789 --> 00:57:31.799 align:start position:0%
the state so we don't have a great
 
00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
handle on that and when we look at iPads
 
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
in fact I was just looking this morning
 
00:57:41.069 --> 00:57:41.079 align:start position:0%
uh at a report from last year uh it I
 
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
can't give you numbers but I can tell
 
00:57:44.349 --> 00:57:44.359 align:start position:0%
you a significant number of our students
 
00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:47.839 align:start position:0%
leave the state and it is significant um
 
00:57:50.549 --> 00:57:50.559 align:start position:0%
compared to staying in and how that is
 
00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
historically trending I that I couldn't
 
00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:55.720 align:start position:0%
answer but it is certainly a concern
 
00:57:58.029 --> 00:57:58.039 align:start position:0%
many I I believe if we're not the
 
00:58:00.029 --> 00:58:00.039 align:start position:0%
largest exporter of college students
 
00:58:01.789 --> 00:58:01.799 align:start position:0%
we're one of the largest on a per capita
 
00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
basis around the country so yeah and
 
00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
we've actually talked about this at the
 
00:58:08.789 --> 00:58:08.799 align:start position:0%
task force extensively and that desire
 
00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
of high schoolers you know to to get out
 
00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
of town to get away from their families
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
to get out on their own and whereas if
 
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
you're in in Texas it's a huge State you
 
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
can go six hours away and still be in
 
00:58:24.069 --> 00:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
Texas in New Hampshire if you go six
 
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
hours away you're practically in DC so
 
00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:29.160 align:start position:0%
um that that you know geography
 
00:58:31.349 --> 00:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
certainly plays a role but some of it is
 
00:58:33.309 --> 00:58:33.319 align:start position:0%
the 18 19 year old mindset of I want to
 
00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:37.480 align:start position:0%
get away I want to try new things
 
00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:39.510 align:start position:0%
get away I want to try new things
so

00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:42.640 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and I would concur that
 
00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
part of it is the get out of Dodge as it
 
00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
were but I will also note that when my
 
00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
daughters who are now in their early 30s
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
were choosing colleges it was
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
considerably less expensive for them to
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
go out of
 
00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
state so if that hasn't changed and I
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
don't think it
 
00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
has we are partly losing students
 
00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:09.400 align:start position:0%
because of the economy that they
 
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
think I'm in suin County so it could be
 
00:59:19.069 --> 00:59:19.079 align:start position:0%
different in different parts of the
 
00:59:22.029 --> 00:59:22.039 align:start position:0%
state but the perception of the quality
 
00:59:22.039 --> 00:59:22.789 align:start position:0%
state but the perception of the quality
of

00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
unh is not as high as what I think is
 
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
the quality of unh so I think it's
 
00:59:31.750 --> 00:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes perhaps
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
frequently perceived as the default the
 
00:59:35.119 --> 00:59:36.309 align:start position:0%
frequently perceived as the default the
safety

00:59:36.309 --> 00:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
safety
 
00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
School versus way back in the Dark Ages
 
00:59:41.549 --> 00:59:41.559 align:start position:0%
I grew up in the shadows of UMass
 
00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:44.480 align:start position:0%
amst and a lot of the local high school
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
students actually wanted to go there it
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
wasn't a default choice I think it's a
 
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
marketing issue that's not really a
 
00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:54.549 align:start position:0%
marketing issue that's not really a
question

00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:54.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
sorry um for further
 
00:59:57.440 --> 00:59:59.910 align:start position:0%
sorry um for further
questions

00:59:59.910 --> 00:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:00:03.029 --> 01:00:03.039 align:start position:0%
of yes yep and and if there are no
 
01:00:04.589 --> 01:00:04.599 align:start position:0%
further questions I just want to end
 
01:00:06.589 --> 01:00:06.599 align:start position:0%
also want to thank two other individuals
 
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
whove Been instrumental uh in this
 
01:00:10.990 --> 01:00:11.000 align:start position:0%
process and that is um Vice Chancellor
 
01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:13.240 align:start position:0%
preventure and chanc Rubenstein who have

both put in uh really a lot of effort
 
01:00:18.190 --> 01:00:18.200 align:start position:0%
and really kept open minds and that
 
01:00:20.510 --> 01:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
that's made our work I think um more
 
01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
productive more beneficial and and quite
 
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:25.200 align:start position:0%
frankly easier so I want to thank you
 
01:00:28.190 --> 01:00:28.200 align:start position:0%
both of them thank you for that um see
 
01:00:31.789 --> 01:00:31.799 align:start position:0%
no further questions oh
 
01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:35.160 align:start position:0%
yes answer representative D's question I
 
01:00:44.910 --> 01:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:48.029 --> 01:00:48.039 align:start position:0%
um this is to answer your question about
 
01:00:50.390 --> 01:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
the number of students who go out of
 
01:00:53.789 --> 01:00:53.799 align:start position:0%
state to seek higher education and my
 
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
numbers are based on 4 your college
 
01:01:00.789 --> 01:01:00.799 align:start position:0%
goers so not of all the high school
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
graduates those that state go to CCF so
 
01:01:04.079 --> 01:01:05.470 align:start position:0%
graduates those that state go to CCF so
about

01:01:05.470 --> 01:01:05.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
56% of our 4-year College goers leave
 
01:01:12.990 --> 01:01:13.000 align:start position:0%
the state to attend college and it is
 
01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
one of the highest in the country um
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
I'll also note that the number of out
 
01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
ofate students that we have coming in
 
01:01:27.069 --> 01:01:27.079 align:start position:0%
provides the biggest inmigration of
 
01:01:29.710 --> 01:01:29.720 align:start position:0%
talent while while they're here and if
 
01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
if we can keep them here another driver
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
for our economy and our
 
01:01:38.829 --> 01:01:38.839 align:start position:0%
Workforce thank yes quickly please thank
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
you so how does our out of state
 
01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
enrollment compared to other comparable
 
01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:47.430 align:start position:0%
enrollment compared to other comparable
state

01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
universities so our we're about 50/50
 
01:01:55.269 --> 01:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
across the university system um that's
 
01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
lower than Vermont for example UVM I
 
01:02:02.789 --> 01:02:02.799 align:start position:0%
think maybe 75 to 80% of their students
 
01:02:06.109 --> 01:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
are out of state students um
 
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts probably has a higher
 
01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
percentage of instate students than we
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
do um I can tell you when you get
 
01:02:15.430 --> 01:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
outside of New
 
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
England the majority of
 
01:02:21.789 --> 01:02:21.799 align:start position:0%
students um in I'll use Texas as an
 
01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
example are
 
01:02:27.269 --> 01:02:27.279 align:start position:0%
inate right um I do think that has to do
 
01:02:32.309 --> 01:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
with the supply of choices of schools in
 
01:02:35.470 --> 01:02:35.480 align:start position:0%
in the Northeast compared to out west
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
but um so we're about we're about 5050
 
01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
and we've been there for for some
 
01:02:47.470 --> 01:02:47.480 align:start position:0%

students in
 
01:42:44.629 --> 01:42:44.639 align:start position:0%
school you have anything you want to of
 
01:42:48.149 --> 01:42:48.159 align:start position:0%
WID ET ET for well thank you Mr chairman
 
01:42:51.229 --> 01:42:51.239 align:start position:0%
I I had a a pleasant email from my State
 
01:42:53.910 --> 01:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
Rep uh representative Hall who on this
 
01:42:57.669 --> 01:42:57.679 align:start position:0%
committee somewhere she is um that you
 
01:42:59.870 --> 01:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
were discussing this bill and thought
 
01:43:02.790 --> 01:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
that uh maybe some input for me would be
 
01:43:06.709 --> 01:43:06.719 align:start position:0%
helpful um I probably would be better
 
01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
off answering questions uh if you have
 
01:43:15.070 --> 01:43:15.080 align:start position:0%
them but I I will just say that
 
01:43:18.910 --> 01:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
uh e efforts to register high school
 
01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
students has been uh in existence for
 
01:43:23.830 --> 01:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
some time
 
01:43:27.669 --> 01:43:27.679 align:start position:0%
and we uh encourage supervisors of the
 
01:43:31.229 --> 01:43:31.239 align:start position:0%
checklist and town clerks uh that want
 
01:43:34.189 --> 01:43:34.199 align:start position:0%
to conduct a a voter registration
 
01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity for students in high school
 
01:43:39.629 --> 01:43:39.639 align:start position:0%
uh to do that uh but there are some
 
01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
caveats uh to that number one is that uh
 
01:43:46.270 --> 01:43:46.280 align:start position:0%
when there is a registration drive it is
 
01:43:48.270 --> 01:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
a public event and it cannot be
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
restricted or limited to just a certain
 
01:43:54.790 --> 01:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
group or certain class of people so you
 
01:43:56.589 --> 01:43:56.599 align:start position:0%
know if if the supervisors are willing
 
01:43:58.589 --> 01:43:58.599 align:start position:0%
to do a registration drive for high
 
01:44:01.870 --> 01:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
school students uh let's say it should
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
be an open Event so that other members
 
01:44:06.149 --> 01:44:06.159 align:start position:0%
of the community could take advantage of
 
01:44:07.470 --> 01:44:07.480 align:start position:0%
the same
 
01:44:09.790 --> 01:44:09.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh but then if there are
 
01:44:12.070 --> 01:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
other groups in town that would like
 
01:44:13.790 --> 01:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
that same opportunity then the
 
01:44:15.910 --> 01:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist should be
 
01:44:19.669 --> 01:44:19.679 align:start position:0%
willing to do that if the if the uh uh
 
01:44:21.790 --> 01:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
you know local veterans organization
 
01:44:24.910 --> 01:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
wants to have a registration drive for
 
01:44:27.149 --> 01:44:27.159 align:start position:0%
some of their younger members or or
 
01:44:30.510 --> 01:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
whoever uh then the supervisor should be
 
01:44:32.270 --> 01:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
willing to do the same thing and it
 
01:44:35.470 --> 01:44:35.480 align:start position:0%
should also be a public event so that uh
 
01:44:37.270 --> 01:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
you know anybody that's interested in
 
01:44:39.629 --> 01:44:39.639 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of getting registered
 
01:44:41.189 --> 01:44:41.199 align:start position:0%
can do
 
01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
that there is also concerns about
 
01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
offering something of value either
 
01:44:52.750 --> 01:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
Financial value or you know or or or
 
01:44:56.270 --> 01:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
person personal value to get registered
 
01:45:01.470 --> 01:45:01.480 align:start position:0%
to vote so uh you know you can't give uh
 
01:45:04.070 --> 01:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh ice cream cones just to those people
 
01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
that show up to register to vote and
 
01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
nobody else uh you you can't give A's to
 
01:45:14.070 --> 01:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
students uh because they went and
 
01:45:17.070 --> 01:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
registered to vote uh you you don't want
 
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
anything that comes close to the
 
01:45:21.390 --> 01:45:21.400 align:start position:0%
perception of buying a voter's
 
01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
registration or or vote so that's very
 
01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:26.550 align:start position:0%
registration or or vote so that's very
very

01:45:26.550 --> 01:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
important uh in New Hampshire a a a
 
01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
citizen uh that's qualified that wants
 
01:45:36.750 --> 01:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
to register to vote has to do it
 
01:45:39.310 --> 01:45:39.320 align:start position:0%
personally in front of an election
 
01:45:41.910 --> 01:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
official specifically a supervisor of
 
01:45:44.790 --> 01:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
the checklist or town
 
01:45:48.390 --> 01:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
clerk uh teachers for example cannot
 
01:45:50.589 --> 01:45:50.599 align:start position:0%
hand out registration forms in their
 
01:45:52.709 --> 01:45:52.719 align:start position:0%
classroom and have students fill them
 
01:45:52.719 --> 01:45:53.790 align:start position:0%
classroom and have students fill them
out

01:45:53.790 --> 01:45:53.800 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:45:56.310 --> 01:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
um unless it's a registration drive and
 
01:45:59.430 --> 01:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
there is an election official present at
 
01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:02.229 align:start position:0%
there is an election official present at
that

01:46:02.229 --> 01:46:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:05.310 --> 01:46:05.320 align:start position:0%
event the
 
01:46:08.990 --> 01:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
um the last thing I'll say before uh
 
01:46:11.470 --> 01:46:11.480 align:start position:0%
I'll take questions is
 
01:46:14.270 --> 01:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
that 15 months ago I had that special
 
01:46:16.950 --> 01:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
committee on voter confidence that went
 
01:46:20.910 --> 01:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
around the state and uh that that group
 
01:46:23.310 --> 01:46:23.320 align:start position:0%
heard from the whole range of Voters ERS
 
01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
and ideas perspectives uh in New
 
01:46:29.550 --> 01:46:29.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it was a really great exercise
 
01:46:31.070 --> 01:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
uh and we learned that there are some
 
01:46:34.229 --> 01:46:34.239 align:start position:0%
things that are uh agreed upon across
 
01:46:36.430 --> 01:46:36.440 align:start position:0%
the board in that process and and one of
 
01:46:41.109 --> 01:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
those is uh just doing more with Civics
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh and voter
 
01:46:45.070 --> 01:46:45.080 align:start position:0%
education uh and engaging not just
 
01:46:47.870 --> 01:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
students but you know our our whole
 
01:46:50.189 --> 01:46:50.199 align:start position:0%
population and so over the last few
 
01:46:52.510 --> 01:46:52.520 align:start position:0%
months we have been engaging in efforts
 
01:46:54.830 --> 01:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
to knew just that um one of the big
 
01:46:57.390 --> 01:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
events that we had was partnering with
 
01:46:59.510 --> 01:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
an organization called vet the vote and
 
01:47:02.229 --> 01:47:02.239 align:start position:0%
we actually set up a mock polling place
 
01:47:03.229 --> 01:47:03.239 align:start position:0%
uh in
 
01:47:06.950 --> 01:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
marac uh which was uh each of the
 
01:47:10.270 --> 01:47:10.280 align:start position:0%
stations in a polling place was manned
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
by uh veterans who were also local
 
01:47:15.189 --> 01:47:15.199 align:start position:0%
election officials and it was an
 
01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity for other veterans to come
 
01:47:19.870 --> 01:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
in and see exactly what happens in a
 
01:47:22.550 --> 01:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
polling place uh but it was also open to
 
01:47:25.629 --> 01:47:25.639 align:start position:0%
the general public um and the kicker
 
01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
there was that the the uh vet the vote
 
01:47:31.629 --> 01:47:31.639 align:start position:0%
program is also partnered with the NFL
 
01:47:33.550 --> 01:47:33.560 align:start position:0%
so we had three former New England
 
01:47:36.070 --> 01:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
Patriot players there and that helped
 
01:47:38.470 --> 01:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
draw some turnouts so that was a good
 
01:47:42.510 --> 01:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
event um one big plan that I have uh
 
01:47:45.510 --> 01:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
organized for the summer is bringing on
 
01:47:49.189 --> 01:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
a person uh into the office Who as a
 
01:47:52.510 --> 01:47:52.520 align:start position:0%
former educator and starting a a Civic
 
01:47:56.589 --> 01:47:56.599 align:start position:0%
space program for direct Outreach to
 
01:47:59.510 --> 01:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
voters uh you know we'll be looking at
 
01:48:01.750 --> 01:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh high school students college students
 
01:48:04.629 --> 01:48:04.639 align:start position:0%
but also just get getting messaging out
 
01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
to the general public about how our
 
01:48:09.310 --> 01:48:09.320 align:start position:0%
elections actually work uh in an effort
 
01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
to uh reduce the amount of
 
01:48:13.790 --> 01:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
misinformation that is out there related
 
01:48:15.149 --> 01:48:15.159 align:start position:0%
to the election
 
01:48:17.430 --> 01:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
process so with that I'd be happy to
 
01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
have thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:48:27.589 --> 01:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
secretary for being here um so can you
 
01:48:31.310 --> 01:48:31.320 align:start position:0%
speak it all to what law or case law or
 
01:48:33.990 --> 01:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
best practices sort of exist around
 
01:48:36.350 --> 01:48:36.360 align:start position:0%
policies of who is allowed and how they
 
01:48:39.589 --> 01:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
are allowed to assist voters with voting
 
01:48:41.510 --> 01:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
or with
 
01:48:44.310 --> 01:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
registering so the law is very
 
01:48:47.589 --> 01:48:47.599 align:start position:0%
clear as I mentioned that only
 
01:48:51.629 --> 01:48:51.639 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist uh and or
 
01:48:54.310 --> 01:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
the town clerk accept voter registration
 
01:48:57.750 --> 01:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
forms directly from voters and when they
 
01:49:00.109 --> 01:49:00.119 align:start position:0%
do that they are reviewing the
 
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
information on the form uh and then they
 
01:49:04.669 --> 01:49:04.679 align:start position:0%
are looking at the backup
 
01:49:08.629 --> 01:49:08.639 align:start position:0%
documentation that is provided to prove
 
01:49:12.629 --> 01:49:12.639 align:start position:0%
uh identity age citizenship and
 
01:49:15.310 --> 01:49:15.320 align:start position:0%
domicile and in New Hampshire we do have
 
01:49:18.149 --> 01:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
affidavits that a voter consign you know
 
01:49:19.990 --> 01:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
to prove those things that's the state
 
01:49:23.070 --> 01:49:23.080 align:start position:0%
of the law at the current time but those
 
01:49:26.629 --> 01:49:26.639 align:start position:0%
are items that are provided to those
 
01:49:29.790 --> 01:49:29.800 align:start position:0%
election officials and then the election
 
01:49:33.229 --> 01:49:33.239 align:start position:0%
officials will take them back and in a
 
01:49:36.390 --> 01:49:36.400 align:start position:0%
in an advertised session we'll vote on
 
01:49:38.830 --> 01:49:38.840 align:start position:0%
them to add those names to the voter
 
01:49:41.109 --> 01:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
checklist in New Hampshire only
 
01:49:43.270 --> 01:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist can add
 
01:49:46.830 --> 01:49:46.840 align:start position:0%
names to the voter checklist or remove
 
01:49:49.109 --> 01:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
names from the checklist even the
 
01:49:50.790 --> 01:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State cannot do that it's
 
01:49:53.950 --> 01:49:53.960 align:start position:0%
those locally elected individuals that
 
01:49:55.669 --> 01:49:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh have that
 
01:49:55.679 --> 01:49:58.149 align:start position:0%
uh have that
responsibility

01:49:58.149 --> 01:49:58.159 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
01:50:01.950 --> 01:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
um and so it is within the statutory
 
01:50:06.149 --> 01:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
authority of those election officials to
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
not only take registrations when they're
 
01:50:11.310 --> 01:50:11.320 align:start position:0%
in meeting or uh at the clerk's office
 
01:50:13.189 --> 01:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
but they can hold
 
01:50:15.310 --> 01:50:15.320 align:start position:0%
events either in a school or at the
 
01:50:19.510 --> 01:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
local VFW or you know at the at the town
 
01:50:21.669 --> 01:50:21.679 align:start position:0%
uh fair in the summertime you know they
 
01:50:24.350 --> 01:50:24.360 align:start position:0%
can have a table set up where qualified
 
01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
people have an opportunity uh outside of
 
01:50:39.189 --> 01:50:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:41.950 --> 01:50:41.960 align:start position:0%
vote as a school principal or as a
 
01:50:43.350 --> 01:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
social studies teacher I'd like to
 
01:50:45.510 --> 01:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
engage this process in my classroom if I
 
01:50:48.589 --> 01:50:48.599 align:start position:0%
have a supervisor of the checklist come
 
01:50:53.830 --> 01:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
in to uh register students
 
01:50:56.350 --> 01:50:56.360 align:start position:0%
on the format and addressing those four
 
01:50:57.750 --> 01:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
points that you
 
01:51:01.950 --> 01:51:01.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned then do the the supervisor now
 
01:51:05.149 --> 01:51:05.159 align:start position:0%
has this form is that taken back to the
 
01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist for
 
01:51:10.149 --> 01:51:10.159 align:start position:0%
approval or is it approved upon the
 
01:51:13.149 --> 01:51:13.159 align:start position:0%
individual supervisor dealing with it in
 
01:51:15.950 --> 01:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
the in the classroom so in in a
 
01:51:19.109 --> 01:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
situation like that if if a supervisor
 
01:51:21.870 --> 01:51:21.880 align:start position:0%
is going to go someplace and take
 
01:51:21.880 --> 01:51:23.470 align:start position:0%
is going to go someplace and take
registration

01:51:23.470 --> 01:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
registration
 
01:51:26.550 --> 01:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
then it has to be an advertised event it
 
01:51:28.990 --> 01:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
it can't be a private event it it should
 
01:51:31.709 --> 01:51:31.719 align:start position:0%
be advertised just like they're holding
 
01:51:34.910 --> 01:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
you know a a session for receiving
 
01:51:39.990 --> 01:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
applications um and then at that event
 
01:51:42.149 --> 01:51:42.159 align:start position:0%
the registration forms would be
 
01:51:44.750 --> 01:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
collected uh and then T taken back so
 
01:51:47.510 --> 01:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
that the Board of Supervisors has the
 
01:51:50.109 --> 01:51:50.119 align:start position:0%
opportunity to vote on the applications
 
01:51:51.830 --> 01:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
and accept them and then put those names
 
01:51:53.310 --> 01:51:53.320 align:start position:0%
on the checklist
 
01:51:54.709 --> 01:51:54.719 align:start position:0%
and I'll just follow up and then the
 
01:51:58.149 --> 01:51:58.159 align:start position:0%
rest of the committee is that a event at
 
01:52:00.589 --> 01:52:00.599 align:start position:0%
the school in the classroom a singular
 
01:52:02.709 --> 01:52:02.719 align:start position:0%
event only for students or can somebody
 
01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
walk in off the street and say I want to
 
01:52:06.830 --> 01:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
take advantage of this situation and
 
01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:16.149 --> 01:52:16.159 align:start position:0%
um it should be held in a location not
 
01:52:20.550 --> 01:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
specifically a classroom so that the
 
01:52:22.270 --> 01:52:22.280 align:start position:0%
general public can come in if they want
 
01:52:24.550 --> 01:52:24.560 align:start position:0%
to register as
 
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
well the the the issue with schools when
 
01:52:31.149 --> 01:52:31.159 align:start position:0%
these events are held in schools is
 
01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes a lot of high schools are
 
01:52:35.069 --> 01:52:35.079 align:start position:0%
Regional high
 
01:52:37.990 --> 01:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
schools and the students that attend
 
01:52:40.030 --> 01:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
that school are from different towns
 
01:52:42.589 --> 01:52:42.599 align:start position:0%
within the region a supervisor of the
 
01:52:46.709 --> 01:52:46.719 align:start position:0%
checklist can only accept registrations
 
01:52:51.069 --> 01:52:51.079 align:start position:0%
from uh citizens of their town so if it
 
01:52:53.390 --> 01:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
was going to be a you know if the school
 
01:52:56.470 --> 01:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
was going to sponsor an event like that
 
01:52:58.270 --> 01:52:58.280 align:start position:0%
uh and there's four towns in the school
 
01:53:02.350 --> 01:53:02.360 align:start position:0%
district then ideally there should be a
 
01:53:04.589 --> 01:53:04.599 align:start position:0%
representative there from the four towns
 
01:53:07.589 --> 01:53:07.599 align:start position:0%
uh supervisors of the checklist so that
 
01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh each student has the opportunity to
 
01:53:11.870 --> 01:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
do that if if the election officials
 
01:53:12.910 --> 01:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
from town
 
01:53:16.189 --> 01:53:16.199 align:start position:0%
C are not there then the students who
 
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
would be voters in town C would not be
 
01:53:20.750 --> 01:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
able to register at that
 
01:53:22.790 --> 01:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
event I have another question I want to
 
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
ask you represent Hall at this time
 
01:53:27.030 --> 01:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
represent Hall thank you Mr chair and
 
01:53:28.069 --> 01:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here and thank you
 
01:53:30.270 --> 01:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh in a letter
 
01:53:31.870 --> 01:53:31.880 align:start position:0%
you wrote to the supervisor of the
 
01:53:33.470 --> 01:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
checklist in
 
01:53:36.030 --> 01:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
2023 uh you had said the public notice
 
01:53:38.109 --> 01:53:38.119 align:start position:0%
and access to the event are not required
 
01:53:40.629 --> 01:53:40.639 align:start position:0%
if a single supervisor attending the
 
01:53:42.350 --> 01:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
event to receive
 
01:53:44.189 --> 01:53:44.199 align:start position:0%
applications is
 
01:53:47.189 --> 01:53:47.199 align:start position:0%
that is that no longer the case like the
 
01:53:48.990 --> 01:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
Quorum thing and
 
01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
the um I I want to just look back and
 
01:53:56.069 --> 01:53:56.079 align:start position:0%
and double check uh you know the
 
01:53:59.189 --> 01:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
circumstances that that uh was written
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding has been that that that
 
01:54:04.030 --> 01:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
when registrations are taken that they
 
01:54:05.790 --> 01:54:05.800 align:start position:0%
are public
 
01:54:09.229 --> 01:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
events okay um can I follow up actually
 
01:54:10.709 --> 01:54:10.719 align:start position:0%
read want me to read you exactly what it
 
01:54:13.669 --> 01:54:13.679 align:start position:0%
said I was kind of mixing it all up um a
 
01:54:15.629 --> 01:54:15.639 align:start position:0%
single supervisor attending an event to
 
01:54:17.550 --> 01:54:17.560 align:start position:0%
receive applications that will not be
 
01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
acted on until a subsequent supervisor
 
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
session is not a public meeting of the
 
01:54:25.149 --> 01:54:25.159 align:start position:0%
board therefore public notice and access
 
01:54:27.589 --> 01:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
to the event are not required so that's
 
01:54:29.589 --> 01:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
I just want okay so if that's what's
 
01:54:32.350 --> 01:54:32.360 align:start position:0%
written that's the way it is um you know
 
01:54:34.709 --> 01:54:34.719 align:start position:0%
butd fit I'm sure approved that uh butd
 
01:54:36.149 --> 01:54:36.159 align:start position:0%
fit is the legal counsil for the
 
01:54:39.629 --> 01:54:39.639 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office um but the
 
01:54:43.069 --> 01:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
the the key part there was that the
 
01:54:44.990 --> 01:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
registrations would not be approved at
 
01:54:48.550 --> 01:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
that event correct okay thank you
 
01:54:51.149 --> 01:54:51.159 align:start position:0%
further questions yes represent s then
 
01:54:53.830 --> 01:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
represent dry thank you you um I'm
 
01:54:57.430 --> 01:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
wondering just if a Civics teacher had
 
01:54:59.470 --> 01:54:59.480 align:start position:0%
their students filling out sort of the
 
01:55:01.390 --> 01:55:01.400 align:start position:0%
basic information in those forms for the
 
01:55:02.950 --> 01:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
students to then take back to their town
 
01:55:05.669 --> 01:55:05.679 align:start position:0%
clerk's office to to sign and and
 
01:55:07.709 --> 01:55:07.719 align:start position:0%
provide all the necessary documents
 
01:55:10.709 --> 01:55:10.719 align:start position:0%
would that be still within the realm of
 
01:55:12.910 --> 01:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
what's legal so that they're you know
 
01:55:15.790 --> 01:55:15.800 align:start position:0%
because having I live in Durham and have
 
01:55:17.229 --> 01:55:17.239 align:start position:0%
volunteered at a number of Elections and
 
01:55:19.550 --> 01:55:19.560 align:start position:0%
been sworn to assist with this process
 
01:55:21.550 --> 01:55:21.560 align:start position:0%
and we advise people as they're filling
 
01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
things out to get to to a certain line
 
01:55:25.669 --> 01:55:25.679 align:start position:0%
and stop and not sign anything till the
 
01:55:27.990 --> 01:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
supervisor is there monitoring and that
 
01:55:29.510 --> 01:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
they're the ones in fact signing and
 
01:55:32.310 --> 01:55:32.320 align:start position:0%
providing their documents so if a
 
01:55:34.470 --> 01:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
teacher had students doing just the
 
01:55:37.189 --> 01:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
initial portion would that be and then
 
01:55:39.510 --> 01:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
the student takes it with them is that
 
01:55:42.790 --> 01:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
that would not be permitted uh we do not
 
01:55:46.030 --> 01:55:46.040 align:start position:0%
make the registration forms publicly
 
01:55:48.910 --> 01:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
available um because ultimately what
 
01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
happens is a voter will fill one of
 
01:55:54.109 --> 01:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
those out and then mail in and that's
 
01:55:56.510 --> 01:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
just not the way it works in New
 
01:55:56.520 --> 01:55:58.709 align:start position:0%
just not the way it works in New
Hampshire

01:55:58.709 --> 01:55:58.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:55:58.719 --> 01:56:00.950 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
um

01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:05.109 --> 01:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
um so uh that would not be permissible
 
01:56:08.069 --> 01:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
um there is a bill in the legislature
 
01:56:10.510 --> 01:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
right now that would that would create a
 
01:56:14.470 --> 01:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
voter portal which would allow voters
 
01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
potential voters on their laptop to fill
 
01:56:18.550 --> 01:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
out the information that would be
 
01:56:21.589 --> 01:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
required on a voter registration form
 
01:56:23.270 --> 01:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
and that would be sent then to the
 
01:56:24.709 --> 01:56:24.719 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the
 
01:56:27.870 --> 01:56:27.880 align:start position:0%
checklist uh they would review it uh
 
01:56:30.589 --> 01:56:30.599 align:start position:0%
they would bring a copy with them to the
 
01:56:32.669 --> 01:56:32.679 align:start position:0%
polls and then that voter would have to
 
01:56:35.589 --> 01:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
show up either at the polling place or
 
01:56:39.470 --> 01:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
go to the uh supervisor's meeting and
 
01:56:41.629 --> 01:56:41.639 align:start position:0%
sign the forms and show the
 
01:56:43.870 --> 01:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
documentation and the benefit of doing
 
01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
that is that the the information is
 
01:56:51.550 --> 01:56:51.560 align:start position:0%
provided by the voter in electronic form
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
which would say the supervisors from
 
01:56:56.069 --> 01:56:56.079 align:start position:0%
having to transfer
 
01:56:59.470 --> 01:56:59.480 align:start position:0%
illegibly ill legibly written
 
01:57:02.470 --> 01:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
handwritten forums and enter that into
 
01:57:04.629 --> 01:57:04.639 align:start position:0%
the database they'd be able to just
 
01:57:06.830 --> 01:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
transfer once they approve the
 
01:57:08.750 --> 01:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
application and then it should
 
01:57:10.870 --> 01:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
streamline uh the time it takes for a
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
voter to that's registering to vote to
 
01:57:14.430 --> 01:57:14.440 align:start position:0%
move through the polling place if they
 
01:57:17.189 --> 01:57:17.199 align:start position:0%
pre-fill that information
 
01:57:21.430 --> 01:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
out thank you represent dry thank you
 
01:57:23.470 --> 01:57:23.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Secret take my question I
 
01:57:24.990 --> 01:57:25.000 align:start position:0%
just want to go a little in the weeds
 
01:57:28.310 --> 01:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
with representative Hall's letter uh was
 
01:57:32.910 --> 01:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
that the at school it would not be a
 
01:57:35.470 --> 01:57:35.480 align:start position:0%
with a with one supervisor there that
 
01:57:37.030 --> 01:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
would not be a board meeting so it
 
01:57:40.350 --> 01:57:40.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to be um announce as in
 
01:57:44.229 --> 01:57:44.239 align:start position:0%
public now is that different than having
 
01:57:48.589 --> 01:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
that event open to the public so that
 
01:57:50.189 --> 01:57:50.199 align:start position:0%
people members of the public could also
 
01:57:51.750 --> 01:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
come along with high school students to
 
01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:52.709 align:start position:0%
come along with high school students to
register

01:57:52.709 --> 01:57:52.719 align:start position:0%
register
 
01:57:54.750 --> 01:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
like what kind of a meeting or what kind
 
01:57:57.430 --> 01:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
of announcement would be required or
 
01:58:01.229 --> 01:58:01.239 align:start position:0%
needed if the supervisors are meeting to
 
01:58:04.149 --> 01:58:04.159 align:start position:0%
actually place names on the checklist or
 
01:58:07.470 --> 01:58:07.480 align:start position:0%
take names off the checklist uh that
 
01:58:10.430 --> 01:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
that's noticed as a SE session for the
 
01:58:11.589 --> 01:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
correction of the
 
01:58:14.550 --> 01:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
checklist and at that meeting the there
 
01:58:16.629 --> 01:58:16.639 align:start position:0%
has to be a quorum of Supervisors pres
 
01:58:19.149 --> 01:58:19.159 align:start position:0%
so that they can vote uh on the
 
01:58:21.229 --> 01:58:21.239 align:start position:0%
applications that they've received and
 
01:58:22.669 --> 01:58:22.679 align:start position:0%
whether those names get placed on the
 
01:58:24.790 --> 01:58:24.800 align:start position:0%
checklist or
 
01:58:28.709 --> 01:58:28.719 align:start position:0%
not yes so we're having this event at
 
01:58:32.229 --> 01:58:32.239 align:start position:0%
the high school public is invited or
 
01:58:33.950 --> 01:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
announced is it's announced that it's
 
01:58:35.550 --> 01:58:35.560 align:start position:0%
taking place so that members that
 
01:58:36.830 --> 01:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
members of the public can also take
 
01:58:39.550 --> 01:58:39.560 align:start position:0%
advantage of based on what my uh
 
01:58:41.910 --> 01:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
notification that got sent out to local
 
01:58:44.350 --> 01:58:44.360 align:start position:0%
election officials some time ago it
 
01:58:47.069 --> 01:58:47.079 align:start position:0%
sounds like an event could be held
 
01:58:48.830 --> 01:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
without notice to the
 
01:58:53.709 --> 01:58:53.719 align:start position:0%
public um as long as there is uh one
 
01:58:55.950 --> 01:58:55.960 align:start position:0%
supervisor present would that would not
 
01:58:58.790 --> 01:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
be an official session of Supervisors it
 
01:59:02.189 --> 01:59:02.199 align:start position:0%
would just be it would be it would be
 
01:59:02.199 --> 01:59:04.109 align:start position:0%
would just be it would be it would be
like

01:59:04.109 --> 01:59:04.119 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:59:07.030 --> 01:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
um a a new voter going into the clerk's
 
01:59:09.870 --> 01:59:09.880 align:start position:0%
office and filling out the application
 
01:59:13.109 --> 01:59:13.119 align:start position:0%
form um showing the clerk documentation
 
01:59:15.310 --> 01:59:15.320 align:start position:0%
because the clerk is authorized to do
 
01:59:17.990 --> 01:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
that but the clerk cannot put that name
 
01:59:19.790 --> 01:59:19.800 align:start position:0%
on the checklist the clerk then has to
 
01:59:23.189 --> 01:59:23.199 align:start position:0%
take that application and give it to to
 
01:59:26.189 --> 01:59:26.199 align:start position:0%
the the uh Board of Supervisors of the
 
01:59:28.149 --> 01:59:28.159 align:start position:0%
checklist to then vote by majority vote
 
01:59:31.550 --> 01:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
to accept it one more go ahead so it's
 
01:59:35.030 --> 01:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
so it is a limited then event because it
 
01:59:37.310 --> 01:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be open to the public that's
 
01:59:39.990 --> 01:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's that seems to be the case yes
 
01:59:42.189 --> 01:59:42.199 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I'm going to confirm that but
 
01:59:43.709 --> 01:59:43.719 align:start position:0%
but you know if if the notice went out
 
01:59:46.189 --> 01:59:46.199 align:start position:0%
from my office I'm I'm sure
 
01:59:50.629 --> 01:59:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
you go ahead uh Woodcock did represent
 
01:59:56.229 --> 01:59:56.239 align:start position:0%
Woodcock do you I saw your hand up go
 
01:59:58.310 --> 01:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
first did
 
02:00:01.270 --> 02:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
you leus yeah you're welcome well I just
 
02:00:04.069 --> 02:00:04.079 align:start position:0%
wanted to follow that up given what we
 
02:00:07.109 --> 02:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
just talked about um would they still
 
02:00:09.709 --> 02:00:09.719 align:start position:0%
need to have a supervisor of the
 
02:00:12.109 --> 02:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
checklist from each Town represented by
 
02:00:12.119 --> 02:00:13.910 align:start position:0%
checklist from each Town represented by
the

02:00:13.910 --> 02:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:00:16.550 --> 02:00:16.560 align:start position:0%
school that would make the most sense if
 
02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
it's a multi- if it's a Regional School
 
02:00:21.069 --> 02:00:21.079 align:start position:0%
District yeah I mean if if if part of
 
02:00:22.830 --> 02:00:22.840 align:start position:0%
that process is to educate the voters
 
02:00:25.790 --> 02:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
and give them an opportunity then uh the
 
02:00:27.709 --> 02:00:27.719 align:start position:0%
event should have at least one
 
02:00:30.109 --> 02:00:30.119 align:start position:0%
supervisor from each of the towns in the
 
02:00:35.189 --> 02:00:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:37.390 --> 02:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
you representa Woodcock thank you
 
02:00:38.830 --> 02:00:38.840 align:start position:0%
chairman L good morning Mr secretary
 
02:00:40.669 --> 02:00:40.679 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here um something
 
02:00:43.109 --> 02:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
much easier can you have a a guess for
 
02:00:45.629 --> 02:00:45.639 align:start position:0%
us a ballpark guest how many 18 to 20
 
02:00:48.350 --> 02:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
year olds 21y olds in New Hampshire
 
02:00:52.069 --> 02:00:52.079 align:start position:0%
register uh I don't I don't have a guess
 
02:00:53.950 --> 02:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
top of my head although you know I did
 
02:00:56.350 --> 02:00:56.360 align:start position:0%
listen to the to the discussion that you
 
02:00:58.950 --> 02:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
had last time and rip I think you tossed
 
02:01:01.870 --> 02:01:01.880 align:start position:0%
a figure out uh when you were discussing
 
02:01:04.950 --> 02:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
that those figures are a little bit uh
 
02:01:07.750 --> 02:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
deceptive in that and it's in the way
 
02:01:09.709 --> 02:01:09.719 align:start position:0%
the other states report their data
 
02:01:12.390 --> 02:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
compared to New Hampshire so New
 
02:01:15.189 --> 02:01:15.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has election day registration
 
02:01:17.069 --> 02:01:17.079 align:start position:0%
and there is a a growing number of
 
02:01:19.310 --> 02:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
states now that you know they're going
 
02:01:22.790 --> 02:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
in that direction but in many states the
 
02:01:25.030 --> 02:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
registrations have to be have to take
 
02:01:28.589 --> 02:01:28.599 align:start position:0%
place you know as as early as 30 days
 
02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
before the election and so those states
 
02:01:34.990 --> 02:01:35.000 align:start position:0%
are able to report their uh registration
 
02:01:39.270 --> 02:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
numbers uh faster than new hampture sure
 
02:01:42.109 --> 02:01:42.119 align:start position:0%
when many of most of the registrants do
 
02:01:46.189 --> 02:01:46.199 align:start position:0%
it on the day of the election and so uh
 
02:01:48.109 --> 02:01:48.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire may not be as high as the
 
02:01:51.109 --> 02:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
national average but I think they were
 
02:01:52.390 --> 02:01:52.400 align:start position:0%
it would be higher
 
02:01:56.189 --> 02:01:56.199 align:start position:0%
once all those final numbers come in uh
 
02:02:00.589 --> 02:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
uh uh when you look at that but but the
 
02:02:03.830 --> 02:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
bottom line is it's the registrations of
 
02:02:08.790 --> 02:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
Youth are are relatively low and uh you
 
02:02:11.390 --> 02:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
know the trick is to get them if they do
 
02:02:13.189 --> 02:02:13.199 align:start position:0%
it once if they register to vote and
 
02:02:15.990 --> 02:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
they vote then they tend to continue to
 
02:02:18.510 --> 02:02:18.520 align:start position:0%
do it and and I think that's you know
 
02:02:20.669 --> 02:02:20.679 align:start position:0%
that's we wouldn't encourage them to do
 
02:02:24.149 --> 02:02:24.159 align:start position:0%
that so that so that participate and uh
 
02:02:25.750 --> 02:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
you know once they get involved in that
 
02:02:27.709 --> 02:02:27.719 align:start position:0%
process they tend to stick with it thank
 
02:02:29.390 --> 02:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr secretary thank you Mr chairman
 
02:02:31.990 --> 02:02:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you uh secretary scand and I have
 
02:02:33.790 --> 02:02:33.800 align:start position:0%
one question follow up to the example
 
02:02:36.390 --> 02:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
you gave us about uh the Regional High
 
02:02:38.790 --> 02:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
School with students from towns a c and
 
02:02:41.870 --> 02:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
d the question is is it discriminatory
 
02:02:44.430 --> 02:02:44.440 align:start position:0%
if Town C students are not afforded the
 
02:02:49.550 --> 02:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:52.350 --> 02:02:52.360 align:start position:0%
D well I I think it would be if
 
02:02:54.830 --> 02:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
you know if uh in the process of
 
02:02:57.990 --> 02:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
organizing this you know towns a b and d
 
02:03:02.310 --> 02:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
were invited and town C was not um but
 
02:03:05.950 --> 02:03:05.960 align:start position:0%
if they were all invited uh and uh you
 
02:03:07.589 --> 02:03:07.599 align:start position:0%
know one of them was for whatever reason
 
02:03:10.189 --> 02:03:10.199 align:start position:0%
unable to make it um and if they were
 
02:03:12.030 --> 02:03:12.040 align:start position:0%
willing to you know create an
 
02:03:14.189 --> 02:03:14.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity you know that that might
 
02:03:18.510 --> 02:03:18.520 align:start position:0%
work outside of that event then uh I
 
02:03:19.870 --> 02:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
think it depends on the situation
 
02:03:21.510 --> 02:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
whether it would be discriminatory or
 
02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:23.390 align:start position:0%
whether it would be discriminatory or
not

02:03:23.390 --> 02:03:23.400 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:03:25.189 --> 02:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
there are some communities that do not
 
02:03:28.950 --> 02:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
want to engage in in this activity in
 
02:03:34.270 --> 02:03:34.280 align:start position:0%
schools and so if Town C was one that
 
02:03:38.350 --> 02:03:38.360 align:start position:0%
did not want to engage and uh kids from
 
02:03:42.229 --> 02:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
a b and d were provided that opportunity
 
02:03:44.830 --> 02:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
what recourse would the kids from town C
 
02:03:46.750 --> 02:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
have saying hey I wasn't afforded this
 
02:03:48.350 --> 02:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity where other high school
 
02:03:50.350 --> 02:03:50.360 align:start position:0%
students in this school were afforded
 
02:03:52.950 --> 02:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
that opportunity I I would hope that in
 
02:03:55.430 --> 02:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
a situation like that that that the
 
02:03:58.629 --> 02:03:58.639 align:start position:0%
students from town C would be informed
 
02:04:02.310 --> 02:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
of how to register to vote and where
 
02:04:06.910 --> 02:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
they could go and do it um you know and
 
02:04:11.750 --> 02:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know you know they're 18 right
 
02:04:14.229 --> 02:04:14.239 align:start position:0%
they can they can vote uh they can
 
02:04:17.470 --> 02:04:17.480 align:start position:0%
register to vote uh when they're 17 as
 
02:04:20.950 --> 02:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
long as they will be 18 before the next
 
02:04:25.709 --> 02:04:25.719 align:start position:0%
election and so 18yar olds are adults um
 
02:04:30.589 --> 02:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
and uh you know they they assume some
 
02:04:34.390 --> 02:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility and and uh you know if
 
02:04:37.189 --> 02:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
that opportunity is not available for
 
02:04:40.189 --> 02:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
them uh on Election Day or when they
 
02:04:41.589 --> 02:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
have the event at the school then I
 
02:04:44.750 --> 02:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
suppose they could uh you know take the
 
02:04:47.149 --> 02:04:47.159 align:start position:0%
initiative to visit the clerk or a
 
02:04:49.270 --> 02:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
supervisor's meeting or just show up at
 
02:04:51.750 --> 02:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
the polls on the day of the election
 
02:04:55.549 --> 02:04:55.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:58.750 --> 02:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
committee rson Hall thank you Mr chair
 
02:04:59.950 --> 02:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
and thank you again for taking my
 
02:05:01.910 --> 02:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
question so I'm just curious let's see
 
02:05:02.830 --> 02:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
if the
 
02:05:06.030 --> 02:05:06.040 align:start position:0%
single um town clerk goes and does the
 
02:05:09.229 --> 02:05:09.239 align:start position:0%
voter registration Drive she gets the
 
02:05:11.069 --> 02:05:11.079 align:start position:0%
all the the pile of registrations now
 
02:05:13.950 --> 02:05:13.960 align:start position:0%
when she goes back to the the group they
 
02:05:16.549 --> 02:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
go one by one to accept it they don't
 
02:05:18.149 --> 02:05:18.159 align:start position:0%
just say Okay this whole pack was done
 
02:05:21.030 --> 02:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
the same way one by one they would go
 
02:05:22.189 --> 02:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
one by one
 
02:05:25.950 --> 02:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
and and vote on uh and and and then vote
 
02:05:28.069 --> 02:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
on the individuals that they're going to
 
02:05:31.790 --> 02:05:31.800 align:start position:0%
approve yes can I have one more please
 
02:05:33.910 --> 02:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
one more um you said before the next
 
02:05:36.030 --> 02:05:36.040 align:start position:0%
election does it matter what kind of
 
02:05:37.790 --> 02:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
election it is whether it's a primary or
 
02:05:40.589 --> 02:05:40.599 align:start position:0%
presidential or a local no it's before
 
02:05:42.990 --> 02:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
the next election yeah yeah because in
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire you have to be 18 years
 
02:05:49.669 --> 02:05:49.679 align:start position:0%
old to vote so um if you have a town
 
02:05:52.750 --> 02:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
election uh before a prime
 
02:05:55.990 --> 02:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
primary uh and and the student won't
 
02:05:59.430 --> 02:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
turn 18 until after the town election
 
02:06:01.750 --> 02:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
then the student could not register to
 
02:06:05.669 --> 02:06:05.679 align:start position:0%
vote uh before the town election thank
 
02:06:08.430 --> 02:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you very represent Cornell
 
02:06:10.510 --> 02:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you secretary for
 
02:06:13.229 --> 02:06:13.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question would it be safe to
 
02:06:16.390 --> 02:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
assume that town clerks or are people
 
02:06:19.069 --> 02:06:19.079 align:start position:0%
who do this in cities and towns know the
 
02:06:21.629 --> 02:06:21.639 align:start position:0%
rules for how to do it and what's requ
 
02:06:23.709 --> 02:06:23.719 align:start position:0%
fired or and if they had questions they
 
02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
would check with your office before they
 
02:06:28.950 --> 02:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
went into a school and registered kids
 
02:06:30.870 --> 02:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
in a class and and didn't give out
 
02:06:34.109 --> 02:06:34.119 align:start position:0%
public notice yes there are many
 
02:06:36.790 --> 02:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
long-term clerks and long-term
 
02:06:40.189 --> 02:06:40.199 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist uh who know
 
02:06:42.549 --> 02:06:42.559 align:start position:0%
how this process works and the newer
 
02:06:45.149 --> 02:06:45.159 align:start position:0%
ones uh and we are seeing a lot of
 
02:06:47.669 --> 02:06:47.679 align:start position:0%
turnover in those positions now through
 
02:06:50.629 --> 02:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
elections uh uh they don't hesitate to
 
02:06:54.310 --> 02:06:54.320 align:start position:0%
call uh if they have questions and you
 
02:06:56.229 --> 02:06:56.239 align:start position:0%
know one of the initiatives that I would
 
02:06:58.589 --> 02:06:58.599 align:start position:0%
like to see is not is I mean it's
 
02:07:00.069 --> 02:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
important to get them to register to
 
02:07:01.990 --> 02:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
vote but we would like to take it to
 
02:07:04.709 --> 02:07:04.719 align:start position:0%
another level and and get them to
 
02:07:08.149 --> 02:07:08.159 align:start position:0%
volunteer in polling places um and you
 
02:07:09.149 --> 02:07:09.159 align:start position:0%
know get
 
02:07:11.870 --> 02:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
some uh younger people that you know
 
02:07:14.189 --> 02:07:14.199 align:start position:0%
want to participate as supervisors of
 
02:07:15.910 --> 02:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
the checklist
 
02:07:19.589 --> 02:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
because uh some of those individuals
 
02:07:21.950 --> 02:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
have been doing that job for 30 40 even
 
02:07:24.589 --> 02:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
50 years and you know we have to find
 
02:07:26.549 --> 02:07:26.559 align:start position:0%
replacements for
 
02:07:30.030 --> 02:07:30.040 align:start position:0%
them oh we're all getting a little wider
 
02:07:33.910 --> 02:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
here not everybody represent demon it's
 
02:07:36.589 --> 02:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
getting grayer thank you thank you for
 
02:07:38.510 --> 02:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question I was wondering if
 
02:07:40.069 --> 02:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
you could just update us on what the
 
02:07:41.990 --> 02:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
training for supervisors of the
 
02:07:44.189 --> 02:07:44.199 align:start position:0%
checklist is and
 
02:07:47.149 --> 02:07:47.159 align:start position:0%
also am I correct that in order to be a
 
02:07:49.870 --> 02:07:49.880 align:start position:0%
supervisor you have to be
 
02:07:52.270 --> 02:07:52.280 align:start position:0%

those requirements and then
 
02:08:18.950 --> 02:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
um the in terms of the training prior to
 
02:08:21.589 --> 02:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
every election cycle uh whether it's
 
02:08:24.149 --> 02:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
presidential primary or whether it's the
 
02:08:27.990 --> 02:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
fall elections every two years we have
 
02:08:31.109 --> 02:08:31.119 align:start position:0%
um uh been ex expanding the training
 
02:08:34.470 --> 02:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
opportunities but we start with about a
 
02:08:36.910 --> 02:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
dozen uh two and a half to three hour
 
02:08:39.069 --> 02:08:39.079 align:start position:0%
training sessions that we take around
 
02:08:42.470 --> 02:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
the state so we visit each County uh you
 
02:08:44.149 --> 02:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
know go all the way up to C Brook
 
02:08:46.669 --> 02:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes and you know over to Keen down
 
02:08:49.229 --> 02:08:49.239 align:start position:0%
on the Sea Coast and everywhere in
 
02:08:51.510 --> 02:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
between and and we create opportun
 
02:08:55.549 --> 02:08:55.559 align:start position:0%
unities for uh uh moderators clerks and
 
02:08:57.669 --> 02:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist to come in
 
02:09:01.189 --> 02:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
so that uh they can learn the process
 
02:09:03.750 --> 02:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
number one but two we make them aware of
 
02:09:05.990 --> 02:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
all the Law changes that take place
 
02:09:08.270 --> 02:09:08.280 align:start position:0%
every every
 
02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
year and then in addition to that we
 
02:09:14.510 --> 02:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
have been uh recording training sessions
 
02:09:17.430 --> 02:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
and putting them up on YouTube and then
 
02:09:20.189 --> 02:09:20.199 align:start position:0%
we have been doing uh training videos
 
02:09:21.910 --> 02:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
that are specific to the individual
 
02:09:24.189 --> 02:09:24.199 align:start position:0%
roles in the polling place whether it's
 
02:09:26.390 --> 02:09:26.400 align:start position:0%

and as convenient to everybody that
 
02:09:39.589 --> 02:09:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:43.109 --> 02:09:43.119 align:start position:0%

02:09:56.430 --> 02:09:56.440 align:start position:0%
you the legislature try to change that
 
02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:57.599 align:start position:0%
though so he won't know what everything
 
02:10:01.830 --> 02:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
you did um uh secretary have you have
 
02:10:04.709 --> 02:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
you talked with ID ltin who has got the
 
02:10:06.990 --> 02:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
commission right now in in looking at
 
02:10:09.310 --> 02:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
Civics education within our schools
 
02:10:13.350 --> 02:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
textbook Etc um and you spoke at the
 
02:10:15.270 --> 02:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
very beginning of your presentation or
 
02:10:16.830 --> 02:10:16.840 align:start position:0%
working with us today that you were
 
02:10:18.870 --> 02:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
looking down the road at a program which
 
02:10:20.470 --> 02:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
could be used from an educational
 
02:10:22.470 --> 02:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
perspective in the school tools are you
 
02:10:25.109 --> 02:10:25.119 align:start position:0%
you know linking it up with oit who is
 
02:10:27.669 --> 02:10:27.679 align:start position:0%
also right now they're right in the
 
02:10:31.310 --> 02:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
process of letting a contract out and uh
 
02:10:33.549 --> 02:10:33.559 align:start position:0%
moving forward with a design program I
 
02:10:35.390 --> 02:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
was curious to know if you are aware of
 
02:10:38.910 --> 02:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
that I have not spoken with ID uh on on
 
02:10:42.430 --> 02:10:42.440 align:start position:0%
that topic um but I think whatever they
 
02:10:45.310 --> 02:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
decide to do will be compatible with uh
 
02:10:48.390 --> 02:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
you know with our initiative it's um
 
02:10:51.310 --> 02:10:51.320 align:start position:0%
we've been doing a really good job uh
 
02:10:53.270 --> 02:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
conducting the elections and and
 
02:10:55.870 --> 02:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
training the pole workers and uh and
 
02:10:58.549 --> 02:10:58.559 align:start position:0%
communicating them uh the one area that
 
02:11:01.350 --> 02:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
we need to spend more time on is
 
02:11:04.229 --> 02:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
communicating to the voters themselves
 
02:11:08.069 --> 02:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
and and so um you know I'm anxious to
 
02:11:10.830 --> 02:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
see what the Civics commission comes up
 
02:11:14.950 --> 02:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
with uh but whatever it is it will be
 
02:11:18.709 --> 02:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
our initiative will be uh an enhancement
 
02:11:21.669 --> 02:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
okay to that thank you yes
 
02:11:24.270 --> 02:11:24.280 align:start position:0%
representative sing thank you um very
 
02:11:26.870 --> 02:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
quickly so first um just to follow up on
 
02:11:28.629 --> 02:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
uh representative Damon's question I
 
02:11:29.950 --> 02:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
believe you have to also be registered
 
02:11:31.910 --> 02:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
to vote in the district where you're a
 
02:11:34.910 --> 02:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
supervisor and then my other question is
 
02:11:36.390 --> 02:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
um are you aware of an organization
 
02:11:38.549 --> 02:11:38.559 align:start position:0%
called my school votes which creates
 
02:11:41.069 --> 02:11:41.079 align:start position:0%
voting clubs in schools um not in New
 
02:11:42.149 --> 02:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because kids can't
 
02:11:44.510 --> 02:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
pre-register here but in other places a
 
02:11:47.310 --> 02:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan effort to get students to
 
02:11:49.270 --> 02:11:49.280 align:start position:0%
learn about the voting process in order
 
02:11:51.229 --> 02:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
to encourage their peers to vote and to
 
02:11:54.030 --> 02:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
support that yeah I'm I'm not aware of
 
02:11:57.149 --> 02:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
that organization um uh number one
 
02:12:00.229 --> 02:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
number two is uh you have to be a
 
02:12:04.390 --> 02:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
registered voter uh to work as an
 
02:12:07.189 --> 02:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
official in the polls except that the
 
02:12:10.350 --> 02:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
law does allow for 17year olds to uh
 
02:12:13.149 --> 02:12:13.159 align:start position:0%
work in a polling place and you know we
 
02:12:15.470 --> 02:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
really want to encourage you know that
 
02:12:17.709 --> 02:12:17.719 align:start position:0%
type of participation thank you for the
 
02:12:18.990 --> 02:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
clarification actually my student got
 
02:12:22.270 --> 02:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
her NHS hours that way
 
02:12:24.270 --> 02:12:24.280 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli thank you thank you
 
02:12:26.990 --> 02:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
for being here secretary um I just want
 
02:12:29.390 --> 02:12:29.400 align:start position:0%
to mention RSA
 
02:12:32.149 --> 02:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
18923 which relates to uh the State
 
02:12:34.629 --> 02:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
Board of Education Distributing copies
 
02:12:38.750 --> 02:12:38.760 align:start position:0%
of the Constitution and election laws to
 
02:12:42.390 --> 02:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
teachers in high schools um this dates
 
02:12:45.750 --> 02:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
back to the 30s um it had been lost
 
02:12:48.709 --> 02:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
somewhere along the line I've contacted
 
02:12:51.470 --> 02:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
uh the State Board chair and the uh Comm
 
02:12:54.069 --> 02:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
and they are going to start to do that
 
02:12:56.950 --> 02:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted you to be aware of you
 
02:12:58.910 --> 02:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
know they were going to be sending out
 
02:13:02.069 --> 02:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
information on Election laws so you know
 
02:13:04.390 --> 02:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
maybe some coordination there might be
 
02:13:07.189 --> 02:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
helpful as well y that would be good we
 
02:13:10.430 --> 02:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
do uh every year publish constitutions
 
02:13:13.229 --> 02:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
for the fourth graders I think uh in in
 
02:13:15.149 --> 02:13:15.159 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and and there
 
02:13:17.470 --> 02:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
otherwise they're generally available
 
02:13:18.870 --> 02:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
and I know the finance committee has
 
02:13:20.629 --> 02:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
been looking at a bill that would
 
02:13:23.310 --> 02:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
require us to publish a lot more copies
 
02:13:25.189 --> 02:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
of the Constitution so that they could
 
02:13:29.790 --> 02:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:32.589 --> 02:13:32.599 align:start position:0%
distributed I have one more things
 
02:13:35.430 --> 02:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
twirling around up here uh we have a
 
02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
requirement to any student that comes K
 
02:13:41.149 --> 02:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
through 12 we must enroll whether
 
02:13:43.470 --> 02:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
they're a citizen of the country or
 
02:13:46.310 --> 02:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
not um we have a number of students
 
02:13:48.510 --> 02:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
we've had in past years the Val
 
02:13:50.709 --> 02:13:50.719 align:start position:0%
Victorian coming forward and testifying
 
02:13:54.189 --> 02:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
in here who may not be a citizen of our
 
02:13:56.589 --> 02:13:56.599 align:start position:0%
of our our state and denied instate
 
02:13:59.549 --> 02:13:59.559 align:start position:0%
tuition at UNH because of that what are
 
02:14:00.950 --> 02:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
we going to deal with those students
 
02:14:02.149 --> 02:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
which we're going to have more and more
 
02:14:03.910 --> 02:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
that come in that are not legal
 
02:14:05.870 --> 02:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
residents of our country is that going
 
02:14:07.430 --> 02:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
to be a problem if we start doing this
 
02:14:08.709 --> 02:14:08.719 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:14:12.069 --> 02:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
schools well one of the requirements for
 
02:14:14.310 --> 02:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
registration is that you show
 
02:14:16.669 --> 02:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
documentation of
 
02:14:19.549 --> 02:14:19.559 align:start position:0%
citizenship and you know right now the
 
02:14:23.069 --> 02:14:23.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:26.229 --> 02:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
allows for that requirement to be
 
02:14:29.910 --> 02:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
established by signing a qualified voter
 
02:14:33.629 --> 02:14:33.639 align:start position:0%
affidavit and as long as the supervisor
 
02:14:35.430 --> 02:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
of the checklist has no reason to
 
02:14:38.030 --> 02:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
believe that that information is not
 
02:14:41.069 --> 02:14:41.079 align:start position:0%
true uh then it would be
 
02:14:44.350 --> 02:14:44.360 align:start position:0%
accepted um if there is information that
 
02:14:48.830 --> 02:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
is provided that uh to the contrary then
 
02:14:50.470 --> 02:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
the supervisors when they're making that
 
02:14:52.350 --> 02:14:52.360 align:start position:0%
decision have to make a determination is
 
02:14:54.149 --> 02:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
it more likely than not that this person
 
02:14:57.149 --> 02:14:57.159 align:start position:0%
is United States citizen and using that
 
02:15:00.189 --> 02:15:00.199 align:start position:0%
standard would decide whether to approve
 
02:15:03.830 --> 02:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
the name or not it is a crime for
 
02:15:07.470 --> 02:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
somebody to uh register to vote who is
 
02:15:09.870 --> 02:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
not properly qualified and so if there's
 
02:15:13.589 --> 02:15:13.599 align:start position:0%
somebody that lies on their uh on their
 
02:15:15.470 --> 02:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
voter registration form that says that
 
02:15:18.229 --> 02:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
they are United States citizen when they
 
02:15:21.589 --> 02:15:21.599 align:start position:0%
are not that that's is punishable thank
 
02:15:23.709 --> 02:15:23.719 align:start position:0%
you any further questions from the
 
02:15:25.189 --> 02:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
committee well we want to thank you very

02:46:42.910 --> 02:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to go ahead and try to
 
02:46:45.429 --> 02:46:45.439 align:start position:0%
knock off several bills here before
 
02:46:47.630 --> 02:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
lunch so the first bill which we're
 
02:46:49.389 --> 02:46:49.399 align:start position:0%
going to be taking up is
 
02:46:52.790 --> 02:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
1093 this is prohibiting mandatory Mass
 
02:46:52.800 --> 02:46:55.070 align:start position:0%
1093 this is prohibiting mandatory Mass
policies

02:46:55.070 --> 02:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
policies
 
02:46:55.080 --> 02:46:58.190 align:start position:0%
policies
um

02:46:58.190 --> 02:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:01.269 --> 02:47:01.279 align:start position:0%
and uh I'll open up with some discussion
 
02:47:01.279 --> 02:47:03.790 align:start position:0%
and uh I'll open up with some discussion
first

02:47:03.790 --> 02:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:06.790 --> 02:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
here uh Miss Ryan did you have something
 
02:47:08.710 --> 02:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
you wanted to communicate to us on this
 
02:47:08.720 --> 02:47:17.830 align:start position:0%
you wanted to communicate to us on this
particular

02:47:17.830 --> 02:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:17.840 --> 02:47:20.630 align:start position:0%
 
bill

02:47:20.630 --> 02:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:47:23.830 --> 02:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
so okay thank you Mr chair um my name is
 
02:47:26.870 --> 02:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
Mora Ryan and um I'm a member of the
 
02:47:29.070 --> 02:47:29.080 align:start position:0%
state advisory committee for Education
 
02:47:31.790 --> 02:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not here on behalf of them I'm here
 
02:47:35.349 --> 02:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
on behalf of myself um but I did speak
 
02:47:37.070 --> 02:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
with the chair who was not able to come
 
02:47:38.349 --> 02:47:38.359 align:start position:0%
here today and what she wanted me to
 
02:47:39.710 --> 02:47:39.720 align:start position:0%
communicate to you and she wrote a
 
02:47:42.230 --> 02:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
letter to this effect um when the state
 
02:47:44.790 --> 02:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
advisory committee wrote um our
 
02:47:47.269 --> 02:47:47.279 align:start position:0%
recommendation regarding this particular
 
02:47:49.550 --> 02:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
bill um
 
02:47:52.230 --> 02:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
we used the phraseology that um we
 
02:47:55.309 --> 02:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
opposed it as written because we thought
 
02:47:56.790 --> 02:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
there should be an exception for
 
02:47:58.790 --> 02:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
students who needed to wear a mask if it
 
02:48:01.389 --> 02:48:01.399 align:start position:0%
was necessary and if it was in their IEP
 
02:48:04.910 --> 02:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
um examples I I would 100% say that
 
02:48:07.550 --> 02:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
that's something that's probably rare um
 
02:48:09.790 --> 02:48:09.800 align:start position:0%
but examples would be if a student had a
 
02:48:12.190 --> 02:48:12.200 align:start position:0%
transplant or if they had cystic
 
02:48:13.670 --> 02:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
fibrosis or something like that where
 
02:48:15.710 --> 02:48:15.720 align:start position:0%
they would need to wear a mask because
 
02:48:17.710 --> 02:48:17.720 align:start position:0%
they'd be in an immuno compromised
 
02:48:20.269 --> 02:48:20.279 align:start position:0%
position so in that case they would need
 
02:48:21.630 --> 02:48:21.640 align:start position:0%
to wear a mask and it would be something
 
02:48:24.110 --> 02:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
that would be a medical reason and we
 
02:48:25.469 --> 02:48:25.479 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure that if there
 
02:48:27.269 --> 02:48:27.279 align:start position:0%
were an exception like that that that
 
02:48:29.990 --> 02:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
could be addressed obviously on the flip
 
02:48:33.670 --> 02:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
side um with covid and masking um kids
 
02:48:35.349 --> 02:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
with disabilities were not able to get
 
02:48:37.870 --> 02:48:37.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate speech services and that is
 
02:48:41.910 --> 02:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
a reason why it you know it's sort of
 
02:48:44.630 --> 02:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
hard to have an you know absolute
 
02:48:46.590 --> 02:48:46.600 align:start position:0%
because there should be some
 
02:48:48.830 --> 02:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
exceptions thank you very much are there
 
02:48:49.990 --> 02:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee yes
 
02:48:52.790 --> 02:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell so thank you for
 
02:48:54.150 --> 02:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question so if it's in the
 
02:48:56.429 --> 02:48:56.439 align:start position:0%
students IEP that that student with the
 
02:48:58.750 --> 02:48:58.760 align:start position:0%
medical condition should only be around
 
02:49:00.990 --> 02:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
other students who are also masks for
 
02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:01.750 align:start position:0%
other students who are also masks for
his

02:49:01.750 --> 02:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
his
 
02:49:05.269 --> 02:49:05.279 align:start position:0%
health what do you think about that so
 
02:49:06.790 --> 02:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
you're asking me just I'm just going to
 
02:49:08.389 --> 02:49:08.399 align:start position:0%
reiterate your question to make sure I
 
02:49:10.349 --> 02:49:10.359 align:start position:0%
understand it if a student needs to be
 
02:49:12.030 --> 02:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
in an environment where other people are
 
02:49:15.389 --> 02:49:15.399 align:start position:0%
masked you're asking me what I'm I'm not
 
02:49:16.710 --> 02:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
certain if you're asking me a medical
 
02:49:18.910 --> 02:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
opinion so I just wanted to clarify that
 
02:49:20.910 --> 02:49:20.920 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying if if it happens to end
 
02:49:23.510 --> 02:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
up in the students IEP that their their
 
02:49:26.429 --> 02:49:26.439 align:start position:0%
health is fragile and that other
 
02:49:29.510 --> 02:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
students should be masked to be in
 
02:49:32.550 --> 02:49:32.560 align:start position:0%
contact with that student you know what
 
02:49:34.710 --> 02:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
would happen then if there's a mask
 
02:49:39.550 --> 02:49:39.560 align:start position:0%
Prohibition in the in the school okay
 
02:49:42.349 --> 02:49:42.359 align:start position:0%
um again I would say that that's usually
 
02:49:43.990 --> 02:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
a pretty rare circumstance and it would
 
02:49:45.670 --> 02:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
usually be only in the you know a
 
02:49:47.190 --> 02:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
situation where a transplant is taking
 
02:49:48.710 --> 02:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
place and it's usually going to be a
 
02:49:50.910 --> 02:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
transitory situation but I think it
 
02:49:52.110 --> 02:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
would be something that the school would
 
02:49:55.030 --> 02:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
be able to work out if it was in the IEP
 
02:49:56.389 --> 02:49:56.399 align:start position:0%
you know I think that's something where
 
02:49:58.309 --> 02:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
we we can have common sense and work
 
02:49:59.910 --> 02:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
02:50:01.990 --> 02:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
out further
 
02:50:04.349 --> 02:50:04.359 align:start position:0%
questions not seeing any thank thank you
 
02:50:07.269 --> 02:50:07.279 align:start position:0%
very much thank you I appreciate it so
 
02:50:10.349 --> 02:50:10.359 align:start position:0%
with that we're on 1093 and I'm going to
 
02:50:13.950 --> 02:50:13.960 align:start position:0%
look to uh rep representative Noble for
 
02:50:15.269 --> 02:50:15.279 align:start position:0%
a motion
 
02:50:19.389 --> 02:50:19.399 align:start position:0%
please I move out to pass on hb19 three
 
02:50:22.630 --> 02:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
is there a second I second the motion
 
02:50:25.870 --> 02:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
okay we have a uh a second made by
 
02:50:27.830 --> 02:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
represent Cordell and and a motion made
 
02:50:29.590 --> 02:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
by representative Noble representative
 
02:50:31.550 --> 02:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
Noble would you like to speak to your
 
02:50:34.590 --> 02:50:34.600 align:start position:0%
motion yes thank you Mr chair
 
02:50:38.429 --> 02:50:38.439 align:start position:0%
um I would like to take this time to uh
 
02:50:48.710 --> 02:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:51.389 --> 02:50:51.399 align:start position:0%
we have a motion on the floor to move
 
02:50:51.399 --> 02:50:52.349 align:start position:0%
we have a motion on the floor to move
forward

02:50:52.349 --> 02:50:52.359 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:50:56.670 --> 02:50:56.680 align:start position:0%
0911 H made by representative Noble is
 
02:50:59.510 --> 02:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
there a second second represent cordelli
 
02:51:01.150 --> 02:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
makes the second represent Noble would
 
02:51:04.070 --> 02:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
you speak to your uh amending
 
02:51:06.630 --> 02:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
motion um thank you
 
02:51:11.630 --> 02:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
um so um the first change um is moving
 
02:51:15.429 --> 02:51:15.439 align:start position:0%
it out of the studies section which was
 
02:51:17.950 --> 02:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
uh probably not an appropriate section
 
02:51:21.269 --> 02:51:21.279 align:start position:0%
and into a new um section the other
 
02:51:24.790 --> 02:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
change is to
 
02:51:24.800 --> 02:51:26.590 align:start position:0%
change is to
um

02:51:26.590 --> 02:51:26.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:30.150 --> 02:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
um for it was for the sack what they had
 
02:51:34.590 --> 02:51:34.600 align:start position:0%
um given feedback for which was um you
 
02:51:37.190 --> 02:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
know creating an exception for children
 
02:51:40.550 --> 02:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
with IEPs and
 
02:51:43.910 --> 02:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
504s so that they would still be able to
 
02:51:46.070 --> 02:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
uh require masks if that if that was in
 
02:51:46.080 --> 02:51:46.910 align:start position:0%
uh require masks if that if that was in
their

02:51:46.910 --> 02:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:51:49.550 --> 02:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
plan thank you ref Cordell you care to
 
02:51:52.550 --> 02:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
speak as a second nothing thank you is
 
02:51:55.389 --> 02:51:55.399 align:start position:0%
there any further discussion on the
 
02:51:59.429 --> 02:51:59.439 align:start position:0%
amendment which we're talking 0911
 
02:51:59.439 --> 02:52:17.510 align:start position:0%
amendment which we're talking 0911
H

02:52:17.510 --> 02:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:17.520 --> 02:52:47.429 align:start position:0%

OTP forther discussion yeah Mr chair I
 
02:54:11.670 --> 02:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
can start with speaking to that motion
 
02:54:13.830 --> 02:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to say that the
 
02:54:16.389 --> 02:54:16.399 align:start position:0%
governor's mask mandate Exempted K
 
02:54:19.790 --> 02:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
through 12 students teachers and staff
 
02:54:22.429 --> 02:54:22.439 align:start position:0%
um school boards created their own
 
02:54:24.110 --> 02:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
mandates for
 
02:54:28.910 --> 02:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
masking and parents um in a lot of cases
 
02:54:31.550 --> 02:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
were not able to get exemptions for
 
02:54:34.510 --> 02:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
their kids who suffered from asthma or
 
02:54:37.750 --> 02:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
Autism anxiety developmental
 
02:54:41.670 --> 02:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
issues um however if we were under the
 
02:54:44.389 --> 02:54:44.399 align:start position:0%
governor's mask mandate for the schools
 
02:54:47.590 --> 02:54:47.600 align:start position:0%
that would not have been an issue at all
 
02:54:47.600 --> 02:54:49.469 align:start position:0%
that would not have been an issue at all
um

02:54:49.469 --> 02:54:49.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:52.030 --> 02:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
I if you've read the The Mask mandate
 
02:54:53.070 --> 02:54:53.080 align:start position:0%
from the
 
02:54:53.080 --> 02:54:55.670 align:start position:0%
from the
governor

02:54:55.670 --> 02:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
governor
 
02:54:59.349 --> 02:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
um um number six under that a person who
 
02:55:01.910 --> 02:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
declines to wear a mask or cloth face
 
02:55:03.550 --> 02:55:03.560 align:start position:0%
covering because of a medical or
 
02:55:05.550 --> 02:55:05.560 align:start position:0%
developmental issue or difficulty
 
02:55:07.830 --> 02:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
breathing shall not be required to
 
02:55:10.830 --> 02:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
produce documentation or other evidence
 
02:55:13.150 --> 02:55:13.160 align:start position:0%
um verifying the condition so the kids
 
02:55:15.309 --> 02:55:15.319 align:start position:0%
would have been covered under
 
02:55:19.229 --> 02:55:19.239 align:start position:0%
that in late February of 22
 
02:55:21.710 --> 02:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
um the governor had a press conference
 
02:55:25.790 --> 02:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
and um said that schools are now
 
02:55:28.950 --> 02:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
required to end their mask
 
02:55:32.429 --> 02:55:32.439 align:start position:0%
mandates um and and he was asked several
 
02:55:36.030 --> 02:55:36.040 align:start position:0%
times during that that press conference
 
02:55:38.030 --> 02:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
uh for some clarity on whether school
 
02:55:40.190 --> 02:55:40.200 align:start position:0%
districts can decide on their own to end
 
02:55:43.349 --> 02:55:43.359 align:start position:0%
the mask mandates and he said no schools
 
02:55:45.670 --> 02:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
really need to transition their policy
 
02:55:49.190 --> 02:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
away from the mask mandates
 
02:55:54.550 --> 02:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
and they they actually um cited um that
 
02:55:57.590 --> 02:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
the districts would be viol in violation
 
02:56:02.870 --> 02:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
of Ed 306 rules um having to do with
 
02:56:04.750 --> 02:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
meeting the instructional needs of each
 
02:56:07.429 --> 02:56:07.439 align:start position:0%
individual student and and promoting a
 
02:56:09.389 --> 02:56:09.399 align:start position:0%
school environment that was conducive to
 
02:56:11.349 --> 02:56:11.359 align:start position:0%
learning now I remember at the time for
 
02:56:13.950 --> 02:56:13.960 align:start position:0%
myself that I thought that was kind of
 
02:56:16.269 --> 02:56:16.279 align:start position:0%
odd because we didn't do that for the
 
02:56:19.910 --> 02:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
previous two years
 
02:56:23.670 --> 02:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
um there there was objection to to that
 
02:56:26.309 --> 02:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire school boards
 
02:56:26.319 --> 02:56:28.309 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire school boards
Association

02:56:28.309 --> 02:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
Association
 
02:56:31.349 --> 02:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
um I have a quote from uh baric
 
02:56:36.389 --> 02:56:36.399 align:start position:0%
Christina um in a article from nhpr and
 
02:56:39.349 --> 02:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
and this was this was in regards to in
 
02:56:42.630 --> 02:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
the violation of the Ed 306 rules and he
 
02:56:44.269 --> 02:56:44.279 align:start position:0%
said we were caught off guard by the
 
02:56:46.990 --> 02:56:47.000 align:start position:0%
announcement yesterday for the last two
 
02:56:48.389 --> 02:56:48.399 align:start position:0%
years the governor and the the
 
02:56:50.349 --> 02:56:50.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner have repeatedly stated that
 
02:56:53.030 --> 02:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
the decision of whether or not a school
 
02:56:55.590 --> 02:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
district would require masks within
 
02:56:58.510 --> 02:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
their facility has always been up to the
 
02:56:59.830 --> 02:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
local school
 
02:57:02.150 --> 02:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
boards the authority to put mask
 
02:57:04.070 --> 02:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
mandates in place lies with the school
 
02:57:06.269 --> 02:57:06.279 align:start position:0%
boards not the state he
 
02:57:08.630 --> 02:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
said and the authority does not
 
02:57:13.150 --> 02:57:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:17.870 --> 02:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
change so I just um you know the New
 
02:57:19.510 --> 02:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school boards Association is
 
02:57:23.469 --> 02:57:23.479 align:start position:0%
is opposed to this bill and I
 
02:57:28.030 --> 02:57:28.040 align:start position:0%
I I am I don't really understand why
 
02:57:31.510 --> 02:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
because um the school boards also you
 
02:57:34.429 --> 02:57:34.439 align:start position:0%
know the kids went through a terrible
 
02:57:37.309 --> 02:57:37.319 align:start position:0%
time um it also was not easy for for
 
02:57:40.590 --> 02:57:40.600 align:start position:0%
school boards um so this bill kind of
 
02:57:44.229 --> 02:57:44.239 align:start position:0%
takes that um off their plate If This
 
02:57:48.190 --> 02:57:48.200 align:start position:0%
Were Ever to be an issue again and if
 
02:57:51.630 --> 02:57:51.640 align:start position:0%
puts it back on the state um if there is
 
02:57:53.710 --> 02:57:53.720 align:start position:0%
some kind of Public Health crisis then
 
02:57:55.349 --> 02:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
that mandate is going to have to come
 
02:57:58.229 --> 02:57:58.239 align:start position:0%
from the state it should not come from
 
02:58:00.229 --> 02:58:00.239 align:start position:0%
our local school
 
02:58:03.550 --> 02:58:03.560 align:start position:0%
districts so at that time um after that
 
02:58:06.950 --> 02:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
press conference and the
 
02:58:11.750 --> 02:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
um um my school district sent out an
 
02:58:14.830 --> 02:58:14.840 align:start position:0%
email saying that we're not allowed to
 
02:58:18.389 --> 02:58:18.399 align:start position:0%
require masks anymore and um that was
 
02:58:21.070 --> 02:58:21.080 align:start position:0%
the end of it there was no having a
 
02:58:23.830 --> 02:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
special meeting or voting to change
 
02:58:26.710 --> 02:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
their policy it ended right
 
02:58:30.070 --> 02:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
there but that was not the case in every
 
02:58:34.190 --> 02:58:34.200 align:start position:0%
District so in another article
 
02:58:38.590 --> 02:58:38.600 align:start position:0%
um from um musoma Valley Regional School
 
02:58:40.870 --> 02:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
District is discussing ways to come into
 
02:58:42.550 --> 02:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
compliance with the state and so this
 
02:58:45.429 --> 02:58:45.439 align:start position:0%
was an NBC 5 article and the
 
02:58:47.389 --> 02:58:47.399 align:start position:0%
superintendent at the time said our
 
02:58:47.399 --> 02:58:48.710 align:start position:0%
superintendent at the time said our
board

02:58:48.710 --> 02:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:58:51.110 --> 02:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
is potentially going to need to look at
 
02:58:54.750 --> 02:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
their mandate for masking again and
 
02:58:56.830 --> 02:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
probably look at an emergency meeting
 
02:58:59.510 --> 02:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
coming up within the next few days so we
 
02:59:01.830 --> 02:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
can discuss it
 
02:59:04.469 --> 02:59:04.479 align:start position:0%
again and she goes on to say as
 
02:59:07.429 --> 02:59:07.439 align:start position:0%
administrators and teachers we're tired
 
02:59:09.630 --> 02:59:09.640 align:start position:0%
of asking kids to continue pulling up
 
02:59:13.830 --> 02:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
their masks and to explain to them
 
02:59:16.870 --> 02:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
why it's just kind of a mask fatigue if
 
02:59:19.750 --> 02:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
you will on the part part of the wearers
 
02:59:24.229 --> 02:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:27.269 --> 02:59:27.279 align:start position:0%
wearing um there in the hearing it was
 
02:59:30.269 --> 02:59:30.279 align:start position:0%
brought up about um there were some mask
 
02:59:35.469 --> 02:59:35.479 align:start position:0%
lawsuits across the state and I um
 
02:59:37.950 --> 02:59:37.960 align:start position:0%
understand that some may think that
 
02:59:39.469 --> 02:59:39.479 align:start position:0%
those were
 
02:59:42.630 --> 02:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
frivolous um because they were citing um
 
02:59:44.590 --> 02:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
child restraint
 
02:59:47.150 --> 02:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
statutes you you have to understand that
 
02:59:49.710 --> 02:59:49.720 align:start position:0%
parents were desperate and looking for
 
02:59:51.910 --> 02:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
anything that they could grab on to to
 
02:59:55.269 --> 02:59:55.279 align:start position:0%
make this stop because their children
 
02:59:59.990 --> 03:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:03.269 --> 03:00:03.279 align:start position:0%
harmed this bill is not
 
03:00:05.429 --> 03:00:05.439 align:start position:0%
misguided it's taking the school boards
 
03:00:07.990 --> 03:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
off the hook because they're not
 
03:00:09.990 --> 03:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
qualified to be making these types of
 
03:00:12.150 --> 03:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
decisions and that was admitted in the
 
03:00:15.910 --> 03:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:18.550 --> 03:00:18.560 align:start position:0%
that if the state wants a man dat like I
 
03:00:21.070 --> 03:00:21.080 align:start position:0%
said it's up to the
 
03:00:23.950 --> 03:00:23.960 align:start position:0%
state this bill is about learning from
 
03:00:27.309 --> 03:00:27.319 align:start position:0%
mistakes of the past and prevention for
 
03:00:27.319 --> 03:00:29.190 align:start position:0%
mistakes of the past and prevention for
the

03:00:29.190 --> 03:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:00:32.110 --> 03:00:32.120 align:start position:0%
future there certainly wasn't intent to
 
03:00:35.349 --> 03:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
cause harm but the mass mandates did
 
03:00:38.389 --> 03:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
cause a lot of harm and parents tried to
 
03:00:42.830 --> 03:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
sound the alarm Bell and nobody would
 
03:00:46.070 --> 03:00:46.080 align:start position:0%
listen so for as long as I'm sitting
 
03:00:49.630 --> 03:00:49.640 align:start position:0%
here as a parent who through that I am
 
03:00:51.670 --> 03:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
going to do everything that I can to
 
03:00:53.790 --> 03:00:53.800 align:start position:0%
make sure that this never happens again
 
03:00:56.429 --> 03:00:56.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you very much
 
03:00:56.439 --> 03:00:58.070 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you very much
representative

03:00:58.070 --> 03:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:01:00.269 --> 03:01:00.279 align:start position:0%
cordel thank you Mr
 
03:01:05.110 --> 03:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
chair um so last week on the house floor
 
03:01:06.910 --> 03:01:06.920 align:start position:0%
during the debate on the free speech
 
03:01:08.710 --> 03:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
amendment this is related someone
 
03:01:11.229 --> 03:01:11.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned that old adage about um I may
 
03:01:12.510 --> 03:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
disagree with what you say but I'll
 
03:01:14.750 --> 03:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
fight for your right to say it I see a
 
03:01:17.510 --> 03:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
similarity here because you can still
 
03:01:19.389 --> 03:01:19.399 align:start position:0%
think that masks are effective and that
 
03:01:21.870 --> 03:01:21.880 align:start position:0%
that the kids should wear them but um I
 
03:01:23.590 --> 03:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
think that um as you heard in my
 
03:01:25.030 --> 03:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
testimony I know there's a few of you
 
03:01:27.110 --> 03:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
here who weren't at the hearing but I
 
03:01:29.510 --> 03:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
bought up a lot of medical evidence and
 
03:01:32.469 --> 03:01:32.479 align:start position:0%
um you know including Dr fouchi himself
 
03:01:34.550 --> 03:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh expressing
 
03:01:37.110 --> 03:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
some lack of shity over the
 
03:01:39.910 --> 03:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of masks but
 
03:01:43.309 --> 03:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
um Reasonable Doubt is has definitely
 
03:01:44.750 --> 03:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
been been
 
03:01:48.389 --> 03:01:48.399 align:start position:0%
raised uh so the choice of to whether a
 
03:01:50.750 --> 03:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
child should wear a mask to school or
 
03:01:56.030 --> 03:01:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:58.429 --> 03:01:58.439 align:start position:0%
uh so anyway to vote in favor of this
 
03:02:00.389 --> 03:02:00.399 align:start position:0%
bill you don't have to agree with any of
 
03:02:02.870 --> 03:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
the evidence I presented in the hearing
 
03:02:04.710 --> 03:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
this bill would not take away the right
 
03:02:07.229 --> 03:02:07.239 align:start position:0%
to wear masks all it does is and I'm
 
03:02:08.670 --> 03:02:08.680 align:start position:0%
sorry to read but I have a lot to say
 
03:02:10.510 --> 03:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to waste your time and
 
03:02:12.030 --> 03:02:12.040 align:start position:0%
I don't want to forget anything all it
 
03:02:13.630 --> 03:02:13.640 align:start position:0%
does is make sure that the rights of
 
03:02:15.070 --> 03:02:15.080 align:start position:0%
parents who don't want their children to
 
03:02:18.229 --> 03:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
wear masks are respected too and
 
03:02:21.110 --> 03:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
exercising this right Will Do no harm to
 
03:02:21.120 --> 03:02:22.030 align:start position:0%
exercising this right Will Do no harm to
mask

03:02:22.030 --> 03:02:22.040 align:start position:0%
mask
 
03:02:26.150 --> 03:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
wearers what concerns me is this logical
 
03:02:28.510 --> 03:02:28.520 align:start position:0%
Paradox if some people think that masks
 
03:02:30.590 --> 03:02:30.600 align:start position:0%
are effective and they choose to wear
 
03:02:32.950 --> 03:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
them or have their kids wear them why
 
03:02:34.870 --> 03:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
are they so concerned about other people
 
03:02:37.790 --> 03:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
not wearing them if masks work won't
 
03:02:39.710 --> 03:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
those wearing them be protected from
 
03:02:42.750 --> 03:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
those who aren't uh regarding there's
 
03:02:44.269 --> 03:02:44.279 align:start position:0%
the local control
 
03:02:47.229 --> 03:02:47.239 align:start position:0%
argument and um by taking this decision
 
03:02:49.630 --> 03:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
away from the school school boards and I
 
03:02:50.269 --> 03:02:50.279 align:start position:0%
I think it might have been
 
03:02:51.670 --> 03:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
representative Phillips who brought up a
 
03:02:53.950 --> 03:02:53.960 align:start position:0%
good point there is no more local of a
 
03:02:56.550 --> 03:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
unit than the family this this bill
 
03:02:58.590 --> 03:02:58.600 align:start position:0%
isn't mandating some kind of detailed
 
03:03:01.070 --> 03:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
curriculum it is simply protecting the
 
03:03:02.590 --> 03:03:02.600 align:start position:0%
rights of parents to make personal
 
03:03:05.269 --> 03:03:05.279 align:start position:0%
choices for their own children there is
 
03:03:06.750 --> 03:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
one thing I want to reread from all
 
03:03:09.429 --> 03:03:09.439 align:start position:0%
those articles I brought up I think it
 
03:03:11.229 --> 03:03:11.239 align:start position:0%
Bears repeating because it was an
 
03:03:13.229 --> 03:03:13.239 align:start position:0%
article just from this past December
 
03:03:15.510 --> 03:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
just three months ago The Archives of
 
03:03:19.150 --> 03:03:19.160 align:start position:0%
disease in childhood it
 
03:03:21.750 --> 03:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
concluded real world effectiveness of
 
03:03:24.269 --> 03:03:24.279 align:start position:0%
child mask mandates has not been
 
03:03:26.590 --> 03:03:26.600 align:start position:0%
demonstrated with high quality evidence
 
03:03:28.750 --> 03:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
the current body of scientific data does
 
03:03:30.630 --> 03:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
not support masking children for
 
03:03:31.910 --> 03:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
protection against
 
03:03:34.750 --> 03:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
covid-19 we fail to find any evidence of
 
03:03:37.429 --> 03:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
benefit from masking children child mask
 
03:03:40.030 --> 03:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
mandates fail a basic risk benefit
 
03:03:42.830 --> 03:03:42.840 align:start position:0%
analysis recommending child masking is
 
03:03:45.349 --> 03:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
unsupported by current scientific data
 
03:03:48.630 --> 03:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
and inconsistent with accepted ethical
 
03:03:52.229 --> 03:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
Norms so this is from a medical journal
 
03:03:54.150 --> 03:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
um there's one other thing I I want to
 
03:03:57.590 --> 03:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
add um in the conclusion to the article
 
03:04:00.510 --> 03:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
it says in medicine new interventions
 
03:04:02.750 --> 03:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
with unknown benefit but known or
 
03:04:05.229 --> 03:04:05.239 align:start position:0%
potential risks cannot be ethically
 
03:04:07.870 --> 03:04:07.880 align:start position:0%
recommended or enforced until absence of
 
03:04:10.950 --> 03:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
harm is demonstrated an intervention
 
03:04:13.469 --> 03:04:13.479 align:start position:0%
should only be employed after benefit
 
03:04:15.990 --> 03:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
has been demonstrated there's been a lot
 
03:04:18.389 --> 03:04:18.399 align:start position:0%
of Reasonable Doubt brought up and I
 
03:04:21.110 --> 03:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
think from listening to the testimony
 
03:04:26.110 --> 03:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
that harm has been done um aside from
 
03:04:28.830 --> 03:04:28.840 align:start position:0%
the the young man um and the I believe
 
03:04:30.110 --> 03:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
it was the New Hampshire school school
 
03:04:33.229 --> 03:04:33.239 align:start position:0%
board lobbyist who opposed this bill
 
03:04:35.150 --> 03:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
everyone else who spoke at the hearing
 
03:04:36.790 --> 03:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
supported it and I think they were all
 
03:04:39.990 --> 03:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
moms whose children suffered in one way
 
03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:40.750 align:start position:0%
moms whose children suffered in one way
or

03:04:40.750 --> 03:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:04:44.030 --> 03:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
another especially mentally we we are
 
03:04:45.389 --> 03:04:45.399 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what is the cause
 
03:04:47.790 --> 03:04:47.800 align:start position:0%
of our Mental Health crisis perhaps
 
03:04:49.990 --> 03:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
could be a small part of
 
03:04:53.150 --> 03:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
it and I'm one of those moms I had to
 
03:04:55.349 --> 03:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
see my son go off to school every day
 
03:04:59.030 --> 03:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
with a mask and he's the kind of kid who
 
03:05:01.150 --> 03:05:01.160 align:start position:0%
just takes things pretty easily and it
 
03:05:02.830 --> 03:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
didn't really seem to affect him but I
 
03:05:06.750 --> 03:05:06.760 align:start position:0%
can certainly like I I it it made me
 
03:05:08.790 --> 03:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
feel really sad that he had to
 
03:05:10.670 --> 03:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
experience half of his high school
 
03:05:13.790 --> 03:05:13.800 align:start position:0%
wearing something covering his
 
03:05:16.550 --> 03:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
face moms have a sick sense about what's
 
03:05:19.070 --> 03:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
harmful for their children we need to
 
03:05:22.269 --> 03:05:22.279 align:start position:0%
respect parents like them and pass this
 
03:05:25.309 --> 03:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you thank you very
 
03:05:29.790 --> 03:05:29.800 align:start position:0%

that addressed the issue when a special
 
04:23:49.030 --> 04:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
child education child that's of the uh
 
04:23:52.269 --> 04:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
military uh support from famili DOD
 
04:23:54.870 --> 04:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
schools transfers into your school has
 
04:23:57.469 --> 04:23:57.479 align:start position:0%
to deal with the military compact that
 
04:23:59.149 --> 04:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
if they have an IEP which they're
 
04:24:00.870 --> 04:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
carrying with them their paperwork the
 
04:24:03.710 --> 04:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
old we called it the old 2011 file now
 
04:24:06.710 --> 04:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
it's probably all digitized and etc etc
 
04:24:09.189 --> 04:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
but they bring that in then the
 
04:24:12.469 --> 04:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
receiving School accepts that and moves
 
04:24:15.349 --> 04:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
forward with education programming now
 
04:24:17.670 --> 04:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
they look at the IEP and they see an IEP
 
04:24:19.510 --> 04:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
they immediately contact the sending
 
04:24:21.510 --> 04:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
school and those records are transferred
 
04:24:24.349 --> 04:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
to them immediately by way of the uh
 
04:24:24.359 --> 04:24:25.510 align:start position:0%
to them immediately by way of the uh
digital

04:24:25.510 --> 04:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
digital
 
04:24:28.469 --> 04:24:28.479 align:start position:0%
capabilities if they find that this IEP
 
04:24:32.149 --> 04:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
is current this IEP is also uh meeting
 
04:24:34.469 --> 04:24:34.479 align:start position:0%
what they're observing in the school and
 
04:24:36.389 --> 04:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
and they want to continue it other words
 
04:24:39.030 --> 04:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
there's another year left on that IEP
 
04:24:43.189 --> 04:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
the IEP is good they can go forward and
 
04:24:45.149 --> 04:24:45.159 align:start position:0%
uh deliver services in accordance with
 
04:24:47.830 --> 04:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
that IEP that's the way our legislation
 
04:24:50.830 --> 04:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
in this state is written right now so
 
04:24:53.790 --> 04:24:53.800 align:start position:0%
just because they're coming in new
 
04:24:55.670 --> 04:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean you have to go through the
 
04:24:57.990 --> 04:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
IEP development processes again within
 
04:25:01.469 --> 04:25:01.479 align:start position:0%
30 days and go through all that again
 
04:25:04.389 --> 04:25:04.399 align:start position:0%
which is already in that IEP that's
 
04:25:06.830 --> 04:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
causing of course it's a financial uh
 
04:25:09.750 --> 04:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
loss to the community to have to you
 
04:25:11.309 --> 04:25:11.319 align:start position:0%
know get out gather all the people
 
04:25:14.109 --> 04:25:14.119 align:start position:0%
associated with that I AP and services
 
04:25:16.590 --> 04:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
so what this does the amendment does
 
04:25:19.710 --> 04:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
eliminate sections one and
 
04:25:24.070 --> 04:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
two um and which reflect you know that
 
04:25:25.910 --> 04:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
when you're receiving you get comparable
 
04:25:27.790 --> 04:25:27.800 align:start position:0%
Services that's already that's already
 
04:25:30.429 --> 04:25:30.439 align:start position:0%
being done and we're already looking at
 
04:25:32.670 --> 04:25:32.680 align:start position:0%
the IEPs and we have the responsibility
 
04:25:36.309 --> 04:25:36.319 align:start position:0%
of updating it and if necessary or going
 
04:25:38.349 --> 04:25:38.359 align:start position:0%
with it that's already being done what's
 
04:25:42.670 --> 04:25:42.680 align:start position:0%
not being done is section uh three and
 
04:25:47.229 --> 04:25:47.239 align:start position:0%
section three deals with um witness fees
 
04:25:48.830 --> 04:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
incurred by parents who are members of
 
04:25:50.670 --> 04:25:50.680 align:start position:0%
the Armed Forces shall and do process
 
04:25:52.750 --> 04:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
hearings be reimbursed by the Department
 
04:25:54.109 --> 04:25:54.119 align:start position:0%
of Education if the hearing officer
 
04:25:56.590 --> 04:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
finds in favor of the parent doesn't
 
04:25:58.389 --> 04:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
mean the local school district has to do
 
04:26:01.590 --> 04:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
it it means the state has to as far as I
 
04:26:03.109 --> 04:26:03.119 align:start position:0%
know in talking with people at the
 
04:26:05.590 --> 04:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
department this has not happened at all
 
04:26:07.830 --> 04:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh when military kids move into this
 
04:26:09.750 --> 04:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
this state this state is really
 
04:26:12.550 --> 04:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
supportive and we always have been and
 
04:26:14.750 --> 04:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
so but this is put in there in case they
 
04:26:16.830 --> 04:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
have a due process hearing the findings
 
04:26:19.349 --> 04:26:19.359 align:start position:0%
come out in behalf of the of the the
 
04:26:22.510 --> 04:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
parent the student then those costs of
 
04:26:24.590 --> 04:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh Legal Services all are reimbursed by
 
04:26:27.149 --> 04:26:27.159 align:start position:0%
the state to that family for those costs
 
04:26:28.790 --> 04:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
that's the only thing this bill will now
 
04:26:32.349 --> 04:26:32.359 align:start position:0%

going to be a good opportunity for us to
 
04:29:09.590 --> 04:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
take a second a couple minutes or so to
 
04:29:14.590 --> 04:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
uh look at uh 1090 10 uh 1298 and 1014

05:12:47.910 --> 05:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
authorization now it's not certification
 
05:12:50.830 --> 05:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
authorization and what we've recognized
 
05:12:53.708 --> 05:12:53.718 align:start position:0%
from prior commission work that there
 
05:12:56.190 --> 05:12:56.200 align:start position:0%
are certain positions depending upon
 
05:12:58.670 --> 05:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
your District where there's teacher
 
05:13:01.788 --> 05:13:01.798 align:start position:0%
shortages and it's critical that we have
 
05:13:07.670 --> 05:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
somebody in that uh position that's uh
 
05:13:09.510 --> 05:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
got the knowledge and content and the
 
05:13:12.548 --> 05:13:12.558 align:start position:0%
qualifications to U address the subject
 
05:13:16.310 --> 05:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
or the content being uh instructed the
 
05:13:18.548 --> 05:13:18.558 align:start position:0%
initial bill which we had said this
 
05:13:21.628 --> 05:13:21.638 align:start position:0%
individual could uh be part-time basis
 
05:13:23.628 --> 05:13:23.638 align:start position:0%
for less than 30
 
05:13:26.948 --> 05:13:26.958 align:start position:0%
hours when we look at 30 hours and you
 
05:13:29.628 --> 05:13:29.638 align:start position:0%
divide five into it you're beyond the 5
 
05:13:31.270 --> 05:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
and a half hours a day of instruction
 
05:13:33.948 --> 05:13:33.958 align:start position:0%
which basically occur whether whether in
 
05:13:35.628 --> 05:13:35.638 align:start position:0%
the grade schools whether you count
 
05:13:37.750 --> 05:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
recess as instruction but I always did
 
05:13:40.070 --> 05:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
it was my favorite subject
 
05:13:42.990 --> 05:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
and so it's down to 20 hours right now
 
05:13:48.150 --> 05:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
so this is a part-time position but even
 
05:13:48.160 --> 05:13:49.030 align:start position:0%
so this is a part-time position but even
more

05:13:49.030 --> 05:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:13:51.548 --> 05:13:51.558 align:start position:0%
importantly it's to address local and
 
05:13:54.910 --> 05:13:54.920 align:start position:0%
Statewide teacher shortage content area
 
05:13:57.030 --> 05:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
so it's the Local District that has to
 
05:13:59.788 --> 05:13:59.798 align:start position:0%
make the decision whether they can find
 
05:14:03.750 --> 05:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
somebody to teach this science class or
 
05:14:06.070 --> 05:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
the the class which is where they have
 
05:14:08.030 --> 05:14:08.040 align:start position:0%
the teacher shortage area
 
05:14:12.628 --> 05:14:12.638 align:start position:0%
within this bill on this amendment vers
 
05:14:14.708 --> 05:14:14.718 align:start position:0%
what we initially had produced to
 
05:14:17.948 --> 05:14:17.958 align:start position:0%
requires a bachelor's degree or hire
 
05:14:20.830 --> 05:14:20.840 align:start position:0%
with a major in or related to the field
 
05:14:20.840 --> 05:14:21.548 align:start position:0%
with a major in or related to the field
of

05:14:21.548 --> 05:14:21.558 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:14:23.270 --> 05:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
authorization other words if you're
 
05:14:26.030 --> 05:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
coming in as a history teacher if there
 
05:14:28.230 --> 05:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
is a shortage in history the person
 
05:14:29.948 --> 05:14:29.958 align:start position:0%
would have to have a background a degree
 
05:14:31.788 --> 05:14:31.798 align:start position:0%
in history you don't necessarily need
 
05:14:34.788 --> 05:14:34.798 align:start position:0%
that teacher's ticket the certification
 
05:14:37.230 --> 05:14:37.240 align:start position:0%
but you have the bachelor's degree in
 
05:14:41.788 --> 05:14:41.798 align:start position:0%
history or uh and in and uh and must
 
05:14:43.788 --> 05:14:43.798 align:start position:0%
submit passing scores on the content
 
05:14:46.548 --> 05:14:46.558 align:start position:0%
knowledge exam or exams required for
 
05:14:49.628 --> 05:14:49.638 align:start position:0%
authorization uh authorization area if
 
05:14:51.830 --> 05:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
one exists there may be some subject
 
05:14:53.708 --> 05:14:53.718 align:start position:0%
areas in talking with the director over
 
05:14:56.708 --> 05:14:56.718 align:start position:0%
the doe they don't have exams for and
 
05:14:58.548 --> 05:14:58.558 align:start position:0%
but if there is an exam for example of
 
05:15:01.910 --> 05:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
History you'd have to you know pass that
 
05:15:05.230 --> 05:15:05.240 align:start position:0%
exam uh uh verification of 5 years
 
05:15:07.070 --> 05:15:07.080 align:start position:0%
occupational experience in or related to
 
05:15:09.830 --> 05:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
the content field for of the
 
05:15:12.190 --> 05:15:12.200 align:start position:0%
authorization is uh and if the New
 
05:15:13.310 --> 05:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Education
 
05:15:14.990 --> 05:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
determines that this requirement is not
 
05:15:16.948 --> 05:15:16.958 align:start position:0%
met the individual and the employing
 
05:15:19.628 --> 05:15:19.638 align:start position:0%
public school or District May apply to
 
05:15:21.548 --> 05:15:21.558 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department for a
 
05:15:24.270 --> 05:15:24.280 align:start position:0%
determination as whether adequate op
 
05:15:26.628 --> 05:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
occupational experience is documented to
 
05:15:30.150 --> 05:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
justify the issuance of an adjunct
 
05:15:32.390 --> 05:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
authorization criminal background check
 
05:15:35.948 --> 05:15:35.958 align:start position:0%
is required and it needs to be required
 
05:15:38.628 --> 05:15:38.638 align:start position:0%
the adject authorization issued in this
 
05:15:41.830 --> 05:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh um uh uh let's see going on down a
 
05:15:44.590 --> 05:15:44.600 align:start position:0%
little farther here
 
05:15:47.788 --> 05:15:47.798 align:start position:0%
um if in fact you're looking to become a
 
05:15:50.270 --> 05:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
teacher this is not going to be a step
 
05:15:52.390 --> 05:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
towards you have to take the alternative
 
05:15:54.150 --> 05:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
approved program or the teacher
 
05:15:56.830 --> 05:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
certification preparation program to get
 
05:16:01.150 --> 05:16:01.160 align:start position:0%
certification so U that's important also
 
05:16:04.948 --> 05:16:04.958 align:start position:0%
um if you've been if you lost your job
 
05:16:06.708 --> 05:16:06.718 align:start position:0%
as a result of something which shouldn't
 
05:16:09.030 --> 05:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
happen or you know the criminal back
 
05:16:11.270 --> 05:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
ground or uh areas which it's been
 
05:16:15.470 --> 05:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
revoked you're ineligible for this so
 
05:16:18.590 --> 05:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
another area of extreme
 
05:16:21.910 --> 05:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
importance and and lastly uh we talked
 
05:16:24.990 --> 05:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
about the code of uh of ethics and the
 
05:16:27.390 --> 05:16:27.400 align:start position:0%
professional code of conduct part-time
 
05:16:29.470 --> 05:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
teachers this applies to the part-time
 
05:16:32.670 --> 05:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
teachers as well so they have there's no
 
05:16:35.590 --> 05:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
question that you have to abide by that
 
05:16:38.190 --> 05:16:38.200 align:start position:0%
so that's the nature of this uh it's
 
05:16:40.270 --> 05:16:40.280 align:start position:0%
trying to address the issues that we
 
05:16:42.510 --> 05:16:42.520 align:start position:0%
have attended to and heard so much about
 
05:16:44.830 --> 05:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
teacher shortage but it's not going to
 
05:16:46.990 --> 05:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
give full-time status and it's going to
 
05:16:49.350 --> 05:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
require that you have a person has a
 
05:16:51.788 --> 05:16:51.798 align:start position:0%
background in it and a bachelor's
 
05:16:54.628 --> 05:16:54.638 align:start position:0%
degree in it so I won't speak any more
 
05:16:57.270 --> 05:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
to it I think thank you any any further
 
05:16:59.948 --> 05:16:59.958 align:start position:0%

05:17:05.750 --> 05:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
about um and I think that uh the lad
 
05:17:08.670 --> 05:17:08.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment does address those concerns
 
05:17:12.190 --> 05:17:12.200 align:start position:0%
and provides uh an entree to some issues
 
05:17:13.590 --> 05:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
that were dealt with in the teacher
 
05:17:15.430 --> 05:17:15.440 align:start position:0%
shortage Committee of which
 
05:17:17.788 --> 05:17:17.798 align:start position:0%

05:19:35.470 --> 05:19:35.480 align:start position:0%
1452 respecting the office of clerk just
 
05:19:37.628 --> 05:19:37.638 align:start position:0%

a minute
okay

05:19:39.430 --> 05:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:19:42.390 --> 05:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:46.470 --> 05:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
itl is there a second second so we have
 
05:19:50.190 --> 05:19:50.200 align:start position:0%
motion on on the table itl on 1452 made
 
05:19:52.510 --> 05:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
by representative dry and second by
 
05:19:55.868 --> 05:19:55.878 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli representa
 
05:19:59.230 --> 05:19:59.240 align:start position:0%
dry what I've seen is that statute is
 
05:20:02.150 --> 05:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
kind of uh paints with broad stripes and
 
05:20:04.948 --> 05:20:04.958 align:start position:0%
the the rules and regulations and
 
05:20:08.430 --> 05:20:08.440 align:start position:0%
minutia belong in rules and regulations
 
05:20:12.310 --> 05:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
and I think that this bill puts a very
 
05:20:15.628 --> 05:20:15.638 align:start position:0%
long job description that belongs more
 
05:20:18.270 --> 05:20:18.280 align:start position:0%
in rules and regulations into statute I
 
05:20:21.350 --> 05:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
mean we had a bill recently that um
 
05:20:23.230 --> 05:20:23.240 align:start position:0%
delineated job qualifications for the
 
05:20:24.788 --> 05:20:24.798 align:start position:0%
commission of Education that only had
 
05:20:27.750 --> 05:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
three short lines this is very long
 
05:20:30.310 --> 05:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
extensive I mean it's good but it's but
 
05:20:32.310 --> 05:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
it's too long to put into a statute I
 
05:20:34.470 --> 05:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
think what we have here is a very good
 
05:20:37.948 --> 05:20:37.958 align:start position:0%
model for local um districts to look at
 
05:20:41.948 --> 05:20:41.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:45.230 --> 05:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
superintendent further discussion no not
 
05:20:47.350 --> 05:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
going to have it your sure just very
 
05:20:49.548 --> 05:20:49.558 align:start position:0%
very quickly so I I agree with
 
05:20:52.070 --> 05:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative dry not on the motion but
 
05:20:54.150 --> 05:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
um but on the idea that these do belong
 
05:20:55.990 --> 05:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
in rules unfortunately the Department of
 
05:20:58.628 --> 05:20:58.638 align:start position:0%
Education took a different uh approach
 
05:21:00.670 --> 05:21:00.680 align:start position:0%
to that eliminated rules for school
 
05:21:03.670 --> 05:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
business officers and has um has uh
 
05:21:06.830 --> 05:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
removed um much of the rules for um uh
 
05:21:10.390 --> 05:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
for superintendent so uh so you know my
 
05:21:11.910 --> 05:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
um you know what the what the State
 
05:21:13.430 --> 05:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
Board of Education what a member of the
 
05:21:15.628 --> 05:21:15.638 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education told me is well
 
05:21:18.150 --> 05:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
if you really want to have um um
 
05:21:20.110 --> 05:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
standards for school business officers
 
05:21:22.628 --> 05:21:22.638 align:start position:0%
that handle over $3.4 billion doar a
 
05:21:24.548 --> 05:21:24.558 align:start position:0%
year Statewide and you really want to
 
05:21:26.670 --> 05:21:26.680 align:start position:0%
have standards for superintendents that
 
05:21:28.868 --> 05:21:28.878 align:start position:0%
administer school districts that spend
 
05:21:31.830 --> 05:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
$3.4 billion Statewide then you better
 
05:21:34.270 --> 05:21:34.280 align:start position:0%
put it in law so um so when we get
 
05:21:37.750 --> 05:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
around to uh to the OTP motion uh I will
 
05:21:40.910 --> 05:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
be offering an amendment that um that uh
 
05:21:43.590 --> 05:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
that does actually restore those uh
 
05:21:46.390 --> 05:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
those those rules but but puts them into
 
05:21:50.670 --> 05:21:50.680 align:start position:0%
law but uh I I do agree that they they
 
05:21:52.470 --> 05:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
should just be in rules but
 
05:21:54.548 --> 05:21:54.558 align:start position:0%
unfortunately aren't there anymore okay
 
05:21:56.230 --> 05:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
we have a motion on table
 
05:21:59.390 --> 05:21:59.400 align:start position:0%

studies um yeah do you want me to speak
 
05:28:02.548 --> 05:28:02.558 align:start position:0%
to it first or well if you if you want
 
05:28:05.310 --> 05:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
to pull your motion at this time and and
 
05:28:06.788 --> 05:28:06.798 align:start position:0%
then we can speak to it and then I we'll
 
05:28:09.910 --> 05:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
come back to you I'll pull my second
 
05:28:12.350 --> 05:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
second or I can I can address it or you
 
05:28:13.910 --> 05:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
can address it right now either way
 
05:28:13.920 --> 05:28:15.548 align:start position:0%
can address it right now either way
right

05:28:15.548 --> 05:28:15.558 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:28:18.708 --> 05:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
yes yeah we can do it right now yeah so
 
05:28:20.708 --> 05:28:20.718 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli will address that
 
05:28:22.670 --> 05:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
when he's also speaking towards his
 
05:28:27.150 --> 05:28:27.160 align:start position:0%
motion of right inter study right so um
 
05:28:31.070 --> 05:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
I think that there were uh questions
 
05:28:35.470 --> 05:28:35.480 align:start position:0%
related to a hard and fast November 1st
 
05:28:40.390 --> 05:28:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh date um uh did talk with uh director
 
05:28:45.788 --> 05:28:45.798 align:start position:0%
white um and uh there have been inst
 
05:28:50.788 --> 05:28:50.798 align:start position:0%
instances where the um charter school
 
05:28:50.798 --> 05:28:51.948 align:start position:0%
instances where the um charter school
has

05:28:51.948 --> 05:28:51.958 align:start position:0%
has
 
05:28:54.590 --> 05:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
not signed
 
05:28:57.150 --> 05:28:57.160 align:start position:0%
theou for various
 
05:29:01.628 --> 05:29:01.638 align:start position:0%
reasons and um the concern is and refus
 
05:29:04.390 --> 05:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
to provide services until theou was
 
05:29:09.270 --> 05:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
signed so the concern is that
 
05:29:14.150 --> 05:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
um po it's possible that a um a charter
 
05:29:16.510 --> 05:29:16.520 align:start position:0%
school would not sign an M
 
05:29:20.788 --> 05:29:20.798 align:start position:0%
moou uh until this November 1st deadline
 
05:29:23.910 --> 05:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
and in those instances no Services would
 
05:29:27.628 --> 05:29:27.638 align:start position:0%
be provided to the child uh prior to
 
05:29:31.510 --> 05:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
November 1st um so I I am putting
 
05:29:34.030 --> 05:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
forward the interim study motion because
 
05:29:36.470 --> 05:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
I think that there are uh clearly
 
05:29:39.948 --> 05:29:39.958 align:start position:0%
problems you know with that happening um
 
05:29:42.110 --> 05:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
that need to be looked at and resolved
 
05:29:45.390 --> 05:29:45.400 align:start position:0%
and I don't think we can um uh resolve
 
05:29:50.270 --> 05:29:50.280 align:start position:0%
it here today um and we just saw a a
 
05:29:52.470 --> 05:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
special that AIT come out the end of
 
05:29:55.670 --> 05:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
last week also um with uh even more
 
05:29:59.310 --> 05:29:59.320 align:start position:0%
concerns and questions so um I would
 
05:30:02.230 --> 05:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
like to um Advance the motion of interum
 
05:30:05.110 --> 05:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
study so we can take a look at the whole
 
05:30:12.470 --> 05:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:15.948 --> 05:30:15.958 align:start position:0%
theou okay is there further discussion
 
05:30:17.628 --> 05:30:17.638 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll speak against the interim
 
05:30:19.190 --> 05:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
study and
 
05:30:21.030 --> 05:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
say pardon
 
05:30:23.708 --> 05:30:23.718 align:start position:0%
me I'll speak against the interim study
 
05:30:26.230 --> 05:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
and use that as my uh you know support
 
05:30:28.470 --> 05:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
for ought to pass if we get to that to
 
05:30:32.990 --> 05:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
that point so so U Mr chair thank you um
 
05:30:36.070 --> 05:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
um I you know offered the bill we
 
05:30:38.430 --> 05:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
offered the bill
 
05:30:42.510 --> 05:30:42.520 align:start position:0%
to move the um the date where school
 
05:30:44.548 --> 05:30:44.558 align:start position:0%
districts and charter schools have to
 
05:30:47.150 --> 05:30:47.160 align:start position:0%
enter into a memorandum of understanding
 
05:30:51.708 --> 05:30:51.718 align:start position:0%
for essentially how and where and who
 
05:30:54.670 --> 05:30:54.680 align:start position:0%
pays for what or how things get paid for
 
05:30:58.390 --> 05:30:58.400 align:start position:0%
build uh for special education services
 
05:31:01.510 --> 05:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
um provided to um
 
05:31:04.310 --> 05:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
to IEP students who attend charter
 
05:31:08.150 --> 05:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
schools and um by law the um the school
 
05:31:11.190 --> 05:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
district of residence is responsible for
 
05:31:14.150 --> 05:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
um uh for these services and uh the
 
05:31:15.548 --> 05:31:15.558 align:start position:0%
school district of residence is
 
05:31:17.670 --> 05:31:17.680 align:start position:0%
responsible for these Services whether
 
05:31:20.708 --> 05:31:20.718 align:start position:0%
or not anou is in place at all because
 
05:31:23.350 --> 05:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
as long as the IEP is in place the
 
05:31:25.270 --> 05:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
services are provided there may be some
 
05:31:26.788 --> 05:31:26.798 align:start position:0%
confusion between the school district
 
05:31:28.470 --> 05:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
and the charter as to how they're going
 
05:31:30.990 --> 05:31:31.000 align:start position:0%
to be paid for um or where they're going
 
05:31:34.190 --> 05:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
to be performed but the student is
 
05:31:35.510 --> 05:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
receiving the services that are
 
05:31:38.430 --> 05:31:38.440 align:start position:0%
specified in their IP that's fed I'm not
 
05:31:41.270 --> 05:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
an expert I believe that's federal law
 
05:31:44.548 --> 05:31:44.558 align:start position:0%
um so I'm I'm sort of surprised that
 
05:31:47.030 --> 05:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
that an expert at the department would
 
05:31:50.230 --> 05:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
would suggest that students um would not
 
05:31:53.030 --> 05:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
be receiving services but another reason
 
05:31:55.548 --> 05:31:55.558 align:start position:0%
why I think the 111 the November 1st
 
05:31:57.350 --> 05:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
date is not
 
05:32:00.230 --> 05:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
only practical because it's not a date
 
05:32:02.470 --> 05:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
that exists in the middle of the summer
 
05:32:05.390 --> 05:32:05.400 align:start position:0%
when um although special uh special
 
05:32:08.030 --> 05:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
education and student service directors
 
05:32:11.708 --> 05:32:11.718 align:start position:0%
are you know are there yearround at at
 
05:32:13.670 --> 05:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
public school districts but at Charter
 
05:32:15.868 --> 05:32:15.878 align:start position:0%
Schools they may not have any any
 
05:32:17.750 --> 05:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
staffing during the during the summer
 
05:32:20.470 --> 05:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
months um a number of us learned on
 
05:32:24.910 --> 05:32:24.920 align:start position:0%
Friday that the number of um of students
 
05:32:27.868 --> 05:32:27.878 align:start position:0%
identified uh as special education
 
05:32:30.788 --> 05:32:30.798 align:start position:0%
apparently changes between before the
 
05:32:34.070 --> 05:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
October 1st um uh collection date and
 
05:32:36.788 --> 05:32:36.798 align:start position:0%
after October 1st and in fact we learned
 
05:32:38.510 --> 05:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
from the um
 
05:32:42.548 --> 05:32:42.558 align:start position:0%
from the um
 
05:32:45.430 --> 05:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
um from the Department of Education
 
05:32:46.948 --> 05:32:46.958 align:start position:0%
Brian eaten administrative Bureau of
 
05:32:50.910 --> 05:32:50.920 align:start position:0%
school finance that um that in fact this
 
05:32:54.990 --> 05:32:55.000 align:start position:0%
past year uh prior to October 1st the uh
 
05:32:58.708 --> 05:32:58.718 align:start position:0%
the department was um was only aware of
 
05:33:01.230 --> 05:33:01.240 align:start position:0%
26334 students identified as special
 
05:33:04.470 --> 05:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
education Statewide but after October
 
05:33:08.750 --> 05:33:08.760 align:start position:0%
1st um they um they were aware of 30,000
 
05:33:11.788 --> 05:33:11.798 align:start position:0%
965 students so so
 
05:33:15.510 --> 05:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
4,631 students hadn't been identified um
 
05:33:18.708 --> 05:33:18.718 align:start position:0%
or at least made aware of at the
 
05:33:21.350 --> 05:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Education until um till
 
05:33:25.708 --> 05:33:25.718 align:start position:0%
the October 1 collection so so for for
 
05:33:28.670 --> 05:33:28.680 align:start position:0%
that reason in addition to the Practical
 
05:33:31.310 --> 05:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
reason I think pushing this to a
 
05:33:34.788 --> 05:33:34.798 align:start position:0%
November first date really makes a lot
 
05:33:36.708 --> 05:33:36.718 align:start position:0%
of sense makes a lot of sense because
 
05:33:38.788 --> 05:33:38.798 align:start position:0%
you've got Staffing and place and it
 
05:33:41.030 --> 05:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense because the New
 
05:33:43.510 --> 05:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Education knows
 
05:33:46.628 --> 05:33:46.638 align:start position:0%
the um knows all of the kids that are um
 
05:33:48.390 --> 05:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
that are identified for special
 
05:33:50.868 --> 05:33:50.878 align:start position:0%
education services so I'm hoping we can
 
05:33:54.470 --> 05:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
defeat the interim study report um at
 
05:33:56.350 --> 05:33:56.360 align:start position:0%
recommendation and uh so that we can
 
05:33:59.270 --> 05:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
take up an not to pass thank
 
05:34:02.868 --> 05:34:02.878 align:start position:0%
you all right so we've had speaking for
 
05:34:05.868 --> 05:34:05.878 align:start position:0%

05:34:07.390 --> 05:34:07.400 align:start position:0%

05:43:43.750 --> 05:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
much uh what this amendment does it it
 
05:43:47.590 --> 05:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
eliminates that section 4 new
 
05:43:50.910 --> 05:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
language which is already something we
 
05:43:54.468 --> 05:43:54.478 align:start position:0%
can do in law and is being done it's in
 
05:43:57.548 --> 05:43:57.558 align:start position:0%
it's in statute but it's also in Rule
 
05:44:00.468 --> 05:44:00.478 align:start position:0%
and it keeps the first section it of the
 
05:44:03.190 --> 05:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
change on this so sections the read
 
05:44:05.510 --> 05:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
right there it just takes out section
 
05:44:07.830 --> 05:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
four and section five become section
 
05:44:10.190 --> 05:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
four which is the effective
 
05:44:13.468 --> 05:44:13.478 align:start position:0%
date uh it's basically in compliance
 
05:44:14.788 --> 05:44:14.798 align:start position:0%

okay when you're re uh ready represent
 
05:51:48.190 --> 05:51:48.200 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh thank you um we had quite a
 
05:51:50.628 --> 05:51:50.638 align:start position:0%
hearing on this um with a number of
 
05:51:54.948 --> 05:51:54.958 align:start position:0%
people testifying um basically uh just
 
05:51:57.990 --> 05:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
requires uh parental consent uh to be
 
05:52:00.628 --> 05:52:00.638 align:start position:0%
obtained with each new
 
05:52:05.270 --> 05:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
service uh not just a one-time parental
 
05:52:07.750 --> 05:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
consent um
 
05:52:10.150 --> 05:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
what the amendment does um we had quite
 
05:52:12.670 --> 05:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
a bit of discussion uh in relation to
 
05:52:17.390 --> 05:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
Roman 9 lines 14 through 18 in relation
 
05:52:21.548 --> 05:52:21.558 align:start position:0%
to violations being um contrary to the
 
05:52:24.390 --> 05:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
code of conduct of violations of this
 
05:52:26.548 --> 05:52:26.558 align:start position:0%
section of law being violations of the
 
05:52:29.788 --> 05:52:29.798 align:start position:0%
code of conduct um the amendment removes
 
05:52:29.798 --> 05:52:31.430 align:start position:0%
code of conduct um the amendment removes
Roman

05:52:31.430 --> 05:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
Roman
 
05:52:35.430 --> 05:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
9 basally removes that uh penalty
 
05:52:35.440 --> 05:52:39.270 align:start position:0%
9 basally removes that uh penalty
possibility

05:52:39.270 --> 05:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:39.280 --> 05:52:42.468 align:start position:0%
 
further

05:52:42.468 --> 05:52:42.478 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:48.708 --> 05:52:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:52.868 --> 05:52:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:55.788 --> 05:52:55.798 align:start position:0%
amendment sure thank thank you Mr chair
 
05:52:58.788 --> 05:52:58.798 align:start position:0%
um I I think the um the amendment
 
05:53:02.628 --> 05:53:02.638 align:start position:0%
probably at least remove some um some
 
05:53:04.468 --> 05:53:04.478 align:start position:0%
part of the bill that that is
 
05:53:07.110 --> 05:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
particularly um uh
 
05:53:10.070 --> 05:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
you know that particularly onerous but
 
05:53:11.390 --> 05:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
so I'm probably I'm going to be
 
05:53:14.030 --> 05:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
supporting the amendment but unlikely to
 
05:53:16.468 --> 05:53:16.478 align:start position:0%
support the bill is amended thank you
 
05:53:20.190 --> 05:53:20.200 align:start position:0%
very much okay uh mam Clark would you
 
05:53:22.270 --> 05:53:22.280 align:start position:0%
please uh call the amendment the
 
05:53:23.590 --> 05:53:23.600 align:start position:0%

discussion and you
 
05:54:25.430 --> 05:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
ready represent Bon um I'm going to be
 
05:54:29.590 --> 05:54:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh speaking against the bill um the
 
05:54:30.990 --> 05:54:31.000 align:start position:0%
amendment makes it better but there's
 
05:54:34.190 --> 05:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
still a lot of problems with it um one
 
05:54:36.910 --> 05:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
of the problems is that uh there's a lot
 
05:54:39.868 --> 05:54:39.878 align:start position:0%
of uh intricate details in here and we
 
05:54:42.510 --> 05:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
had no nobody from the Department to
 
05:54:44.110 --> 05:54:44.120 align:start position:0%
come to speak to to ask specific
 
05:54:45.948 --> 05:54:45.958 align:start position:0%
questions as to actually how this would
 
05:54:49.390 --> 05:54:49.400 align:start position:0%
work or what it means in addition uh we
 
05:54:49.400 --> 05:54:50.628 align:start position:0%
work or what it means in addition uh we
recently

05:54:50.628 --> 05:54:50.638 align:start position:0%
recently
 
05:54:50.638 --> 05:54:53.788 align:start position:0%
recently
passed

05:54:53.788 --> 05:54:53.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:57.510 --> 05:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
um HB 1695 which requires school
 
05:54:59.310 --> 05:54:59.320 align:start position:0%
districts to provide specific written
 
05:55:01.548 --> 05:55:01.558 align:start position:0%
notification to parents each time
 
05:55:04.430 --> 05:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
personal identific pii is transferred
 
05:55:07.030 --> 05:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
from uh school districts to third party
 
05:55:09.190 --> 05:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
which is um similar to what's being
 
05:55:11.468 --> 05:55:11.478 align:start position:0%
requested here so I think there's a
 
05:55:14.070 --> 05:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
little bit of an overlap in the bill but
 
05:55:16.788 --> 05:55:16.798 align:start position:0%
primarily I think it's a complicated
 
05:55:19.430 --> 05:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
Bill uh that we don't have a lot of
 
05:55:21.910 --> 05:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
information on so I think it's premature
 
05:55:24.548 --> 05:55:24.558 align:start position:0%
to uh to vote for it it would be better
 
05:55:26.830 --> 05:55:26.840 align:start position:0%
suited as we talked about it in having a
 
05:55:29.270 --> 05:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or inter interim study
 
05:55:29.280 --> 05:55:31.548 align:start position:0%
subcommittee or inter interim study
thank

05:55:31.548 --> 05:55:31.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:36.830 --> 05:55:36.840 align:start position:0%
you okay uh F brother disc yes yeah
 
05:55:41.390 --> 05:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and um and I'm I'm I
 
05:55:43.030 --> 05:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
I agree with what with what
 
05:55:45.190 --> 05:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
representative balbon just said that
 
05:55:47.468 --> 05:55:47.478 align:start position:0%
that perhaps this this does deserve
 
05:55:50.510 --> 05:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
interim study and um and I'm sort of
 
05:55:54.628 --> 05:55:54.638 align:start position:0%
also you know learning that that prior
 
05:55:58.868 --> 05:55:58.878 align:start position:0%
to um you know a
 
05:56:01.150 --> 05:56:01.160 align:start position:0%
a a
 
05:56:03.628 --> 05:56:03.638 align:start position:0%
Medicaid or let me say it another way a
 
05:56:06.310 --> 05:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
medical procedure performed under the
 
05:56:09.030 --> 05:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
Medicaid to schools program that there'd
 
05:56:11.910 --> 05:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
be a medical order that has to be signed
 
05:56:15.868 --> 05:56:15.878 align:start position:0%
off first by by the parenter guardian
 
05:56:19.350 --> 05:56:19.360 align:start position:0%
and and so the parenter guardian knows
 
05:56:22.150 --> 05:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
what uh what services are being provided
 
05:56:26.270 --> 05:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
um to their to their child in school and
 
05:56:28.990 --> 05:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
um and it sort of renders I I think this
 
05:56:31.830 --> 05:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
bill sort of you know
 
05:56:31.840 --> 05:56:35.230 align:start position:0%
bill sort of you know
unnecessary

05:56:35.230 --> 05:56:35.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:39.670 --> 05:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much um representa
 
05:56:43.110 --> 05:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
Cornell yes um I just looked up Medicaid
 
05:56:45.670 --> 05:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
International classification of diseases
 
05:56:49.350 --> 05:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
diagnostic code and I I I would want an
 
05:56:51.830 --> 05:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
interim study or something because I
 
05:56:54.390 --> 05:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
don't know what that has to do with the
 
05:56:56.230 --> 05:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
services that are provided in school it
 
05:56:58.910 --> 05:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
some looks like it has something to do
 
05:57:01.548 --> 05:57:01.558 align:start position:0%
with World Health Organization and I
 
05:57:03.468 --> 05:57:03.478 align:start position:0%
don't know what that has to do with
 
05:57:05.468 --> 05:57:05.478 align:start position:0%
services that are provided in schools so
 
05:57:07.708 --> 05:57:07.718 align:start position:0%
I think this is too confusing and I
 
05:57:10.788 --> 05:57:10.798 align:start position:0%
can't vote for it represent
 
05:57:13.350 --> 05:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
Bel thank you Mr chair I just want to
 
05:57:15.390 --> 05:57:15.400 align:start position:0%
point out that I I think it is very
 
05:57:17.270 --> 05:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
important that parental could s be
 
05:57:20.230 --> 05:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
obtained before any any service um
 
05:57:21.910 --> 05:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
because they can change over time what
 
05:57:23.868 --> 05:57:23.878 align:start position:0%
schools are providing and just to read
 
05:57:25.030 --> 05:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
real quick from the New Hampshire
 
05:57:26.910 --> 05:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid site on on the question and
 
05:57:28.948 --> 05:57:28.958 align:start position:0%
answer Can a district provide services
 
05:57:31.670 --> 05:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
without parent parental consent answer
 
05:57:33.830 --> 05:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
yes a district can provide services
 
05:57:35.110 --> 05:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
without parental
 
05:57:35.120 --> 05:57:36.788 align:start position:0%
without parental
consent

05:57:36.788 --> 05:57:36.798 align:start position:0%

05:57:40.310 --> 05:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you just to speak a little
 
05:57:43.070 --> 05:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
further to representative Cornell's
 
05:57:45.868 --> 05:57:45.878 align:start position:0%
remarks the international classification
 
05:57:48.990 --> 05:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
of diseases ICD codes are diagnosis
 
05:57:50.708 --> 05:57:50.718 align:start position:0%
codes they
 
05:57:53.628 --> 05:57:53.638 align:start position:0%
specify what condition is being
 
05:57:56.190 --> 05:57:56.200 align:start position:0%
addressed they're not service codes that
 
05:57:57.830 --> 05:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
would be a service code or a procedure
 
05:58:02.830 --> 05:58:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:11.628 --> 05:58:11.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:14.430 --> 05:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
procedure further discussion representor
 
05:58:17.310 --> 05:58:17.320 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr chair so far the
 
05:58:19.110 --> 05:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
discussion has focused around sections
 
05:58:21.030 --> 05:58:21.040 align:start position:0%
eight and nine I'm drawing back
 
05:58:23.670 --> 05:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
attention to section s it seems that the
 
05:58:26.230 --> 05:58:26.240 align:start position:0%
report that we have gotten here as a
 
05:58:27.948 --> 05:58:27.958 align:start position:0%
part of testimony from the Department of
 
05:58:30.750 --> 05:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services would also be
 
05:58:32.788 --> 05:58:32.798 align:start position:0%
required to be sent to the chair of this
 
05:58:35.510 --> 05:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
committee as well as the chair of Health
 
05:58:37.948 --> 05:58:37.958 align:start position:0%
and Human services and both education
 
05:58:39.590 --> 05:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
and Health Human Services in the Senate
 
05:58:41.590 --> 05:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
as well and that would allow them to
 
05:58:43.070 --> 05:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
delineate the information to all
 
05:58:44.868 --> 05:58:44.878 align:start position:0%
committee members so that future
 
05:58:46.788 --> 05:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
discussions surrounding Medicaid which
 
05:58:48.390 --> 05:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
comes up in a lot of bills we can make

thank you per
 
06:00:15.190 --> 06:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
luno so um yeah I mean I think interim
 
06:00:17.270 --> 06:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
study is where this belongs I think you
 
06:00:20.788 --> 06:00:20.798 align:start position:0%
know there there's there's there's some
 
06:00:24.110 --> 06:00:24.120 align:start position:0%
some clear inconsistencies with what the
 
06:00:25.910 --> 06:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
terminology used in the bill I think
 
06:00:29.830 --> 06:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
representative Damon brought that out um
 
06:00:32.868 --> 06:00:32.878 align:start position:0%
and uh Medicaid to schools does does
 
06:00:35.670 --> 06:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
come up uh uh quite a bit and I think we
 
06:00:39.430 --> 06:00:39.440 align:start position:0%
have uh we had we we actually had some
 
06:00:41.590 --> 06:00:41.600 align:start position:0%
significant impact on Medicaid the
 
06:00:43.868 --> 06:00:43.878 align:start position:0%
schools during the uh during the covid
 
06:00:47.868 --> 06:00:47.878 align:start position:0%
pandemic but again this is about billing
 
06:00:51.230 --> 06:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
and um and the uh the procedures still
 
06:00:53.670 --> 06:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
are subject to uh the medical orders
 
06:00:57.350 --> 06:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
still subject to parental um approval so
 
06:00:59.390 --> 06:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
um so I I you know I think interim
 
06:01:04.390 --> 06:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:19.110 --> 06:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:21.350 --> 06:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
McDonald well I think that that's part
 
06:01:26.030 --> 06:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:28.628 --> 06:01:28.638 align:start position:0%

to your motion uh thank you um I I think
 
06:14:41.270 --> 06:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
there are still questions to be resolved
 
06:14:46.310 --> 06:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
um related uh to this bill um you we we
 
06:14:49.788 --> 06:14:49.798 align:start position:0%
heard from uh secretary scanland uh
 
06:14:54.110 --> 06:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
today um but uh I I still have questions
 
06:14:57.190 --> 06:14:57.200 align:start position:0%
even um after um hearing from the
 
06:15:01.190 --> 06:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
secretary um in relation to um uh public
 
06:15:05.510 --> 06:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
meetings in relation to um
 
06:15:09.350 --> 06:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
um whether how things would work if
 
06:15:12.670 --> 06:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
there is uh a Regional School District
 
06:15:17.788 --> 06:15:17.798 align:start position:0%
and only certain um reg um super uh
 
06:15:19.510 --> 06:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist or town
 
06:15:23.230 --> 06:15:23.240 align:start position:0%
clerks appear um and other students
 
06:15:25.190 --> 06:15:25.200 align:start position:0%
being unable to register from that
 
06:15:29.070 --> 06:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
school um that day I think uh causes a
 
06:15:33.910 --> 06:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
problems um so I I I
 
06:15:36.750 --> 06:15:36.760 align:start position:0%
think think this is already happening in
 
06:15:40.110 --> 06:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
some places now so uh I think interim
 
06:15:42.230 --> 06:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
study to look at the uh remaining
 
06:15:44.628 --> 06:15:44.638 align:start position:0%
questions um is
 
06:15:47.230 --> 06:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate further
 
06:15:49.708 --> 06:15:49.718 align:start position:0%
discussion not seeing
 
06:15:52.310 --> 06:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
any R Hall he didn't see I'm just
 
06:15:54.150 --> 06:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
curious when he said it's already
 
06:15:56.750 --> 06:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
happening the bill asks for school
 
06:15:59.830 --> 06:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
boards to adopt a policy is that what's
 
06:16:01.990 --> 06:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
already happening or you talking about
 
06:16:02.000 --> 06:16:03.548 align:start position:0%
already happening or you talking about
voter

06:16:03.548 --> 06:16:03.558 align:start position:0%
voter
 
06:16:07.708 --> 06:16:07.718 align:start position:0%
registration in schools um I think that
 
06:16:10.590 --> 06:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
um there might be voter registration but
 
06:16:13.510 --> 06:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
certainly uh providing uh information on
 
06:16:17.548 --> 06:16:17.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:20.430 --> 06:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
happening further

Hall thank you Mr chair uh the intent of
 
06:21:24.990 --> 06:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
this bipartisan bill is to require
 
06:21:27.590 --> 06:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
school districts and private schools to
 
06:21:30.390 --> 06:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
adopt policies to promote student um
 
06:21:32.910 --> 06:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
voter registration it's about adopting
 
06:21:35.310 --> 06:21:35.320 align:start position:0%
policies our American democracy is
 
06:21:37.150 --> 06:21:37.160 align:start position:0%
strongest when all eligible citizens
 
06:21:39.390 --> 06:21:39.400 align:start position:0%
participate and to do so they need to be
 
06:21:41.750 --> 06:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
registered to vote and that is our
 
06:21:43.070 --> 06:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
challenge in the grand of State for
 
06:21:45.628 --> 06:21:45.638 align:start position:0%
young voters our schools play a critical
 
06:21:47.350 --> 06:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
role in supporting and strengthening our
 
06:21:47.360 --> 06:21:48.948 align:start position:0%
role in supporting and strengthening our
Democratic

06:21:48.948 --> 06:21:48.958 align:start position:0%
Democratic
 
06:21:51.310 --> 06:21:51.320 align:start position:0%
Society even though New Hampshire at a
 
06:21:53.750 --> 06:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
proud tradition of high to high voter
 
06:21:56.310 --> 06:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
turnout the voter registration rate for
 
06:21:58.948 --> 06:21:58.958 align:start position:0%
18y olds is a mere
 
06:22:02.350 --> 06:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
15.6% or maybe a little higher as um
 
06:22:04.270 --> 06:22:04.280 align:start position:0%
secretary scanland said but the bottom
 
06:22:07.830 --> 06:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
line is it's slow and that said 83% of
 
06:22:10.270 --> 06:22:10.280 align:start position:0%
registered New Hampshire 18y olds voted
 
06:22:13.270 --> 06:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
in the 22 midterms so if they register
 
06:22:16.708 --> 06:22:16.718 align:start position:0%
at 17 or 18 they're likely to vote a
 
06:22:18.708 --> 06:22:18.718 align:start position:0%
major responsibility of a supervisor of
 
06:22:20.910 --> 06:22:20.920 align:start position:0%
the checklist is to encourage voting as
 
06:22:23.110 --> 06:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
we heard this morning so activities such
 
06:22:24.868 --> 06:22:24.878 align:start position:0%
as coordinating a voter registration
 
06:22:27.390 --> 06:22:27.400 align:start position:0%
Drive in a high school is one way to
 
06:22:29.468 --> 06:22:29.478 align:start position:0%
encourage voting it's not mandated in
 
06:22:32.030 --> 06:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
this bill it just suggests it's an
 
06:22:36.750 --> 06:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
option um uh HB
 
06:22:39.590 --> 06:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
1014 is a Way New Hampshire can increase

an
 
06:23:33.270 --> 06:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
amend repres
 
06:23:37.430 --> 06:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
leus I I thought um what we heard today
 
06:23:40.270 --> 06:23:40.280 align:start position:0%
was that we couldn't provide assistance
 
06:23:42.830 --> 06:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
with filing the registration
 
06:23:46.070 --> 06:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
applications I could answer
 
06:23:49.030 --> 06:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
that said if everything is 101 then we
 
06:23:51.788 --> 06:23:51.798 align:start position:0%
can choose yeah I'd like to recognize
 
06:23:55.948 --> 06:23:55.958 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli oh you got a question
 
06:23:55.958 --> 06:23:59.270 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli oh you got a question
that

06:23:59.270 --> 06:23:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:02.150 --> 06:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
she thank you Mr chair the question was
 
06:24:04.430 --> 06:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
I thought that they couldn't help right
 
06:24:07.830 --> 06:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
now in law we actually have for special
 
06:24:10.030 --> 06:24:10.040 align:start position:0%
ed if a student with disabilities
 
06:24:11.910 --> 06:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
requires assistance to complete the
 
06:24:14.910 --> 06:24:14.920 align:start position:0%
voter registration form a staff member
 
06:24:16.390 --> 06:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
may be made available to help the
 
06:24:19.788 --> 06:24:19.798 align:start position:0%
student complete the form so already
 
06:24:21.548 --> 06:24:21.558 align:start position:0%
it's happening with some students it can
 
06:24:23.788 --> 06:24:23.798 align:start position:0%
happen with some students and clearly
 
06:24:25.270 --> 06:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
those are the two the two parts
 
06:24:26.468 --> 06:24:26.478 align:start position:0%
informing students of the state
 
06:24:28.548 --> 06:24:28.558 align:start position:0%
requirements of voter registration and
 
06:24:30.190 --> 06:24:30.200 align:start position:0%
providing access to and assistance with
 
06:24:32.230 --> 06:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
filing registration applications the
 
06:24:33.590 --> 06:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
other thing if I could add one more
 
06:24:34.990 --> 06:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
thing would be
 
06:24:38.270 --> 06:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
um if you inform students if you if you
 
06:24:40.590 --> 06:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
inform students in civics class some of
 
06:24:43.468 --> 06:24:43.478 align:start position:0%
these kids are 14 years old 14y old
 
06:24:45.390 --> 06:24:45.400 align:start position:0%
they're freshman they're taking Civics
 
06:24:47.430 --> 06:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
they talk about voter registration that
 
06:24:49.510 --> 06:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
is not going to translate into that kid
 
06:24:51.430 --> 06:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
registering the vote you know maybe you
 
06:24:52.670 --> 06:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
could have the town clerk come in and
 
06:24:54.670 --> 06:24:54.680 align:start position:0%
talk about the process or whatever but
 
06:24:56.590 --> 06:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
unless but it's totally different being
 
06:24:59.708 --> 06:24:59.718 align:start position:0%
in a Civic class and this is a a a
 
06:25:02.070 --> 06:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
separate activity but again this is
 
06:25:04.628 --> 06:25:04.638 align:start position:0%
about adopting policy some schools do it
 
06:25:06.270 --> 06:25:06.280 align:start position:0%
some schools don't some schools do this
 
06:25:08.230 --> 06:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
some schools do that it's about adopting
 
06:25:10.468 --> 06:25:10.478 align:start position:0%
policy so that everyone is on the same
 
06:25:12.350 --> 06:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
page and
 
06:25:15.788 --> 06:25:15.798 align:start position:0%
um that's the way it is per
 
06:25:19.750 --> 06:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh thank you uh first I I think
 
06:25:21.708 --> 06:25:21.718 align:start position:0%
what we just heard is defined as local
 
06:25:23.990 --> 06:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
control um but secondly I would like to
 
06:25:26.708 --> 06:25:26.718 align:start position:0%

06:25:29.990 --> 06:25:30.000 align:start position:0%

06:26:10.590 --> 06:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
06:26:15.190 --> 06:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um during the hearing I I
 
06:26:18.708 --> 06:26:18.718 align:start position:0%
believe we had um quite a bit of uh
 
06:26:22.350 --> 06:26:22.360 align:start position:0%
discussion that um this really belonged
 
06:26:24.990 --> 06:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
in the Civics uh
 
06:26:28.270 --> 06:26:28.280 align:start position:0%
statutes uh so basically that's what
 
06:26:33.110 --> 06:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
this amendment does it puts it um in um
 
06:26:36.350 --> 06:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
18911 uh um under government and
 
06:26:40.868 --> 06:26:40.878 align:start position:0%
Civics and um as you can see adds an F
 
06:26:45.310 --> 06:26:45.320 align:start position:0%
which refers to existing law regarding
 
06:26:47.788 --> 06:26:47.798 align:start position:0%
uh information on um
 
06:26:50.070 --> 06:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
voting um and
 
06:26:52.990 --> 06:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
that um I can just read the first
 
06:26:56.350 --> 06:26:56.360 align:start position:0%
sentence or so to you um
 
06:26:58.750 --> 06:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
18923 the State Board of Education is
 
06:27:01.070 --> 06:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
hereby directed to distribute copies of
 
06:27:03.948 --> 06:27:03.958 align:start position:0%
the State Constitution and election laws
 
06:27:06.230 --> 06:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
to to all teachers of history and Civics
 
06:27:08.468 --> 06:27:08.478 align:start position:0%
in the upper grades of elementary
 
06:27:11.270 --> 06:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
schools and to teachers of United States
 
06:27:13.468 --> 06:27:13.478 align:start position:0%
history and Junior and senior high
 
06:27:16.390 --> 06:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
schools um to be used in instructing
 
06:27:18.990 --> 06:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
their pupils relative to laws governing
 
06:27:20.468 --> 06:27:20.478 align:start position:0%
elections and
 
06:27:23.910 --> 06:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
voting um so I think this
 
06:27:26.910 --> 06:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
um puts it in the proper section of
 
06:27:30.468 --> 06:27:30.478 align:start position:0%
Statute and requires um information to
 
06:27:32.830 --> 06:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
be available to students which is
 
06:27:35.150 --> 06:27:35.160 align:start position:0%
basically I think what looking to have
 
06:27:39.990 --> 06:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
done in our schools uh Rel related to
 
06:27:42.430 --> 06:27:42.440 align:start position:0%
voting further discussion on that
 
06:27:44.788 --> 06:27:44.798 align:start position:0%
Amendment representative
 
06:27:47.270 --> 06:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
Hall I would just say that this
 
06:27:49.788 --> 06:27:49.798 align:start position:0%
amendment totally misses the intent of
 
06:27:52.030 --> 06:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1014 there's nothing about
 
06:27:54.270 --> 06:27:54.280 align:start position:0%
develop adopting policy it's about
 
06:27:56.948 --> 06:27:56.958 align:start position:0%
adding vote laws governing election and
 
06:27:58.990 --> 06:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
voting in a Civic
 
06:28:03.350 --> 06:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
Clause so thank you okay uh we've had
 
06:28:05.310 --> 06:28:05.320 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
06:28:19.628 --> 06:28:19.638 align:start position:0%
the the statutory reference to
 
06:28:22.030 --> 06:28:22.040 align:start position:0%
where I mean I I guess what I'm asking
 
06:28:29.310 --> 06:28:29.320 align:start position:0%

06:28:36.150 --> 06:28:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:39.510 --> 06:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
germanness and even even making a a
 
06:28:43.390 --> 06:28:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:45.868 --> 06:28:45.878 align:start position:0%
reference I could go ahead I think the
 
06:28:49.350 --> 06:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
original Bill amends 18911 and that's
 
06:28:50.910 --> 06:28:50.920 align:start position:0%
the same section the statute that we're
 
06:28:53.030 --> 06:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
in here this is
 
06:28:55.310 --> 06:28:55.320 align:start position:0%

06:29:22.310 --> 06:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
to the speaker working with the the
 
06:29:24.310 --> 06:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
clerk but I would say that from my
 
06:29:27.110 --> 06:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
perspective we've we've modified things
 
06:29:30.670 --> 06:29:30.680 align:start position:0%
18911 many times you know with Wellness
 
06:29:34.190 --> 06:29:34.200 align:start position:0%

10pr
 
06:30:37.350 --> 06:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
okay we're back to the primary motion of
 
06:30:41.548 --> 06:30:41.558 align:start position:0%
OTP on 1014 any further discussion
 
06:30:45.590 --> 06:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
represent dry thank you I want to say I
 
06:30:47.430 --> 06:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
do appreciate the distinction between
 
06:30:50.750 --> 06:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
writing a policy and doing an action but
 
06:30:53.868 --> 06:30:53.878 align:start position:0%
the problem with I have with this
 
06:30:56.350 --> 06:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
version of the original bill is it says
 
06:31:01.070 --> 06:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
policy shall include providing access to
 
06:31:03.270 --> 06:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
an assistance with filing registration
 
06:31:03.280 --> 06:31:07.110 align:start position:0%
an assistance with filing registration
applications

06:31:07.110 --> 06:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:10.430 --> 06:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
so when you are providing
 
06:31:15.628 --> 06:31:15.638 align:start position:0%
access to one group over any other group
 
06:31:17.990 --> 06:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
I think that that does not belong in
 
06:31:21.590 --> 06:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
statute because uh we just discussed
 
06:31:23.510 --> 06:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
this morning whether for example the
 
06:31:25.548 --> 06:31:25.558 align:start position:0%
public was invited if you have a
 
06:31:28.310 --> 06:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
registration at a high school and I
 
06:31:30.270 --> 06:31:30.280 align:start position:0%
think that there are a lot of other
 
06:31:33.070 --> 06:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
groups of people that would be
 
06:31:37.110 --> 06:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
interested in this kind of um
 
06:31:38.990 --> 06:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
accessibility uh however we're not
 
06:31:42.230 --> 06:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
putting any of those into statute and I
 
06:31:44.310 --> 06:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
don't want to concentrate on just one at
 
06:31:44.320 --> 06:31:45.430 align:start position:0%
don't want to concentrate on just one at
one

06:31:45.430 --> 06:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
one
 
06:31:48.750 --> 06:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
time represent
 
06:31:51.868 --> 06:31:51.878 align:start position:0%
Damon with respect to the last
 
06:31:55.270 --> 06:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
speaker we are not we're the education
 
06:31:58.430 --> 06:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
committee we're working on educating our
 
06:32:01.110 --> 06:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
students and this is an Endeavor to do
 
06:32:02.830 --> 06:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
that on one of the most important
 
06:32:05.830 --> 06:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
privileges of our Democratic civilized
 
06:32:08.270 --> 06:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
society this isn't about prohibiting
 
06:32:10.388 --> 06:32:10.398 align:start position:0%
anybody else from accessing registration
 
06:32:12.948 --> 06:32:12.958 align:start position:0%
to vote should people choose to bring
 
06:32:14.750 --> 06:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
that legislation forward next year I
 
06:32:17.388 --> 06:32:17.398 align:start position:0%
would be happy to vote for
 
06:32:20.868 --> 06:32:20.878 align:start position:0%
it further discussion representative pel
 
06:32:24.548 --> 06:32:24.558 align:start position:0%
thank you um because of all of the
 
06:32:27.030 --> 06:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
questions that we have about
 
06:32:29.590 --> 06:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
discrimination and registering students
 
06:32:31.830 --> 06:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
to vote in the high schools I think that
 
06:32:33.468 --> 06:32:33.478 align:start position:0%
this is a topic that would be better
 
06:32:36.430 --> 06:32:36.440 align:start position:0%
taken up by the election law committee
 
06:32:38.190 --> 06:32:38.200 align:start position:0%
and put into statue with the election
 
06:32:39.868 --> 06:32:39.878 align:start position:0%
law before the education committee
 
06:32:43.430 --> 06:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
adopts a policy regarding um the
 
06:32:46.948 --> 06:32:46.958 align:start position:0%
assistance of high school assisting high
 
06:32:50.030 --> 06:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
school students in registering to
 
06:32:52.110 --> 06:32:52.120 align:start position:0%
vote any further
 
06:32:54.670 --> 06:32:54.680 align:start position:0%
discussion yes represent
 
06:32:57.868 --> 06:32:57.878 align:start position:0%
Whit thank you chairman
 
06:33:00.670 --> 06:33:00.680 align:start position:0%
um I would disagree with my associate
 
06:33:04.070 --> 06:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
across the hall here um I think it's it
 
06:33:06.310 --> 06:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
should be because this is going to Local
 
06:33:08.670 --> 06:33:08.680 align:start position:0%
School boards to make their policy and
 
06:33:11.150 --> 06:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
as you guys representative dve Point um
 
06:33:12.910 --> 06:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
I understand what she's saying but
 
06:33:15.110 --> 06:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that excludes the local
 
06:33:18.510 --> 06:33:18.520 align:start position:0%
school board from saying under B that
 
06:33:20.350 --> 06:33:20.360 align:start position:0%
you can't there will be non- accept for
 
06:33:23.190 --> 06:33:23.200 align:start position:0%
special education allowed access so I
 
06:33:24.548 --> 06:33:24.558 align:start position:0%
think those that's the whole point of
 
06:33:26.468 --> 06:33:26.478 align:start position:0%
this it allows the school boys to make
 
06:33:28.830 --> 06:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
legitimate policy for each community
 
06:33:30.670 --> 06:33:30.680 align:start position:0%
that governs
 
06:33:30.680 --> 06:33:32.310 align:start position:0%
that governs
registration

06:33:32.310 --> 06:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
registration
 
06:33:35.388 --> 06:33:35.398 align:start position:0%
pres thank you Mr chair and for allowing
 
06:33:37.510 --> 06:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
me to speak on this um speaking as a
 
06:33:39.030 --> 06:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
parent of high school of a high school
 
06:33:40.750 --> 06:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
student and a recent high school
 
06:33:43.150 --> 06:33:43.160 align:start position:0%
graduate I think this bill is excellent
 
06:33:45.468 --> 06:33:45.478 align:start position:0%
in terms of providing information to
 
06:33:47.948 --> 06:33:47.958 align:start position:0%
students about how to do this this
 
06:33:50.030 --> 06:33:50.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that it's going to provide
 
06:33:52.350 --> 06:33:52.360 align:start position:0%
voter registration it says it'll provide
 
06:33:55.310 --> 06:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
information about how to vote to
 
06:33:57.788 --> 06:33:57.798 align:start position:0%
register to vote and that's a bipartisan
 
06:33:59.190 --> 06:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
process that we should be encouraging
 
06:34:01.190 --> 06:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
all of our students across the state
 
06:34:03.708 --> 06:34:03.718 align:start position:0%
regardless of political idology or any
 
06:34:05.310 --> 06:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
any other thing we want all of our
 
06:34:07.628 --> 06:34:07.638 align:start position:0%
students engaged in the voting process
 
06:34:09.388 --> 06:34:09.398 align:start position:0%
we also that way there's a much greater
 
06:34:10.910 --> 06:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
likelihood they'll choose to continue to
 
06:34:12.468 --> 06:34:12.478 align:start position:0%
stay voting in our state and stay
 
06:34:14.430 --> 06:34:14.440 align:start position:0%
involved in our system which will mean
 
06:34:15.350 --> 06:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
that we'll have more young people
 
06:34:17.948 --> 06:34:17.958 align:start position:0%
choosing to stay in the state and grow
 
06:34:21.948 --> 06:34:21.958 align:start position:0%
here representative uh H and then
 
06:34:23.468 --> 06:34:23.478 align:start position:0%
represent Al thank you Mr chair just in
 
06:34:25.350 --> 06:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
terms of discrimination I thought um
 
06:34:27.670 --> 06:34:27.680 align:start position:0%
secretary scandin this morning spoke
 
06:34:29.510 --> 06:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
rather clearly about discrimination and
 
06:34:31.110 --> 06:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
that and how to handle it and it wasn't
 
06:34:31.120 --> 06:34:32.628 align:start position:0%
that and how to handle it and it wasn't
a

06:34:32.628 --> 06:34:32.638 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:34:37.190 --> 06:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:40.230 --> 06:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
luus well there was a comment made the
 
06:34:43.430 --> 06:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
difference between um planning something
 
06:34:47.030 --> 06:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
and doing something and where it's just
 
06:34:47.040 --> 06:34:49.110 align:start position:0%
and doing something and where it's just
a

06:34:49.110 --> 06:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:34:51.910 --> 06:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
policy how many policies have we asked
 
06:34:55.070 --> 06:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
schools to come up with that don't exist
 
06:34:59.230 --> 06:34:59.240 align:start position:0%
um I much I much prefer the amendment
 
06:35:01.190 --> 06:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
that we put on
 
06:35:04.388 --> 06:35:04.398 align:start position:0%
that um actually does something thing
 
06:35:07.590 --> 06:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
and gets the gets the information and
 
06:35:09.510 --> 06:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
the instructions and everything out to
 
06:35:09.520 --> 06:35:10.270 align:start position:0%
the instructions and everything out to
the

06:35:10.270 --> 06:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:35:13.110 --> 06:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
kids further discussion yes
 
06:35:15.310 --> 06:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald thank you Mr
 
06:35:17.468 --> 06:35:17.478 align:start position:0%
chair and I concur with a lot of what
 
06:35:20.070 --> 06:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
representative D said and I believe the
 
06:35:22.110 --> 06:35:22.120 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State who spoke this
 
06:35:25.788 --> 06:35:25.798 align:start position:0%
morning corroborated a lot of that I do
 
06:35:27.510 --> 06:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
however think it is important to educate
 
06:35:29.468 --> 06:35:29.478 align:start position:0%
our students on the voting process and
 
06:35:33.030 --> 06:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
their obligations as Citizens and I'm in
 
06:35:34.990 --> 06:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
a large part disappointed that's not
 
06:35:38.388 --> 06:35:38.398 align:start position:0%
already occurring but I draw the line at
 
06:35:41.230 --> 06:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
assisting them filing registering to
 
06:35:44.270 --> 06:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
vote filing that form I go as far to say
 
06:35:47.590 --> 06:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
that that's election interference and I
 
06:35:49.230 --> 06:35:49.240 align:start position:0%
wish we could see a bipartisan
 
06:35:51.510 --> 06:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
compromise as representative Cel noted
 
06:35:53.310 --> 06:35:53.320 align:start position:0%
but nothing in the manner this bill was
 
06:35:55.310 --> 06:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
brought forward has been bipartisan
 
06:35:57.990 --> 06:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
we've had a few motions thus far and I
 
06:36:00.350 --> 06:36:00.360 align:start position:0%
think we agreed that we want to study
 
06:36:02.270 --> 06:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
this forward unfortunately that motion
 
06:36:05.230 --> 06:36:05.240 align:start position:0%
failed we also just had mment to find a
 
06:36:07.948 --> 06:36:07.958 align:start position:0%
bipartisan compromise that failed and I
 
06:36:10.468 --> 06:36:10.478 align:start position:0%
think it's sad but because there has
 
06:36:12.868 --> 06:36:12.878 align:start position:0%
been no compromise in the bill as is we
 
06:36:14.868 --> 06:36:14.878 align:start position:0%
have stated several concerns and no one
 
06:36:16.910 --> 06:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
seems to be willing to address them or
 
06:36:18.788 --> 06:36:18.798 align:start position:0%
to support the Amendments both sides
 
06:36:20.948 --> 06:36:20.958 align:start position:0%
we're not having that I cannot support
 
06:36:23.310 --> 06:36:23.320 align:start position:0%
this bill as is so thank
 
06:36:26.708 --> 06:36:26.718 align:start position:0%

first page on line 13 the screener and
 
06:39:31.750 --> 06:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
training on the use of the screener is
 
06:39:34.110 --> 06:39:34.120 align:start position:0%
added to that sentence
 
06:39:37.270 --> 06:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
um will be performed um by the
 
06:39:40.388 --> 06:39:40.398 align:start position:0%
department um over on page two in
 
06:39:43.948 --> 06:39:43.958 align:start position:0%
several places we change age appropriate
 
06:39:48.270 --> 06:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
to grade appropriate as was um on the
 
06:39:52.310 --> 06:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
first page um and also as uh suggested
 
06:39:56.030 --> 06:39:56.040 align:start position:0%

and 16
 
06:40:06.708 --> 06:40:06.718 align:start position:0%
the guid the uh department will provide
 
06:40:09.230 --> 06:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
guidance to the districts uh on
 
06:40:12.110 --> 06:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
instructional materials compliant with
 
06:40:15.388 --> 06:40:15.398 align:start position:0%
evidence-based instruction by

September um and that uh comes prior to
 
06:40:24.230 --> 06:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
their requirement on page one to

identify and
 
06:40:28.590 --> 06:40:28.600 align:start position:0%

five

06:40:47.070 --> 06:40:47.080 align:start position:0%
five
 
06:40:49.230 --> 06:40:49.240 align:start position:0%
um it just
 
06:40:52.590 --> 06:40:52.600 align:start position:0%
updates um in section 4 updates the
 
06:40:55.270 --> 06:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
current uh RSA
 
06:40:59.868 --> 06:40:59.878 align:start position:0%
259 um a dislexia and Related Disorders
 
06:41:01.270 --> 06:41:01.280 align:start position:0%

statute um new section is Section
Five

06:41:07.388 --> 06:41:07.398 align:start position:0%
Five
 
06:41:12.750 --> 06:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
um my goal here with this bill is
 
06:41:16.270 --> 06:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
comprehensive literacy um instruction
 
06:41:19.670 --> 06:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
with a state average of 50 52%
 
06:41:24.750 --> 06:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
proficient in um English in Reading um
 
06:41:29.468 --> 06:41:29.478 align:start position:0%
we need we need to do things um in a in
 
06:41:33.230 --> 06:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
a bold way and that includes uh the
 
06:41:36.468 --> 06:41:36.478 align:start position:0%
screening the interventions the parental
 
06:41:39.948 --> 06:41:39.958 align:start position:0%
involvement um it includes as we had in
 
06:41:42.670 --> 06:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
here I'm looking of teacher preparation
 
06:41:45.788 --> 06:41:45.798 align:start position:0%
programs where the the three New
 
06:41:47.830 --> 06:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire four New Hampshire
 
06:41:50.670 --> 06:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
schools um that were surveyed by the
 
06:41:53.510 --> 06:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
national teacher quality Council uh
 
06:41:56.788 --> 06:41:56.798 align:start position:0%
three out of the four got D's or FS we
 
06:41:59.670 --> 06:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
can't have that if we're going to bring
 
06:42:02.190 --> 06:42:02.200 align:start position:0%
teachers into the system who are not
 
06:42:05.150 --> 06:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
trained in the um
 
06:42:07.948 --> 06:42:07.958 align:start position:0%
evidence-based um instructional methods
 
06:42:09.830 --> 06:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
that are now recognized as helping
 
06:42:13.190 --> 06:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
students to read going hand inand with
 
06:42:15.150 --> 06:42:15.160 align:start position:0%
that we have many teachers who have been
 
06:42:18.430 --> 06:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
in the system for a number of years who
 
06:42:21.628 --> 06:42:21.638 align:start position:0%
maybe have not had that training the
 
06:42:24.510 --> 06:42:24.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Education has gone through
 
06:42:28.830 --> 06:42:28.840 align:start position:0%
um uh free training in the letters
 
06:42:32.230 --> 06:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
program for over 3,000 people teachers
 
06:42:33.990 --> 06:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
and parents in
 
06:42:37.948 --> 06:42:37.958 align:start position:0%
State this new section section five
 
06:42:40.990 --> 06:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
requires beginning in
 
06:42:45.030 --> 06:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
2028 teachers getting uh certification
 
06:42:49.708 --> 06:42:49.718 align:start position:0%
renewals and you can see um this um uh
 
06:42:53.868 --> 06:42:53.878 align:start position:0%
seven or eight uh types of uh Educators
 
06:42:57.430 --> 06:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
listed here that would have to undergo
 
06:43:01.030 --> 06:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
um an assessment test uh to demonstrate
 
06:43:03.510 --> 06:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
their ability to promote learning
 
06:43:06.190 --> 06:43:06.200 align:start position:0%
through the evidence-based instructional
 
06:43:09.190 --> 06:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
methods um I think that's very important
 
06:43:13.110 --> 06:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
as well um and then the last section six
 
06:43:14.230 --> 06:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
is an
 
06:43:16.548 --> 06:43:16.558 align:start position:0%
appropriation um to be made by the
 
06:43:17.750 --> 06:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
06:43:22.230 --> 06:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
Finance um for this um to assist the
 
06:43:26.190 --> 06:43:26.200 align:start position:0%
districts and also uh in um support of
 
06:43:28.670 --> 06:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
the uh reading Improvement Grants that
 
06:43:33.590 --> 06:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
are part of this bill um so you know
 
06:43:39.110 --> 06:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
tried to cover many bases on this to put
 
06:43:43.590 --> 06:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
forward an agenda to improve literacy um
 
06:43:46.270 --> 06:43:46.280 align:start position:0%
in the state and I think we can't
 
06:43:49.030 --> 06:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
isolate on just one section this year
 
06:43:50.788 --> 06:43:50.798 align:start position:0%
and another section next year and
 
06:43:52.788 --> 06:43:52.798 align:start position:0%
another section this year we have to
 
06:43:55.190 --> 06:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
have a comprehensive plan for moving
 
06:43:57.628 --> 06:43:57.638 align:start position:0%
forward and helping our kids learn to
 
06:43:59.990 --> 06:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
read Because if we don't you know what
 
06:44:01.990 --> 06:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
does it say for our future and our
 
06:44:04.910 --> 06:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
future Workforce in this state so thank
 
06:44:09.910 --> 06:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:12.948 --> 06:44:12.958 align:start position:0%
discussion not seeing any hands on that
 
06:44:15.990 --> 06:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh so we'll move forward and we have an

06:50:01.628 --> 06:50:01.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:01.638 --> 06:50:13.388 align:start position:0%
 
for

06:50:13.388 --> 06:50:13.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:17.270 --> 06:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
ready to go ahead now uh represent
 
06:50:20.468 --> 06:50:20.478 align:start position:0%
Bon okay um looking at the amendment um
 
06:50:23.230 --> 06:50:23.240 align:start position:0%
on line five it changes the starting
 
06:50:26.150 --> 06:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
date beginning July 1st
 
06:50:30.590 --> 06:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
2027 um it includes a lot of the um in
 
06:50:33.230 --> 06:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
section one um
 
06:50:36.548 --> 06:50:36.558 align:start position:0%
it includes the ads chartered schools
 
06:50:39.430 --> 06:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
which wasn't in the original um it
 
06:50:42.310 --> 06:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
continues along with the uh same
 
06:50:46.230 --> 06:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
language in section one and the changes
 
06:50:50.350 --> 06:50:50.360 align:start position:0%
it deletes uh section two uh which uh
 
06:50:52.190 --> 06:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
removes the specific directives
 
06:50:54.510 --> 06:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
regarding tier 2 referrals and
 
06:50:56.230 --> 06:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
interventions um this was a
 
06:50:57.868 --> 06:50:57.878 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort between
 
06:50:59.628 --> 06:50:59.638 align:start position:0%
representative ball and representative
 
06:51:02.030 --> 06:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
cascaden and it keeps to the intent of
 
06:51:03.270 --> 06:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
the original
 
06:51:06.310 --> 06:51:06.320 align:start position:0%
bill um uh the five components of
 
06:51:08.670 --> 06:51:08.680 align:start position:0%
reading is scientifically based reading
 
06:51:11.310 --> 06:51:11.320 align:start position:0%
research by the national reading panel
 
06:51:13.708 --> 06:51:13.718 align:start position:0%
University of Oregon and Washington
 
06:51:16.270 --> 06:51:16.280 align:start position:0%
State all schools currently teach
 
06:51:18.310 --> 06:51:18.320 align:start position:0%
reading and this amendment allows for
 
06:51:20.350 --> 06:51:20.360 align:start position:0%
professional development materials and
 
06:51:22.750 --> 06:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
teacher teacher preparation
 
06:51:25.868 --> 06:51:25.878 align:start position:0%
programs uh uh there is no political
 
06:51:28.830 --> 06:51:28.840 align:start position:0%
language roric or Playbook language nor
 
06:51:31.548 --> 06:51:31.558 align:start position:0%
does does this bill promote any specific
 
06:51:34.270 --> 06:51:34.280 align:start position:0%
Theory or program
 
06:51:36.868 --> 06:51:36.878 align:start position:0%
um this would this bill would allow
 
06:51:39.750 --> 06:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
individual districts to make uh their
 
06:51:42.868 --> 06:51:42.878 align:start position:0%
own decisions on curriculum and
 
06:51:46.868 --> 06:51:46.878 align:start position:0%
materials and uh um just stating more
 
06:51:50.150 --> 06:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
that uh the passing this amendment to
 
06:51:52.788 --> 06:51:52.798 align:start position:0%
the bill would provide continuity and
 
06:51:55.750 --> 06:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
consistency in teaching
 
06:51:58.110 --> 06:51:58.120 align:start position:0%
reading further discussion
 
06:52:02.388 --> 06:52:02.398 align:start position:0%
representative of uh cordelli thank you
 
06:52:06.110 --> 06:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
uh um just to follow on that um uh I
 
06:52:07.750 --> 06:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
don't think the previous amendment that
 
06:52:10.750 --> 06:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
we discussed um dictates any particular
 
06:52:13.310 --> 06:52:13.320 align:start position:0%
curriculum it calls on the department to
 
06:52:15.868 --> 06:52:15.878 align:start position:0%
provide to provide guidance to districts
 
06:52:19.670 --> 06:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
on um instructional materials and um I'm
 
06:52:21.590 --> 06:52:21.600 align:start position:0%
not sure what the reference to political
 
06:52:23.708 --> 06:52:23.718 align:start position:0%
language was um but I don't believe
 
06:52:26.030 --> 06:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
there was any political language um in
 
06:52:29.350 --> 06:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
anything that I've proposed is
 
06:52:32.868 --> 06:52:32.878 align:start position:0%
either brother disc represent miler
 
06:52:35.708 --> 06:52:35.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'd like to thank uh
 
06:52:37.388 --> 06:52:37.398 align:start position:0%
both representative cascaden and
 
06:52:40.030 --> 06:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
representative ball for attempting to
 
06:52:41.548 --> 06:52:41.558 align:start position:0%
bring bring this
 
06:52:43.788 --> 06:52:43.798 align:start position:0%
bipartisan uh amendment to this
 
06:52:45.788 --> 06:52:45.798 align:start position:0%
committee and I think they should
 
06:52:48.190 --> 06:52:48.200 align:start position:0%
they've done a good job in trying to
 
06:52:52.548 --> 06:52:52.558 align:start position:0%
work together uh as a Republican and a
 
06:52:55.110 --> 06:52:55.120 align:start position:0%
Democrat and trying to address this
 
06:52:57.868 --> 06:52:57.878 align:start position:0%
issue they should I thank them for doing
 
06:53:00.190 --> 06:53:00.200 align:start position:0%
that further discussion representative
 
06:53:03.670 --> 06:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
cordelli thank you I I
 
06:53:07.590 --> 06:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
the the first sentence first few words
 
06:53:10.750 --> 06:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
prevent pres prevent present a huge
 
06:53:12.750 --> 06:53:12.760 align:start position:0%
problem to me we're kicking the can down
 
06:53:17.388 --> 06:53:17.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:20.468 --> 06:53:20.478 align:start position:0%
years um I'd also point out I'm
 
06:53:25.910 --> 06:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
sorry in line seven um this um uh
 
06:53:28.948 --> 06:53:28.958 align:start position:0%
provides um for all students through
 
06:53:32.070 --> 06:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
grade five which I think um is not
 
06:53:36.230 --> 06:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
necess either um uh I think it was Dr
 
06:53:39.030 --> 06:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
Carol Tolman who was the co co-author of
 
06:53:43.150 --> 06:53:43.160 align:start position:0%
the letters program um who said that um
 
06:53:47.750 --> 06:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
in K through three we teach children to
 
06:53:50.910 --> 06:53:50.920 align:start position:0%
re we uh teach children to read in
 
06:53:54.548 --> 06:53:54.558 align:start position:0%
grades four and five they read to
 
06:53:57.510 --> 06:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
learn I think that the emphasis needs to
 
06:54:00.430 --> 06:54:00.440 align:start position:0%
be on grades uh K through
 
06:54:05.548 --> 06:54:05.558 align:start position:0%
three um and if we Pro get them up to uh
 
06:54:08.468 --> 06:54:08.478 align:start position:0%
proficiency levels in K grades K through
 
06:54:12.868 --> 06:54:12.878 align:start position:0%
three we will be saving money um as um
 
06:54:17.430 --> 06:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
local districts and as a state uh later
 
06:54:20.030 --> 06:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
on further discussion representative
 
06:54:25.030 --> 06:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
Terry you Mr chairman uh line three
 
06:54:28.548 --> 06:54:28.558 align:start position:0%
specifies literacy skill development
 
06:54:31.310 --> 06:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
with emphasis on literacy
 
06:54:35.548 --> 06:54:35.558 align:start position:0%
literacy then if we come down to
 
06:54:40.230 --> 06:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
line um lines five and
 
06:54:42.788 --> 06:54:42.798 align:start position:0%
following and we picked this up at the
 
06:54:45.990 --> 06:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
end of line six instruction in Literacy
 
06:54:49.110 --> 06:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
for all students through grade five
 
06:54:51.350 --> 06:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
including and now we have a
 
06:54:54.270 --> 06:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
colon so all that
 
06:54:56.590 --> 06:54:56.600 align:start position:0%
follows we come to
 
06:54:56.600 --> 06:54:58.548 align:start position:0%
follows we come to
line

06:54:58.548 --> 06:54:58.558 align:start position:0%
line
 
06:55:02.948 --> 06:55:02.958 align:start position:0%
10 and the word mathematics is in
 
06:55:06.110 --> 06:55:06.120 align:start position:0%
included and Mathematics reasoning and
 
06:55:08.070 --> 06:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
Mathematics calculation including
 
06:55:11.708 --> 06:55:11.718 align:start position:0%
fluency can someone um explain to me how
 
06:55:13.670 --> 06:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
mathematics reasoning and Mathematics
 
06:55:15.670 --> 06:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
calculation including fluency falls
 
06:55:20.628 --> 06:55:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:24.270 --> 06:55:24.280 align:start position:0%
development thank you representative Bon
 
06:55:26.468 --> 06:55:26.478 align:start position:0%
that that actually was um in the
 
06:55:28.910 --> 06:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
original that was presented um so it
 
06:55:28.920 --> 06:55:30.910 align:start position:0%
original that was presented um so it
wasn't

06:55:30.910 --> 06:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
06:55:33.350 --> 06:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
changed follow
 
06:55:33.360 --> 06:55:35.110 align:start position:0%
changed follow
yes

06:55:35.110 --> 06:55:35.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:55:38.510 --> 06:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
so so are you suggesting that because
 
06:55:40.350 --> 06:55:40.360 align:start position:0%
it's there it should stay there even
 
06:55:45.270 --> 06:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:48.830 --> 06:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
there I believe when represent B was
 
06:55:50.948 --> 06:55:50.958 align:start position:0%
here she explained the reasoning for
 
06:55:54.788 --> 06:55:54.798 align:start position:0%
that um I don't have the you know exact
 
06:55:56.948 --> 06:55:56.958 align:start position:0%
language that she used um but she felt
 
06:55:59.788 --> 06:55:59.798 align:start position:0%
it was very important she talked about
 
06:56:02.788 --> 06:56:02.798 align:start position:0%
um uh the the mathematics reasoning
 
06:56:05.388 --> 06:56:05.398 align:start position:0%
which would have to be having to read to
 
06:56:07.750 --> 06:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
understand the mathematics problems and
 
06:56:11.230 --> 06:56:11.240 align:start position:0%
I believe she tied in uh the M the
 
06:56:14.350 --> 06:56:14.360 align:start position:0%
mathematics fluency to
 
06:56:16.510 --> 06:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
that further
 
06:56:19.788 --> 06:56:19.798 align:start position:0%
discussion re SEL uh just just to
 
06:56:21.868 --> 06:56:21.878 align:start position:0%
clarify as a former Elementary School
 
06:56:24.750 --> 06:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
teacher um reading in mathematics skill
 
06:56:26.590 --> 06:56:26.600 align:start position:0%
is very different than reading like a
 
06:56:28.830 --> 06:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
story it's a different type of reading
 
06:56:32.388 --> 06:56:32.398 align:start position:0%
skill and so fluency in it um is demon
 
06:56:34.388 --> 06:56:34.398 align:start position:0%
at differently so learning to read word
 
06:56:36.590 --> 06:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
problems for example or learning to read
 
06:56:38.270 --> 06:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
even just the numbers across the page
 
06:56:40.910 --> 06:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
and sequence is a specific skill that's
 
06:56:42.788 --> 06:56:42.798 align:start position:0%
a different type of reading fluency than
 
06:56:45.270 --> 06:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
reading words further discussion
 
06:56:47.230 --> 06:56:47.240 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald Mr chair may
 
06:56:50.270 --> 06:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
call a caucus please yes you may thank
 
06:56:52.910 --> 06:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
you haven't had one in a
 
06:57:01.150 --> 06:57:01.160 align:start position:0%

07:42:51.110 --> 07:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um Mr chair I I'd
 
07:42:54.110 --> 07:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
like to speak to the itl the itl for
 
07:42:57.590 --> 07:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
this particular Bill uh dealing with
 
07:43:00.388 --> 07:43:00.398 align:start position:0%
the uh qualifications for the commission
 
07:43:02.830 --> 07:43:02.840 align:start position:0%
of Education I believe are strongly
 
07:43:05.430 --> 07:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
should be those possessed by the
 
07:43:06.868 --> 07:43:06.878 align:start position:0%
governor and
 
07:43:10.510 --> 07:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
Council and in looking at this uh when
 
07:43:12.830 --> 07:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
we're talking about having to have a
 
07:43:14.350 --> 07:43:14.360 align:start position:0%
degree from the accredited college
 
07:43:16.830 --> 07:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
University be certified as a teacher
 
07:43:18.510 --> 07:43:18.520 align:start position:0%
have at least five years combined
 
07:43:20.788 --> 07:43:20.798 align:start position:0%
experience in teaching or Administration
 
07:43:23.708 --> 07:43:23.718 align:start position:0%
in a public school I look back over some
 
07:43:25.670 --> 07:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
of the Commissioners and I did that
 
07:43:28.548 --> 07:43:28.558 align:start position:0%
we've had Commissioners here that have
 
07:43:31.830 --> 07:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
not had had these qualifications in
 
07:43:36.350 --> 07:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
place and so I I I feel that it's we're
 
07:43:39.308 --> 07:43:39.318 align:start position:0%
looking for a person that comes in with
 
07:43:41.190 --> 07:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
the skill and knowledge to be able to
 
07:43:43.150 --> 07:43:43.160 align:start position:0%
handle that and I'm not always convinced
 
07:43:45.948 --> 07:43:45.958 align:start position:0%
that certification is the answer to that
 
07:43:49.510 --> 07:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
um I look at uh the current commissioner
 
07:43:53.150 --> 07:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
who is just recently appointed to the uh
 
07:43:55.230 --> 07:43:55.240 align:start position:0%
Council for chief School administrators
 
07:43:57.948 --> 07:43:57.958 align:start position:0%
in the country and there's got to be a
 
07:43:59.830 --> 07:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
reason for that
 
07:44:02.910 --> 07:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
um and you know and we've had other
 
07:44:05.150 --> 07:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that you know I I go back
 
07:44:07.110 --> 07:44:07.120 align:start position:0%
to the most recent commissioner prior to
 
07:44:10.388 --> 07:44:10.398 align:start position:0%
the one we have and everybody brings in
 
07:44:12.750 --> 07:44:12.760 align:start position:0%
their gifts and their qualifications and
 
07:44:15.670 --> 07:44:15.680 align:start position:0%
it's based upon the school board making
 
07:44:18.468 --> 07:44:18.478 align:start position:0%
that decision state board making that
 
07:44:21.670 --> 07:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
decision with governor and councel and I
 
07:44:23.270 --> 07:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
think the state's done a pretty good job
 
07:44:25.948 --> 07:44:25.958 align:start position:0%
on of it so I would prefer to leave this
 
07:44:29.190 --> 07:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
the way it is and to leave that respons
 
07:44:31.750 --> 07:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
ility identifying the duties and the
 
07:44:33.830 --> 07:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of course we do that
 
07:44:35.830 --> 07:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
but in terms of what we're looking for
 
07:44:37.868 --> 07:44:37.878 align:start position:0%
what's qualifying an individual take on
 
07:44:40.308 --> 07:44:40.318 align:start position:0%
this responsibility leave it to the
 
07:44:42.350 --> 07:44:42.360 align:start position:0%
executive branch thank
 
07:44:46.308 --> 07:44:46.318 align:start position:0%
you uh the seconder would you like to
 
07:44:48.990 --> 07:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
comment I I think
 
07:44:52.030 --> 07:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
um no because there's yes I have
 
07:44:54.990 --> 07:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
comments but okay U represent
 
07:44:59.070 --> 07:44:59.080 align:start position:0%
SEL thank you and um so respectfully I
 
07:45:01.230 --> 07:45:01.240 align:start position:0%
disagree I feel as though in order to
 
07:45:02.990 --> 07:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
have someone who truly is excellent at
 
07:45:04.548 --> 07:45:04.558 align:start position:0%
doing their job they need to have
 
07:45:06.590 --> 07:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
experience they need to have training
 
07:45:09.150 --> 07:45:09.160 align:start position:0%
they need to have firsthand knowledge of
 
07:45:11.548 --> 07:45:11.558 align:start position:0%
what's happening I know that my own
 
07:45:14.150 --> 07:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
growth as a teacher um and my
 
07:45:15.308 --> 07:45:15.318 align:start position:0%
understanding of the different dynamics
 
07:45:17.230 --> 07:45:17.240 align:start position:0%
that my students faced came over the
 
07:45:19.590 --> 07:45:19.600 align:start position:0%
years that I had in the classroom from
 
07:45:20.628 --> 07:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
understanding the challenges homeless
 
07:45:22.030 --> 07:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
students had from understanding the
 
07:45:24.070 --> 07:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
challenges students with disabilities
 
07:45:26.030 --> 07:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
had and how to navigate all of the
 
07:45:27.350 --> 07:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
different aspects of a school system
 
07:45:28.670 --> 07:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
including how to use budgeting and how
 
07:45:30.990 --> 07:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
to use resources came from having that
 
07:45:32.990 --> 07:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
firsthand knowledge I think that someone
 
07:45:35.190 --> 07:45:35.200 align:start position:0%
who's never had any experience within a
 
07:45:37.388 --> 07:45:37.398 align:start position:0%
public school can't really speak to what
 
07:45:39.070 --> 07:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
it's like in a public school can't speak
 
07:45:41.190 --> 07:45:41.200 align:start position:0%
to what Public Schools needs and as this
 
07:45:43.350 --> 07:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
role is really essentially the chief
 
07:45:45.590 --> 07:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
executive for all public schools who
 
07:45:47.308 --> 07:45:47.318 align:start position:0%
should be focused on supporting all
 
07:45:48.948 --> 07:45:48.958 align:start position:0%
public schools they ought to have
 
07:45:50.708 --> 07:45:50.718 align:start position:0%
experience and training relevant to
 
07:45:50.718 --> 07:45:55.388 align:start position:0%
experience and training relevant to
public

07:45:55.388 --> 07:45:55.398 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:00.750 --> 07:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
schools go further discussion
 
07:46:02.548 --> 07:46:02.558 align:start position:0%
not seeing any further yes represent
 
07:46:05.468 --> 07:46:05.478 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh I would just say um if we're
 
07:46:08.868 --> 07:46:08.878 align:start position:0%
looking for a chief sorry thank you um
 
07:46:10.670 --> 07:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
if we're looking for a chief executive
 
07:46:14.590 --> 07:46:14.600 align:start position:0%
officer um I certainly would um be uh
 
07:46:17.990 --> 07:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
more interested in um uh an experienced
 
07:46:20.708 --> 07:46:20.718 align:start position:0%
business person um who understand
 
07:46:25.070 --> 07:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
budgeting Etc um than um maybe someone
 
07:46:28.308 --> 07:46:28.318 align:start position:0%
who had been a classroom teacher um who
 
07:46:30.948 --> 07:46:30.958 align:start position:0%
did not have that kind of
 
07:46:34.110 --> 07:46:34.120 align:start position:0%
experience further
 
07:46:37.030 --> 07:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
discussion represent I I would just
 
07:46:39.150 --> 07:46:39.160 align:start position:0%
counter that having budgeting experience
 
07:46:42.150 --> 07:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
is excellent but it is only one very
 
07:46:44.270 --> 07:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
small percentage of what's essential for
 
07:46:45.708 --> 07:46:45.718 align:start position:0%
understanding how school systems work
 
07:46:45.718 --> 07:46:46.990 align:start position:0%
understanding how school systems work
further

07:46:46.990 --> 07:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
further
 
07:46:51.628 --> 07:46:51.638 align:start position:0%
 
07:46:54.670 --> 07:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
leus people from the system are not
 
07:46:58.150 --> 07:46:58.160 align:start position:0%
going to change the system and right now
 
07:46:59.990 --> 07:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
given the
 
07:47:02.430 --> 07:47:02.440 align:start position:0%
uh results that we're seeing our system
 
07:47:06.510 --> 07:47:06.520 align:start position:0%
needs a change therefore we need a point
 
07:47:09.948 --> 07:47:09.958 align:start position:0%
of view fresh from outside of the system
 
07:47:13.110 --> 07:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
and the other part of that is we had a
 
07:47:15.110 --> 07:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
parent talk about
 
07:47:18.510 --> 07:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
how um the whole school was working to
 
07:47:21.430 --> 07:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
deal with her autistic child they were
 
07:47:23.030 --> 07:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
all trained in
 
07:47:25.788 --> 07:47:25.798 align:start position:0%
education they did not were not able to
 
07:47:28.510 --> 07:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
deal with her child's autism and yet
 
07:47:31.030 --> 07:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
this same training which failed her son
 
07:47:33.788 --> 07:47:33.798 align:start position:0%
is somehow going to help the
 
07:47:36.990 --> 07:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner F further discussion not
 
07:47:39.308 --> 07:47:39.318 align:start position:0%

OTP yeah I I will further discussion
 
07:48:37.070 --> 07:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I will speak to this I I think it's
 
07:48:40.190 --> 07:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
important I want to uh reiterate what
 
07:48:43.468 --> 07:48:43.478 align:start position:0%
rake said we need somebody that
 
07:48:45.788 --> 07:48:45.798 align:start position:0%
understands this and and believe me uh
 
07:48:47.468 --> 07:48:47.478 align:start position:0%
if if the statement is that you don't
 
07:48:49.230 --> 07:48:49.240 align:start position:0%
think that people who are in the system
 
07:48:51.190 --> 07:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
can be Innovative you're absolutely
 
07:48:55.590 --> 07:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
wrong uh prior I've been with uh several
 
07:48:57.830 --> 07:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh commissioners of Education while I've
 
07:48:59.468 --> 07:48:59.478 align:start position:0%
been on this committee
 
07:49:02.308 --> 07:49:02.318 align:start position:0%
and frankly uh the former commissioner
 
07:49:05.670 --> 07:49:05.680 align:start position:0%
for example Jenny Barry was very uh
 
07:49:08.708 --> 07:49:08.718 align:start position:0%
Innovative in fact uh our state was a
 
07:49:11.830 --> 07:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
model for every other state in the work
 
07:49:14.350 --> 07:49:14.360 align:start position:0%
that she and Paul leather did so don't
 
07:49:17.430 --> 07:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
tell me that uh incumbent Educators
 
07:49:20.230 --> 07:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
aren't uh aren't creative and aren't uh
 
07:49:22.548 --> 07:49:22.558 align:start position:0%
create aren't Innovative because they in
 
07:49:24.910 --> 07:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
fact they are and I think the elements
 
07:49:27.190 --> 07:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
that are in in this particular Bill do
 
07:49:29.830 --> 07:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
site uh what the qualifications ought to
 
07:49:32.670 --> 07:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
be and uh frankly I believe they're
 
07:49:35.670 --> 07:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
missing at this point in time in our
 
07:49:37.788 --> 07:49:37.798 align:start position:0%

07:52:53.830 --> 07:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
also a basically saying that that the um
 
07:52:56.548 --> 07:52:56.558 align:start position:0%
the department would refuse to cooperate
 
07:53:00.230 --> 07:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
and refuse to allow access to um to
 
07:53:02.388 --> 07:53:02.398 align:start position:0%
