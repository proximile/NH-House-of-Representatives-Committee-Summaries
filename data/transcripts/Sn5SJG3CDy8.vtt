asking that members who are using
 
00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 align:start position:0%

use the keyboard for taking notes

clearly with some volume
 
00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 align:start position:0%
soft voices may be heard but hard to
 
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
understand and microphones in rooms pick
 
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
up sound very well be careful about
 
00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 align:start position:0%

representative ward okay
 
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:16.560 align:start position:0%

we have um ian president madam chairman
 
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
and it looks like uh former president
 
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
george w bush might be in the room with
 
00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
representative sweeney can we check on
 
00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:30.830 align:start position:0%
representative sweeney can we check on
that

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:34.629 align:start position:0%
that
[Laughter]

00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
i don't even want to ask who some
 
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
what similar people might be with
 
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
members of the committee today so there
 
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
yeah let's not go down this path folks
 
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
um so i
 
00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
i want to thank you all for
 
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
noticed this for a work session
 
00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
primarily because we have experienced
 
00:08:07.589 --> 00:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
at least for my memory in election law
 
00:08:07.599 --> 00:08:08.230 align:start position:0%
at least for my memory in election law
that

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
are an introduction to omnibus bills
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
and when we got to
 
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
an executive session i wanted the
 
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
committee to have
 
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
some direction on how to address them
 
00:08:22.479 --> 00:08:23.830 align:start position:0%
some direction on how to address them
because

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
i have no ice bills are going um
 
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
i have my own opinion on where they
 
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
should go
 
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
but that is not going to affect how the
 
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
committee goes forward
 
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
um and if people feel strongly that one
 
00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039 align:start position:0%
section of the bill should
 
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
survive so to speak with amendment i
 
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that the committee has
 
00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
the ability to preserve
 
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
that piece of the omnibus bill
 
00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
and not have it be subject to what else
 
00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
might be going on
 
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
in the rest of the bill um so that was
 
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
really the focus of it i want to thank
 
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
attorney bergeron for an attorney hamlet
 
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
for doing an amendment uh to a section
 
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
before today but the other thing is is
 
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
if it appears
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
that people want to do amendments they
 
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.190 align:start position:0%
that people want to do amendments they
can

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%
and i'm getting noticed that my internet
 
00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519 align:start position:0%
connection is unstable so we are going
 
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
to move
 
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
right along the first bill
 
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
we have is s31 that was relative to
 
00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
voter checklist and modifying
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballot affidavit
 
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
we had a public hearing on this bill on
 
00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:38.590 align:start position:0%
we had a public hearing on this bill on
march

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
march
 
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
31st and it
 
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
modifies the actions
 
00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:48.959 align:start position:0%
of supervisors i think really as
 
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
compared to the secretary of state
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
um and so it sort of eliminated
 
00:09:58.870 --> 00:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
language in the process saying it was on
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
the envelope and in the affidavit why
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
did we need it to
 
00:10:06.069 --> 00:10:06.079 align:start position:0%
um and that's sort of my general
 
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
overview of what this bill did
 
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
i have a couple of sections um
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
noted where people had specific
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
questions so i guess i would just like
 
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
to open this up
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
to committee members to see if they had
 
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
any particular comments or
 
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
or things about this bill that they
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:41.509 --> 00:10:41.519 align:start position:0%
yes madam chairman um
 
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
heywood wants to say something thank you
 
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
representative haywood go ahead
 
00:10:53.509 --> 00:10:53.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
there is uh 112
 
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:00.800 align:start position:0%
through 14. an attempt to
 
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
try and bring
 
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
the emergency orders into
 
00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:16.069 --> 00:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
in the uh current law the first part of
 
00:11:18.069 --> 00:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
line 12 why am i able to vote a person
 
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
with a disability
 
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
is actually not new that is that
 
00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be highlighted
 
00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
that is what it says in our senate it's
 
00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:30.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
representative hayward are we on hb
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
third sb31
 
00:11:39.269 --> 00:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
yes h3
 
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i was on the wrong page
 
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you my internet was bad
 
00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
sorry go ahead i would uh
 
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
suggest that we strike
 
00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
from the second sentence in that line
 
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
the disability includes medical
 
00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:08.470 align:start position:0%
the disability includes medical
conditions

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
i would agree with that that would be an
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
amendment that would get
 
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
so if you wanted to bring that forward
 
00:12:16.389 --> 00:12:16.399 align:start position:0%
that would come come as an amendment to
 
00:12:16.399 --> 00:12:18.310 align:start position:0%
that would come come as an amendment to
sb31

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
sb31
 
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
all right anybody else have any
 
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
comps on sb 31 or questions in regards
 
00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
to the impact or what it was trying to
 
00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.430 align:start position:0%
to the impact or what it was trying to
do

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
madam chair oh i'm sorry representative
 
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
bergeron you had your hand up thank you
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you and and it'll be quick in your
 
00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
introduction you had mentioned that
 
00:12:53.829 --> 00:12:53.839 align:start position:0%
some members of the committee had
 
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned why is certain language
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
appearing in two statutes
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
i happen to be the one that raised the
 
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
question on page one lines eight through
 
00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:02.550 align:start position:0%
question on page one lines eight through
ten

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
ten
 
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh why was that included in rsa 654
 
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
colon 45
 
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
addresses the same thing and frankly i
 
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
00:13:13.269 --> 00:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
a strong opinion one way or the other
 
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
whether that language is duplicated here
 
00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:16.959 align:start position:0%
as well or not so
 
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's really an issue in my
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
opinion on that section
 
00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
all right thank you i did have the note
 
00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:27.279 align:start position:0%
i didn't have your name on
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
i also had that somebody concluded it it
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
at least doesn't conflict with the other
 
00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
statute is that correct
 
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh that's correct and actually may
 
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:37.670 align:start position:0%
uh that's correct and actually may
clarify

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
00:13:40.389 --> 00:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
on line nine it says uh supervisors
 
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
shall enter the data
 
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
whereas rsa 654 colon 45
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
says that the voter registration form
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
shall include
 
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
the data so maybe in some ways it
 
00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
actually helps clarify
 
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
what the roles of the supervisor should
 
00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:01.269 align:start position:0%
what the roles of the supervisor should
be

00:14:01.269 --> 00:14:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
any comments on the introduction of uh
 
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
on line 22 page one
 
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
all right so as to s31
 
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
um i'm hearing the possibility of an
 
00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
amendment deleting a particular
 
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.590 align:start position:0%
amendment deleting a particular
provision

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
provision
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
um but in general not any other specific
 
00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:51.829 align:start position:0%
um but in general not any other specific
comments

00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
if anybody objects to that conclusion
 
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
all right we're going to move on to then
 
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.990 align:start position:0%
all right we're going to move on to then
sb46

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
sb46
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
sb46 is relative to the use of
 
00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.710 align:start position:0%
sb46 is relative to the use of
electronic

00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
electronic
 
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
poll books by cities and towns we had a
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
on this on march 31st
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
there was a fair amount of discussion on
 
00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
i'm not particularly sure i saw anything
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
in regards to
 
00:15:29.269 --> 00:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
changes but let me open it up to
 
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
committee members in regards to the
 
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
language on this bill and what it's
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
proposing to do
 
00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
um just to recap there's a trial program
 
00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.110 align:start position:0%
um just to recap there's a trial program
now

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
it's basically bringing it into the
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
ability to do it
 
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
um on a regular basis i heard somebody
 
00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:49.759 align:start position:0%
somebody in election
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
in the lob no i was getting ready to say
 
00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:54.949 align:start position:0%
in the lob no i was getting ready to say
something

00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
uh madame chair it's uh peter terrorism
 
00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
i um
 
00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
i got bumped off here i got represented
 
00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
yeah i got weakened in that too um i
 
00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:05.110 align:start position:0%
yeah i got weakened in that too um i
know

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
when we heard testimony on that part of
 
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
um the secretary of state's office was
 
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
concerned with the
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
with the time frame of implementing this
 
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
so that was there was some concerns
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
there from
 
00:16:23.749 --> 00:16:23.759 align:start position:0%
from from them they they don't disagree
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
with the uh concept but
 
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
felt that um it couldn't be done in the
 
00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:28.790 align:start position:0%
felt that um it couldn't be done in the
time

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
that uh would be stipulated in the in
 
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if i'm still there or
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
not because i'm definitely fading in and
 
00:16:43.509 --> 00:16:43.519 align:start position:0%
out here
 
00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
well i would just note that if there's
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
any consideration of change of the
 
00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0%
effective date the date of the repeal
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
should probably also be changed because
 
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
you would want the trial program to be
 
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
able to remain in effect for those
 
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:10.880 align:start position:0%
right and it could be it is
 
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm not suggesting that whether we
 
00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:14.390 align:start position:0%
and i'm not suggesting that whether we
um

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:15.919 align:start position:0%
i got mixed emotions about it quite
 
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
frankly we could either amend it or we
 
00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:18.309 align:start position:0%
frankly we could either amend it or we
could

00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
we could strike that section down and
 
00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:24.559 --> 00:17:28.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
i don't care i believe i heard
 
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
i believe i heard representative
 
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
taurosian uh refer to
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe i'm not again i i was got
 
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
bumped up it took me a while to get back
 
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
on what one way on then i thought we
 
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
46. all right yeah i'm not there was
 
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
some concern about the tap
 
00:18:01.029 --> 00:18:01.039 align:start position:0%
that's all right i'll periodically say
 
00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
what bill we're on because a couple of
 
00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:03.039 align:start position:0%
us have an
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
unstable problem i can't pull that one
 
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:06.390 align:start position:0%
unstable problem i can't pull that one
up

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
i have 83 and 89 here in paper but that
 
00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
i don't i can't
 
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh it knocked me off so i i don't have
 
00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
the uh have that bill in front of me
 
00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
um anybody care to give me a very short
 
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
that's all right then when we get to it
 
00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.029 align:start position:0%
that's all right then when we get to it
okay

00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
um i will just note that
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
we can make this effective right away
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
but from a municipal standpoint
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
the requirement is for the municipality
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
who wants to do this
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
procures the poll
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
book themselves um
 
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
the trial community was able to use
 
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
some on a trial basis with the vendor
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
but as far as going forward this is
 
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
going to be a municipal budget item
 
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
for communities i know in
 
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
towns and cities we are certainly past
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
the date
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
for budgets for this calendar year
 
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
so the impact would be on budgets for
 
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
next year i don't know exactly i think
 
00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
the city process is slightly different
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
than towns
 
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
um but just so people understand this is
 
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
clearly something that would have to be
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
budgeted by your
 
00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:27.669 align:start position:0%
budgeted by your
municipality

00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
so that will be a consideration in the
 
00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:34.870 align:start position:0%
so that will be a consideration in the
effect

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
airman i see that all right i see
 
00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.150 align:start position:0%
airman i see that all right i see
representative

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
yep i made madam chair
 
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative bergeron and
 
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.830 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative bergeron and
then

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:19:51.029 --> 00:19:51.039 align:start position:0%
deputy scanlon i would just uh
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
mention too that while it's true that
 
00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
the commun communities will need to come
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
up with the funding
 
00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
to purchase the poll books it is
 
00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:59.190 align:start position:0%
to purchase the poll books it is
optional

00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
optional
 
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
some of the larger communities the large
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
towns large cities
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
may embrace the idea some of the smaller
 
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
communities may not
 
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
but it's uh you know a bunch of
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
consideration that they
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for that reminder deputy
 
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
scanlon thank you madam chair i i just
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to add a little clarity
 
00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
um uh this office is fine with the time
 
00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.149 align:start position:0%
um uh this office is fine with the time
frame

00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
frame
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
in senate bill 46. uh
 
00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
representative perot mentioned senate
 
00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
bill 83 and he is correct
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
that that section of of that bill uh
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
we didn't be concerned about the
 
00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.070 align:start position:0%
we didn't be concerned about the
effectiveness

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
effectiveness
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.430 align:start position:0%
 
members

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
members
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any so we'll move
 
00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:09.919 align:start position:0%
on to sb 54.
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
this is relative to the absentee ballot
 
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
application for
 
00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:16.720 align:start position:0%

00:21:18.070 --> 00:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
that occurred
 
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
on march 31st and it's
 
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
a requirement that absentee
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
ballot applications include
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
some identity information
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%

00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
and new sections comment from committee
 
00:21:38.799 --> 00:21:41.990 align:start position:0%
and new sections comment from committee

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron well thank you
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
i polled the city clerks because i
 
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to find out how many city clerks
 
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
did not have access to the dmv database
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
because in a lot of the cities
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle registration is handled by
 
00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:01.919 align:start position:0%
tax collectors or finance directors
 
00:22:03.909 --> 00:22:03.919 align:start position:0%
nashville portsmouth manchester berlin
 
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
and rochester all said they don't have
 
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
access to dmv
 
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
information but the clerks in claremont
 
00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
and laconia also pointed out to me
 
00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
that while they process motor vehicle
 
00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.710 align:start position:0%
that while they process motor vehicle
registrations

00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
registrations
 
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
they don't have access to the driver's
 
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
license or non
 
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
driver's license id number so even those
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
communities that have access to a
 
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
dmv through their motor vehicle
 
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
registration process
 
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
don't have the means to verify
 
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
a voter's driver's license or
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
non-driver's picture id number
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
the other piece is that senator gray the
 
00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:40.789 align:start position:0%
the other piece is that senator gray the
sponsor

00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
talked about the possibility of maybe a
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
clerk verifying
 
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
a voter's identity using the vital
 
00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:48.640 align:start position:0%
records database
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
and there is a search fee involved with
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
that anytime the clerk logs in
 
00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
and does a search for a vital record the
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
state charges eight dollars for that
 
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:00.390 align:start position:0%
state charges eight dollars for that
search

00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
search
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
and that's passed on to the citizen
 
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
who's at the counter asking for
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
a birth certificate for example and it's
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
assessed whether or not the record is
 
00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:09.669 align:start position:0%
assessed whether or not the record is
found

00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
found
 
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
so if that were to be a means whereby
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
a clerk would have to verify a person's
 
00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.270 align:start position:0%
a clerk would have to verify a person's
identity

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
identity
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
then the voter registration database
 
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be amended
 
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
or revised or recoded so that
 
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
there's no fee associated with accessing
 
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
that that database
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to share that information
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:36.149 --> 00:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bergeron for
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
looking into that further for the
 
00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.230 align:start position:0%
looking into that further for the
committee

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
representative barry um actually i think
 
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron hit on the um
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
with this statement here on the point
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
that i agree with which is that if we do
 
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
implement something like this we can't
 
00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
create a new
 
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
burden on the towns um i'm not too
 
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
familiar with this database
 
00:23:57.029 --> 00:23:57.039 align:start position:0%
um to be to be upfront and how would
 
00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
they charge this eight dollar fee
 
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
um knowing kind of how databases work it
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
seems like it's
 
00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
probably not necessary for them to do
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
that here but that was a little beyond
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
my scope but
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
except representative bergeron kind of
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
all right so it sounds like that's
 
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
an issue and we'd need an amendment to
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
go to the vital records
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
regardless and i think you're right
 
00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
senator gray did mention that
 
00:24:34.149 --> 00:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
can i make a comment madam chair
 
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
sure representative derozan go ahead
 
00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
yeah uh and and i know that was when we
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
had testimony on that bill there was
 
00:24:41.669 --> 00:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
some concern about
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
how to make that work on the vital
 
00:24:45.909 --> 00:24:45.919 align:start position:0%
record and how valuable that would be
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
but certainly i like the concept of
 
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
bringing uh absentee ballot um
 
00:24:54.549 --> 00:24:54.559 align:start position:0%
you know identification more in line
 
00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
with what
 
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
what we do now at the polls currently
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
when you when you show up to vote in
 
00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.070 align:start position:0%
when you when you show up to vote in
person

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
um you have to for the most part you
 
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
have to show your driver's license or
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
or you know
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
some kind of proper identification
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
and i i heard firsthand from my town
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
clerks in the two towns i represent that
 
00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:15.909 align:start position:0%
clerks in the two towns i represent that
um

00:25:15.909 --> 00:25:15.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
with absentee balloting that was kind of
 
00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
it flew under the radar that you didn't
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
have to show
 
00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
um an id when you came in in person like
 
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
you do when you when you
 
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
vote in person so i like the idea of
 
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
bringing that
 
00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
into a more consistent um condition
 
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
um than we have now whether or not we
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
can achieve that with this bill
 
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
i guess we'll have to see but but i i
 
00:25:42.549 --> 00:25:42.559 align:start position:0%
like that aspect of it
 
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
madam chair are there comments i know
 
00:25:44.559 --> 00:25:46.470 align:start position:0%
madam chair are there comments i know
that

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:49.919 align:start position:0%
representative growing it could
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
could we also uh amend to
 
00:25:55.669 --> 00:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
allow the clerk's access to the dmv
 
00:25:55.679 --> 00:25:56.630 align:start position:0%
allow the clerk's access to the dmv
records

00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
records
 
00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
for purposes of of the absentee ballots
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
and voter checklist
 
00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
my guess is representative cody might
 
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
have more experience or representative
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
bergeron with this issue but my guess is
 
00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
and this is a guess at this point that
 
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
we would also need to
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
amend a statute relating to dmv
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
uh yes ma'am because we would be
 
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
allowing it on one end
 
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
but not authorizing dmv representative
 
00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.149 align:start position:0%
but not authorizing dmv representative
cody

00:26:34.149 --> 00:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
cody
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
i said i was confirming that you were
 
00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:37.269 align:start position:0%
i said i was confirming that you were
correct

00:26:37.269 --> 00:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
and i and there are other reasons that
 
00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
might not be advisable
 
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
okay i mean if
 
00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
if that's how somebody wants to do it
 
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
you're you're
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
you can do an amendment for that but i
 
00:26:59.430 --> 00:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
do think that
 
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
you would have dmv at this point saying
 
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
i don't have the authority to release it
 
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
and i and i don't know whether represent
 
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
whether senator gray's reference to
 
00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.510 align:start position:0%
whether senator gray's reference to
access

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
access
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
implied that and i note that the dmv
 
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
director is attending and
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
if or someone from that office is
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
attending and if they would
 
00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
like to speak
 
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
i would love i am going to uh
 
00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
certainly allow them to um
 
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
or if there's somebody who has any
 
00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
specific information on this if they
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
speak up we'd be welcome we'd be happy
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
to hear from them
 
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
good morning madam chair this is
 
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
elizabeth fielecki from the dmv
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
um i can i can shine
 
00:27:58.870 --> 00:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
me too i'm sorry and i was just thinking
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
this is sb 46 so um
 
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
i was just looking at um the bill
 
00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not familiar with we're actually
 
00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
director we're actually on
 
00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
sb 54. okay
 
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
let me look back at that um but i know
 
00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
that you're looking at
 
00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:20.559 align:start position:0%
access court access to dmv record you
 
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
are absolutely
 
00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:24.559 align:start position:0%
correct that we would probably adjust
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
the driver privacy act for that specific
 
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
um circumstance as well in addition we
 
00:28:32.789 --> 00:28:32.799 align:start position:0%
would really have to work to see how the
 
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
records would be shared as well um
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
because there is really not an
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
electronic exchange of records with
 
00:28:42.149 --> 00:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
the courts right now so there might be
 
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
some logistical challenges with that as
 
00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.350 align:start position:0%
some logistical challenges with that as
well

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to explore it farther but i
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
think you would have to look at the dpa
 
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
or the driver privacy act to provide
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
some specific exemptions for release of
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for joining us and
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
for that clarification
 
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else who wants to speak
 
00:29:15.669 --> 00:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
on this particular issue or the bill
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
we're on which is
 
00:29:19.909 --> 00:29:19.919 align:start position:0%
sb 54. and
 
00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
i see representative lane joins us good
 
00:29:22.399 --> 00:29:25.350 align:start position:0%
i see representative lane joins us good
morning

00:29:25.350 --> 00:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:50.389 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
all right the next bill that we have
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
before is from the senate as a committee
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
is sb 83 sb 83
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
is adoption of omnibus legislation
 
00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
relative to elections the public hearing
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
was april 23rd
 
00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:14.799 align:start position:0%
there are five sections to the bill
 
00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:18.440 align:start position:0%
clarifying the circumstances of
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
disqualification for performing duties
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
as an election official
 
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
relative to the establishment of an
 
00:30:27.909 --> 00:30:27.919 align:start position:0%
election information portal
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
the third section is relative to recount
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
fees the fourth section
 
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
is relative to statements filed by
 
00:30:36.389 --> 00:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
political candidates and
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
committees and the fifth one
 
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200 align:start position:0%
is providing for optional town meeting
 
00:30:46.549 --> 00:30:46.559 align:start position:0%
procedures i had some
 
00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:49.799 align:start position:0%
anticipation that this bill and
 
00:30:53.909 --> 00:30:53.919 align:start position:0%
89 might have very specific
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
um comments as to different parts and
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
because they're
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
not related this is really
 
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
one of the primary purposes of the work
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
session is to sort of figure out what
 
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
might be happening with these bills so
 
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
if we can i would like to proceed by
 
00:31:15.909 --> 00:31:15.919 align:start position:0%
part since they are so independent
 
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
so taking a look at sb 83
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
part 1 this has to do with sort of
 
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
a statute that apparently has had a few
 
00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:27.350 align:start position:0%
a statute that apparently has had a few
amendments

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
um in regards to who can actually handle
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
ballots and
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
the moderator seems to be the the word
 
00:31:36.149 --> 00:31:36.159 align:start position:0%
of import
 
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
in this particular section
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
representative trojan thank you madam
 
00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.549 align:start position:0%
representative trojan thank you madam
chair

00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:31:49.509 --> 00:31:49.519 align:start position:0%
i like the idea and concept because um
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
most of us in our districts are probably
 
00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
at one point or another had a moderator
 
00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:52.789 align:start position:0%
at one point or another had a moderator
who's

00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
who's
 
00:31:55.029 --> 00:31:55.039 align:start position:0%
also running for you know a state
 
00:31:55.039 --> 00:31:56.230 align:start position:0%
also running for you know a state
position

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
say you know a house seat and certainly
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
their ability to have and i know this
 
00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:03.750 align:start position:0%
their ability to have and i know this
this

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
bill doesn't address this portion it has
 
00:32:06.950 --> 00:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
to do with when they're counting
 
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
votes but um we have to follow very
 
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
specific rules on being so far
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
away from the voters when we're
 
00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
campaigning but if you're a moderator
 
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
you get to be right there in the thick
 
00:32:17.909 --> 00:32:17.919 align:start position:0%
of things so
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
i conceptually i like the idea however
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
there's a problem with this and we heard
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
that in testimony that
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
um the moderator has specific duties
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
that are outlined in the constant
 
00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:31.919 align:start position:0%
the constitution that would
 
00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:34.799 align:start position:0%
be a problem if we were past this part
 
00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
one because
 
00:32:39.029 --> 00:32:39.039 align:start position:0%
um i'm not so sure he can delegate this
 
00:32:39.039 --> 00:32:39.350 align:start position:0%
um i'm not so sure he can delegate this
would

00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
require him to delegate and i'm not so
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:44.799 align:start position:0%
that that is allowed under the way that
 
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
statue is written i'd be
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
interested to know what other people
 
00:32:51.909 --> 00:32:51.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:54.549 --> 00:32:54.559 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron i know you don't
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
have your hand up but i know
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
you're very familiar with this
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
this statue
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
and yeah you know i mentioned to some
 
00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
other members of the committee that have
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
been dealing with this issue for 48
 
00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.509 align:start position:0%
been dealing with this issue for 48
years

00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.519 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:16.399 align:start position:0%
um and we still haven't gotten involved
 
00:33:16.399 --> 00:33:17.750 align:start position:0%
um and we still haven't gotten involved
um

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
because i i was i won an election at
 
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:21.760 align:start position:0%
state rep 48 years ago in a
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
in a recount and immediately introduce
 
00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
legislation saying
 
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
no candidate could count ballots at the
 
00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
polling place regardless of their
 
00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.149 align:start position:0%
polling place regardless of their
positions

00:33:30.149 --> 00:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
um what i was looking at when i raised
 
00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:35.120 align:start position:0%
it is that
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
the second part article 32 of the
 
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
constitution says
 
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
that the procedure shall be governed by
 
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
a moderator who
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
that's their constitutional authority
 
00:33:52.149 --> 00:33:52.159 align:start position:0%
and directive
 
00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
i do think the moderator can apply an
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
assistant moderator to work in his stead
 
00:33:59.590 --> 00:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
one of the things that concerns me
 
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
though is
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
this law is also saying that they can't
 
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
be in the area designated for the
 
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
handling of marked ballots for the
 
00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
counting of votes which
 
00:34:10.470 --> 00:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
currently kind of means everything
 
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
within the guard rail
 
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
and so you're throwing the moderator
 
00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
outside of the guard rail
 
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
um during the counting and and you know
 
00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
the closing
 
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
the polls essentially and that's a
 
00:34:24.629 --> 00:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
concern i i don't know how to address it
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
um so i share some of the concerns of
 
00:34:27.359 --> 00:34:27.829 align:start position:0%
um so i share some of the concerns of
rep

00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
rep
 
00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative trojan um there is a
 
00:34:32.869 --> 00:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
there is some kind of conflict here
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
and how best to resolve it i frankly
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
representative barry um yes i actually
 
00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
had a
 
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
question of representative bergeron if
 
00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:47.599 align:start position:0%
he'd be willing to take one
 
00:34:49.589 --> 00:34:49.599 align:start position:0%
sure um you said that you've been
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
working on this problem
 
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
for a while and i i definitely see the
 
00:34:54.069 --> 00:34:54.079 align:start position:0%
problem i'm not it's
 
00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
it's not an easy uh an easy one i just
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
wanted you to go over
 
00:34:59.190 --> 00:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
kind of some of the solutions that have
 
00:35:01.109 --> 00:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
been proposed in the past
 
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not familiar with them so i just
 
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
kind of curious what
 
00:35:07.829 --> 00:35:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
the initial bill i introduced in 73 said
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
essentially that nobody could work at
 
00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
the polls who was a candidate on the
 
00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:15.670 align:start position:0%
the polls who was a candidate on the
ballot

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
that went to a study committee it came
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
out saying that
 
00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
over the years it's been changed senator
 
00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:26.230 align:start position:0%
over the years it's been changed senator
jasper

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
jasper
 
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
representative jasper introduced a bill
 
00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:29.599 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
the moderators and these election
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
officials could work at the polls
 
00:35:35.589 --> 00:35:35.599 align:start position:0%
provided they didn't count or handle
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
the challenge is that we as elected
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
officials want to make sure that
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
the public perceives the elections being
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
handled in a fair
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
impartial manner and when you have a
 
00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:55.190 align:start position:0%
impartial manner and when you have a
candidate

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
at the polling place counting his or her
 
00:35:59.430 --> 00:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
own ballots it becomes
 
00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.270 align:start position:0%
own ballots it becomes
[Music]

00:36:01.270 --> 00:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
well it becomes fodder for conspiracy
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
theories if you will
 
00:36:07.829 --> 00:36:07.839 align:start position:0%
um i thought it was a great idea in the
 
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
70s when i introduced it
 
00:36:11.430 --> 00:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
later on when when i became city clerk i
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
thought it was a terrible idea
 
00:36:15.109 --> 00:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
because we were excluding some of the
 
00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
most experienced people
 
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
uh from working at the polls in some
 
00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
very large elections
 
00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
and and i don't know what the solution
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
is here really
 
00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
right now we're at the point where the
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
only elected official who seems to be
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
allowed in that area
 
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
to handle and and count ballots is the
 
00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.910 align:start position:0%
to handle and and count ballots is the
moderator

00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
moderator
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
if we throw that person out um
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
i guess we have to make sure that it's
 
00:36:41.510 --> 00:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
clear that that person can appoint an
 
00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
assistant moderator
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
representative barry if you want to
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
continue go ahead yeah
 
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
just to kind of expand that i wasn't
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
even kind of thinking
 
00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:56.079 align:start position:0%
about the counting of ballots because
 
00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
admittedly my experience in voting in
 
00:36:59.349 --> 00:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is manchester where
 
00:36:59.359 --> 00:36:59.829 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is manchester where
there's

00:36:59.829 --> 00:36:59.839 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
you know about the um the poll location
 
00:37:03.349 --> 00:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
is extremely busy there's people
 
00:37:03.359 --> 00:37:03.910 align:start position:0%
is extremely busy there's people
everywhere

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
everywhere
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
right um it would be hard for somebody
 
00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
to do something nefarious i've never
 
00:37:07.119 --> 00:37:07.910 align:start position:0%
to do something nefarious i've never
really

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
really conceptualized that but i guess
 
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
in these smaller towns you're you're
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
right you know these are kind of
 
00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
lowercase fairs i've always
 
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
i've always had the thought about these
 
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
moderators working inside these polls
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
one of the things and this may already
 
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
be a law i'm not aware of it if it is
 
00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:20.630 align:start position:0%
be a law i'm not aware of it if it is
but

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
i've always been concerned that they're
 
00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
going to wear something like like a name
 
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
badge or something like that and they'll
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
be inside the guardrail helping people
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
vote and there's their name on a badge
 
00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:29.839 align:start position:0%
right there then the voter sees that and
 
00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
you know that's a last minute name
 
00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
recognition tick and it's a campaign
 
00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:33.270 align:start position:0%
recognition tick and it's a campaign
advantage

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
um so kind of kind of interesting the
 
00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
way you're going about this or the way
 
00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
you're thinking about it
 
00:37:38.790 --> 00:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
it's a new thought process for me so
 
00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.390 align:start position:0%
it's a new thought process for me so
thanks

00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
if i'm well thank you representative
 
00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:44.240 align:start position:0%
barry for that because i didn't even
 
00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:46.160 align:start position:0%
think about the name tag issue that
 
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
hadn't even crossed my mind
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
because most people in my town know each
 
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
other but you're right even the name tag
 
00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.390 align:start position:0%
other but you're right even the name tag
would

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
have some impact representative bergeron
 
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
yeah i would just add that even if the
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
moderator isn't
 
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
technically counting the ballots when
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
the accu vote machines are being used
 
00:38:06.310 --> 00:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
the moderator
 
00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:08.240 align:start position:0%
will get involved perhaps in the hand
 
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
count of ballots certainly the
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
processing of absentee ballots
 
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
and maybe maybe making rulings on the
 
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
intent of the voter in
 
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
in ballots that some of the election
 
00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
officials might have questions on when
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
tallying them
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
the name badge certainly is is a
 
00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.109 align:start position:0%
the name badge certainly is is a
consideration

00:38:25.109 --> 00:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
um and it's a
 
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
i don't have an answer i don't have an
 
00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:35.750 align:start position:0%
i don't have an answer i don't have an
answer

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
representative taurosian thank you madam
 
00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:39.190 align:start position:0%
representative taurosian thank you madam
chair

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:39.200 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
um and again it seems as though we
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
maybe don't have a clear solution
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
forward on this
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
but just to reiterate some of the
 
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
problems the um
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
you know you know in a town election
 
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
some um any selectmen that are up for
 
00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
re-election or
 
00:38:57.349 --> 00:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
or anybody that's running i would have
 
00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
to be up for re-election they're not
 
00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
allowed to
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
to um in our town i don't know if this
 
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
happens everywhere
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
to participate in in work or shift
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
during the polls
 
00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
when they were on the ballot so it seems
 
00:39:10.079 --> 00:39:10.950 align:start position:0%
when they were on the ballot so it seems
to

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
you know and then that's for a good
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
reason so it seems like we should carry
 
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:14.230 align:start position:0%
reason so it seems like we should carry
it

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
a step further with the moderator
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
however in my district in one of my
 
00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:18.790 align:start position:0%
however in my district in one of my
towns

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
both the moderator and the assistant
 
00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
moderator are both um
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
current state reps so but so if you said
 
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
okay the moderator can't do it well he
 
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
with a system moderator is also a wrap
 
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
so you know it's problematic i i too
 
00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
would like to find a way forward on this
 
00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:35.839 align:start position:0%
but i don't know that this
 
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
this part one of uh sb 83s is
 
00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
is the answer
 
00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
representative moorehead as i
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
as i listened to uh more experienced you
 
00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:50.320 align:start position:0%
know committee members discuss this i
 
00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:51.430 align:start position:0%
know committee members discuss this i
guess

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
guess
 
00:39:54.710 --> 00:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
my takeaway is that there's a benefit to
 
00:39:57.270 --> 00:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
excluding moderators
 
00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
it eliminates a conflict of interest it
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
eliminates an unfair advantage and maybe
 
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
most important it eliminates the
 
00:40:04.790 --> 00:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
perception of an unfair advantage
 
00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
but there's also a cost in that a lot of
 
00:40:07.359 --> 00:40:08.150 align:start position:0%
but there's also a cost in that a lot of
moderators

00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
moderators
 
00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
who also happen to be maybe candidates
 
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
for state rep
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
are among the most experienced election
 
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
officials that towns have
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
and and so we're just weighing this
 
00:40:19.589 --> 00:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
benefit in the cost and
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
and i'm trying to get my mind around you
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
know how big a cost that is
 
00:40:26.069 --> 00:40:26.079 align:start position:0%
and anyone who can speak to that you
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
know i'd be
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
grateful to hear from um you know are
 
00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
there a lot of state reps who are
 
00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:31.990 align:start position:0%
there a lot of state reps who are
moderators

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
moderators
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
are there a lot of towns that would
 
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
suffer if we disallowed
 
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
state rep slash moderators from
 
00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.069 align:start position:0%
state rep slash moderators from
participating

00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
participating
 
00:40:42.309 --> 00:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
in uh the administration of an election
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
how big is this cost
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
and i don't i know no one may be able to
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
answer it but i'm just that that's what
 
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
wrap my mind around as i'm weighing the
 
00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:53.839 align:start position:0%
cost and the benefit
 
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
i see that deputy scanlon is still
 
00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
online with us and i guess if
 
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
he would be willing i'd i'd like him to
 
00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.150 align:start position:0%
he would be willing i'd i'd like him to
answer

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
from as to your
 
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
office how often has
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
this issue been raised by members of the
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
public with concern
 
00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
madam chair every election we hear
 
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
from voters about uh
 
00:41:29.589 --> 00:41:29.599 align:start position:0%
uh local election officials working the
 
00:41:29.599 --> 00:41:30.710 align:start position:0%
uh local election officials working the
polls

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
polls
 
00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh sometimes when they're running for
 
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
the same office but certainly
 
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
when they're running for an office other
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
than an election official
 
00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:42.160 align:start position:0%
and uh you know i mean people feel
 
00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
different ways about that
 
00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
and um and there are perception
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
issues that are involved and you know
 
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
when we train local election officials
 
00:41:53.109 --> 00:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
we do everything we can to make them
 
00:41:53.119 --> 00:41:54.309 align:start position:0%
we do everything we can to make them
aware

00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
aware
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
of uh you know those potential uh
 
00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
perception issues that might be out
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
there while they're doing
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
their job um and as has been discussed
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
by the committee this has been
 
00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:09.280 align:start position:0%
a subject uh not just this year but
 
00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:11.359 align:start position:0%
you know as representative bergeron said
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
for decades
 
00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
and obviously there's been no resolution
 
00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
to you know how to
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
easily address the concerns
 
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
the one thought i guess i would convey
 
00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
is that these individuals
 
00:42:30.309 --> 00:42:30.319 align:start position:0%
that are serving as moderators or
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist that
 
00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
you know hold other positions and there
 
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
are a number of state reps
 
00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
that are also moderators currently
 
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
is that they are elected by the people
 
00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
in their
 
00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
town or in their ward and those
 
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
positions are usually ones
 
00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
that command respect um
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
the the the officials are chosen based
 
00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
on their
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
integrity and honesty and and
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
and the voters decision that they're
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
capable of doing the job
 
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:06.640 align:start position:0%
and and you know every example that i
 
00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
can think of
 
00:43:10.630 --> 00:43:10.640 align:start position:0%
that where a current state rep also
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
serves as a moderator
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
i think they're all excellent examples
 
00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
of individuals that are able to separate
 
00:43:19.829 --> 00:43:19.839 align:start position:0%
uh you know running for an office but
 
00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
also doing their job
 
00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
as an election official and and even
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
though there's
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
you know this issue comes up you know
 
00:43:28.079 --> 00:43:28.630 align:start position:0%
you know this issue comes up you know
every

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
every
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
every biennium uh we seem to get through
 
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
it and
 
00:43:34.069 --> 00:43:34.079 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not aware of any real
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
scandals that are out there
 
00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh that i can cite as examples of you
 
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
know this process going awry
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
because of conflicts beyond that you
 
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
know i i don't have any
 
00:43:48.069 --> 00:43:48.079 align:start position:0%
answers on you know how to cleanly
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
address this
 
00:43:53.349 --> 00:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative hamer do you have your
 
00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
or do i have my cursor over your screen
 
00:44:00.390 --> 00:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
i have
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
i think we understand the issue when
 
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
it's an issue representative
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
your head well i just would propose for
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
people to consider that if it really is
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
a vexing question
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
and it's been it's been dogging people
 
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
you know for 50 i i
 
00:44:28.309 --> 00:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
remember our esteemed colleague
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron for
 
00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
five decades you know maybe rather than
 
00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
pass the bill in its per current state
 
00:44:37.109 --> 00:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
we should um
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
we should take this little one part of
 
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
it and study it uh just a little bit
 
00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:41.190 align:start position:0%
it and study it uh just a little bit
longer

00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
longer
 
00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
and and get a sense of how many people
 
00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
are talking about how many times be
 
00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:45.910 align:start position:0%
are talking about how many times be
affected

00:44:45.910 --> 00:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
affected
 
00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
um and and and just get a more precise
 
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
understanding of
 
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
of what the effects of this would be for
 
00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
towns in the state
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure that's the right course
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
all right i just um thank you for
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
raising that because it brings up two
 
00:45:04.630 --> 00:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
points that are my understanding of
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with these omnivorous bills
 
00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
just so you know we cannot separate the
 
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
parts out
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
they remain in the final
 
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
vote on what will be sb
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
83 now amended by the senate
 
00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
possibly amended by the house so
 
00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
you're considering say part one is a
 
00:45:28.079 --> 00:45:28.790 align:start position:0%
you're considering say part one is a
study

00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
it needs to be contained an amendment
 
00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
within the bill
 
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
and cannot be retained or dealt with
 
00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:38.960 align:start position:0%
separately it it is part of the whole
 
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
package which is part of why i wanted to
 
00:45:43.109 --> 00:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
have this work session
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
so that people understood when
 
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
amendments come forward you're dealing
 
00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:47.839 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
that part and you can make a motion to
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
amend the bill to delete a part um
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
so you understand that's valid so you
 
00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
can delete amend
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
or leave a part in we can't create a new
 
00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:01.750 align:start position:0%
or leave a part in we can't create a new
bill

00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i just wanted to
 
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
say you you've had a good historical
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
overview of the
 
00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
current state of the situation regarding
 
00:46:16.870 --> 00:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
this question which has been a question
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
as representative bergeron pointed out
 
00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
for longer than i've been around
 
00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh and i've always been one that's come
 
00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:26.480 align:start position:0%
down on the side of you know that you
 
00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
have to pick your poison
 
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of you know you either want to
 
00:46:32.069 --> 00:46:32.079 align:start position:0%
run for state rep or you want to do
 
00:46:32.079 --> 00:46:33.349 align:start position:0%
run for state rep or you want to do
moderator

00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
moderator
 
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
um i concede that that uh
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron and others have
 
00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
raised significant questions about
 
00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
about the utility of that in these
 
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.630 align:start position:0%
about the utility of that in these
circumstances

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
um but uh
 
00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
you know obviously if this were not a
 
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
live issue it wouldn't be here
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
and but the only thing i could say about
 
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
it is i
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
have no uh answers any more than anyone
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
else has however
 
00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
you know at some point you have to at
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
some point you have to fish or cut bait
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
as my grandfather used to
 
00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
say thank you
 
00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:13.839 align:start position:0%
thank you all right any other committee
 
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
comments on part one
 
00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair we are on sb
 
00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
83 representative growing yeah regarding
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative merhead's suggestion
 
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
could there be an amendment just to make
 
00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
section one a study instead of
 
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
i it can but i think my reply is
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
how many times do you study an issue it
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
sounds like this has been
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
studied maybe not by virtue of a formal
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
separate committee but it's certainly
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
been discussed a lot
 
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
um and i think representative cody makes
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
a valid point maybe some people just
 
00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
have to make a decision i know in my
 
00:47:57.680 --> 00:47:58.549 align:start position:0%
have to make a decision i know in my
community

00:47:58.549 --> 00:47:58.559 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
the moderator has always just been the
 
00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:02.069 align:start position:0%
the moderator has always just been the
moderator

00:48:02.069 --> 00:48:02.079 align:start position:0%
moderator
 
00:48:04.870 --> 00:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
um and we've had about three moderators
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
since the beginning of time
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
um and maybe that has something to do
 
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:48:12.630 --> 00:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
how that election goes and that he's
 
00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
handling ballots in my community once
 
00:48:16.069 --> 00:48:16.079 align:start position:0%
you become moderator
 
00:48:17.829 --> 00:48:17.839 align:start position:0%
you're there till you don't want to run
 
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
anymore or god has other plans for you
 
00:48:23.109 --> 00:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
so and i know a lot of the communities
 
00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
around me are like that
 
00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:27.990 align:start position:0%
around me are like that
so

00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
you know committee members can bring
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
what amendments they want forward but
 
00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
i just want everybody to understand what
 
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative teroshian for their
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
comment yeah thank you madam chair
 
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
no i i concur with what you were just
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
saying um i mentioned
 
00:48:50.549 --> 00:48:50.559 align:start position:0%
one of my towns uh having the assistant
 
00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.160 align:start position:0%
moderator and the moderator both
 
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
state reps in my town my current
 
00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:55.990 align:start position:0%
state reps in my town my current
moderator

00:48:55.990 --> 00:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
moderator
 
00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
was a state rep but he takes very
 
00:48:58.160 --> 00:48:59.910 align:start position:0%
was a state rep but he takes very
seriously

00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
seriously
 
00:49:01.829 --> 00:49:01.839 align:start position:0%
his job as moderator to be completely
 
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
impartial to the point where he was a
 
00:49:06.069 --> 00:49:06.079 align:start position:0%
registered republican he he no longer
 
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
associates with a
 
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
party he goes out of his way to to to
 
00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:13.150 align:start position:0%
to make sure there's no indication or
 
00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:14.549 align:start position:0%
to make sure there's no indication or
[Music]

00:49:14.549 --> 00:49:14.559 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
potential for there to be a conflict
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
interest and
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
so certainly you know people make that
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
choice maybe that's the
 
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
solution to with the future legislation
 
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
to come up with a way to maybe perhaps
 
00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
have that kind of restriction
 
00:49:30.549 --> 00:49:30.559 align:start position:0%
but it's getting back to part one it
 
00:49:31.829 --> 00:49:31.839 align:start position:0%
seems to me the best thing we could do
 
00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
with that is
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
is to um is to i tell that portion of
 
00:49:35.910 --> 00:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
in its current form it's just my opinion
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
all right i assume you're talking about
 
00:49:45.670 --> 00:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
part one of representative friedas
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%
it's been my ex that the experience of
 
00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
the moderator is what keeps this
 
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
election running smoothly
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
and legally and i think it's rare i
 
00:50:00.549 --> 00:50:00.559 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
no somebody said there were two
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
representatives that are in my ward i
 
00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
would prefer that
 
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
to be what it is that the moderator who
 
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
is running for another position
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
cannot touch in fact that happens i
 
00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:14.079 align:start position:0%
cannot touch the ballots when they're
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
counting them
 
00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:18.079 align:start position:0%
so it's i i would leave it as it is
 
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:22.069 --> 00:50:22.079 align:start position:0%
are you disclosing that you're a
 
00:50:22.079 --> 00:50:24.630 align:start position:0%
are you disclosing that you're a
moderator

00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
moderator
 
00:50:26.790 --> 00:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
no i'm not a moderator i don't think i
 
00:50:28.549 --> 00:50:28.559 align:start position:0%
want to be okay
 
00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:32.559 align:start position:0%
no um and because we have one that is
 
00:50:35.349 --> 00:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
so good it's so experienced why would i
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
lose that because he's running for
 
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
something and
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
how many days does the moderator serve
 
00:50:46.710 --> 00:50:46.720 align:start position:0%
in that role as compared to a
 
00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:49.910 align:start position:0%
in that role as compared to a
representative

00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
i just need a good mod and i have one
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:59.910 --> 00:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
all right well so anything we pass will
 
00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
be except for the good moderator and
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
representative frieda's
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
district all right
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
all right part two of sb 83
 
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
is in regards to the establishment of an
 
00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:17.510 align:start position:0%
is in regards to the establishment of an
election

00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
information portal
 
00:51:24.630 --> 00:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
there were a fair amount of discussion
 
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
there was some question as to whether or
 
00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
not there should have been a fiscal note
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
associated with it um and
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh the the end
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
the end goal bill was that a
 
00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
information portal um would be
 
00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
in place by january 1st of next year
 
00:51:50.150 --> 00:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
representative terozian thanks again
 
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
um yes and this was the one i i was
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
speaking to before when we were on uh
 
00:51:59.510 --> 00:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
one of the other bills um because i
 
00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
thought we had gone further ahead
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
and so in you heard uh deputy
 
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh scanlon say that um that
 
00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
there was some concern on the on the uh
 
00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
on the date
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh the prime sponsor in this did
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
indicate that he
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have a problem if we chose to
 
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
push the date dates out
 
00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
and i think almost certainly if we had
 
00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
an interest in passing that we would
 
00:52:23.109 --> 00:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
have to do that
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
but i believe i might have been one that
 
00:52:26.549 --> 00:52:26.559 align:start position:0%
asked the question about the fiscal note
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
on that or the
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
what the cost would be and that was a
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
concern as well so
 
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
those are the two issues i see with with
 
00:52:34.870 --> 00:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
that i don't disagree in concept with
 
00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
the idea but whether or not
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
as it's drafted we can get there on this
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh madam chair representative terezian
 
00:52:55.829 --> 00:52:55.839 align:start position:0%
did you want to add something
 
00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
no i was trying to i i i tried to lower
 
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
my hand i might have hit it twice
 
00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
no i'm all set all right representative
 
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:06.720 align:start position:0%
growing did you have something
 
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
yeah could uh deputy scanlon
 
00:53:12.309 --> 00:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
comment on what an appropriate date
 
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
deputy scanlan thank you madam chair um
 
00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:29.280 align:start position:0%
i think that it is um
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
too optimistic to think that we might
 
00:53:32.549 --> 00:53:32.559 align:start position:0%
have a portal
 
00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh like this in place for the 22
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
election cycle but
 
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
is something that i think is certainly
 
00:53:39.190 --> 00:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
doable for
 
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
2024 so you know if that's the time
 
00:53:43.109 --> 00:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
frame that the committee would
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
want to look at i think that's certainly
 
00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:47.440 align:start position:0%
something that we could
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
deputy scaling i guess i have a question
 
00:54:02.069 --> 00:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
for you
 
00:54:02.079 --> 00:54:05.750 align:start position:0%
for you
um

00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
there was some question about whether
 
00:54:11.589 --> 00:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
who who would actually be doing this at
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
least in my mind i have some notes to
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
that effect
 
00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
and this directs that
 
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
your office with uh the department of
 
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
information technology
 
00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
was there some financial
 
00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
implications of this i would presume and
 
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
was there some
 
00:54:34.549 --> 00:54:34.559 align:start position:0%
other department that maybe should have
 
00:54:36.069 --> 00:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
or would be involved in this
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
as i call all right
 
00:54:42.390 --> 00:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
deputy scandal technology the language
 
00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:46.559 align:start position:0%
uh in the bill um suggests that we work
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
with the department of information
 
00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.390 align:start position:0%
with the department of information
technology

00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
technology
 
00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
when we're designing the portal um and
 
00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
you know that's something certainly be
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
happy to do
 
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh typically when there's ft project
 
00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
i'll call it you know we
 
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
we establish the parameters um
 
00:55:08.309 --> 00:55:08.319 align:start position:0%
of what's going to be requested uh put
 
00:55:09.910 --> 00:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
it in the form of an rfp
 
00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
and then have some vendors uh
 
00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
you know submit their proposals on
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
making the implementation of it happen
 
00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:19.990 align:start position:0%
making the implementation of it happen
and

00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:21.990 --> 00:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
um to do that obviously we have to rely
 
00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
on some expertise
 
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
of i.t professionals which
 
00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
um and that leads then to the question
 
00:55:37.109 --> 00:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
of the fiscal note you know once we
 
00:55:40.150 --> 00:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
do that uh you know we get bids in yeah
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
we have a better handle of how much
 
00:55:44.789 --> 00:55:44.799 align:start position:0%
this is actually going to cost uh based
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:53.589 --> 00:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
does anybody know whether the current
 
00:55:53.599 --> 00:55:54.309 align:start position:0%
does anybody know whether the current
general

00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
house website has what we would consider
 
00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:02.240 align:start position:0%
a true portal on it
 
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
because from what i know these are
 
00:56:06.789 --> 00:56:06.799 align:start position:0%
pretty much static
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
pages that provide links to documents
 
00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:13.910 align:start position:0%
pages that provide links to documents
or

00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
i think that exactly i don't believe we
 
00:56:24.549 --> 00:56:24.559 align:start position:0%
do have anything
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
um like a portal on the house
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
on the general court website
 
00:56:32.630 --> 00:56:32.640 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't think we do either and i
 
00:56:35.270 --> 00:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
raise that just because i know
 
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
um for other reasons i'm looking at
 
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
websites and i know what our
 
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
staffing is and our current technology
 
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
as compared to what other places might
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
have in regards to portals
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
and information and staff because i'll
 
00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
so i have a major concern with this and
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
then when
 
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
we put in a date of the end of next
 
00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.470 align:start position:0%
we put in a date of the end of next
session

00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
you know not that i think this section
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
would be undone but i'm not sure that
 
00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:08.710 align:start position:0%
would be undone but i'm not sure that
that's

00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
a practice i want to get into because
 
00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
in two years from now and i don't think
 
00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
this is an issue that it would be
 
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
the next session could come in and say
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
be gone
 
00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
and now you've directed people
 
00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
on a path that maybe internally if they
 
00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
had just done
 
00:57:29.109 --> 00:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
would still be in place but by statute
 
00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
we could potentially
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
all right well it sounds like
 
00:57:45.190 --> 00:57:45.200 align:start position:0%
there's not general opposition to it but
 
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
there is some
 
00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:47.839 align:start position:0%
general at the implementation and the
 
00:57:47.839 --> 00:57:51.829 align:start position:0%
general at the implementation and the
date

00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:54.870 --> 00:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
okay section three
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
of sb 83
 
00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:02.559 align:start position:0%
where part three has to do with recount
 
00:58:02.559 --> 00:58:03.910 align:start position:0%
where part three has to do with recount
fees

00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
fees
 
00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
it was pretty straightforward it was
 
00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
presented by senator gray questions or
 
00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:15.030 align:start position:0%
presented by senator gray questions or
comments

00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:17.839 align:start position:0%
representative lane yeah sorry i can't
 
00:58:20.829 --> 00:58:20.839 align:start position:0%
figure out how to raise my hand
 
00:58:23.589 --> 00:58:23.599 align:start position:0%
um my comment was
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
and maybe it's just it's gonna cost
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh a senator more to
 
00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
do a recount they're gonna make during
 
00:58:34.789 --> 00:58:34.799 align:start position:0%
their term
 
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
and it's going to count and it's going
 
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
to cost state rep almost the same amount
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
it i don't know it just kind of hit me
 
00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
wrong but
 
00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
i guess that's the price of
 
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
it just seems i don't know
 
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
odd are you are you talking about
 
00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:54.640 align:start position:0%
section three with the state
 
00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
senator and state representative yes
 
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
but and i was just it just seemed
 
00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
incongruent i mean
 
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
it's i mean we're basically public
 
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
servants we're making 100 bucks a year
 
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
it just i don't know seemed odd but
 
00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
representative barry i mean i actually
 
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
had the the opposite feeling
 
00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
um i i wished uh i wish they were higher
 
00:59:29.349 --> 00:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
um i think a lot of the re i've
 
00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
participated in a lot of recounts in the
 
00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:32.069 align:start position:0%
participated in a lot of recounts in the
state

00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
probably over 15 at this point including
 
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
municipal recounts
 
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
which are covered by this but um right
 
00:59:42.950 --> 00:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
usually usually i probably in my
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
personal experience probably 70 percent
 
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
of the recounts i've participated
 
00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:49.839 align:start position:0%
in are grossly unnecessary rarely ever
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
with windham excluded the current
 
00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
situation wyndham excluded
 
00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
do the results change um and a lot of
 
00:59:58.390 --> 00:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
times these are
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
these are feel good exercises for the
 
01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
losing candidate and by the way i've
 
01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
worked for both the winning and the
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
losing candidates so
 
01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
i understand what it's like to be on
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
both sides of that um
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
um i i hear you about the state reps and
 
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
the state senators um
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
you know i i i look at the i look more
 
01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
of the concern
 
01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
with the statewide and congressional
 
01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.109 align:start position:0%
with the statewide and congressional
districts

01:00:21.109 --> 01:00:21.119 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
um and the cost associated with those
 
01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office does an
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
excellent job on these recounts they
 
01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:27.349 align:start position:0%
excellent job on these recounts they
spend

01:00:27.349 --> 01:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
spend
 
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of money and staff on these
 
01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
recounts and one of these days
 
01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
we will have a statewide recount and i
 
01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
have no idea what the cost will be but
 
01:00:37.829 --> 01:00:37.839 align:start position:0%
it will be high
 
01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
you know in 2016 the u.s senate race was
 
01:00:42.549 --> 01:00:42.559 align:start position:0%
decided by a little more than a thousand
 
01:00:42.559 --> 01:00:43.349 align:start position:0%
decided by a little more than a thousand
votes

01:00:43.349 --> 01:00:43.359 align:start position:0%
votes
 
01:00:45.990 --> 01:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
um and that would have been a perfectly
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable recount to ask for
 
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
um given the margin right um so i guess
 
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
i i raised all that to say i'm kind of
 
01:00:54.390 --> 01:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
on the other side of that but i have no
 
01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
intention of changing it but if somebody
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
does change it to be higher
 
01:01:00.870 --> 01:01:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
representative representative
 
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks again madam chair yeah
 
01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:08.069 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks again madam chair yeah
um

01:01:08.069 --> 01:01:08.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
i was going to comment um um and uh
 
01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
representative barry kind of hit on it
 
01:01:12.319 --> 01:01:12.710 align:start position:0%
representative barry kind of hit on it
that

01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
i mean if you look at the old uh fee
 
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
schedule if you want to call it that
 
01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
um what a rep paid was less
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
for a recount than a state senate race
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
so it's always been that way um you know
 
01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
and i to add to what um
 
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative berry said his concern is
 
01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:35.760 align:start position:0%
a statewide and congressional
 
01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
so you know maybe a solution to that of
 
01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
people concerned about
 
01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
you leave the fee the same for for the
 
01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:42.720 align:start position:0%
house and
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
state senate maybe even executive
 
01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
council and and then the rest
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
you do the increase i i don't really
 
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
have heartburn either way
 
01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:52.720 align:start position:0%
other than i'm typically people that
 
01:01:54.789 --> 01:01:54.799 align:start position:0%
know me know i i'm up
 
01:01:56.069 --> 01:01:56.079 align:start position:0%
more often than not i vote against
 
01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
things that are that are fee increases
 
01:02:00.069 --> 01:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
because that's just the way i am but um
 
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
you know and i don't know what the cost
 
01:02:01.359 --> 01:02:01.589 align:start position:0%
you know and i don't know what the cost
of

01:02:01.589 --> 01:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:02:03.109 --> 01:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
what it costs to do a recount i know
 
01:02:05.029 --> 01:02:05.039 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of volunteers if
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
we if we're woefully behind the cost
 
01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
then we should increase it
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:17.109 --> 01:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
again this was another section of the
 
01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
bill that there was no fiscal note
 
01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
we're already doing it so i'm assuming
 
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
the response would have been
 
01:02:25.589 --> 01:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
no discernible change representative
 
01:02:25.599 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
no discernible change representative
growing

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:26.170 align:start position:0%
growing
 
01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:27.829 align:start position:0%
growing
[Music]

01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i agree with
 
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative barry on this
 
01:02:34.230 --> 01:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh i think the even with the raised
 
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
fees i'm sure that even with the
 
01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
increased fees it comes nowhere near the
 
01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:38.549 align:start position:0%
increased fees it comes nowhere near the
cost

01:02:38.549 --> 01:02:38.559 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
of the recount uh the point here
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
it seems is to the the greater the
 
01:02:47.829 --> 01:02:47.839 align:start position:0%
margin the higher the cost to discourage
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
people from from doing a um you know
 
01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
asking for a recount if
 
01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
if there's a larger margin and
 
01:02:58.870 --> 01:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
i think the numbers are very reasonable
 
01:03:01.270 --> 01:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
it you know what with the state rep
 
01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
candidate i agree that it's a
 
01:03:07.029 --> 01:03:07.039 align:start position:0%
low paid position but i can't imagine
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
uh very many state reps spending less
 
01:03:09.839 --> 01:03:10.789 align:start position:0%
uh very many state reps spending less
than

01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:03:13.270 --> 01:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
10 or 20 times these amounts on their
 
01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:13.910 align:start position:0%
10 or 20 times these amounts on their
campaigns

01:03:13.910 --> 01:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
campaigns
 
01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think the amount if they really
 
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
want to recount would
 
01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
prevent them from doing it but it would
 
01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:28.960 align:start position:0%
representative barry i mean i just want
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
to add
 
01:03:31.589 --> 01:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
one more point about the state rep
 
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
recount um not all state rep recounts
 
01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
are created equal
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
um some districts are heads up you know
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
we're talking about less than a thousand
 
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
voters maybe 1200 voters
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
um in my district i have one of the
 
01:03:44.309 --> 01:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
largest filterial seats in terms of
 
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
population in the state i've got about i
 
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:46.710 align:start position:0%
population in the state i've got about i
think

01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:03:49.829 --> 01:03:49.839 align:start position:0%
18 000 registered voters um so
 
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
those recounts are different a recount
 
01:03:54.069 --> 01:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
in dairy where there's i believe there's
 
01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
almost there's over eight reps in dairy
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
now those multi-candidate recounts
 
01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
get really really labor-intensive
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
because you're having to count you're
 
01:04:03.349 --> 01:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
not just recounting
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
the the the first win the last winner
 
01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
and the first loser right you're
 
01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:08.390 align:start position:0%
and the first loser right you're
recounting

01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
recounting
 
01:04:11.029 --> 01:04:11.039 align:start position:0%
everything in there um so if those those
 
01:04:19.109 --> 01:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
okay somebody wants to make amendments
 
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
it sounds like in general there's not
 
01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
if they're not overwhelming opposition
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
and there might be some
 
01:04:36.549 --> 01:04:36.559 align:start position:0%
appetite for changing some of the fees
 
01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
so make your amendments appropriately if
 
01:04:41.109 --> 01:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
you're going to
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
part 4 of sb 83 is relative to the
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
itemized statements
 
01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
filed by political committees and
 
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
candidate um
 
01:04:57.029 --> 01:04:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:59.829 --> 01:04:59.839 align:start position:0%
what was used to submit to the secretary
 
01:05:01.829 --> 01:05:01.839 align:start position:0%
of state
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
and ross barry was close to my heart on
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
this in regards to saying that even
 
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
size 8 was not big enough it should be
 
01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:11.829 align:start position:0%
size 8 was not big enough it should be
12.

01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
12.
 
01:05:17.270 --> 01:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:20.480 align:start position:0%
representative barry um to that uh
 
01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.799 align:start position:0%
um madam chairman um i i did send an
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
amendment over to you from ols i do have
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
the uh fabled uh eight point font to
 
01:05:29.349 --> 01:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
twelve point font amendment from ols
 
01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:31.839 align:start position:0%
ready to go um it's my intention with
 
01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
that amendment
 
01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
that if we edit this uh omnibus bill
 
01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
that i'll present it
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
if we don't for some reason edit this
 
01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
ominous bill which i think is an
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
unlikely situation i'll just sit on it
 
01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
um i don't want to have to needlessly
 
01:05:44.710 --> 01:05:44.720 align:start position:0%
send this bill back to the senate if
 
01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative teresian
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um so
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
i'm one that and i'm not alone um
 
01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
i'm more of a grassroots guy and i don't
 
01:06:02.069 --> 01:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
have a team
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
when i run for state rep and i suspect
 
01:06:05.109 --> 01:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of others and i do
 
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
file my um reports
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
um you know oftentimes i even fax them
 
01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
and they're handwritten but you can read
 
01:06:15.270 --> 01:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
them and i don't want
 
01:06:17.829 --> 01:06:17.839 align:start position:0%
you know it's problematic to me it's
 
01:06:20.069 --> 01:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
just one more thing i have to do
 
01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:23.119 align:start position:0%
um and others like me now i have to
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
you know spend more time filing these
 
01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
things if i have to
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
have them all formatted on on the
 
01:06:31.029 --> 01:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
computer and and i'll go on record as
 
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
being the dumbest guy when it comes to
 
01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:33.109 align:start position:0%
being the dumbest guy when it comes to
computers

01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
computers
 
01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
in the room and so that
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
you know the rest of it i'm fine with it
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
should it should be
 
01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
legible but i don't want to be forced to
 
01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
have to to
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
to do more work on these things because
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
what i do
 
01:06:48.870 --> 01:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
submit is legible and it and then
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
they're handwritten
 
01:06:52.870 --> 01:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
and i do it myself that's all so
 
01:06:54.789 --> 01:06:54.799 align:start position:0%
let other members of the committee
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
correct me i understand this is a may
 
01:06:58.950 --> 01:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
that if you're doing it electronically
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
you have to do it in a manner that's
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
legible that that was the
 
01:07:05.950 --> 01:07:05.960 align:start position:0%
intent it wasn't to force you to file it
 
01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:09.200 align:start position:0%
electronically if you didn't want to
 
01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
so somebody deputy scanlan you're on the
 
01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
line could you uh
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
chime in as to whether that's your
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
understanding of this bill or not
 
01:07:20.309 --> 01:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
uh yes ma'am chair my understanding is
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
just to make the forums
 
01:07:21.839 --> 01:07:24.870 align:start position:0%
just to make the forums
legible

01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
but if people are doing hand written
 
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
they can continue to do that that's my
 
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.349 align:start position:0%
they can continue to do that that's my
understanding

01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:07:35.829 --> 01:07:35.839 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that thank you if
 
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
they are handwritten that they are also
 
01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:38.870 align:start position:0%
they are handwritten that they are also
legible

01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
legible
 
01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the for the
 
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
clarification because i thought i heard
 
01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
in testimony that this would force
 
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
everybody to have to do them
 
01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:46.549 align:start position:0%
everybody to have to do them
electronically

01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
electronically
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
perhaps i'm on a misnomer there yeah
 
01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
that was not my understanding
 
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
yes yes uh
 
01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
representative teresa and i just wanted
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
to point out that it's explicit
 
01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
on line 22
 
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh page four for part four
 
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
that uh a candidate the political
 
01:08:18.309 --> 01:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
committee of a candidate
 
01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
or a candidate may file such candidates
 
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
required reports
 
01:08:24.630 --> 01:08:24.640 align:start position:0%
as an email attachment a facsimile or a
 
01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
so i think that makes it very clear that
 
01:08:31.269 --> 01:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
you can continue
 
01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
to file on paper okay
 
01:08:38.229 --> 01:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
so the new section the new section on
 
01:08:41.349 --> 01:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
line twenty eight just based
 
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madame for the comments on
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
part four
 
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any um so that sounds
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
like that i'm
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry mr representative lane sorry
 
01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
go ahead should go back sorry i need to
 
01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
look for your wave
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
i i i did it physically not
 
01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
to representative quality's point the
 
01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
way i read that though is even with the
 
01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
paper copy
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
it says provided that the font size
 
01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
still would be required correct
 
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
but most people are going to write big
 
01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:30.550 align:start position:0%
but most people are going to write big
points

01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
points
 
01:09:32.709 --> 01:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
so i think roman numeral 1 would still
 
01:09:34.709 --> 01:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
apply but roman numeral two and three
 
01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't is that a correct
 
01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
reading is that how you would read that
 
01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:41.440 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding i didn't
 
01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:43.349 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding i didn't
particularly

01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think that the facsimile your
 
01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
paper copy i think you can print out
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
on the forum and that would technically
 
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
be electronic but
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
um i understood that i think i recall in
 
01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
testimony that
 
01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
you know some of the filings they would
 
01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
make the font size purposely small
 
01:10:03.030 --> 01:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
so that you couldn't read it as printed
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
and then you would have to
 
01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
go to another you know medium so
 
01:10:11.110 --> 01:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
i understood that you could still do
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
them hand written and this really
 
01:10:16.229 --> 01:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
um dealt with if you look at the title
 
01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
of six
 
01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
here i am with my glasses and font signs
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
664 9a
 
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
this it specifically deals with
 
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
the filed electronically
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
and then so i i sort of
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
saw it differently representative barry
 
01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
um yeah i'm looking at line 23
 
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
um it says printed so would there be a
 
01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
this is a good question for all of our
 
01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
lawyers president
 
01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:45.520 align:start position:0%
our attorneys um is there a difference
 
01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
between britain printed
 
01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
i i'm asking generally i i don't know
 
01:10:55.510 --> 01:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
this is a this is
 
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
this one's uh this one's well well
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know they're probably i just
 
01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
don't know what it is
 
01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
if somebody can hand write in eight
 
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
point font
 
01:11:17.669 --> 01:11:17.679 align:start position:0%
that's you know what at that point they
 
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
should be able to send it in
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
yeah well i would assume that written
 
01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
refers to
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
graphologically and printed refers to
 
01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:28.229 align:start position:0%
graphologically and printed refers to
printed

01:11:28.229 --> 01:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
printed
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
that would be my um that would be my
 
01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
belief but um
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
you know i've been wrong before it it
 
01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:34.550 align:start position:0%
you know i've been wrong before it it
also

01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:11:38.630 --> 01:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
says on
 
01:11:41.750 --> 01:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
line 31 that the candidate shall be
 
01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for ensuring the report
 
01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
is legible and it gives the secretary of
 
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
state or attorney general's office
 
01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh to me the discretion to inform the
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:00.470 --> 01:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
yeah right like this gives them a little
 
01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:01.189 align:start position:0%
yeah right like this gives them a little
t

01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
t
 
01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i think reasonable people know when
 
01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:10.149 --> 01:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
now we're talking politics and craziness
 
01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
representative sandler
 
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh yes ma'am i'm gonna take off my
 
01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
former lawyer hat here and just use a uh
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
obsessive wordsmith interpretation
 
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
but legible means legible someone's
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
handwriting might be more legible than
 
01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
someone else's printing
 
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
and more legible than certain small
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
fonts that we get off of our
 
01:12:33.189 --> 01:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
computers or a typewriter or what have
 
01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
you the operative term
 
01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
is legible if it isn't legible
 
01:12:40.630 --> 01:12:40.640 align:start position:0%
everything else falls by the wayside
 
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
all right we're putting that in the
 
01:12:48.790 --> 01:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
record representative sandler we're not
 
01:12:50.070 --> 01:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
taking many notes today
 
01:12:51.570 --> 01:12:51.580 align:start position:0%
but that's going in
 
01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:55.510 align:start position:0%
but that's going in
[Music]

01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
all right i'm not seeing anything so
 
01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
we'll move on to part five this is the
 
01:13:07.110 --> 01:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
last section
 
01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
is therefore yeah there is a part yeah
 
01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
there is yeah
 
01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
part four in regards to optional town
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
meeting procedures
 
01:13:22.709 --> 01:13:22.719 align:start position:0%
um this dealt with the
 
01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative sandler you're back on on
 
01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:25.910 align:start position:0%
representative sandler you're back on on
deck

01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
deck
 
01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
um the prior years versus the prior
 
01:13:28.719 --> 01:13:29.350 align:start position:0%
um the prior years versus the prior
years

01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
then i see that uh cordell johnstone
 
01:13:34.149 --> 01:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
from the nhma is also with us who had
 
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
commented on this
 
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
before so i'm going to defer to
 
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
committee members as to whether that
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
needs anything
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
or not anybody think that needs a change
 
01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
representative sandler thank you
 
01:13:54.550 --> 01:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:58.630 --> 01:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
i need you to unmute representatives
 
01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
great thank you now you're on
 
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you uh was the question whether
 
01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
are we still on the legibility of this
 
01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:12.630 align:start position:0%
are we still on the legibility of this
uh

01:14:12.630 --> 01:14:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
no no no we're on now we're on the next
 
01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
the the issue of
 
01:14:25.830 --> 01:14:25.840 align:start position:0%
a community being able to expend funds
 
01:14:29.030 --> 01:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
before that fiscal year's budget
 
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
is approved and it's supposed to be at a
 
01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:32.950 align:start position:0%
is approved and it's supposed to be at a
level

01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
that is considered to be reasonable in
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
light of prior years budgets
 
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
and the issue came up in the word
 
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
i raised it i was the pain and i think i
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
was corrected as to the intent by
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
cordell johnstone
 
01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
in regards to years on line five
 
01:14:56.550 --> 01:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
year apostrophe yes as compared to years
 
01:14:58.709 --> 01:14:58.719 align:start position:0%
with the plural apostrophe
 
01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
okay years would be the plural you're
 
01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
right if it's being compared to
 
01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
a series of two or four or eight or
 
01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
however many previous years
 
01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
you would probably want to go back to
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
those years and determine what
 
01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:12.870 align:start position:0%
those years and determine what
percentage

01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
of the uh votes were affected by it
 
01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
if it says apostrophe s that that means
 
01:15:22.630 --> 01:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a particular year
 
01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
and its ownership of the question that's
 
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
going on there
 
01:15:29.669 --> 01:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
so we could talk about last year's
 
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
budget thank you or prior
 
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
years plural where we would have to
 
01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
probably go back and do some kind of a
 
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
statistical analysis
 
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
right and my concern is because this
 
01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
issue is generally raised by people who
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
are very suspicious of what their
 
01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
municipal leaders are doing in
 
01:15:48.239 --> 01:15:49.669 align:start position:0%
municipal leaders are doing in
expenditures

01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
and my concern is and cordell i hope
 
01:15:52.950 --> 01:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
you're on
 
01:15:56.229 --> 01:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
when you said prior years
 
01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
to me that left it wide open to any
 
01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
prior year
 
01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
and so if you had big spending five
 
01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
years ago but the prior year had been
 
01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:06.310 align:start position:0%
years ago but the prior year had been
pretty

01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
lean you could argue that
 
01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
a higher expenditure level until the
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
budget was approved was consistent with
 
01:16:18.830 --> 01:16:18.840 align:start position:0%
a prior year budget five years ago
 
01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
so i had thought that if you were going
 
01:16:22.709 --> 01:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
to make it
 
01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
if you were going to make a change it
 
01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
should have been the prior
 
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal year's appropriations
 
01:16:32.149 --> 01:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
not prior years so let me
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
open that up to comment representative
 
01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:35.510 align:start position:0%
open that up to comment representative
growing

01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
growing
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i i felt the same way madam chair
 
01:16:42.149 --> 01:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
um and i think if we took out
 
01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
the years where it's located and we read
 
01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:45.750 align:start position:0%
the years where it's located and we read
this

01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
in light of prior appropriations and
 
01:16:50.950 --> 01:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
expenditures for the same purposes
 
01:16:52.310 --> 01:16:52.320 align:start position:0%
during the same period
 
01:16:56.470 --> 01:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
of the immediately prior fiscal period
 
01:16:58.390 --> 01:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
and that would if the fiscal period is
 
01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
more than one year
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
it would take care of that but it would
 
01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
it would
 
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
clearly relate to the immediately prior
 
01:17:12.630 --> 01:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
um i see that mr johnstone from the new
 
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
municipal association is with us i've
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
asked him if he if he can unmute um
 
01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:26.719 align:start position:0%
if you want to comment please yeah
 
01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
um hi and and thank you for um
 
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
inviting me uh i my point is simply
 
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
that the language ought to be clarified
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh because on line five it says the
 
01:17:41.910 --> 01:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
current law says
 
01:17:47.189 --> 01:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
in light of prior year apostrophe s
 
01:17:49.270 --> 01:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
and you need i think it needs to be
 
01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
clear that we're
 
01:17:54.070 --> 01:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
either we're referring to just the last
 
01:17:57.510 --> 01:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
year singular or we're referring to
 
01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
a series of prior years plural
 
01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
and the way it's written right now it's
 
01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
it's unclear because it
 
01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
it says prior year apostrophe s
 
01:18:11.990 --> 01:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
if you want to refer to just one year
 
01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
you should say
 
01:18:16.149 --> 01:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
the prior year apostrophe
 
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
s if you want to refer to several you
 
01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
should say
 
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
prior years s apostrophe
 
01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
so so if you don't like changing year
 
01:18:30.630 --> 01:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
apostrophe s to years
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
s apostrophe then i think what you want
 
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
to do is insert
 
01:18:37.590 --> 01:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
the word the before prior
 
01:18:40.630 --> 01:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
in light of the prior year
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
apostrophe s so it's clear that you're
 
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
just referring to
 
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
last year would it
 
01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
court it all if i could speak up and ask
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
this question school
 
01:18:54.630 --> 01:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
you know in my town my fiscal year
 
01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
corresponds to a calendar year so
 
01:18:58.390 --> 01:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
there's no question about what you would
 
01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
be referring to for a year
 
01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
our school district encompasses two
 
01:19:07.830 --> 01:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
calendar years but is one fiscal
 
01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
sense to have the word
 
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal associated with year as suggested
 
01:19:19.350 --> 01:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
by representative growing i i think it's
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
fine to include the word
 
01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
the word fiscal and in fact the language
 
01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
that he suggested
 
01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
i don't remember it exactly but it
 
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
sounded it sounded fine to me
 
01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
my point is just simply simply clarify
 
01:19:34.630 --> 01:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
whether you're referring to
 
01:19:38.229 --> 01:19:38.239 align:start position:0%
one year one fiscal year or or several
 
01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal years
 
01:19:42.550 --> 01:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
and and i don't think i have a strong
 
01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
opinion as to which it should be
 
01:19:46.470 --> 01:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
it just ought to be clear one way or the
 
01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:47.590 align:start position:0%
it just ought to be clear one way or the
other

01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:19:50.229 --> 01:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
so if you wanted to say in light of the
 
01:19:50.239 --> 01:19:51.590 align:start position:0%
so if you wanted to say in light of the
prior

01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
prior
 
01:19:55.830 --> 01:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:57.510 --> 01:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
that would be i think that would be fine
 
01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:04.390 --> 01:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative tarosian thank
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
you i had
 
01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
a question for mr johnson i may so um
 
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
i guess one of the questions was
 
01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
what was the intent just the prior year
 
01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
or or
 
01:20:18.629 --> 01:20:18.639 align:start position:0%
to be several prior years or years
 
01:20:18.639 --> 01:20:19.189 align:start position:0%
to be several prior years or years
that's

01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
that was number one number two uh the
 
01:20:22.709 --> 01:20:22.719 align:start position:0%
beginning of the fiscal year are there
 
01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
some towns or
 
01:20:26.470 --> 01:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
um cities that start their fiscal year
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
prior to january first
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh yeah there are um
 
01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:34.639 align:start position:0%
most of the towns are on a calendar
 
01:20:35.910 --> 01:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
01:20:38.550 --> 01:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
but there are a handful that have a june
 
01:20:41.189 --> 01:20:41.199 align:start position:0%
uh rather july one to june 30 fiscal
 
01:20:41.199 --> 01:20:42.310 align:start position:0%
uh rather july one to june 30 fiscal
year

01:20:42.310 --> 01:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:20:45.750 --> 01:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
okay so it's a follow-up the id this
 
01:20:47.590 --> 01:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
is address those towns that started
 
01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
there they say the 2021 budget prior to
 
01:20:52.870 --> 01:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
january of 2021 then
 
01:20:55.669 --> 01:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
this is the reason well the the main
 
01:20:55.679 --> 01:20:56.470 align:start position:0%
this is the reason well the the main
reason

01:20:56.470 --> 01:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
reason
 
01:20:58.550 --> 01:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
if you forget about the change on line
 
01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
five the main reason for the change on
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
lines three and four
 
01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
is to is to extend
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
the benefit that is currently available
 
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
only to
 
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
towns with a calendar fiscal year
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
to extend that to those that have
 
01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
a june 30 fiscal year as well
 
01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
because what happened last year
 
01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
and it was very unusual obviously but
 
01:21:29.189 --> 01:21:29.199 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic there were some
 
01:21:29.199 --> 01:21:30.070 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic there were some
towns

01:21:30.070 --> 01:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
towns
 
01:21:32.709 --> 01:21:32.719 align:start position:0%
with a june 30 fiscal year that had to
 
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
postpone their town meeting
 
01:21:37.990 --> 01:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
until july or august so they were
 
01:21:40.709 --> 01:21:40.719 align:start position:0%
adopting their budget after the fiscal
 
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
year begins
 
01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
which they don't ordinarily do towns
 
01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
that are on a calendar fiscal year
 
01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
always adopt their budget after the
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
after the fiscal year begins the fiscal
 
01:21:55.270 --> 01:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
year begins january 1 but we have our
 
01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:01.910 --> 01:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
so thank you and the couple so yeah and
 
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
the couple of towns that i can think of
 
01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
that have a meeting later than march
 
01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
have their fiscal year beginning july 1.
 
01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:09.270 align:start position:0%
have their fiscal year beginning july 1.
so

01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:12.550 --> 01:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
up until last year this was not an issue
 
01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
so this would clarify it correct
 
01:22:19.030 --> 01:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thank you any other
 
01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
questions or comments
 
01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair questions procedurally
 
01:22:28.149 --> 01:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
sure um so
 
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
what would happen in a town and i
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
forgive me i have never
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
lived in a town i've lived in a city
 
01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
what would happen in a town where you
 
01:22:37.430 --> 01:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
did want to make a significant increase
 
01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
in a portion of the budget how would you
 
01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
go about doing that
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
you need to do it as part of your budget
 
01:22:45.669 --> 01:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
so if on and on cordell i'm jumping in
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
here correct me if i'm on
 
01:22:52.629 --> 01:22:52.639 align:start position:0%
as a former selectman i might have
 
01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
decide that i want to spend
 
01:22:58.950 --> 01:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
10 times more than i did last year on my
 
01:23:01.030 --> 01:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
road plan
 
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
okay everybody wants a new road and i
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
decide i ran on new roads i'm going to
 
01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:05.990 align:start position:0%
decide i ran on new roads i'm going to
give

01:23:05.990 --> 01:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
give
 
01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
everybody a new road my budget
 
01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
would have a huge increase
 
01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
in my public works budget for that plan
 
01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
what this would mean is if the prior
 
01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:20.550 align:start position:0%
what this would mean is if the prior
year

01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:23:22.629 --> 01:23:22.639 align:start position:0%
i wasn't spending at 10 times the rate
 
01:23:24.229 --> 01:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
right i'm proposing the increase
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
i can only spend at the rate of the
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
prior year until the voters go
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
and approve the increase and then
 
01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
whenever my meeting is then i can go out
 
01:23:34.229 --> 01:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
and order my asphalt and spend at that
 
01:23:36.310 --> 01:23:36.320 align:start position:0%
rate and if they don't approve it
 
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
i've kept myself at the prior year's
 
01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
level so i'm not running into a
 
01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
budget disaster by doing a huge
 
01:23:45.189 --> 01:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
expenditure and then having the voters
 
01:23:45.199 --> 01:23:45.750 align:start position:0%
expenditure and then having the voters
say

01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:23:47.030 --> 01:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
hey we're not going to give you that
 
01:23:49.669 --> 01:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
increase thank you cordell did i get
 
01:23:49.679 --> 01:23:51.430 align:start position:0%
increase thank you cordell did i get
that

01:23:51.430 --> 01:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:54.390 --> 01:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
yes yes that's right if if you want uh
 
01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:55.590 align:start position:0%
yes yes that's right if if you want uh
basically

01:23:55.590 --> 01:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:23:58.470 --> 01:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh you need to you need to be careful
 
01:23:59.910 --> 01:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
about your expenditures
 
01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
between january 1 and the town meeting
 
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
and as the law says be consistent with
 
01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
the prior year's expenditures if you
 
01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
want to increase something tenfold
 
01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
you very well better wait until
 
01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
town meeting when the voters approve the
 
01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
budget and then you can spend whatever
 
01:24:23.669 --> 01:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
representative hamlet thank you madam
 
01:24:30.719 --> 01:24:31.270 align:start position:0%
representative hamlet thank you madam
chair

01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
i i also think it's important to put the
 
01:24:35.189 --> 01:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
the word immediate
 
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
in there if you're really referring to
 
01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
the immediate past year
 
01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
somebody else brought that up i think
 
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
representative sandler
 
01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:48.719 align:start position:0%
is that right with year or years so
 
01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm hoping that representative
 
01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
growing has volunteered to do an
 
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
amendment along the lines of the words
 
01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
that he suggested i think it was he
 
01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:59.669 align:start position:0%
that he suggested i think it was he
um

01:24:59.669 --> 01:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:02.709 --> 01:25:02.719 align:start position:0%
okay representative quailly thank you
 
01:25:03.669 --> 01:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
madam chairman
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh i agree that clarification is really
 
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
needed and i think
 
01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
the the the introduction of the word
 
01:25:14.790 --> 01:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal is really important here and and
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
it is needed for the towns that have
 
01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
their fiscal year
 
01:25:19.830 --> 01:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
begin july 1st and i thought
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
representative grohn's
 
01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
amendment did a good job of clarifying
 
01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
and it's important to clarify it because
 
01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:27.590 align:start position:0%
and it's important to clarify it because
it

01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
it needs to be clear otherwise i'm also
 
01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
a former select when i did one term here
 
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:32.560 align:start position:0%
in rindge
 
01:25:35.110 --> 01:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
and things need to be very clear or the
 
01:25:38.229 --> 01:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
possibility for conflict and dissension
 
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
rises very quickly so this needs this
 
01:25:43.270 --> 01:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
fix needs to be done
 
01:25:47.189 --> 01:25:47.199 align:start position:0%
thank you all right anybody else on part
 
01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
5 of sb 83
 
01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing anything so we're going
 
01:25:57.510 --> 01:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
to move on
 
01:26:00.709 --> 01:26:00.719 align:start position:0%

representative bergeron when we get to

you please speak up
 
01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
um unmute yourself and speak up because
 
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
of the computer that i'm on i'm not
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
going to be able to dual screen very
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
easily so
 
01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to need you to take the lead
 
01:26:59.030 --> 01:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
on that amendment so part one
 
01:27:02.070 --> 01:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
relative to the city chief election
 
01:27:06.070 --> 01:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
officer this appeared to be a change
 
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%

committee members
 
01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:24.629 align:start position:0%
committee members
anybody

01:27:24.629 --> 01:27:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
okay not seeing any
 
01:27:30.629 --> 01:27:30.639 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna move on to part two regarding
 
01:27:32.550 --> 01:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
taking up photographs within the
 
01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:39.830 align:start position:0%
taking up photographs within the
guardrail

01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:42.070 --> 01:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
i think we sort of discussed what the
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
purpose and
 
01:27:45.110 --> 01:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
function of this one this is separate
 
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
from taking a picture
 
01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
of your own ballot any questions or
 
01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:54.950 align:start position:0%
of your own ballot any questions or
comments

01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:58.390 --> 01:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any part three in regards
 
01:27:58.400 --> 01:27:58.870 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any part three in regards
to

01:27:58.870 --> 01:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:28:03.669 --> 01:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
the pre-processing of absentee ballots
 
01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
comments questions
 
01:28:09.070 --> 01:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
this is like the calm before the storm
 
01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:10.229 align:start position:0%
this is like the calm before the storm
[Music]

01:28:10.229 --> 01:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
okay sure representative bergeron you go
 
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
ahead with your amendment
 
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you madam chair um
 
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
the intent as i understand it from the
 
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
sponsor in part
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
was to allow for cities and towns to be
 
01:28:26.550 --> 01:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
able to reach out
 
01:28:29.590 --> 01:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
to voters who were voting absentee
 
01:28:31.830 --> 01:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
whose paperwork or affidavits weren't
 
01:28:33.350 --> 01:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
filled out properly
 
01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
and give them an opportunity to correct
 
01:28:36.239 --> 01:28:36.709 align:start position:0%
and give them an opportunity to correct
um

01:28:36.709 --> 01:28:36.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
those errors prior to the ballots being
 
01:28:41.910 --> 01:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
counted on election day
 
01:28:43.669 --> 01:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
and that's the concept i think i would
 
01:28:45.430 --> 01:28:45.440 align:start position:0%
hope that all of us support to try and
 
01:28:46.709 --> 01:28:46.719 align:start position:0%
make it work
 
01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
it was the approach to it the logistics
 
01:28:50.149 --> 01:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
of it that i
 
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
had some concerns about um
 
01:28:54.870 --> 01:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
there seemed to be some conflicting
 
01:28:56.870 --> 01:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
language in the
 
01:29:00.790 --> 01:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh original senate bill 89 as amended
 
01:29:03.189 --> 01:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
for example it was in one section it was
 
01:29:04.390 --> 01:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
01:29:06.229 --> 01:29:06.239 align:start position:0%
if someone was voting in person the
 
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
clerk could
 
01:29:10.149 --> 01:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
take a look at the affidavit make sure
 
01:29:11.830 --> 01:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
filled out properly but at the same time
 
01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
was saying in that section that the
 
01:29:17.350 --> 01:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
clerk had to have a policy
 
01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
providing a 24-hour notice that this be
 
01:29:19.679 --> 01:29:20.629 align:start position:0%
providing a 24-hour notice that this be
done

01:29:20.629 --> 01:29:20.639 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:29:25.030 --> 01:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
it also provided that at five o'clock
 
01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
the day after the uh the day before an
 
01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:28.950 align:start position:0%
the day after the uh the day before an
election

01:29:28.950 --> 01:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
that the moderator would be processing
 
01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:31.990 align:start position:0%
that the moderator would be processing
these

01:29:31.990 --> 01:29:32.000 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:29:36.790 --> 01:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:38.709 --> 01:29:38.719 align:start position:0%
and you know presumably to to find
 
01:29:41.110 --> 01:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
errors that occurred in the affidavits
 
01:29:42.870 --> 01:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
and then the clerk would have to contact
 
01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:44.639 align:start position:0%
these people to
 
01:29:46.870 --> 01:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
try and correct the paperwork of course
 
01:29:48.070 --> 01:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
the problem with that is the night
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
before an election the election
 
01:29:50.870 --> 01:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
officials are probably trying to set up
 
01:29:52.629 --> 01:29:52.639 align:start position:0%
their polling places
 
01:29:55.030 --> 01:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
and uh you know in practice once the
 
01:29:58.390 --> 01:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
office is closed on that monday night
 
01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
there's no one going to be even if the
 
01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
clerk can reach out to these people
 
01:30:03.830 --> 01:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
there's not going to be anyone there to
 
01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
accept the correction
 
01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
um and if that we're telling them to go
 
01:30:09.110 --> 01:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
to the polls on election day
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
to uh to vote in person the next day
 
01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:14.719 align:start position:0%
um you know again you have the problem
 
01:30:15.910 --> 01:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
well they're voting absentee because
 
01:30:17.750 --> 01:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
they can't go to the polls
 
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
so the amendment that i was proposing
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
kind of took a look at
 
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
what we did during the covet
 
01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
experiences last fall which would allow
 
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
the moderator to do the pre-processing
 
01:30:35.669 --> 01:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
on certain days after the checklist has
 
01:30:35.679 --> 01:30:36.629 align:start position:0%
on certain days after the checklist has
been

01:30:36.629 --> 01:30:36.639 align:start position:0%
been
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
certified by the supervisors of the
 
01:30:38.639 --> 01:30:39.669 align:start position:0%
certified by the supervisors of the
checklist

01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
checklist
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
it eliminated the the night before which
 
01:30:44.629 --> 01:30:44.639 align:start position:0%
is monday because now
 
01:30:46.950 --> 01:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
the purpose is to try and find out where
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
there have been errors
 
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
that have occurred it still directs the
 
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
town of city clerk to try and reach out
 
01:30:54.870 --> 01:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
to these people
 
01:30:58.149 --> 01:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
to see if we can get their paperwork
 
01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
corrected it also adds the word
 
01:31:03.189 --> 01:31:03.199 align:start position:0%
affidavit envelope
 
01:31:05.189 --> 01:31:05.199 align:start position:0%
and application because sometimes it's
 
01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
not just the
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
envelope that's a problem it might be
 
01:31:10.070 --> 01:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
the application itself
 
01:31:13.030 --> 01:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
so we're asking the moderator to look at
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
both of those
 
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
it's focusing on the moderator doing
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
this because under state laws the
 
01:31:21.189 --> 01:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
moderator who ultimately has to make the
 
01:31:21.199 --> 01:31:22.229 align:start position:0%
moderator who ultimately has to make the
decision

01:31:22.229 --> 01:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not a voter's paperwork
 
01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
has been properly executed and the vote
 
01:31:30.149 --> 01:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
should be counted
 
01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
so even if the clerk was doing a lot of
 
01:31:33.270 --> 01:31:33.280 align:start position:0%
preliminary work ultimately the
 
01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
moderator has to go through all of those
 
01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:35.750 align:start position:0%
moderator has to go through all of those
envelopes

01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
envelopes
 
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
and make sure that the paperwork has
 
01:31:40.709 --> 01:31:40.719 align:start position:0%
been properly executed
 
01:31:44.070 --> 01:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
the other provision i i
 
01:31:45.990 --> 01:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
put in there is and and representative
 
01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
hamlin as well
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
is to say that if the moderator want to
 
01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
hold sessions prior to the
 
01:31:53.830 --> 01:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh certification the checklist they
 
01:31:55.990 --> 01:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
could do so they just couldn't mark up
 
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
the checklist
 
01:31:59.669 --> 01:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
until that session that occurs after
 
01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
which is mandatory
 
01:32:03.270 --> 01:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
that occurs after the uh checklist has
 
01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
been posted
 
01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh i think i've covered about the key
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
things i i mean i try to
 
01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
preserve the intent of senator gray's
 
01:32:16.629 --> 01:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
proposal and try and
 
01:32:18.629 --> 01:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
resolve some of the logistical problems
 
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
i saw with it
 
01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
using as a model what was done with
 
01:32:24.550 --> 01:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
house bill 1266
 
01:32:26.550 --> 01:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
i'd like to think that that we were able
 
01:32:28.229 --> 01:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
to accomplish that
 
01:32:29.669 --> 01:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
and i guess if if you know other
 
01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
committee members have any questions or
 
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
or input on this approach i would
 
01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:34.870 align:start position:0%
or input on this approach i would
certainly

01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:32:39.910 --> 01:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh be happy to try and answer those
 
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
01:32:44.310 --> 01:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
um is representative mooney in
 
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
in lobby because i know she had a
 
01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:48.400 align:start position:0%
conversation with her
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
clerk um and i i
 
01:32:54.149 --> 01:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
wondered if she was available to share
 
01:32:54.159 --> 01:32:59.110 align:start position:0%
wondered if she was available to share
it

01:32:59.110 --> 01:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:07.430 --> 01:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
yes we can okay
 
01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
yes i was contacted by my town's
 
01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.750 align:start position:0%
yes i was contacted by my town's
moderator

01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
moderator
 
01:33:15.510 --> 01:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
she did have three very specific
 
01:33:17.430 --> 01:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
issues with regard to the bill and i
 
01:33:18.790 --> 01:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:33:20.950 --> 01:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
frankly representative bergeron's
 
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
amendment covers a couple of them
 
01:33:25.990 --> 01:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
i'd like to really get them verbatim so
 
01:33:27.510 --> 01:33:27.520 align:start position:0%
could you just give me one moment
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:33.990 --> 01:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
sure in the meantime representative
 
01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
tarosian did you have a comment on this
 
01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:36.790 align:start position:0%
tarosian did you have a comment on this
section

01:33:36.790 --> 01:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
yes um we heard in testimony on um
 
01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
on page two i guess of this uh section
 
01:33:49.510 --> 01:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
um line 17 that the town and city clerks
 
01:33:49.990 --> 01:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
are the
 
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
designee shall open out envelopes of all
 
01:33:54.310 --> 01:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots received prior to 5 pm
 
01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
on the day
 
01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
prior to election day we heard testimony
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
from from
 
01:34:00.950 --> 01:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
some town clerks one in particular was
 
01:34:03.510 --> 01:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
that the town clerk from derry
 
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
who had a concern with that
 
01:34:09.990 --> 01:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
um being required that it shall and that
 
01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
the word may
 
01:34:14.550 --> 01:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
may be better in that regard and so i
 
01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
didn't know if the
 
01:34:17.910 --> 01:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
if representative bergeron's amendment
 
01:34:19.350 --> 01:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
would address that section
 
01:34:23.910 --> 01:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
or not uh if i may respond madam chair
 
01:34:26.790 --> 01:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
sure representative bertrand um i had
 
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
that question of senator gray during his
 
01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
testimony i said
 
01:34:32.229 --> 01:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
was it your intent to make this
 
01:34:35.110 --> 01:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
mandatory for all elections and he said
 
01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:37.030 align:start position:0%
mandatory for all elections and he said
yes

01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
so i kept in the language shell
 
01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
and what i did in my amendment is that
 
01:34:46.470 --> 01:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
say after the checklist has been posted
 
01:34:48.709 --> 01:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
or certified by the supervisors of the
 
01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
checklist the moderators
 
01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
shall hold a session to review these uh
 
01:34:55.430 --> 01:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
you know open the elder envelopes and
 
01:34:57.270 --> 01:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
review the affidavits
 
01:34:59.830 --> 01:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
and uh i mean his as i understood it his
 
01:35:02.070 --> 01:35:02.080 align:start position:0%
intent was to ensure
 
01:35:05.669 --> 01:35:05.679 align:start position:0%
that election officials would try and uh
 
01:35:08.709 --> 01:35:08.719 align:start position:0%
make corrections to any of the paperwork
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
that voters may have inadv inadvertently
 
01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
made errors to
 
01:35:14.310 --> 01:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
to allow their votes to be cast on
 
01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
election day so
 
01:35:20.310 --> 01:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mooney do you
 
01:35:24.149 --> 01:35:24.159 align:start position:0%
have your notes
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so the first one
 
01:35:28.149 --> 01:35:28.159 align:start position:0%
is to allow but
 
01:35:36.550 --> 01:35:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
and that's in line with what
 
01:35:40.870 --> 01:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
representative terresian just brought up
 
01:35:43.990 --> 01:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
okay number two
 
01:35:47.430 --> 01:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
is to allow processing
 
01:35:50.229 --> 01:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
during the thursday through saturday
 
01:35:52.149 --> 01:35:52.159 align:start position:0%
prior to election
 
01:35:55.350 --> 01:35:55.360 align:start position:0%
not monday and i see that very
 
01:35:58.950 --> 01:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
clearly in the bergeron hamlet amendment
 
01:36:02.470 --> 01:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
page 1 and 16 through
 
01:36:05.830 --> 01:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
19. and then
 
01:36:09.709 --> 01:36:09.719 align:start position:0%
issue 3 allow challengers during
 
01:36:09.719 --> 01:36:11.270 align:start position:0%
issue 3 allow challengers during
pre-processing

01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
pre-processing
 
01:36:19.109 --> 01:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:21.189 --> 01:36:21.199 align:start position:0%
madam chair yet my amendment did not
 
01:36:22.470 --> 01:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
address the issue of
 
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
of challenging um challenges occur
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
actually at the polls as the voter's
 
01:36:31.189 --> 01:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
name is being announced
 
01:36:32.709 --> 01:36:32.719 align:start position:0%
and that would continue to be the
 
01:36:34.870 --> 01:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
practice even with those
 
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots that were pre-processed
 
01:36:40.390 --> 01:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
based on again what i think senator
 
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
gray's intent was
 
01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
i tried to preserve that intent in the
 
01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:47.910 align:start position:0%
i tried to preserve that intent in the
amendment

01:36:47.910 --> 01:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:49.830 --> 01:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron and i apologize
 
01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
for not being able to
 
01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
see your amendment um there was a
 
01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:54.950 align:start position:0%
see your amendment um there was a
comment

01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
comment
 
01:36:58.470 --> 01:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
during during our public hearing on
 
01:37:03.189 --> 01:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
the second page of the bill of the part
 
01:37:05.830 --> 01:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
page three i think line 21 about the
 
01:37:07.030 --> 01:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
moderator shall
 
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
then mark the chest list and there was
 
01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
suggestion that that
 
01:37:12.629 --> 01:37:12.639 align:start position:0%
be changed to the moderator or the
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
moderators designee
 
01:37:17.189 --> 01:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
does anybody recall that or think it's
 
01:37:17.199 --> 01:37:18.070 align:start position:0%
does anybody recall that or think it's
material

01:37:18.070 --> 01:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
material
 
01:37:19.510 --> 01:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
if this section of the bill is going to
 
01:37:21.990 --> 01:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
be changed
 
01:37:24.550 --> 01:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
i i think i did say throughout my
 
01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:25.109 align:start position:0%
i i think i did say throughout my
amendment

01:37:25.109 --> 01:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:37:26.790 --> 01:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
the moderator or the moderator's
 
01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:28.790 align:start position:0%
the moderator or the moderator's
designee

01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
designee
 
01:37:31.189 --> 01:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
okay great really does in the
 
01:37:33.590 --> 01:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
pre-processing of absentee ballots
 
01:37:36.709 --> 01:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
and and i if i may add during the public
 
01:37:37.910 --> 01:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
hearing one of the members of the
 
01:37:39.030 --> 01:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
committee asked
 
01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
how many people are we really talking
 
01:37:42.629 --> 01:37:42.639 align:start position:0%
about in trying to reach out
 
01:37:44.070 --> 01:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
who may not have filled out the
 
01:37:46.629 --> 01:37:46.639 align:start position:0%
affidavits or the paperwork properly
 
01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
um my my best guess based on experience
 
01:37:51.350 --> 01:37:51.360 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:37:54.790 --> 01:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
that is less than half of one percent
 
01:37:57.990 --> 01:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
the uh of the absentee ballots received
 
01:38:00.629 --> 01:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
the the real workload is the opening and
 
01:38:02.229 --> 01:38:02.239 align:start position:0%
the reviewing of all the absentee
 
01:38:03.990 --> 01:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
ballots not necessarily
 
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative groan
 
01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i have a
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
question for representative bergeron if
 
01:38:16.870 --> 01:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
he's willing to take it
 
01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
sure go ahead uh
 
01:38:22.390 --> 01:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
do i understand that your amendment
 
01:38:23.910 --> 01:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
would establish
 
01:38:27.430 --> 01:38:27.440 align:start position:0%
certain days and possibly times for the
 
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh for the pre-processing
 
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
as opposed to sort of an open notice
 
01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:37.109 align:start position:0%
as opposed to sort of an open notice
process

01:38:37.109 --> 01:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:38:40.709 --> 01:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
uh yes the uh the pre-processing the
 
01:38:42.629 --> 01:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
mandatory session
 
01:38:44.629 --> 01:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
should not occur until the supervisors
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
of the checklist have
 
01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
have certified uh the checklist for use
 
01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
at the election and that usually
 
01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
will occur seven to ten days before the
 
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
date of the election
 
01:38:57.910 --> 01:38:57.920 align:start position:0%

01:39:14.149 --> 01:39:14.159 align:start position:0%
so in modeling that language i included
 
01:39:16.470 --> 01:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
the words thursday friday or saturday
 
01:39:20.149 --> 01:39:20.159 align:start position:0%
prior to the time established for
 
01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
the date of the election so yes there
 
01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
are specific days
 
01:39:25.590 --> 01:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
it really doesn't matter i suppose as
 
01:39:27.270 --> 01:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
long as it occurs after the checklist
 
01:39:30.629 --> 01:39:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:35.189 --> 01:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
follow up go ahead representative
 
01:39:38.629 --> 01:39:38.639 align:start position:0%
one of the uh concerns that i have
 
01:39:42.390 --> 01:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
with the uh probably the main concern
 
01:39:43.830 --> 01:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
with the pre-processing
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
is that when uh when a notice is given
 
01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
um that that notice
 
01:39:53.910 --> 01:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
unless somebody is necessarily really
 
01:39:55.510 --> 01:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
watching for it they may not see it
 
01:39:59.030 --> 01:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
election day is always the same tuesday
 
01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:02.239 align:start position:0%
and people know that and i'm wondering
 
01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
if we could specify
 
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
a certain like on say thursday and
 
01:40:09.910 --> 01:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
friday at 10 o'clock
 
01:40:12.390 --> 01:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
that ten or ten o'clock and following
 
01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:13.109 align:start position:0%
that ten or ten o'clock and following
that

01:40:13.109 --> 01:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:15.189 --> 01:40:15.199 align:start position:0%
that this would be done so that we
 
01:40:16.629 --> 01:40:16.639 align:start position:0%
establish a very
 
01:40:20.070 --> 01:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
definitive time that is the same in all
 
01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
towns and cities
 
01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
that people then know okay this is this
 
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
is when the pre-processing is going to
 
01:40:28.629 --> 01:40:28.639 align:start position:0%
be done and it becomes a habit
 
01:40:30.950 --> 01:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
as opposed to something that can be
 
01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:31.750 align:start position:0%
as opposed to something that can be
announced

01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
announced
 
01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
and changed by every town and in any
 
01:40:34.880 --> 01:40:38.629 align:start position:0%
and changed by every town and in any
situation

01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:41.030 --> 01:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
if with permission let me chime in on
 
01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
that one
 
01:40:45.590 --> 01:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
i do sort of like that but
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that the last september
 
01:40:50.550 --> 01:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
election that
 
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
after labor day the tuesday after labor
 
01:40:55.830 --> 01:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
day if you recall the primary
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
um we were setting up
 
01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
actually the thursday night and friday
 
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
before the election
 
01:41:06.229 --> 01:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
because that's when we had staff
 
01:41:06.239 --> 01:41:07.750 align:start position:0%
because that's when we had staff
available

01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
and could do it and of course school
 
01:41:11.910 --> 01:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
wasn't really in session
 
01:41:15.109 --> 01:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
that's my i will tell you that's sort of
 
01:41:18.629 --> 01:41:18.639 align:start position:0%
my concern one of the
 
01:41:20.790 --> 01:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
the things about doing these is your
 
01:41:23.189 --> 01:41:23.199 align:start position:0%
clerk slash moderators ability to find
 
01:41:23.199 --> 01:41:24.390 align:start position:0%
clerk slash moderators ability to find
volunteers

01:41:24.390 --> 01:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
volunteers
 
01:41:27.910 --> 01:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
to come in and do this process and
 
01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
if we handicap i don't want to say
 
01:41:33.830 --> 01:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
handicap if we limit it to a particular
 
01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
day you may end up with communities that
 
01:41:39.510 --> 01:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
just say
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
we might like to do it but we there's i
 
01:41:43.590 --> 01:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
can't get enough volunteers that day
 
01:41:46.709 --> 01:41:46.719 align:start position:0%
or my moderator's not available or
 
01:41:49.750 --> 01:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
um but i agree that it needs it
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some
 
01:41:55.830 --> 01:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
parameters on when it occurs
 
01:41:59.270 --> 01:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
if i made madam chair just to add
 
01:42:02.709 --> 01:42:02.719 align:start position:0%
house bill 1266 modeled some of what was
 
01:42:02.719 --> 01:42:03.510 align:start position:0%
house bill 1266 modeled some of what was
in

01:42:03.510 --> 01:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:42:06.070 --> 01:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
house bill 556 which i sponsored last
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
session to allow for pre-processing of
 
01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:08.950 align:start position:0%
session to allow for pre-processing of
ballots

01:42:08.950 --> 01:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
01:42:11.590 --> 01:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
and during all the discussions and
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
committee public hearings
 
01:42:15.510 --> 01:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
some of the issues you raised actually
 
01:42:16.950 --> 01:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
were discussed that there should be
 
01:42:18.390 --> 01:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
specific days
 
01:42:22.070 --> 01:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
identified thursday and friday became
 
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
two of those days that were identified
 
01:42:25.189 --> 01:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
and then saturday was
 
01:42:28.229 --> 01:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
was added because one of the senators
 
01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
felt well maybe this should be done at
 
01:42:31.109 --> 01:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
the polling sites
 
01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
and since so many polling sites are in
 
01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
the schools it couldn't be done during
 
01:42:36.709 --> 01:42:36.719 align:start position:0%
while school was in session and
 
01:42:39.109 --> 01:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
therefore they threw in the saturday
 
01:42:41.910 --> 01:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
so there was some consideration given to
 
01:42:43.350 --> 01:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
try and identify
 
01:42:45.510 --> 01:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
a very limited number of days when that
 
01:42:46.790 --> 01:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
that could occur
 
01:42:48.950 --> 01:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
um i don't know if there's really a
 
01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
perfect solution for all communities as
 
01:42:54.830 --> 01:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
representative griffin kind of alluded
 
01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:56.790 align:start position:0%
representative griffin kind of alluded
to

01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:43:02.070 --> 01:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:05.590 --> 01:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you madam chair uh yes i just
 
01:43:08.870 --> 01:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to reiterate that um
 
01:43:10.870 --> 01:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
when the the clerk i mean it worked
 
01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
really well in the
 
01:43:15.590 --> 01:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
in the last election in the in the in
 
01:43:16.709 --> 01:43:16.719 align:start position:0%
the covid
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
covert election um so when the clerk
 
01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
announces that
 
01:43:24.950 --> 01:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
the date of the pre-processing he or she
 
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
also has to announce the time
 
01:43:29.109 --> 01:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
so the the clerk makes that very clear
 
01:43:31.109 --> 01:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
that you know there's a date and time
 
01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
of the where you know where the when the
 
01:43:35.590 --> 01:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
pre-processing will occur in the
 
01:43:37.109 --> 01:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
location where it will occur
 
01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:38.639 align:start position:0%
so i don't think that needs to be a
 
01:43:38.639 --> 01:43:40.229 align:start position:0%
so i don't think that needs to be a
statewide

01:43:40.229 --> 01:43:40.239 align:start position:0%
statewide
 
01:43:43.109 --> 01:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
you know specific rule but the town
 
01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
clerks do know that they have to make it
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
very clear that
 
01:43:48.070 --> 01:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
the date time and place of where the
 
01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:49.350 align:start position:0%
the date time and place of where the
pre-processing

01:43:49.350 --> 01:43:49.360 align:start position:0%
pre-processing
 
01:43:53.350 --> 01:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
will occur thank you
 
01:43:56.950 --> 01:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
representative grohan one other
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh question on this a concern and that
 
01:44:01.030 --> 01:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
is that if we
 
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
if we uh introduce may versus shell
 
01:44:08.470 --> 01:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
and some towns do go through the
 
01:44:10.229 --> 01:44:10.239 align:start position:0%
pre-processing and allow
 
01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
voters to uh correct their application
 
01:44:17.270 --> 01:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
and other towns choose not to then are
 
01:44:20.070 --> 01:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
are we going to run into a situation of
 
01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:20.470 align:start position:0%
are we going to run into a situation of
of

01:44:20.470 --> 01:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh that that voters and those in the in
 
01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
the first group of towns
 
01:44:27.669 --> 01:44:27.679 align:start position:0%
will have a an advantage over those in
 
01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
the other towns and is the court going
 
01:44:35.350 --> 01:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
i think that is a point raise and one of
 
01:44:39.590 --> 01:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
the reasons that senator gray uh
 
01:44:42.550 --> 01:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
used the word shell in his language
 
01:44:44.950 --> 01:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative taurosian
 
01:44:48.149 --> 01:44:48.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um since that
 
01:44:50.390 --> 01:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
brought up about um there being an
 
01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:52.790 align:start position:0%
brought up about um there being an
inconsistency

01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
inconsistency
 
01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
this bill or this part of the bill has
 
01:44:57.030 --> 01:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
has that built in
 
01:45:00.070 --> 01:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
in that in essence it rewards
 
01:45:02.470 --> 01:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
voters who vote early that have a chance
 
01:45:04.229 --> 01:45:04.239 align:start position:0%
to have the information corrected
 
01:45:07.270 --> 01:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
when those that don't on their absentee
 
01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
ballots come in
 
01:45:10.709 --> 01:45:10.719 align:start position:0%
um after that date they don't have the
 
01:45:10.719 --> 01:45:11.750 align:start position:0%
um after that date they don't have the
advantage

01:45:11.750 --> 01:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
01:45:14.229 --> 01:45:14.239 align:start position:0%
of um of having their missing signature
 
01:45:15.830 --> 01:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
an incorrect name and so forth verified
 
01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:16.149 align:start position:0%
an incorrect name and so forth verified
so

01:45:16.149 --> 01:45:16.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:45:18.149 --> 01:45:18.159 align:start position:0%
we already have that problem as as the
 
01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:30.070 --> 01:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
um yes to build on what trojan said i
 
01:45:30.950 --> 01:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
think there's
 
01:45:33.910 --> 01:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
a big equal protection issue here um
 
01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
specifically for those ballots that come
 
01:45:36.790 --> 01:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
in late
 
01:45:39.990 --> 01:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
um it's it you know we're
 
01:45:42.310 --> 01:45:42.320 align:start position:0%
the the kova 19 election 2020 is getting
 
01:45:43.830 --> 01:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
referenced a lot
 
01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
in which there was a surge of absentee
 
01:45:47.350 --> 01:45:47.360 align:start position:0%
ballots um you can most certainly make
 
01:45:48.629 --> 01:45:48.639 align:start position:0%
the argument that when a third of the
 
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
electorate was voting with absentee
 
01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:50.790 align:start position:0%
electorate was voting with absentee
ballots

01:45:50.790 --> 01:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
01:45:53.910 --> 01:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
um that that this was necessary but i
 
01:45:55.830 --> 01:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
i don't think going into 2022 that we're
 
01:45:58.149 --> 01:45:58.159 align:start position:0%
going to see that sort of turnout again
 
01:46:00.790 --> 01:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
and that sort of reliance on absentee
 
01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:01.510 align:start position:0%
and that sort of reliance on absentee
ballots

01:46:01.510 --> 01:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
i also have serious trepidations about
 
01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:04.629 align:start position:0%
i also have serious trepidations about
moving

01:46:04.629 --> 01:46:04.639 align:start position:0%
moving
 
01:46:07.590 --> 01:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
election day away from election day that
 
01:46:08.149 --> 01:46:08.159 align:start position:0%
has been
 
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
a new hampshire tradition going back
 
01:46:12.629 --> 01:46:12.639 align:start position:0%
over a hundred years that election day
 
01:46:14.229 --> 01:46:14.239 align:start position:0%
happens on election day and
 
01:46:15.510 --> 01:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to stop anybody from
 
01:46:17.030 --> 01:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
voting with an absentee that's their
 
01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:17.590 align:start position:0%
voting with an absentee that's their
right

01:46:17.590 --> 01:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:46:19.590 --> 01:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
um certain people are not available at
 
01:46:21.030 --> 01:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
the polls on that day and they have to
 
01:46:22.790 --> 01:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
cast an absentee ballot but we need to
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
treat everybody equally we treat
 
01:46:25.350 --> 01:46:25.360 align:start position:0%
everybody the same
 
01:46:27.109 --> 01:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
and i believe we need to make sure that
 
01:46:28.390 --> 01:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
we're keeping with the
 
01:46:30.229 --> 01:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
new hampshire tradition of voting on
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
election day when possible
 
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
and that's why i want that's why i'm i'm
 
01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
a big believer in as much
 
01:46:37.830 --> 01:46:37.840 align:start position:0%
as much election activity needs to
 
01:46:40.550 --> 01:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
happen on election day as is possible
 
01:46:42.550 --> 01:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
i think in the future we are going to
 
01:46:44.950 --> 01:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
have electronic poll books i think those
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
are going to be commonplace
 
01:46:49.109 --> 01:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
in if we pass this this previous bill
 
01:46:50.709 --> 01:46:50.719 align:start position:0%
probably in six years
 
01:46:53.430 --> 01:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
that's going to dramatically reduce the
 
01:46:55.350 --> 01:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
amount of staff or volunteers that are
 
01:46:57.510 --> 01:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
needed on election day because the lines
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
are going to be much shorter there's no
 
01:47:00.310 --> 01:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
there's not going to be a through d
 
01:47:02.070 --> 01:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
anymore there's going to be four lines
 
01:47:03.430 --> 01:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
you walk up you go to whatever one's
 
01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:03.910 align:start position:0%
you walk up you go to whatever one's
open

01:47:03.910 --> 01:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
open
 
01:47:06.709 --> 01:47:06.719 align:start position:0%
and you vote so i i think we're moving
 
01:47:08.550 --> 01:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
towards addressing a lot of the problems
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
that pre-processing is attempting
 
01:47:13.350 --> 01:47:13.360 align:start position:0%
to deal with already and
 
01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
i i think we're kind of moving away from
 
01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
that traditional new hampshire
 
01:47:18.629 --> 01:47:18.639 align:start position:0%
experience of voting on election day
 
01:47:23.590 --> 01:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
when possible
 
01:47:27.189 --> 01:47:27.199 align:start position:0%
thank you other comments
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:34.709 --> 01:47:34.719 align:start position:0%
so representative bergeron has his
 
01:47:37.590 --> 01:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
amendment he's um the committee members
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
have it
 
01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
if people have further changes or other
 
01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:42.149 align:start position:0%
if people have further changes or other
amendments

01:47:42.149 --> 01:47:42.159 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
01:47:44.390 --> 01:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
um they want to do i would suggest
 
01:47:45.350 --> 01:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
either working
 
01:47:47.750 --> 01:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
off of representative bergeron's
 
01:47:49.109 --> 01:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
amendment with his amendment
 
01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:57.590 --> 01:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
okay um the next section
 
01:48:02.070 --> 01:48:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:06.070 --> 01:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
all right the next section of sb 89
 
01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
is part 4 which has to do with the
 
01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
committee to study post-election audit
 
01:48:12.870 --> 01:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
counting devices
 
01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
um and some recount
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
discrepancy authorization investigation
 
01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
to the attorney general's office
 
01:48:22.709 --> 01:48:22.719 align:start position:0%
comments from committee members
 
01:48:24.390 --> 01:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron
 
01:48:27.510 --> 01:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair my comments
 
01:48:29.669 --> 01:48:29.679 align:start position:0%
pertain specifically to the first
 
01:48:30.709 --> 01:48:30.719 align:start position:0%
section of part
 
01:48:33.270 --> 01:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
four which is on page 3 starting with
 
01:48:34.950 --> 01:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
line 27
 
01:48:36.629 --> 01:48:36.639 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study
 
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
post-election audit counting devices
 
01:48:44.149 --> 01:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
last session senate bill 283
 
01:48:46.629 --> 01:48:46.639 align:start position:0%
required that the secretary of state uh
 
01:48:48.229 --> 01:48:48.239 align:start position:0%
conduct a study
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
of high-speed optical scan ballot
 
01:48:52.709 --> 01:48:52.719 align:start position:0%
counting devices
 
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
to assess the feasibility of using such
 
01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
equipment in a post-election audit
 
01:49:01.590 --> 01:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
that report was due november 1st
 
01:49:05.109 --> 01:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
uh but given the challenges posed
 
01:49:07.750 --> 01:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
during the last fall election by uh
 
01:49:09.430 --> 01:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
covet and a lot of the preparations the
 
01:49:11.270 --> 01:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
secretary of state had to make to
 
01:49:14.390 --> 01:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
to address those issues at the polls
 
01:49:17.430 --> 01:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
it wasn't released until march 23rd
 
01:49:20.790 --> 01:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
senator gray's bill was actually
 
01:49:23.990 --> 01:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
introduced on january 26th
 
01:49:27.669 --> 01:49:27.679 align:start position:0%
prior to the secretary of state's report
 
01:49:29.589 --> 01:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
you know in looking at this section i
 
01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
think basically senator gray
 
01:49:34.390 --> 01:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
is asking to establish a special
 
01:49:36.629 --> 01:49:36.639 align:start position:0%
committee to do what the secretary of
 
01:49:38.550 --> 01:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
state has already done
 
01:49:40.629 --> 01:49:40.639 align:start position:0%
so i'm not so sure there's this value in
 
01:49:40.639 --> 01:49:41.990 align:start position:0%
so i'm not so sure there's this value in
creating

01:49:41.990 --> 01:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
creating
 
01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
that committee at this time we have
 
01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:45.830 align:start position:0%
that committee at this time we have
retained

01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
retained
 
01:49:48.390 --> 01:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
representative lang's bill in our
 
01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:50.070 align:start position:0%
representative lang's bill in our
committee

01:49:50.070 --> 01:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:49:52.149 --> 01:49:52.159 align:start position:0%
to address the issues of post-election
 
01:49:52.159 --> 01:49:53.430 align:start position:0%
to address the issues of post-election
audits

01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
audits
 
01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking that perhaps that's really
 
01:49:57.030 --> 01:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
all we need we don't need to establish
 
01:49:58.310 --> 01:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
another committee
 
01:50:00.550 --> 01:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
to do the work that was done last
 
01:50:02.950 --> 01:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
session with senate bill 283 which by
 
01:50:03.510 --> 01:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
the way
 
01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:11.350 --> 01:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
other comments on this part or
 
01:50:13.510 --> 01:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron's comments that
 
01:50:14.550 --> 01:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
i think were
 
01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:20.470 align:start position:0%
i think were
terrific

01:50:20.470 --> 01:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:23.030 --> 01:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
representative teresian thank you madam
 
01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:24.320 align:start position:0%
chair and and uh
 
01:50:27.030 --> 01:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
question to representative bergeron that
 
01:50:28.310 --> 01:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
senate bill he referenced
 
01:50:30.149 --> 01:50:30.159 align:start position:0%
that the study has been completed was
 
01:50:32.070 --> 01:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
that was that a similar
 
01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
type um committee um by that i mean did
 
01:50:39.030 --> 01:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
did it have um um you know a couple
 
01:50:40.550 --> 01:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
members of the senate
 
01:50:42.229 --> 01:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
uh three members from the house and so
 
01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
forth or was it was it a standard
 
01:50:46.470 --> 01:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh study commission as this proposes to
 
01:50:46.480 --> 01:50:47.669 align:start position:0%
uh study commission as this proposes to
do

01:50:47.669 --> 01:50:47.679 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:50:49.750 --> 01:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh no it wasn't a study committee it
 
01:50:51.910 --> 01:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
simply directed the secretary of state
 
01:50:52.790 --> 01:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
01:50:55.830 --> 01:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
conduct a study as to the feasibility of
 
01:50:57.430 --> 01:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
using these devices
 
01:51:00.790 --> 01:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
as post for post-election audits so the
 
01:51:03.270 --> 01:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
secretary of state was charged with uh
 
01:51:05.350 --> 01:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
finding vendors to do it to conduct the
 
01:51:07.510 --> 01:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
studies to use
 
01:51:09.589 --> 01:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
ballots from previous elections to see
 
01:51:11.510 --> 01:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
what kinds of results they were
 
01:51:15.270 --> 01:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to forward a copy of that
 
01:51:16.950 --> 01:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
report the secretary of state's report
 
01:51:18.550 --> 01:51:18.560 align:start position:0%
to all members of the committee
 
01:51:20.709 --> 01:51:20.719 align:start position:0%
so that you could see what it entails
 
01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
it's a 44-page report but 37 of the
 
01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:24.070 align:start position:0%
it's a 44-page report but 37 of the
pages

01:51:24.070 --> 01:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
pages
 
01:51:25.990 --> 01:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
are the vendor's uh data which are
 
01:51:28.629 --> 01:51:28.639 align:start position:0%
attached to deputy scanlan's
 
01:51:31.189 --> 01:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
commentary i'd love to get a copy thank
 
01:51:33.430 --> 01:51:33.440 align:start position:0%

members there was
 
01:51:41.430 --> 01:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
a request for vendors to come and do a
 
01:51:44.310 --> 01:51:44.320 align:start position:0%
trial run uh the secretary of state
 
01:51:48.229 --> 01:51:48.239 align:start position:0%
conducted it up at the state archives
 
01:51:51.189 --> 01:51:51.199 align:start position:0%
there were two vendors i think that were
 
01:51:51.750 --> 01:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:51:55.030 --> 01:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
become um another vendor was unable to
 
01:51:56.550 --> 01:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
attend you might re it
 
01:52:00.070 --> 01:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
occurred last fall um whereas has been
 
01:52:02.070 --> 01:52:02.080 align:start position:0%
referenced there were a lot of competing
 
01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
interests going on for these
 
01:52:07.189 --> 01:52:07.199 align:start position:0%
vendors that have these machines um i
 
01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
had the opportunity to be there for part
 
01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
of it
 
01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
um it was pretty impressive to watch
 
01:52:16.870 --> 01:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
um ballots which were
 
01:52:21.270 --> 01:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
put in huge stacks into
 
01:52:24.229 --> 01:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
high speed readers and how fast they
 
01:52:25.669 --> 01:52:25.679 align:start position:0%
were processed
 
01:52:28.870 --> 01:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
and that the machines could
 
01:52:32.310 --> 01:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
pick up questions that were then
 
01:52:34.790 --> 01:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
pulled out which allowed them whoever
 
01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
the decision maker would have been
 
01:52:40.550 --> 01:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
to sit at a machine and actually look
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
electronically at the ballot to make a
 
01:52:44.950 --> 01:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
determination for example whether the
 
01:52:45.910 --> 01:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
circle was
 
01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
adequately filled in it was pretty
 
01:52:48.400 --> 01:52:49.750 align:start position:0%
adequately filled in it was pretty
impressive

01:52:49.750 --> 01:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
impressive
 
01:52:53.589 --> 01:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
so i just sort of threw that out
 
01:52:55.589 --> 01:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
and that was as representative bergeron
 
01:52:57.510 --> 01:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
said as a result of senator gray's bill
 
01:53:00.629 --> 01:53:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:02.790 --> 01:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
other questions or comments from
 
01:53:03.750 --> 01:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
01:53:09.750 --> 01:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:13.510 --> 01:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
okay madam chair uh representative
 
01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:14.149 align:start position:0%
okay madam chair uh representative
growing

01:53:14.149 --> 01:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
growing
 
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
up so i agree with uh senator
 
01:53:20.550 --> 01:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
with representative bergeron on on that
 
01:53:21.669 --> 01:53:21.679 align:start position:0%
section one
 
01:53:25.189 --> 01:53:25.199 align:start position:0%
of section three but it seems to me
 
01:53:29.350 --> 01:53:29.360 align:start position:0%
that section two we're on section four
 
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
excuse me section one i mean part four
 
01:53:36.550 --> 01:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so excuse me
 
01:53:39.750 --> 01:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
on section one of part four
 
01:53:43.510 --> 01:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
asking for a study committee i agree
 
01:53:46.390 --> 01:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh on that part that i think we should
 
01:53:46.400 --> 01:53:47.669 align:start position:0%
uh on that part that i think we should
just

01:53:47.669 --> 01:53:47.679 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:53:49.189 --> 01:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
deal with whatever we want to do with
 
01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
this on representative lang's bill
 
01:53:55.350 --> 01:53:55.360 align:start position:0%
but then if you go to uh line 15 on page
 
01:53:56.629 --> 01:53:56.639 align:start position:0%
four and then
 
01:53:59.750 --> 01:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
line um 35 on page four it seems that
 
01:54:00.470 --> 01:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
those are
 
01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
very different topics that aren't part
 
01:54:03.990 --> 01:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
of the study committee if i'm reading it
 
01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:05.030 align:start position:0%
of the study committee if i'm reading it
correctly

01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
01:54:08.229 --> 01:54:08.239 align:start position:0%
um so those are
 
01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
those really are it appears to me not
 
01:54:13.270 --> 01:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
related to the
 
01:54:17.589 --> 01:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:17.599 --> 01:54:21.510 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:54:21.510 --> 01:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:24.629 --> 01:54:24.639 align:start position:0%
and i i i also recall that on
 
01:54:26.629 --> 01:54:26.639 align:start position:0%
on the lion 30 where it starts on line
 
01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
35 that madam chair you had
 
01:54:32.629 --> 01:54:32.639 align:start position:0%
some concern about the about
 
01:54:35.990 --> 01:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh the wording
 
01:54:37.910 --> 01:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
of the authority given to the ballot law
 
01:54:41.430 --> 01:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
commission as being a bit broad
 
01:54:44.790 --> 01:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
um yes i did thank you for pointing that
 
01:54:46.950 --> 01:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
out let's go back as senator
 
01:54:49.270 --> 01:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
i mean representative growing points out
 
01:54:51.270 --> 01:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
that representative bergeron's
 
01:54:52.870 --> 01:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
comments in regards to the committee
 
01:54:55.189 --> 01:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
dealt with only section one
 
01:54:59.270 --> 01:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
of part four so i'm going to move on to
 
01:55:03.990 --> 01:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
section two um
 
01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:09.109 align:start position:0%
section two um
and

01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:13.589 --> 01:55:13.599 align:start position:0%
that section deals with recounts
 
01:55:17.350 --> 01:55:17.360 align:start position:0%
um and i'm not
 
01:55:19.350 --> 01:55:19.360 align:start position:0%
i don't show that there was much
 
01:55:21.109 --> 01:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
question or comment
 
01:55:24.709 --> 01:55:24.719 align:start position:0%
on this section does anybody have
 
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
anything on this
 
01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:31.109 align:start position:0%
anything on this
change

01:55:31.109 --> 01:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:32.950 --> 01:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
deputy scanlan i believe you're still on
 
01:55:34.229 --> 01:55:34.239 align:start position:0%
the line if you could
 
01:55:37.189 --> 01:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
speak as to the purpose and whether or
 
01:55:37.199 --> 01:55:38.470 align:start position:0%
speak as to the purpose and whether or
not

01:55:38.470 --> 01:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:55:41.669 --> 01:55:41.679 align:start position:0%
section two of part four has any
 
01:55:43.589 --> 01:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
concerns for the secretary of state's
 
01:55:44.629 --> 01:55:44.639 align:start position:0%
office since they
 
01:55:47.830 --> 01:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
are in charge of recounts
 
01:55:50.950 --> 01:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair um
 
01:55:54.149 --> 01:55:54.159 align:start position:0%
this portion of the bill
 
01:55:57.669 --> 01:55:57.679 align:start position:0%
and section four is uh
 
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
is a reaction to uh what's happening
 
01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
with uh wyndham right now and a
 
01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
disparity between
 
01:56:08.070 --> 01:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
the the count on election night and the
 
01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:09.830 align:start position:0%
the the count on election night and the
recount

01:56:09.830 --> 01:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
recount
 
01:56:12.950 --> 01:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:56:16.470 --> 01:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
you know the the the the process
 
01:56:18.950 --> 01:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh took place as it's doing the statute
 
01:56:21.109 --> 01:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
where there was election night count
 
01:56:23.350 --> 01:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
there was a recount that showed a large
 
01:56:24.550 --> 01:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
disparity which
 
01:56:27.430 --> 01:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
is which is unusual it's not unheard of
 
01:56:29.270 --> 01:56:29.280 align:start position:0%
but it's unusual
 
01:56:31.669 --> 01:56:31.679 align:start position:0%
um the bell law commission heard the
 
01:56:31.679 --> 01:56:33.109 align:start position:0%
um the bell law commission heard the
appeal

01:56:33.109 --> 01:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
appeal
 
01:56:35.109 --> 01:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
and they ruled that you know that there
 
01:56:36.470 --> 01:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
was no
 
01:56:40.790 --> 01:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
change in the outcome of the election
 
01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
after the recount and and they declared
 
01:56:46.310 --> 01:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh the winners uh you know that were
 
01:56:48.629 --> 01:56:48.639 align:start position:0%
chosen on the night of recount so
 
01:56:50.950 --> 01:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
the question then became well you know
 
01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
when when
 
01:56:55.350 --> 01:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
all of the republican candidates jump up
 
01:56:57.350 --> 01:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
roughly 300 votes
 
01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
and the one democrat candidate went down
 
01:57:04.790 --> 01:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
99. what was the reason for that and
 
01:57:07.910 --> 01:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
deputy scanlon i don't deputy scanlon i
 
01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
i didn't phrase my question well enough
 
01:57:12.550 --> 01:57:12.560 align:start position:0%
for a moment
 
01:57:15.189 --> 01:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
before we get to i think section three
 
01:57:16.870 --> 01:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
the ballot law commission
 
01:57:18.550 --> 01:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
i wanted to know whether the secretary
 
01:57:20.470 --> 01:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
of state's office had any
 
01:57:25.189 --> 01:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
comment or opinion on the ex expansion
 
01:57:27.510 --> 01:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
in regards to the conduct of a recount
 
01:57:29.669 --> 01:57:29.679 align:start position:0%
in section two
 
01:57:32.950 --> 01:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:35.589 --> 01:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
expanding the language the ballots cast
 
01:57:36.229 --> 01:57:36.239 align:start position:0%
for such
 
01:57:38.870 --> 01:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
office or question including votes cast
 
01:57:40.229 --> 01:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
for the candidates or question
 
01:57:42.790 --> 01:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
on the ballot write in votes and not
 
01:57:43.750 --> 01:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
counted from
 
01:57:47.510 --> 01:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
over votes or under votes language
 
01:57:49.589 --> 01:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
because i didn't really i don't have any
 
01:57:50.790 --> 01:57:50.800 align:start position:0%
notes indicating
 
01:57:52.229 --> 01:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
that there was really much said about
 
01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
this and i'm not sure what the problem
 
01:57:55.830 --> 01:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
is it's trying to address
 
01:57:58.390 --> 01:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
okay so the the law currently says that
 
01:58:00.070 --> 01:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
the ballots
 
01:58:02.229 --> 01:58:02.239 align:start position:0%
that are counted in a recount are the
 
01:58:03.270 --> 01:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
ballots that were
 
01:58:06.629 --> 01:58:06.639 align:start position:0%
cast uh in the election
 
01:58:09.189 --> 01:58:09.199 align:start position:0%
um and it's as simple as that so when we
 
01:58:10.550 --> 01:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
conduct a recount
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
we do not count the ballots
 
01:58:17.589 --> 01:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
that were not used in the election
 
01:58:21.109 --> 01:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
um and there are some that believe that
 
01:58:24.629 --> 01:58:24.639 align:start position:0%
that uh we should account for the whole
 
01:58:26.229 --> 01:58:26.239 align:start position:0%
universe of ballots that were sent to
 
01:58:27.990 --> 01:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
the top uh
 
01:58:30.149 --> 01:58:30.159 align:start position:0%
for the election whether they were cast
 
01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:58:34.629 --> 01:58:34.639 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:58:36.149 --> 01:58:36.159 align:start position:0%
i mean it's up to the legislature to
 
01:58:37.990 --> 01:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
decide whether we should go through the
 
01:58:39.669 --> 01:58:39.679 align:start position:0%
exercise of counting
 
01:58:42.790 --> 01:58:42.800 align:start position:0%
ballots that were not used or not uh it
 
01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:43.510 align:start position:0%
ballots that were not used or not uh it
will

01:58:43.510 --> 01:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:58:46.629 --> 01:58:46.639 align:start position:0%
require more time to do that and
 
01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0%
we try to be as efficient as possible
 
01:58:50.149 --> 01:58:50.159 align:start position:0%
during the recount so that's what that
 
01:58:52.310 --> 01:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
part of the bill does
 
01:58:54.790 --> 01:58:54.800 align:start position:0%
but deputy scale and if i can continue
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
this with the committee's indulgence
 
01:58:58.870 --> 01:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
this doesn't talk about ballots this
 
01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
talks about
 
01:59:02.550 --> 01:59:02.560 align:start position:0%
votes so this means that this would
 
01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:03.669 align:start position:0%
votes so this means that this would
direct

01:59:03.669 --> 01:59:03.679 align:start position:0%
direct
 
01:59:07.910 --> 01:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:10.950 --> 01:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
to count votes that were
 
01:59:13.910 --> 01:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
legally not part of the vote count on
 
01:59:20.470 --> 01:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:22.629 --> 01:59:22.639 align:start position:0%
well i'm looking at if you're looking at
 
01:59:26.470 --> 01:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
on page four lines 19 and 20.
 
01:59:29.030 --> 01:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
is that is that what we're talking about
 
01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:29.510 align:start position:0%
is that is that what we're talking about
yes

01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:59:32.310 --> 01:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
yes uh including votes cast for the
 
01:59:32.320 --> 01:59:33.109 align:start position:0%
yes uh including votes cast for the
candidates

01:59:33.109 --> 01:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
candidates
 
01:59:36.390 --> 01:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
or the question write-in votes
 
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
and we count those uh and not voted
 
01:59:43.030 --> 01:59:43.040 align:start position:0%
resulting from over votes or undervotes
 
01:59:44.550 --> 01:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
so that would be
 
01:59:46.950 --> 01:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
an additional requirement that we do not
 
01:59:47.669 --> 01:59:47.679 align:start position:0%
do now
 
01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
where if let's say in in
 
01:59:54.229 --> 01:59:54.239 align:start position:0%
if there's a town where you elect four
 
01:59:57.990 --> 01:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
and the voter only cast votes for three
 
02:00:00.310 --> 02:00:00.320 align:start position:0%
then we would have to count that no vote
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
in a no vote category
 
02:00:04.870 --> 02:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
and then in addition to that if it was
 
02:00:06.550 --> 02:00:06.560 align:start position:0%
vote for four
 
02:00:09.830 --> 02:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
and the voter voted for five
 
02:00:12.870 --> 02:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
we would also have to account for
 
02:00:16.470 --> 02:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
the fact for that fifth vote um
 
02:00:19.189 --> 02:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
and so the they're again that would uh
 
02:00:20.870 --> 02:00:20.880 align:start position:0%
require additional time it's not
 
02:00:22.629 --> 02:00:22.639 align:start position:0%
something that we do
 
02:00:25.990 --> 02:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
right now if they is under
 
02:00:29.589 --> 02:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
counted we simply count the ballots that
 
02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
were cast
 
02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
if the ballot was over voted we simply
 
02:00:35.510 --> 02:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
count that ballot as
 
02:00:39.189 --> 02:00:39.199 align:start position:0%
no votes being cast for any candidate um
 
02:00:41.589 --> 02:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
yeah but it doesn't say ballot it says
 
02:00:41.599 --> 02:00:42.870 align:start position:0%
yeah but it doesn't say ballot it says
votes

02:00:42.870 --> 02:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
votes
 
02:00:45.990 --> 02:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's my concern my concern here
 
02:00:49.910 --> 02:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
is this appears to be directing counting
 
02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:50.390 align:start position:0%
is this appears to be directing counting
those

02:00:50.390 --> 02:00:50.400 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:00:53.589 --> 02:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
votes not those ballots
 
02:00:56.550 --> 02:00:56.560 align:start position:0%
so i understand that there's a concern
 
02:00:56.560 --> 02:00:57.750 align:start position:0%
so i understand that there's a concern
that

02:00:57.750 --> 02:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:00:59.990 --> 02:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's a check as to
 
02:01:01.990 --> 02:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
whether the total amount of ballots that
 
02:01:04.070 --> 02:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
a town receives an election
 
02:01:05.750 --> 02:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
are the same as the amount of ballots
 
02:01:08.470 --> 02:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
that might come back for recount
 
02:01:12.229 --> 02:01:12.239 align:start position:0%
but to me that's very different than
 
02:01:15.430 --> 02:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
votes and my concern is is that if we're
 
02:01:16.390 --> 02:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
directing you
 
02:01:19.589 --> 02:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
to count votes over voted
 
02:01:21.589 --> 02:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
undervoted that we're not part of the
 
02:01:23.109 --> 02:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
tape totals plus
 
02:01:26.870 --> 02:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
they can't recounts we are now
 
02:01:29.510 --> 02:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
having a recount with the fifth column
 
02:01:30.870 --> 02:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
so to speak
 
02:01:34.070 --> 02:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
total votes possibly for a candidate
 
02:01:37.910 --> 02:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
that were not counted legally
 
02:01:42.229 --> 02:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:43.830 --> 02:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
i understand what you're saying madam
 
02:01:45.430 --> 02:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
chair and and i think that
 
02:01:49.350 --> 02:01:49.360 align:start position:0%
that this language does do that it's
 
02:01:51.109 --> 02:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
okay that's all i need that's all i
 
02:01:53.910 --> 02:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
needed to hear okay
 
02:01:55.830 --> 02:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from
 
02:02:05.430 --> 02:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
02:02:07.589 --> 02:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
all right i'm just i i will say flat out
 
02:02:08.950 --> 02:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
i think that is a huge
 
02:02:10.610 --> 02:02:10.620 align:start position:0%
mistake um
 
02:02:10.620 --> 02:02:12.229 align:start position:0%
mistake um
[Music]

02:02:12.229 --> 02:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:02:15.030 --> 02:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
and i will either or ask somebody else
 
02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:15.430 align:start position:0%
and i will either or ask somebody else
to

02:02:15.430 --> 02:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
to take this proposed language out
 
02:02:18.629 --> 02:02:18.639 align:start position:0%
because i think
 
02:02:20.629 --> 02:02:20.639 align:start position:0%
raising the possibility that we're going
 
02:02:21.830 --> 02:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
to count
 
02:02:24.149 --> 02:02:24.159 align:start position:0%
at an official recount votes that were
 
02:02:25.750 --> 02:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
not part of the official election
 
02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:26.470 align:start position:0%
not part of the official election
results

02:02:26.470 --> 02:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
results
 
02:02:29.669 --> 02:02:29.679 align:start position:0%
creates a huge problem i don't have an
 
02:02:31.750 --> 02:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
issue with ballots and maybe after the
 
02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:33.189 align:start position:0%
issue with ballots and maybe after the
audit

02:02:33.189 --> 02:02:33.199 align:start position:0%
audit
 
02:02:35.350 --> 02:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
is done and we have an audit report
 
02:02:37.350 --> 02:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
there will be a process to do that
 
02:02:39.189 --> 02:02:39.199 align:start position:0%
that's clearly delineated
 
02:02:42.149 --> 02:02:42.159 align:start position:0%
but i think allowing that possibility of
 
02:02:43.510 --> 02:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
a result without
 
02:02:47.430 --> 02:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
those guard rails so to speak
 
02:02:50.629 --> 02:02:50.639 align:start position:0%
is incredibly uh
 
02:02:53.589 --> 02:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
dangerous as to confidence in election
 
02:02:53.599 --> 02:02:57.030 align:start position:0%
dangerous as to confidence in election
results

02:02:57.030 --> 02:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
all right so that was section two
 
02:03:03.990 --> 02:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
section three deputy scanlan um
 
02:03:06.709 --> 02:03:06.719 align:start position:0%
i think you had started to talk about
 
02:03:06.719 --> 02:03:09.990 align:start position:0%
i think you had started to talk about
and

02:03:09.990 --> 02:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:13.430 --> 02:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
there was language that was somewhat
 
02:03:14.229 --> 02:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
referred to
 
02:03:16.070 --> 02:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
in regards to significant and
 
02:03:18.629 --> 02:03:18.639 align:start position:0%
unexplained discrepancy as to what that
 
02:03:21.669 --> 02:03:21.679 align:start position:0%
means and i have to tell you i i
 
02:03:24.550 --> 02:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
don't know that i want a bill that has
 
02:03:26.870 --> 02:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
anything related to the possibility of
 
02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
could undermine public confidence
 
02:03:29.520 --> 02:03:30.149 align:start position:0%
could undermine public confidence
because

02:03:30.149 --> 02:03:30.159 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:03:32.149 --> 02:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
i think that's pretty broad too deputy
 
02:03:32.159 --> 02:03:33.990 align:start position:0%
i think that's pretty broad too deputy
scanlan

02:03:33.990 --> 02:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
scanlan
 
02:03:35.910 --> 02:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i just follow
 
02:03:38.149 --> 02:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
along the line that you were going
 
02:03:40.870 --> 02:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
is that this is a reaction to what's
 
02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
occurring in windham right now
 
02:03:46.149 --> 02:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
and i think that it would make sense for
 
02:03:48.470 --> 02:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
that process to play out
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
before we start engaging in a
 
02:03:51.990 --> 02:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
conversation of
 
02:03:55.189 --> 02:03:55.199 align:start position:0%
you know what post election
 
02:03:57.189 --> 02:03:57.199 align:start position:0%
and recount and bow law commission
 
02:03:59.030 --> 02:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
appeals processes
 
02:04:02.069 --> 02:04:02.079 align:start position:0%
should look at uh look like um the
 
02:04:03.750 --> 02:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
danger here is that
 
02:04:06.390 --> 02:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
you know we get away from from a quick
 
02:04:07.910 --> 02:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
finality to the election
 
02:04:09.990 --> 02:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
and get into a process that could be
 
02:04:11.270 --> 02:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
really drawn out
 
02:04:14.709 --> 02:04:14.719 align:start position:0%
and um you know i think that again we
 
02:04:15.430 --> 02:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
should look at
 
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
how the wyndham situation plays out
 
02:04:19.270 --> 02:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
before we
 
02:04:22.629 --> 02:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
uh start changing the law relative to
 
02:04:22.639 --> 02:04:25.589 align:start position:0%
uh start changing the law relative to
post

02:04:25.589 --> 02:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:27.350 --> 02:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
you know post-election and recount
 
02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:31.830 align:start position:0%
you know post-election and recount
procedures

02:04:31.830 --> 02:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:34.229 --> 02:04:34.239 align:start position:0%
other members with comments on section
 
02:04:34.239 --> 02:04:36.069 align:start position:0%
other members with comments on section
three

02:04:36.069 --> 02:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:04:40.229 --> 02:04:40.239 align:start position:0%
of sb 89 part
 
02:04:50.470 --> 02:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:53.669 --> 02:04:53.679 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any and i don't see
 
02:04:56.950 --> 02:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
representative lane's hand
 
02:05:00.390 --> 02:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
so part four of part
 
02:05:03.430 --> 02:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
four of sb or section four of part four
 
02:05:05.030 --> 02:05:05.040 align:start position:0%
of sb 89
 
02:05:07.430 --> 02:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
starts on page five of the bill i have
 
02:05:08.550 --> 02:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
as printed
 
02:05:10.470 --> 02:05:10.480 align:start position:0%
and it deals with the attorney general's
 
02:05:12.550 --> 02:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
office with enforcement
 
02:05:15.910 --> 02:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
of election laws
 
02:05:15.920 --> 02:05:19.589 align:start position:0%
of election laws
common

02:05:19.589 --> 02:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:21.589 --> 02:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
my notes reflect that currently the
 
02:05:24.390 --> 02:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
authority to seal or unseal ballot boxes
 
02:05:26.629 --> 02:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
less rests with the secretary of state's
 
02:05:26.639 --> 02:05:29.189 align:start position:0%
less rests with the secretary of state's
office

02:05:29.189 --> 02:05:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:32.830 --> 02:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
that this allows the attorney general to
 
02:05:37.589 --> 02:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
unseal and resale seal the ballot boxes
 
02:05:41.430 --> 02:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
um i this i guess maybe is for the
 
02:05:43.510 --> 02:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
secretary of state or other lawyers on
 
02:05:46.709 --> 02:05:46.719 align:start position:0%
the committee um the attorney general's
 
02:05:48.790 --> 02:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
office is usually
 
02:05:51.910 --> 02:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
part of the enforcement arm of
 
02:05:56.149 --> 02:05:56.159 align:start position:0%
election laws not the participant
 
02:05:58.709 --> 02:05:58.719 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering what impact having
 
02:05:58.719 --> 02:06:00.149 align:start position:0%
and i'm wondering what impact having
them

02:06:00.149 --> 02:06:00.159 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:06:03.189 --> 02:06:03.199 align:start position:0%
physically involved in
 
02:06:06.790 --> 02:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
ballot sorting counting
 
02:06:13.350 --> 02:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:15.990 --> 02:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
anybody have a comment i don't recall
 
02:06:17.750 --> 02:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
hearing a lot about that
 
02:06:21.109 --> 02:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
prior to today was that
 
02:06:23.510 --> 02:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
i don't have any notes specifically
 
02:06:29.189 --> 02:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:32.550 --> 02:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
i i agree there i just i have i have
 
02:06:32.560 --> 02:06:33.270 align:start position:0%
i i agree there i just i have i have
myself

02:06:33.270 --> 02:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
myself
 
02:06:35.910 --> 02:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
highlighted the attorney general may
 
02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
unseal and reseal
 
02:06:40.709 --> 02:06:40.719 align:start position:0%
ballot boxes because that was apparently
 
02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
a flag of a concern of mine
 
02:06:46.149 --> 02:06:46.159 align:start position:0%
no no remarked as well i don't recall
 
02:06:46.159 --> 02:06:47.990 align:start position:0%
no no remarked as well i don't recall
anybody

02:06:47.990 --> 02:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
02:06:51.109 --> 02:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:52.629 --> 02:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
maybe they did i don't know i have a
 
02:06:56.149 --> 02:06:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:00.149 --> 02:07:00.159 align:start position:0%
representative growing i i do recall i
 
02:07:02.870 --> 02:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not sure if uh senator gray
 
02:07:03.830 --> 02:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
spoke about this
 
02:07:05.830 --> 02:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
at the hearing or if it was a discussion
 
02:07:07.270 --> 02:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
i had with him
 
02:07:10.870 --> 02:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
after the hearing but
 
02:07:14.149 --> 02:07:14.159 align:start position:0%
the section four is an enabling
 
02:07:17.589 --> 02:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
section for section three
 
02:07:20.550 --> 02:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
as i understand it if you look at line
 
02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:21.109 align:start position:0%
as i understand it if you look at line
eight

02:07:21.109 --> 02:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
eight
 
02:07:24.870 --> 02:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh through ten it says that the the
 
02:07:28.229 --> 02:07:28.239 align:start position:0%
authority uh at the end of line eight
 
02:07:30.069 --> 02:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
whenever the ballot law commission
 
02:07:32.629 --> 02:07:32.639 align:start position:0%
requests an investigation be conducted
 
02:07:33.990 --> 02:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
the attorney general
 
02:07:37.189 --> 02:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
may steal or unseal and the
 
02:07:40.229 --> 02:07:40.239 align:start position:0%
argument was this time
 
02:07:41.990 --> 02:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
that the attorney general said he did
 
02:07:44.069 --> 02:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
not have the authority to unseal and
 
02:07:46.069 --> 02:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
reseal the ballot boxes
 
02:07:48.550 --> 02:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
so this was to give him the authority if
 
02:07:48.560 --> 02:07:49.910 align:start position:0%
so this was to give him the authority if
the

02:07:49.910 --> 02:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:07:52.229 --> 02:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
election law commission said hey we want
 
02:07:53.990 --> 02:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
this looked into
 
02:07:58.350 --> 02:07:58.360 align:start position:0%
it gave the attorney general and rsa
 
02:07:58.360 --> 02:07:59.830 align:start position:0%
it gave the attorney general and rsa
76-c

02:07:59.830 --> 02:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
76-c
 
02:08:01.990 --> 02:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
the right to do that i believe that's
 
02:08:03.270 --> 02:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
the intent that it's
 
02:08:05.270 --> 02:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
it's really it's really the enabling
 
02:08:06.629 --> 02:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
part for
 
02:08:09.830 --> 02:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
section three thank you representative
 
02:08:11.350 --> 02:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
grohan i would point out that i would
 
02:08:12.550 --> 02:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
argue it does not
 
02:08:15.350 --> 02:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
actually limit it to that it actually
 
02:08:17.189 --> 02:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
gives the attorney general
 
02:08:20.390 --> 02:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
upon his or her own motion so
 
02:08:23.030 --> 02:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
it is not just authorizing about law
 
02:08:24.709 --> 02:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
commission to direct the attorney
 
02:08:26.550 --> 02:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
general's office to do something
 
02:08:29.910 --> 02:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
which i don't know that that's a policy
 
02:08:32.629 --> 02:08:32.639 align:start position:0%
that we want to adopt it allows the
 
02:08:34.149 --> 02:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
attorney general to do it
 
02:08:37.350 --> 02:08:37.360 align:start position:0%
on their own motion again i'm not sure
 
02:08:37.360 --> 02:08:37.750 align:start position:0%
on their own motion again i'm not sure
that's

02:08:37.750 --> 02:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:08:40.470 --> 02:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
a policy we want to adopt attorney
 
02:08:41.589 --> 02:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:08:43.189 --> 02:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh let me look here representative
 
02:08:43.199 --> 02:08:44.629 align:start position:0%
uh let me look here representative
terozian

02:08:44.629 --> 02:08:44.639 align:start position:0%
terozian
 
02:08:46.310 --> 02:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
yeah i was just going to say madam chair
 
02:08:48.709 --> 02:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
that um yeah it looks to
 
02:08:51.430 --> 02:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
make um the process we went through with
 
02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
senate bill 43
 
02:08:57.030 --> 02:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
um if this if this windham
 
02:09:00.229 --> 02:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
problem were to crop up in the future um
 
02:09:00.239 --> 02:09:01.510 align:start position:0%
problem were to crop up in the future um
without

02:09:01.510 --> 02:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
without
 
02:09:05.430 --> 02:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
this part of uh of senate bill 89
 
02:09:07.830 --> 02:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
in place we'd have to go through if we
 
02:09:10.550 --> 02:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:12.149 --> 02:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
house so desired we'd have to go through
 
02:09:13.830 --> 02:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
the same process again
 
02:09:17.430 --> 02:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
to um to get those ballots on sale this
 
02:09:20.550 --> 02:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
in my opinion looks to attempt to
 
02:09:24.550 --> 02:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
put in law the ability for the
 
02:09:26.310 --> 02:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office to address
 
02:09:28.790 --> 02:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
this in the future were to
 
02:09:30.229 --> 02:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
come up no i don't know whether you know
 
02:09:32.149 --> 02:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
if limits are not limits
 
02:09:34.310 --> 02:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
that that appears to me to be the reason
 
02:09:35.270 --> 02:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
why that's in there
 
02:09:38.790 --> 02:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
what i can tell that was
 
02:09:42.149 --> 02:09:42.159 align:start position:0%
senator gray's intent uh for my
 
02:09:43.750 --> 02:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
discussion with him
 
02:09:47.109 --> 02:09:47.119 align:start position:0%
that's what it looks like thank you
 
02:09:49.430 --> 02:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
just to clarify it's my understanding
 
02:09:50.550 --> 02:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
that the issue is
 
02:09:53.589 --> 02:09:53.599 align:start position:0%
ballot boxes because there's specific
 
02:09:56.069 --> 02:09:56.079 align:start position:0%
statutes in regard to the retention of
 
02:09:58.470 --> 02:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
ballots and how that is handled
 
02:10:01.669 --> 02:10:01.679 align:start position:0%
and that the attorney general's office
 
02:10:06.310 --> 02:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
now and in fact has um
 
02:10:09.990 --> 02:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
done books records paper
 
02:10:13.030 --> 02:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
documentary materials so i mean it's
 
02:10:14.629 --> 02:10:14.639 align:start position:0%
sort of a mishmash is
 
02:10:18.950 --> 02:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
what i would sort of say i'm not sure
 
02:10:21.430 --> 02:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
i i i understand the issue that came up
 
02:10:23.350 --> 02:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure from a policy
 
02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:24.790 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure from a policy
standpoint

02:10:24.790 --> 02:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
02:10:27.030 --> 02:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
i want the attorney general whoever that
 
02:10:27.990 --> 02:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
might be
 
02:10:29.910 --> 02:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
to have the ability to go get ballot
 
02:10:32.390 --> 02:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
boxes and unseal them
 
02:10:35.270 --> 02:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
for whatever they might think needs to
 
02:10:36.550 --> 02:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
be investigated because
 
02:10:38.709 --> 02:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
as written this might require the ballot
 
02:10:42.709 --> 02:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
law commission to do the direction
 
02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
madam chair would you be okay with this
 
02:10:46.390 --> 02:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
if we eliminated
 
02:10:50.709 --> 02:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:53.669 --> 02:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
no probably not because i think to be
 
02:10:55.189 --> 02:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
honest with you
 
02:10:57.750 --> 02:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
um you're taking that you're making a
 
02:10:59.109 --> 02:10:59.119 align:start position:0%
major change
 
02:11:02.149 --> 02:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
in the ballot law commission
 
02:11:06.390 --> 02:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
authority um and i come back to
 
02:11:08.830 --> 02:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
what's a significant and unexplained
 
02:11:08.840 --> 02:11:14.709 align:start position:0%
what's a significant and unexplained
discrepancy

02:11:14.709 --> 02:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:16.390 --> 02:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
i mean you know other people are not
 
02:11:18.069 --> 02:11:18.079 align:start position:0%
raising a major
 
02:11:20.790 --> 02:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
issue with this so i mean that's part of
 
02:11:21.430 --> 02:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
having this
 
02:11:23.270 --> 02:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
discussion so people can raise issues
 
02:11:24.790 --> 02:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
that maybe they hadn't thought about or
 
02:11:26.310 --> 02:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
maybe hanging out on the limb about to
 
02:11:28.790 --> 02:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
fall off the branch all by themselves
 
02:11:30.470 --> 02:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
well there's also the issue of the
 
02:11:32.069 --> 02:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
discretion that
 
02:11:35.189 --> 02:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
that language arguably grants to the
 
02:11:38.069 --> 02:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
attorney general
 
02:11:41.589 --> 02:11:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:45.910 --> 02:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:49.430 --> 02:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
okay i think those are concerns
 
02:11:52.790 --> 02:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
does the secretary of state's office um
 
02:11:57.189 --> 02:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
have a position that they want to
 
02:12:01.189 --> 02:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
set forth in regards to this provision
 
02:12:04.149 --> 02:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair we have concerns
 
02:12:05.750 --> 02:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
about this portion
 
02:12:09.750 --> 02:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
of the bill as well for the you know
 
02:12:12.149 --> 02:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
from the items that you mentioned um i i
 
02:12:14.709 --> 02:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
will let the committee know that
 
02:12:16.790 --> 02:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
that right now there is an opportunity
 
02:12:18.629 --> 02:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
to unseal
 
02:12:21.990 --> 02:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
ballot boxes if there are documents or
 
02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:23.350 align:start position:0%
ballot boxes if there are documents or
equipment

02:12:23.350 --> 02:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh that were left in them after the
 
02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:27.189 align:start position:0%
uh that were left in them after the
election

02:12:27.189 --> 02:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
election
 
02:12:29.430 --> 02:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
that are needed after the election and
 
02:12:31.669 --> 02:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
that process involves the secretary of
 
02:12:33.270 --> 02:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
state going
 
02:12:36.950 --> 02:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
to the town with witnesses on the boxes
 
02:12:39.030 --> 02:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
to retrieve those items
 
02:12:41.189 --> 02:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
and then seal them it's getting specific
 
02:12:42.390 --> 02:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
to the attorney general
 
02:12:44.709 --> 02:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
if there is a an investigation a
 
02:12:46.550 --> 02:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
criminal investigation
 
02:12:49.750 --> 02:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
that they are undertaking related to uh
 
02:12:53.109 --> 02:12:53.119 align:start position:0%
ballots or an election they do have the
 
02:12:55.030 --> 02:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go to the court
 
02:12:58.229 --> 02:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh and have the court grant an order
 
02:12:59.750 --> 02:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
that would allow them to open those
 
02:13:02.950 --> 02:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
boxes for that specific purpose
 
02:13:05.830 --> 02:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
aside from that the boxes after election
 
02:13:08.390 --> 02:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
and all appeals are over are sealed
 
02:13:10.790 --> 02:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
and they are kept for the mandatory 22
 
02:13:13.350 --> 02:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
months as required by federal law
 
02:13:15.189 --> 02:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
after the election at which point they
 
02:13:17.270 --> 02:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
are destroyed
 
02:13:19.270 --> 02:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
town election ballots are kept for 60
 
02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:23.510 align:start position:0%
town election ballots are kept for 60
days

02:13:23.510 --> 02:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:26.470 --> 02:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you comments or questions from
 
02:13:28.310 --> 02:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
02:13:32.470 --> 02:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:40.709 --> 02:13:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:44.550 --> 02:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
okay i'm gonna move on to section
 
02:13:48.550 --> 02:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
five which is a relative to the duties
 
02:13:51.669 --> 02:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
of the registrars of probate this
 
02:13:55.510 --> 02:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
actually probably did get the most
 
02:13:58.629 --> 02:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
public participation of all of the parts
 
02:14:02.390 --> 02:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
of this bill as i recall um
 
02:14:08.229 --> 02:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:11.669 --> 02:14:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:14.229 --> 02:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
representative tarosian thank you madam
 
02:14:14.239 --> 02:14:15.669 align:start position:0%
representative tarosian thank you madam
chair

02:14:15.669 --> 02:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:14:19.270 --> 02:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
um yeah well this this part five
 
02:14:22.470 --> 02:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
certainly uh makes this a true omnibus
 
02:14:23.750 --> 02:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
building that it doesn't have a lot to
 
02:14:25.430 --> 02:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
do with election law as far as i can
 
02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:26.069 align:start position:0%
do with election law as far as i can
tell

02:14:26.069 --> 02:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
tell
 
02:14:30.069 --> 02:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
but um but having said that um
 
02:14:32.629 --> 02:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
it is in the new hampshire constitution
 
02:14:33.910 --> 02:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
that each county have a
 
02:14:38.390 --> 02:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
register of probate that does
 
02:14:39.669 --> 02:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
the work that needs to be that's
 
02:14:41.430 --> 02:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
required under probate
 
02:14:44.310 --> 02:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
um and in 2011 we heard testimony that
 
02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:45.189 align:start position:0%
um and in 2011 we heard testimony that
that

02:14:45.189 --> 02:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:14:47.589 --> 02:14:47.599 align:start position:0%
uh responsibility got shifted to the
 
02:14:49.589 --> 02:14:49.599 align:start position:0%
circuit court
 
02:14:53.589 --> 02:14:53.599 align:start position:0%
area and um you know there's certainly
 
02:14:56.470 --> 02:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
in my mind there's some merit to putting
 
02:14:58.069 --> 02:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
it back where the constitution says it
 
02:14:59.430 --> 02:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
should be
 
02:15:02.550 --> 02:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
for one reason um like the rest of us in
 
02:15:03.430 --> 02:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
the room i
 
02:15:05.910 --> 02:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
took an oath to uphold the new hampshire
 
02:15:07.589 --> 02:15:07.599 align:start position:0%
constitution and it seems like
 
02:15:09.189 --> 02:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
this got put in the wrong place as far
 
02:15:11.109 --> 02:15:11.119 align:start position:0%
as the constitution was concerned
 
02:15:13.030 --> 02:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
but the other part is that we did also
 
02:15:14.470 --> 02:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
hear testimony that
 
02:15:16.310 --> 02:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
suggested and i've never been through
 
02:15:18.069 --> 02:15:18.079 align:start position:0%
the probate process so i can't speak
 
02:15:21.270 --> 02:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
um you know firsthand on that
 
02:15:24.870 --> 02:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
um is less responsive than it may
 
02:15:27.990 --> 02:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
have been in may and should be if it
 
02:15:29.910 --> 02:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
were if the process was where
 
02:15:32.629 --> 02:15:32.639 align:start position:0%
the constitution said it should be with
 
02:15:32.639 --> 02:15:33.030 align:start position:0%
the constitution said it should be with
the

02:15:33.030 --> 02:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:15:37.430 --> 02:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
um the register of probate um
 
02:15:39.910 --> 02:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
at the county level so that's my comment
 
02:15:42.069 --> 02:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
i you know i don't i'm not sure
 
02:15:45.270 --> 02:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
um you know the best way to handle this
 
02:15:47.109 --> 02:15:47.119 align:start position:0%
i know there's problems with with money
 
02:15:50.629 --> 02:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
um because this doesn't seem to fund
 
02:15:52.629 --> 02:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
if if we decide that this is what we
 
02:15:54.069 --> 02:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
should do
 
02:15:57.030 --> 02:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
there is not money to fund that that um
 
02:15:57.040 --> 02:15:57.830 align:start position:0%
there is not money to fund that that um
activity

02:15:57.830 --> 02:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
activity
 
02:16:01.030 --> 02:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
at the county level um and so that would
 
02:16:01.990 --> 02:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
be something that would have to be
 
02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:03.030 align:start position:0%
be something that would have to be
addressed

02:16:03.030 --> 02:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
02:16:04.870 --> 02:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
but anyway those are some of my thoughts
 
02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:16.229 --> 02:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:18.629 --> 02:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonald thank you madam
 
02:16:18.639 --> 02:16:19.350 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonald thank you madam
chairman

02:16:19.350 --> 02:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:16:23.189 --> 02:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
um i've uh you know talked to a number
 
02:16:24.390 --> 02:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
of people on this
 
02:16:28.629 --> 02:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
on this issue and you know
 
02:16:30.470 --> 02:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
this whole situation was changed
 
02:16:32.389 --> 02:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
originally for a reason
 
02:16:35.349 --> 02:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
expecting that effectively and i
 
02:16:37.110 --> 02:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
understand it's in the constitution an
 
02:16:38.549 --> 02:16:38.559 align:start position:0%
effort was made to take it out of the
 
02:16:40.230 --> 02:16:40.240 align:start position:0%
constitution and we know how
 
02:16:42.309 --> 02:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendments how successful
 
02:16:44.070 --> 02:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
they usually are
 
02:16:46.230 --> 02:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
but to bring this position back without
 
02:16:47.830 --> 02:16:47.840 align:start position:0%
a support staff
 
02:16:49.910 --> 02:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
without proper funding without any
 
02:16:51.990 --> 02:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
training without even a clear place
 
02:16:53.509 --> 02:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
as to where that person is going to be
 
02:16:55.910 --> 02:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
working i don't think makes any sense at
 
02:17:03.910 --> 02:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:07.750 --> 02:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:09.830 --> 02:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
i i guess my point on this section would
 
02:17:11.669 --> 02:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
be you either want it in or you want it
 
02:17:11.679 --> 02:17:11.990 align:start position:0%
be you either want it in or you want it
out

02:17:11.990 --> 02:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:17:13.750 --> 02:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know that it appeared to be a
 
02:17:15.669 --> 02:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
section that as
 
02:17:19.509 --> 02:17:19.519 align:start position:0%
to the um
 
02:17:22.150 --> 02:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
content of it itself that there was a
 
02:17:23.589 --> 02:17:23.599 align:start position:0%
lot of wordsmithing
 
02:17:33.990 --> 02:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:35.910 --> 02:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
representative growing representative
 
02:17:38.150 --> 02:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
brown can you unmute
 
02:17:39.990 --> 02:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
we we haven't heard you you need to add
 
02:17:41.190 --> 02:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
me great thank
 
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah i agree with
 
02:17:44.709 --> 02:17:44.719 align:start position:0%
representative mcdonald
 
02:17:47.910 --> 02:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
um that our constitution requires this
 
02:17:49.750 --> 02:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
and i wasn't very excited about it in
 
02:17:51.750 --> 02:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
2011 when we
 
02:17:53.270 --> 02:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
i remember dealing with this when i was
 
02:17:56.950 --> 02:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
in the senate but at this point
 
02:17:59.990 --> 02:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
it seems to me kind of like um
 
02:18:02.709 --> 02:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
requiring us to reintroduce brakeman
 
02:18:02.719 --> 02:18:03.110 align:start position:0%
requiring us to reintroduce brakeman
that

02:18:03.110 --> 02:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:18:05.509 --> 02:18:05.519 align:start position:0%
um would reside in the caboose of a
 
02:18:05.519 --> 02:18:06.389 align:start position:0%
um would reside in the caboose of a
train

02:18:06.389 --> 02:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
train
 
02:18:07.990 --> 02:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
that would have no function other than
 
02:18:09.429 --> 02:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
to sit there
 
02:18:13.030 --> 02:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
and i the the the responsibilities of
 
02:18:13.040 --> 02:18:13.910 align:start position:0%
and i the the the responsibilities of
this

02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:18:15.910 --> 02:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
of this position have been given to the
 
02:18:17.910 --> 02:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
court and
 
02:18:19.669 --> 02:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
for the most part i think we're going to
 
02:18:21.750 --> 02:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
have a person without a position
 
02:18:26.150 --> 02:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:29.110 --> 02:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
other questions or comments other than
 
02:18:30.309 --> 02:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
that i request
 
02:18:32.549 --> 02:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
permission to use putting somebody in
 
02:18:34.309 --> 02:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
the caboose with no breaks
 
02:18:42.230 --> 02:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:51.270 --> 02:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:55.270 --> 02:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
okay uh except except anybody else
 
02:18:57.270 --> 02:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
we will see it again madam chair no
 
02:18:58.709 --> 02:18:58.719 align:start position:0%
matter what happens no matter what
 
02:18:58.719 --> 02:19:00.309 align:start position:0%
matter what happens no matter what
happens

02:19:00.309 --> 02:19:00.319 align:start position:0%
happens
 
02:19:02.790 --> 02:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
we will we will maybe not in election
 
02:19:03.429 --> 02:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
law but
 
02:19:06.790 --> 02:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
it will be seen again all right any
 
02:19:06.800 --> 02:19:07.750 align:start position:0%
it will be seen again all right any
other

02:19:07.750 --> 02:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:19:10.389 --> 02:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
comments from community members all
 
02:19:12.870 --> 02:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
right we've had a
 
02:19:15.270 --> 02:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
i i think we've had a consensus on a
 
02:19:16.950 --> 02:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
couple of sections of bills
 
02:19:19.429 --> 02:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
as to changes that may need to be made
 
02:19:21.270 --> 02:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
we've had a couple of volunteers for
 
02:19:22.870 --> 02:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
amendments we've had somebody
 
02:19:25.990 --> 02:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
already do an amendment um
 
02:19:28.230 --> 02:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
and maybe persons are going to do other
 
02:19:30.629 --> 02:19:30.639 align:start position:0%
amendments on on different parts
 
02:19:32.629 --> 02:19:32.639 align:start position:0%
we will not be having an executive
 
02:19:34.549 --> 02:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
session next week
 
02:19:36.790 --> 02:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
um i'm not quite sure at this point when
 
02:19:38.469 --> 02:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
it's going to be scheduled but it will
 
02:19:40.709 --> 02:19:40.719 align:start position:0%
not be next week and part of the point
 
02:19:41.270 --> 02:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
of that
 
02:19:43.270 --> 02:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
was so that if people wanted to do
 
02:19:44.870 --> 02:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
further amendments
 
02:19:47.190 --> 02:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
or have some more discussions about this
 
02:19:49.510 --> 02:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
bill you have the ample opportunity to
 
02:19:52.230 --> 02:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
before executive session because i do
 
02:19:53.910 --> 02:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
anticipate we're going to have to deal
 
02:19:53.920 --> 02:19:54.790 align:start position:0%
anticipate we're going to have to deal
with

02:19:54.790 --> 02:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:19:58.070 --> 02:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
um probably series of amendments on
 
02:20:01.670 --> 02:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
various parts of these bills
 
02:20:04.070 --> 02:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
so i will let you know as soon as i've
 
02:20:06.469 --> 02:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
got it figured out for executive session
 
02:20:09.429 --> 02:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
i don't anticipate a need to meet as a
 
02:20:13.030 --> 02:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
committee before the executive session
 
02:20:14.950 --> 02:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any other business
 
02:20:16.550 --> 02:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
they want to bring before the committee
 
02:20:18.389 --> 02:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
this morning or this afternoon we did
 
02:20:20.309 --> 02:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
make it into afternoon
 
02:20:22.550 --> 02:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
i'm sure could i just ask that if people
 
02:20:24.870 --> 02:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
are preparing amendments that they
 
02:20:28.870 --> 02:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
distribute them as promptly as possible
 
02:20:33.270 --> 02:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:36.150 --> 02:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you and pam um if you're
 
02:20:38.790 --> 02:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
still on
 
02:20:41.910 --> 02:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
yes i just want to make it thank you
 
02:20:44.469 --> 02:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
um i want to make it clear that as to
 
02:20:44.479 --> 02:20:45.270 align:start position:0%
um i want to make it clear that as to
these

02:20:45.270 --> 02:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:20:47.830 --> 02:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
amendments we'd be dealing with them as
 
02:20:49.349 --> 02:20:49.359 align:start position:0%
we would with amendments in
 
02:20:51.590 --> 02:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
any bill if we're addressing as
 
02:20:53.590 --> 02:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
particular part of a bill
 
02:20:57.270 --> 02:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
and we have successive successive
 
02:20:59.830 --> 02:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
amendments um that they would
 
02:21:00.790 --> 02:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
essentially be
 
02:21:04.790 --> 02:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
overlaid as to the previous amendments
 
02:21:08.710 --> 02:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
um and then incorporated into
 
02:21:12.150 --> 02:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
the final house bill as amended do i
 
02:21:13.750 --> 02:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
have that process correct
 
02:21:17.190 --> 02:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
or not well if i understood you
 
02:21:20.309 --> 02:21:20.319 align:start position:0%
um yes i mean i think
 
02:21:23.830 --> 02:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
if you have multiple amendments
 
02:21:26.150 --> 02:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
that are adopted to one of the omnibus
 
02:21:28.150 --> 02:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
bills they would need to be unified
 
02:21:30.150 --> 02:21:30.160 align:start position:0%
after the executive session into a
 
02:21:31.990 --> 02:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
single amendment
 
02:21:34.389 --> 02:21:34.399 align:start position:0%
that would appear in the house calendar
 
02:21:36.710 --> 02:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
they would not be
 
02:21:38.950 --> 02:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
remain as separate amendments for the
 
02:21:41.190 --> 02:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
individual parts of the omnibus they'd
 
02:21:42.070 --> 02:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
all be
 
02:21:45.110 --> 02:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
rolled into one but each individual
 
02:21:47.349 --> 02:21:47.359 align:start position:0%
amendment that is worked on
 
02:21:49.670 --> 02:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
you know it makes sense to to address
 
02:21:49.680 --> 02:21:50.710 align:start position:0%
you know it makes sense to to address
them

02:21:50.710 --> 02:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:21:53.990 --> 02:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
as a single part okay
 
02:21:56.150 --> 02:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
that's what you're asking and i i would
 
02:21:58.230 --> 02:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
ask that that any amendments that come
 
02:22:01.830 --> 02:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
through um if people could include me on
 
02:22:03.750 --> 02:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
the distribution list i'm not on the
 
02:22:05.590 --> 02:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
committee distribution list but it would
 
02:22:06.550 --> 02:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
be helpful if
 
02:22:09.590 --> 02:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
if i had them so i can
 
02:22:11.510 --> 02:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
make sure they're in the the room for
 
02:22:13.110 --> 02:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
