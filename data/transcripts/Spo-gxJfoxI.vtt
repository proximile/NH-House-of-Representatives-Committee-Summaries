three one five nine seven eight it's the
 
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:44.700 align:start position:0%
amendment to Senate Bill 11 that we had
 
00:08:47.269 --> 00:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
a lot of discussion about
 
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
um the last time we met and we had a
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
little straw poll on uh this is the
 
00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
amendment supported by the the division
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
supported by the prime sponsor uh that
 
00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:02.580 align:start position:0%
takes virtually all of the prime
 
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:04.740 align:start position:0%
sponsors language puts it into the right
 
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:07.380 align:start position:0%
parts of the RSA
 
00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
and uh calls for
 
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
um the consultation with descendants and
 
00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
descendant Community prior to excavation
 
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
and exploration of any historical or
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
unmarked African-American or other newly
 
00:09:24.889 --> 00:09:24.899 align:start position:0%
discovered Graves essentially uh
 
00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
preserves current practice into statute
 
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
as I believe representative wrong points
 
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
out we want to make sure that if any
 
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
changes in the Staffing
 
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
occurs that we preserve what we all
 
00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:41.519 align:start position:0%
believe to be good current practice so
 
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:44.220 align:start position:0%
if anything like what happened in I
 
00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:46.580 align:start position:0%
believe Portsmouth any
 
00:09:48.829 --> 00:09:48.839 align:start position:0%
uncovered African-American Graves or
 
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
other Graves that we continue to have
 
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
that good practice so we want to
 
00:09:56.269 --> 00:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
preserve what's a very good bill brought
 
00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:00.420 align:start position:0%
forth by the sponsors so we take this
 
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
language and codify it and that's what
 
00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:05.220 align:start position:0%
this amendment does so I asked for the
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
continued bipartisan support it was
 
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
bipartisan sponsor ship from the Senate
 
00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:12.180 align:start position:0%
and I look back through send a testimony
 
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
and our testimony and I didn't find
 
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
anybody who actually came out
 
00:10:17.329 --> 00:10:17.339 align:start position:0%
specifically against some form of
 
00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
passing the bill so that's what this
 
00:10:22.009 --> 00:10:22.019 align:start position:0%
does it gets us to a good passage so
 
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
thanks thank my colleagues for
 
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:25.800 align:start position:0%

executive session
 
00:14:41.329 --> 00:14:41.339 align:start position:0%
now we have to wait here for another two
 
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
hours in order to collect our mileage so
 
00:14:48.769 --> 00:14:48.779 align:start position:0%
I'm only kidding
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
were there some bills from our committee
 
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
that are rumored or known to be off
 
00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:58.910 align:start position:0%
that are rumored or known to be off
consent

00:14:58.910 --> 00:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
consent
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
yes there are there are but we don't
 
00:15:05.689 --> 00:15:05.699 align:start position:0%
have a hearing to open on those bills so
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
I recommend that we meet in our
 
00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
individual caucuses and then the chair
 
00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:14.220 align:start position:0%
and I will meet if that's okay with the
