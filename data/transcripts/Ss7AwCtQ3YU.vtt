00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:06.540 align:start position:0%

escalind with the Alzheimer's
 
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
Association here in New Hampshire uh as
 
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:22.980 align:start position:0%
the chair said we have been working to
 
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
sort of resurrect this subcommittee of
 
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:27.540 align:start position:0%
HHS oversight that is focused on
 
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:29.720 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's disease and other dementias
 
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:32.700 align:start position:0%
this is something that Most states have
 
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:34.740 align:start position:0%
uh either a subcommittee or a commission
 
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
focused on these issues and it allows
 
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:41.220 align:start position:0%
them to do a really deep dive on these
 
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:43.140 align:start position:0%
issues that are that are becoming more
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
and more prevalent and certainly for our
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
state that is applicable so at the last
 
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:52.140 align:start position:0%
meeting of this committee I made my
 
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
presentation and the chair
 
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
um very generously said that you know
 
00:10:58.910 --> 00:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
sort of keep keep up the work in terms
 
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
of doing Outreach and letting people
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
know that this is an effort underway uh
 
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:04.740 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to report that
 
00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:06.779 align:start position:0%
appointments have been made by several
 
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:08.700 align:start position:0%
of the associations charged with making
 
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
appointments and I spoke with the Senate
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
president's office yesterday and I know
 
00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:15.180 align:start position:0%
that Senator avard has graciously agreed
 
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:17.160 align:start position:0%
to to serve again on the subcommittee
 
00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
which is incredibly appreciated
 
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
um I am aware it was flagged for me by
 
00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
Mr Williams that the website
 
00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:27.300 align:start position:0%
um the subcommittee website needs
 
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:28.740 align:start position:0%
updating to reflect some of those
 
00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839 align:start position:0%
appointments so I will be flagging that
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
for the clerk's office
 
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
um and the two sort of positions that we
 
00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:38.420 align:start position:0%
have yet to identify someone to fill is
 
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
the person living with Alzheimer's
 
00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
disease many of the folks that I am
 
00:11:45.650 --> 00:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
working directly with are not really in
 
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:47.940 align:start position:0%
a position where that would be
 
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
um something that they are are
 
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:52.380 align:start position:0%
comfortable doing so that search still
 
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
exists as well as a researcher with
 
00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:57.180 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's related expertise in base
 
00:11:59.329 --> 00:11:59.339 align:start position:0%
basic transitional clinical or drug
 
00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
development science still looking to
 
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
find find an individual that fits that
 
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.290 align:start position:0%
find find an individual that fits that
bill

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:05.300 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
so that's what I'm working on I
 
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
certainly would appreciate and welcome
 
00:12:12.829 --> 00:12:12.839 align:start position:0%
any guidance or thoughts that the
 
00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
committee members had in terms of folks
 
00:12:17.569 --> 00:12:17.579 align:start position:0%
who might be appropriate but that that
 
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
is where things stand right now so the
 
00:12:21.889 --> 00:12:21.899 align:start position:0%
hope is that we get those final
 
00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
appointments made and would work with
 
00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
Senator avard to find a time to to get
 
00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:30.180 align:start position:0%
this back up and running
 
00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:36.290 align:start position:0%
this back up and running
foreign

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
give you a few minutes to read through
 
00:12:52.129 --> 00:12:52.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
I don't see a hand I see a hand
 
00:12:58.610 --> 00:12:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.810 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:26.449 --> 00:13:26.459 align:start position:0%
the chair would have no difficulty in
 
00:13:29.449 --> 00:13:29.459 align:start position:0%
that as an adjunct member many of these
 
00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:31.980 align:start position:0%
committees rarely take votes anyway so
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
bringing in a few extra hands is I think
 
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
always helpful or always can be helpful
 
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
would you be amenable to that oh
 
00:13:43.009 --> 00:13:43.019 align:start position:0%
absolutely I think I think the more we
 
00:13:44.569 --> 00:13:44.579 align:start position:0%
can pull together the better the product
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
of the two pharmacists currently serving
 
00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
in the House of Representatives
 
00:13:53.569 --> 00:13:53.579 align:start position:0%
and all other pharmacists known to us do
 
00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
you have a recommendation
 
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.110 align:start position:0%
you have a recommendation
type

00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
type
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%

and I will give you leave to do that and
 
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
just Loop me back in as you make that
 
00:14:20.389 --> 00:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
known to
 
00:14:25.790 --> 00:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
good thank you wonderful thank you all
 
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
so much
 
00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
and once again members of this committee
 
00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:33.060 align:start position:0%
from the house we have one house
 
00:14:36.769 --> 00:14:36.779 align:start position:0%
appointment so if you're interested I
 
00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:39.959 align:start position:0%
don't see like anyone's
 
00:14:41.389 --> 00:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
well that's
 
00:14:44.569 --> 00:14:44.579 align:start position:0%
I wanted to give the opportunity to
 
00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:46.620 align:start position:0%
members of this committee as well but
 
00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
I've already had a conversation with
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
representative long about this so okay
 
00:14:53.389 --> 00:14:53.399 align:start position:0%
good I think that yes representative
 
00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:55.860 align:start position:0%
Edwards uh so in the minutes from last
 
00:14:58.090 --> 00:14:58.100 align:start position:0%
month I said if representative long
 
00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:01.019 align:start position:0%
wasn't interested and it sounds like he
 
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.000 align:start position:0%
is yeah it's very much so easy okay
 
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
never mind thank you
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
um it has long been the custom at DHHS
 
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:12.660 align:start position:0%
for the name Laurie to dominate
 
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
um but I have it on good authority that
 
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
the name Melissa or it's
 
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
elegant version morissa is the coming
 
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
name over there and to demonstrate that
 
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
today we have associate commissioner
 
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
Marissa hen a jolly good fellow fellow
 
00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
to make the commissioner's reports
 
00:15:35.329 --> 00:15:35.339 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:37.740 align:start position:0%
and yes thank you on I want to send
 
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
regards from commissioner Lori Weber who
 
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
has the governor's Commission on Alcohol
 
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
and Other Drugs happening simultaneously
 
00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
so and first I think want to while we
 
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:49.380 align:start position:0%
won't go in depth on this just want to
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the historic bipartisan
 
00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
budget that was signed this week and
 
00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:56.100 align:start position:0%
it's important implications for dhhs's
 
00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.230 align:start position:0%
it's important implications for dhhs's
Mission

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
Mission
 
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
um and um and the people we we serve so
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
so that's not the topic of the updates I
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
was asked to provide but I think it
 
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
Bears mentioning and and our gratitude
 
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
to those involved
 
00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
so there were two topics that
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
um I was asked to provide some brief
 
00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
updates and answer any questions about
 
00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:16.620 align:start position:0%
today one of which may actually kind of
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
shorten your agenda because I thought I
 
00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:20.820 align:start position:0%
would cover the Youth Development Center
 
00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:22.310 align:start position:0%
would cover the Youth Development Center
here

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
um in lieu of covering it as an agenda
 
00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:26.100 align:start position:0%
item although happy to go into more
 
00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:28.860 align:start position:0%
depth on any of this
 
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
but the first topic um is the
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
Department's opening of New Hampshire's
 
00:16:36.769 --> 00:16:36.779 align:start position:0%
first ever psychiatric Residential
 
00:16:39.769 --> 00:16:39.779 align:start position:0%
Treatment Facility or prtf
 
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
um this is a huge moment for our
 
00:16:46.189 --> 00:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
children's system of care
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
um in the behavioral health realm
 
00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
um just about a month ago the state had
 
00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:54.380 align:start position:0%
a ribbon cutting the governor joined us
 
00:16:58.129 --> 00:16:58.139 align:start position:0%
others from the community leaders like
 
00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:00.779 align:start position:0%
yourself representative Pearson to open
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
this new unit if you will but really a
 
00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
separate and distinct part of that
 
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
Hampstead campus which is offering our
 
00:17:12.409 --> 00:17:12.419 align:start position:0%
first ever highest level of Residential
 
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
Care this is designed for youth who are
 
00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:18.079 align:start position:0%
between the ages of 5 and 21
 
00:17:20.929 --> 00:17:20.939 align:start position:0%
whose Behavioral Health needs cannot be
 
00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
met in a community setting or in our
 
00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:25.020 align:start position:0%
other existing levels of Residential
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
Care in many cases these are youth who
 
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:29.940 align:start position:0%
are stepping down from an inpatient
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
psychiatric level of care but not quite
 
00:17:34.130 --> 00:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
ready to return to their home
 
00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:36.230 align:start position:0%
ready to return to their home
communities

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
um and it's a very family-centered model
 
00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
of care as well families are involved at
 
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
every step
 
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
um I think one of the key things that
 
00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
makes this such a huge step forward for
 
00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire is the fact
 
00:17:51.049 --> 00:17:51.059 align:start position:0%
that previously when a young person
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
needed this level of care because it
 
00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
wasn't available in New Hampshire and
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
because there are long long wait lists
 
00:17:58.610 --> 00:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
and unavailability in our neighboring
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
states we often had to send them to
 
00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:03.900 align:start position:0%
States Far Far Away thousands of miles
 
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
away which is not conducive to the types
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
of connections with the community that
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
we are all committed to and the
 
00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:11.460 align:start position:0%
day-to-day involvement of their families
 
00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:13.980 align:start position:0%
so this is a really important step for
 
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
us and um and we are slowly ramping up
 
00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:18.660 align:start position:0%
to make sure operations are smooth it
 
00:18:21.169 --> 00:18:21.179 align:start position:0%
will eventually have 12 beds currently
 
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
there are five youth there today
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
um and week by week as we get in Rhythm
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
we will we will keep increasing that
 
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.090 align:start position:0%
we will we will keep increasing that
census

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
census
 
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
um so I'll pause there on the prtf and
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
00:18:43.029 --> 00:18:43.039 align:start position:0%
the this facility is it isn't secure
 
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:45.480 align:start position:0%
so it is
 
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
um it is not it is it is secure in so
 
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
far as it is designed
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
um to keep youth within the facility
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
it's not like a place people can come
 
00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:55.919 align:start position:0%
and go
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
um so it offers a delayed egress store
 
00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
um partly to meet fire code so it's not
 
00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:04.140 align:start position:0%
a completely shut down lock door in the
 
00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
way of an inpatient psychiatric unit
 
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
um but it is still um has many security
 
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
units it also is compliant with all of
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
the aspects of the zero suicide model in
 
00:19:16.669 --> 00:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
the sense of all of the aspects of the
 
00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
facility are designed to ensure safety
 
00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:21.900 align:start position:0%
for a population that is at risk for
 
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.110 align:start position:0%
for a population that is at risk for
suicide

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
suicide
 
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you so uh what I what I
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
think I'm hearing in that is the patient
 
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
cannot leave without being permitted to
 
00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
leave that the doors are locked until
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
unless there's an emergency that's
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
exactly right okay so then
 
00:19:43.669 --> 00:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
um the other part of this is
 
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
um commitment Authority uh to what
 
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
extent uh can the patient refuse to be
 
00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
committed to this level of care uh to
 
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
what extent are parent approvals and
 
00:19:59.810 --> 00:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
permissions required to what extent does
 
00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
the state or the medical community make
 
00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
the determination yeah so all of the
 
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
youth who are um served in the prtf are
 
00:20:12.529 --> 00:20:12.539 align:start position:0%
there voluntarily meaning they are there
 
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
based on their own understanding and
 
00:20:16.669 --> 00:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
commitment to treatment as well as that
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
of um parents and Guardians in the case
 
00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
of minors that's a little bit in
 
00:20:24.529 --> 00:20:24.539 align:start position:0%
contrast to the option to explore or
 
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
involuntary Care at the inpatient level
 
00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:29.100 align:start position:0%
that you may be familiar with which is
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
extremely rare that we're in a situation
 
00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:34.740 align:start position:0%
of um of Youth requiring
 
00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:36.780 align:start position:0%
um to be admitted involuntarily but for
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:40.799 --> 00:20:42.250 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:42.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
so yeah that's also encouraging to know
 
00:20:48.169 --> 00:20:48.179 align:start position:0%
that the committee overseeing it is now
 
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
going to have public meetings and
 
00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
listening sessions and talking sessions
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
with the residents of Hampstead that's
 
00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
right and actually that connects to the
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
second topic which is also centered on
 
00:21:00.529 --> 00:21:00.539 align:start position:0%
that campus
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
um which is the Youth Development Center
 
00:21:05.930 --> 00:21:05.940 align:start position:0%
um so as many of you are deeply involved
 
00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
with especially representative Edwards
 
00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
um this past legislative session was a
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
very important one in terms of moving
 
00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:16.260 align:start position:0%
our department and our Collective Vision
 
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
forward for moving from a correctional
 
00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:23.220 align:start position:0%
model of care into a therapeutic smaller
 
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
but architecturally secure facility
 
00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
for youth involved in the Juvenile
 
00:21:30.049 --> 00:21:30.059 align:start position:0%
Justice System
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
um so through passage of HB 49 we
 
00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
receive legislative approval as well as
 
00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
the Appropriations to build this new
 
00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
center and to close the current the
 
00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
current YDC facility and so just wanted
 
00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:45.780 align:start position:0%
to update this group since a lot has
 
00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
happened and we also did provide a
 
00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
report a letter to you representative
 
00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:52.380 align:start position:0%
Pearson on the progress that is made but
 
00:21:54.289 --> 00:21:54.299 align:start position:0%
just wanted to highlight a few aspects
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
and answer any questions
 
00:21:58.850 --> 00:21:58.860 align:start position:0%
um so the first step since passage of HB
 
00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
49 was that we brought on smrt
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
Architects and Engineers to complete a
 
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
site assessment analysis to determine
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
the feasibility of three potential
 
00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
locations for this Youth Development
 
00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
Center which representative Pearson is
 
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
uh is just was displaying
 
00:22:18.529 --> 00:22:18.539 align:start position:0%
um and they did a very in-depth analysis
 
00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
um many technical specifications
 
00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:22.860 align:start position:0%
examination of different criteria Etc
 
00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:25.500 align:start position:0%
and we as a department released that
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
um just about a month ago
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
um and that assessment concluded that
 
00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
the Hampstead Hospital and residential
 
00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
treatment facility campus that I was
 
00:22:36.289 --> 00:22:36.299 align:start position:0%
just telling you about the prtf residing
 
00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:39.780 align:start position:0%
on would be the best option among those
 
00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:41.940 align:start position:0%
three for the location nation of this
 
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
future YDC
 
00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
um since we last met
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
um under sb1 which passed prior to hb49
 
00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
a commission has been formed
 
00:22:58.730 --> 00:22:58.740 align:start position:0%
um that is chaired by Senator Birdsell
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
um to study the community impacts and
 
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
various considerations of that site and
 
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
The Wider Community context so things
 
00:23:07.549 --> 00:23:07.559 align:start position:0%
like Public Safety Etc and that
 
00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
commission which I sit on had its first
 
00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:13.380 align:start position:0%
meeting just about a week ago and to
 
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
your point representative Pearson is
 
00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
going to be a crucial group for
 
00:23:18.409 --> 00:23:18.419 align:start position:0%
providing it includes a number of
 
00:23:20.409 --> 00:23:20.419 align:start position:0%
different leaders from law enforcement
 
00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
from the provider advocacy community
 
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
members of the House and Senate Etc to
 
00:23:29.330 --> 00:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
ensure that we are taking a thoughtful
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
approach as we launch into this next
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
phase of design and construction of the
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
facility so a report is due by November
 
00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
it sounds like Senator bird cell is
 
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
pretty committed to getting that in
 
00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
sooner and part of the reason for that
 
00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:42.780 align:start position:0%
is that we're we're trying to move
 
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly here
 
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
um one of the timing constraints is that
 
00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:49.860 align:start position:0%
the federal arpa dollars the coven
 
00:23:51.770 --> 00:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
relief dollars that are being
 
00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
um used in large part to build this
 
00:23:57.649 --> 00:23:57.659 align:start position:0%
facility need to be spent by 2026 and
 
00:24:00.529 --> 00:24:00.539 align:start position:0%
need to be um need to be dedicated uh by
 
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
the end of 2025. so in order to do that
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
with a with a facility of this scope and
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
size and complex population we need to
 
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
hit the ground running on the design
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
process and that's exactly what we've
 
00:24:13.370 --> 00:24:13.380 align:start position:0%
done and what we will engage this
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
Commission in
 
00:24:17.149 --> 00:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
um the other update is last Wednesday
 
00:24:20.330 --> 00:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
about 10 days ago governor and Council
 
00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
approved our contract our selection of
 
00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:26.220 align:start position:0%
HDR as the Architecture Firm to do the
 
00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919 align:start position:0%
design process for this um for this
 
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
build and they have a long history of
 
00:24:33.049 --> 00:24:33.059 align:start position:0%
work both in the Juvenile Justice space
 
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:35.940 align:start position:0%
but also in New Hampshire and so now
 
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of knitting together all
 
00:24:39.289 --> 00:24:39.299 align:start position:0%
the pieces ensuring that the voice of
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
local community Through Community
 
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
meetings and consultation are very much
 
00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
present as well as the work of the
 
00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:47.700 align:start position:0%
commission which is helping deepen our
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
focus on the the critical aspects and
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
impacts of this facility but we'll be
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
moving quickly but feel good about the
 
00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:56.580 align:start position:0%
process and the the effectuation of the
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
vision that we've shared for a long time
 
00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:08.460 align:start position:0%
is there anything that the legislature
 
00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
can do to eliminate any potential
 
00:25:13.669 --> 00:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
barriers or roadblocks that would slow
 
00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
or impede the design and and
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
construction process what can we do to
 
00:25:24.409 --> 00:25:24.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:28.140 align:start position:0%
you want an HP 49 was a was a critical
 
00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
first level of leadership to setting us
 
00:25:33.529 --> 00:25:33.539 align:start position:0%
up and providing the funding to do this
 
00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:35.100 align:start position:0%
work well but
 
00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
um I think right now we're all largely
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
on the same page I mean I think that
 
00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:40.860 align:start position:0%
we're seeing we have a good precedent
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
with the forensic hospital that's being
 
00:25:44.029 --> 00:25:44.039 align:start position:0%
built here in Concord to realize that
 
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:46.380 align:start position:0%
it's it's critical to be consultative
 
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
with everyone who's involved everyone
 
00:25:51.289 --> 00:25:51.299 align:start position:0%
who's impacted early and often and that
 
00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
will continue to be our approach not
 
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
just with elected representatives but
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
with local community with um with with
 
00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
schools with law enforcement Etc so I'll
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
let you know but I think for right now
 
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
we're grateful for the support that's
 
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
even gotten us to this point
 
00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and could you just remind me
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
of the timeline
 
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
um you said funds designated by 2025 I'm
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping they will be Des I mean I
 
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:22.860 align:start position:0%
know that there's been an appropriation
 
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
but uh if you could just give me a quick
 
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
overview of the timeline yeah I thought
 
00:26:28.669 --> 00:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
you might ask that so I actually brought
 
00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:30.900 align:start position:0%
it um so we are currently in what is
 
00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
called the pre-design phase which is
 
00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:34.980 align:start position:0%
June to August 2023 and by the way I'll
 
00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
send this around so it gets captured in
 
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
your minutes so this summer is
 
00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
pre-design Phase August to October 2023
 
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
is the schematic phase where this design
 
00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:46.460 align:start position:0%
actually comes to life through actual uh
 
00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
Vision documents October to January will
 
00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:52.020 align:start position:0%
be our completion of our design
 
00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:53.940 align:start position:0%
development um don't ask me what that
 
00:26:55.789 --> 00:26:55.799 align:start position:0%
means The Architects tell me it's the
 
00:26:57.769 --> 00:26:57.779 align:start position:0%
next phase in bringing together the
 
00:26:59.810 --> 00:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
pre-design and schematic
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
um and then we go on and I should
 
00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
mention by the way that this is not
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
reliant on my expertise as a engineer
 
00:27:06.289 --> 00:27:06.299 align:start position:0%
which are non-existent we are working
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
with the division of Public Works and
 
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
Das to oversee all the different aspects
 
00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:13.740 align:start position:0%
of this design and build so January to
 
00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
May is when the construction
 
00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
preparation process begins that's when
 
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
we will be procuring for we'll do a
 
00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
competitive procurement for a contractor
 
00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:25.620 align:start position:0%
to actually build the facility we'll be
 
00:27:27.649 --> 00:27:27.659 align:start position:0%
doing all the necessary checks and
 
00:27:30.529 --> 00:27:30.539 align:start position:0%
engineer civil engineering and so forth
 
00:27:33.289 --> 00:27:33.299 align:start position:0%
to prepare for construction next January
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
through May we expect to bring a
 
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
contract a proposed contract to governor
 
00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
and Council next summer
 
00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:44.520 align:start position:0%
and have a notice to proceed immediately
 
00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:47.220 align:start position:0%
thereafter so essentially that would set
 
00:27:50.289 --> 00:27:50.299 align:start position:0%
us up to begin construction
 
00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:55.559 align:start position:0%
next fall and be halfway done hopefully
 
00:27:58.970 --> 00:27:58.980 align:start position:0%
by early 2025 fully completed by the end
 
00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
of 2025 so that's that you sort of see
 
00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
where the federal covid money deadlines
 
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
fit into that it sets us up to be able
 
00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
to be clear about how we're dedicating
 
00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:10.740 align:start position:0%
them and then actually expend the dollar
 
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
dollars by by the deadline which is uh
 
00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:17.580 align:start position:0%
end of 2026.
 
00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:19.980 align:start position:0%
um so our our hope is to be completed by
 
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
November 2025 and begin moving in youth
 
00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:26.220 align:start position:0%
um at the end of 2025 giving us a little
 
00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:28.919 align:start position:0%
bit more time to do all the bookkeeping
 
00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
and ensure all payments are made within
 
00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:32.940 align:start position:0%
that Federal deadline does that help yes
 
00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'm I'm although the
 
00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:37.740 align:start position:0%
federal deadlines are really important
 
00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
and much more uh interested in when it's
 
00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:43.860 align:start position:0%
going to be open and receiving the youth
 
00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%
who need the treatment exactly Senator
 
00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald thank you thank you Mr chair
 
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.049 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald thank you thank you Mr chair
um

00:28:53.049 --> 00:28:53.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
so we appropriated a little under 22
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars House Bill 2 made a
 
00:29:03.049 --> 00:29:03.059 align:start position:0%
further restriction on those funds and
 
00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
said it really had to only be arpa funds
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:10.980 align:start position:0%
amount of money
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
um going to be all that is needed for
 
00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:16.919 align:start position:0%
that project because there's no
 
00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
opportunity at this point for any other
 
00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
funds yeah my understanding is that
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
based on our current estimates we have
 
00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:25.980 align:start position:0%
updated with dasp or the changes in
 
00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:28.140 align:start position:0%
supply chain and labor on that we are in
 
00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:34.380 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
00:29:37.310 --> 00:29:37.320 align:start position:0%
okay so so I am interested in the money
 
00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:38.940 align:start position:0%
part as well
 
00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:40.980 align:start position:0%
um when we're talking about Federal
 
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
money oftentimes what they use uh the
 
00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:47.940 align:start position:0%
end of a year as 30 September
 
00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:50.940 align:start position:0%
and it sounded to me like in your use of
 
00:29:52.850 --> 00:29:52.860 align:start position:0%
the phrase end of the year you're
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
talking about the end of December so so
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
are you I I assume you all are paying
 
00:30:00.769 --> 00:30:00.779 align:start position:0%
attention to if there's any sort of
 
00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:02.820 align:start position:0%
fiscal year deadlines that come before
 
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to speak incorrectly
 
00:30:10.669 --> 00:30:10.679 align:start position:0%
but I will assure you that our finance
 
00:30:12.169 --> 00:30:12.179 align:start position:0%
team does have
 
00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:14.220 align:start position:0%
um or does have the dates correct so but
 
00:30:21.289 --> 00:30:21.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:26.029 --> 00:30:26.039 align:start position:0%
anything else from the Commissioner's
 
00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:28.140 align:start position:0%
Office no thanks for your time good
 
00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:35.220 align:start position:0%

morning

00:31:07.789 --> 00:31:07.799 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:31:09.889 --> 00:31:09.899 align:start position:0%
um thanks again for this opportunity
 
00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:11.940 align:start position:0%
Jenny and I have put together a few
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
slides in the slide deck that you have
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
in front of you to address the growing
 
00:31:18.169 --> 00:31:18.179 align:start position:0%
concerns that we all share around social
 
00:31:21.169 --> 00:31:21.179 align:start position:0%
media and mental health I especially
 
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
want to thank representative Edwards who
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
has been interested in this issue for
 
00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:27.720 align:start position:0%
quite some time and he has urged the
 
00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:30.860 align:start position:0%
department to take action in this space
 
00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
we have done so much in the past couple
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
of years to address the acute mental
 
00:31:39.169 --> 00:31:39.179 align:start position:0%
health needs of young people and adults
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
in the state we're just hearing about it
 
00:31:42.769 --> 00:31:42.779 align:start position:0%
from associate commissioner hen right
 
00:31:45.649 --> 00:31:45.659 align:start position:0%
now but the evidence is growing that
 
00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
there is more to be done to build
 
00:31:50.269 --> 00:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
protective factors long before there are
 
00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:52.820 align:start position:0%
acute needs that require complex
 
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:56.120 align:start position:0%
expensive treatment and interventions
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
this is why it makes sense to look at
 
00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
this issue around social media with a
 
00:32:03.769 --> 00:32:03.779 align:start position:0%
public health framework using data to
 
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
develop smart prevention messaging and
 
00:32:09.409 --> 00:32:09.419 align:start position:0%
appropriate policies you have a ton of
 
00:32:11.149 --> 00:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
slides in front of you and we are not
 
00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
going to go through each one of those
 
00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
we're happy always to take questions and
 
00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
have more conversation but I understand
 
00:32:18.649 --> 00:32:18.659 align:start position:0%
you have a very long agenda and it is a
 
00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:20.820 align:start position:0%
beautiful June day outside so we're
 
00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
going to focus on three things we're
 
00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
going to focus a little bit on level
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
setting what the data is some of the
 
00:32:27.289 --> 00:32:27.299 align:start position:0%
that highlights where some of our
 
00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
concerns are we're going to focus on the
 
00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:31.919 align:start position:0%
surgeon general's advisory and three
 
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
what our plans are for addressing it in
 
00:32:36.289 --> 00:32:36.299 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire especially through the
 
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
governor's new executive order as you
 
00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
flip to slides two three and four you'll
 
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:43.500 align:start position:0%
see what you already know screens are
 
00:32:45.169 --> 00:32:45.179 align:start position:0%
everywhere and social media is
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
ubiquitous the American Academy of
 
00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics has been focused on issues of
 
00:32:51.889 --> 00:32:51.899 align:start position:0%
media exposure long before the Advent of
 
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
Tick Tock but now that more than 80 90
 
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:56.760 align:start position:0%
percent of Youth are on their personal
 
00:33:00.049 --> 00:33:00.059 align:start position:0%
devices for hours and hours a day the
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
problem is compound founded youth are
 
00:33:04.730 --> 00:33:04.740 align:start position:0%
bombarded with targeted messaging and
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
the algorithms themselves are designed
 
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
to keep you scrolling and to put eyes on
 
00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:10.789 align:start position:0%
to keep you scrolling and to put eyes on
products

00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
products
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
and to promote potentially harmful
 
00:33:14.519 --> 00:33:16.810 align:start position:0%
and to promote potentially harmful
messaging

00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:16.820 align:start position:0%
messaging
 
00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
Slide Five in particular illustrates
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
that one of the differences between our
 
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
old worries about media and TV screen
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
time for example is the very
 
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
personalized algorithms and the
 
00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
opportunity for direct for harmful
 
00:33:36.529 --> 00:33:36.539 align:start position:0%
direct messaging girls in particular are
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
in the crosshairs with almost 30 percent
 
00:33:40.909 --> 00:33:40.919 align:start position:0%
of girls in New Hampshire High Schools
 
00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:43.559 align:start position:0%
reporting cyber bullying it is
 
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
interesting that it appears that this
 
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
happens more at younger ages 9th grade
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
has the highest rates again this is
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
youth risk behavioral Behavior survey
 
00:33:55.009 --> 00:33:55.019 align:start position:0%
the survey that we do in high schools
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
across the state we all lived through
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
Middle School all of us although it was
 
00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:02.519 align:start position:0%
quite a long time ago for some of us and
 
00:34:05.389 --> 00:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
those early years but many of us even
 
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
then we're just sort of happy to get
 
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
through the school day the difference
 
00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
now is that those messages
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
and potentially bullying Behavior
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
follows you the rest of the day no
 
00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:17.220 align:start position:0%
matter where you are you're at home
 
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
you're at night in bed you wake up in
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
the morning that device is there and
 
00:34:22.609 --> 00:34:22.619 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity for those
 
00:34:25.609 --> 00:34:25.619 align:start position:0%
messages harmful Behavior to follow you
 
00:34:25.619 --> 00:34:27.050 align:start position:0%
messages harmful Behavior to follow you
wherever

00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:27.060 align:start position:0%
wherever
 
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
and of course the most concerning data
 
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
that we've seen is around the dramatic
 
00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of Youth who are
 
00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:37.740 align:start position:0%
feeling sad or hopeless this pattern
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
began well before the pandemic although
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
we've sort of talked about it in the
 
00:34:43.490 --> 00:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
framework of the pandemic but you can
 
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
see on on slide six that that trend line
 
00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:48.899 align:start position:0%
was going in the wrong direction before
 
00:34:51.409 --> 00:34:51.419 align:start position:0%
um and we are now in an unfathomable
 
00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
place where more than half of girls high
 
00:34:56.389 --> 00:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
school girls are feeling sad or hopeless
 
00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
in contrast to cyber bullying the data
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
suggests or appears to have more of a
 
00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:03.060 align:start position:0%
cumulative effect where older students
 
00:35:04.849 --> 00:35:04.859 align:start position:0%
are impacted more than younger students
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
and I know Jenny you want to talk a
 
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
little bit about this and and yeah I
 
00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:10.380 align:start position:0%
think just in terms of our crisis lines
 
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
for Behavioral Health we're seeing
 
00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:13.740 align:start position:0%
similar Trends to what you're seeing
 
00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
here in the youth risk behavior survey
 
00:35:18.589 --> 00:35:18.599 align:start position:0%
of who is calling I also will say that
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
we and we'll get into this in in just a
 
00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
moment too where teens also find out
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
about resources and ask for help through
 
00:35:28.609 --> 00:35:28.619 align:start position:0%
these their devices right and so that's
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
another critical important piece to talk
 
00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:32.220 align:start position:0%
about what are some of the positive
 
00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
aspects because they're not going away
 
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
so what are the ways that people also
 
00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
access resources and help but when we
 
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
look at our data from our crisis lines
 
00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:42.660 align:start position:0%
in particular the crisis text line the
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
people that are texting from New
 
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are 14 to 17 year old girls
 
00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
primarily so that does line up right
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
with this information so I think that so
 
00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:53.220 align:start position:0%
leads to tell
 
00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:54.540 align:start position:0%
someone if there is any good news in
 
00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
here is we know what can protect kids
 
00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:57.660 align:start position:0%
and one of those things is having access
 
00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:00.839 align:start position:0%
to resources having access to 988 in a
 
00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
way in which that is comfortable for
 
00:36:04.609 --> 00:36:04.619 align:start position:0%
those 14 to 17 year old girls to use
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
they're already texting anyway that's a
 
00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
way that they feel comfortable getting
 
00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:11.220 align:start position:0%
information we also know that we have
 
00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:12.839 align:start position:0%
other things that are protective for
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
kids positive high quality relationships
 
00:36:18.490 --> 00:36:18.500 align:start position:0%
with their peers and with their parents
 
00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
connectivity and and believing you can
 
00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:23.720 align:start position:0%
make a difference helps build resiliency
 
00:36:26.329 --> 00:36:26.339 align:start position:0%
social connection which is the number
 
00:36:28.609 --> 00:36:28.619 align:start position:0%
and variety and the quality of those
 
00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
relationships that meet your own
 
00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
personal needs is important to kids it's
 
00:36:37.069 --> 00:36:37.079 align:start position:0%
important for adults not only is it
 
00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:39.180 align:start position:0%
protective for the wear and tear of
 
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
social media but it is also protective
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
of things like anxiety depression heart
 
00:36:47.089 --> 00:36:47.099 align:start position:0%
disease diabetes those social positive
 
00:36:49.730 --> 00:36:49.740 align:start position:0%
connections are really really important
 
00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
there's always going to be kids who need
 
00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:54.660 align:start position:0%
a certain level of of intensive
 
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
treatment but from a prevention and a
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
protective lens there are opportunities
 
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
to ameliorate the crisis and the and try
 
00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:04.980 align:start position:0%
and get this curve to bend in a
 
00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:06.660 align:start position:0%
different way
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
and so Vivek Murphy who happens to be
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
one of my favorite people has put out
 
00:37:12.589 --> 00:37:12.599 align:start position:0%
that he's the Surgeon General of the
 
00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
United States he's put out an advisory
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
on social media and youth mental health
 
00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:19.500 align:start position:0%
and I encourage you to check out his
 
00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
full advisory it is available online and
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
also while you're doing that to peek
 
00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
over to some of the priorities that is
 
00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
within the surgeon general's office
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
right now that address a multitude of
 
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
issues that are plaguing us today but um
 
00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:35.700 align:start position:0%
that include youth mental health but
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
also things like social connection you
 
00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
can't think of the two without each
 
00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
other and so this is where we get into
 
00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:43.740 align:start position:0%
some of the emerging data on the
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
negative impact of social media one of
 
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
the unique aspects of social media is
 
00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:52.380 align:start position:0%
the pervasive way it promotes comparison
 
00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:55.260 align:start position:0%
to social groups and networks and this
 
00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:57.300 align:start position:0%
can lead to a host of issues from
 
00:37:59.950 --> 00:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
disordered eating body dysmorphia
 
00:38:02.569 --> 00:38:02.579 align:start position:0%
depression and self-harm especially
 
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
among vulnerable youth you know there's
 
00:38:07.849 --> 00:38:07.859 align:start position:0%
a quote comparison is the thief of Joy I
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
think Mark Twain said death of Joy I am
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
sure that is attributed to a number of
 
00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:14.820 align:start position:0%
dead white men from a number of folks
 
00:38:18.050 --> 00:38:18.060 align:start position:0%
but we understand that that comparison
 
00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:21.300 align:start position:0%
leads to some of these issues and while
 
00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
you've described the benefits as as
 
00:38:25.609 --> 00:38:25.619 align:start position:0%
Jenny said from social media the
 
00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:27.660 align:start position:0%
positivity is oh is not always unanimous
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
teens say they feel overwhelmed by the
 
00:38:32.569 --> 00:38:32.579 align:start position:0%
drama that they see on social media they
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
have pressure to post content that it
 
00:38:36.829 --> 00:38:36.839 align:start position:0%
likes or comments and that moves them in
 
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
a certain way to post more provocative
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
images and some report that these
 
00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
platforms just make them feel worse
 
00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:45.780 align:start position:0%
about their own life and while we have
 
00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:49.140 align:start position:0%
some data in studies to inform us and to
 
00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
inform the Surgeon General I know in
 
00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:53.700 align:start position:0%
particular that Jenny is a huge advocate
 
00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
in this space for ensuring that we
 
00:38:57.790 --> 00:38:57.800 align:start position:0%
better understand from youth themselves
 
00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:00.660 align:start position:0%
what it means to them to have this
 
00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:03.300 align:start position:0%
little device in their hand that gives
 
00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
them Kings of Joy but also opens up to
 
00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
to other impacts yeah so I think to that
 
00:39:12.109 --> 00:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
point I think it's really important just
 
00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:13.740 align:start position:0%
like in all of our work in Behavioral
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
Health we're constantly talking about
 
00:39:17.329 --> 00:39:17.339 align:start position:0%
voices of lived experience right and
 
00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
there are some times with our children
 
00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
where if my toddler doesn't want to ride
 
00:39:22.849 --> 00:39:22.859 align:start position:0%
in their car seat and says that's
 
00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable I know better and I have
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
to keep them safe there are other times
 
00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
when you're engaging with adolescents
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
when you work directly with adolescents
 
00:39:33.770 --> 00:39:33.780 align:start position:0%
they are younger grown-ups they can make
 
00:39:35.569 --> 00:39:35.579 align:start position:0%
a lot of decisions on their own they can
 
00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:37.380 align:start position:0%
do many of the things that adults can do
 
00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
and we have to recognize that their
 
00:39:41.089 --> 00:39:41.099 align:start position:0%
brains are not fully developed and of
 
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
course have to help them navigate this
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
but I do think it's really critical when
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
making policy or when parenting at these
 
00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:49.260 align:start position:0%
age group that we have open
 
00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:51.180 align:start position:0%
communication and that we hear from
 
00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:53.780 align:start position:0%
voices of young people so I really and
 
00:39:56.569 --> 00:39:56.579 align:start position:0%
enjoyed reading more about slides 12 and
 
00:39:59.089 --> 00:39:59.099 align:start position:0%
13 where you have a Pew research study
 
00:40:02.089 --> 00:40:02.099 align:start position:0%
that is what teens are telling you right
 
00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:04.380 align:start position:0%
so you'll see in there some of that data
 
00:40:06.349 --> 00:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
around when they feel overwhelmed when
 
00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:08.220 align:start position:0%
they they're comparing themselves to
 
00:40:10.730 --> 00:40:10.740 align:start position:0%
others and then you'll also see on that
 
00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:13.020 align:start position:0%
slide 13 that there are times where
 
00:40:14.990 --> 00:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
social media helps teens feel more
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
connected helps them find resources
 
00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:19.740 align:start position:0%
helps them be able to express creativity
 
00:40:22.430 --> 00:40:22.440 align:start position:0%
so I do think we have to find balance as
 
00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
opposed to saying because of potential
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
negative harms we take these things away
 
00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
when we have to really make sure we
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
educate young people to help them make
 
00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
informed decisions about their health
 
00:40:34.849 --> 00:40:34.859 align:start position:0%
just as we would in every other kind of
 
00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:37.740 align:start position:0%
area yeah you know I think it's
 
00:40:39.589 --> 00:40:39.599 align:start position:0%
important on that to also acknowledge
 
00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
what we still don't know so we don't
 
00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
know how you know in person versus
 
00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
digital interactions impact your health
 
00:40:48.710 --> 00:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
we don't exactly know how that happens
 
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
we don't exactly know how social media
 
00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
builds or erodes social connectedness
 
00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:55.740 align:start position:0%
there are lots of areas for research
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
lots of information that we still don't
 
00:40:58.079 --> 00:40:59.270 align:start position:0%
lots of information that we still don't
know

00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:01.700 align:start position:0%
um and we really don't know what exactly
 
00:41:04.849 --> 00:41:04.859 align:start position:0%
what type of content and at what
 
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
frequency generates the most harm there
 
00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
is a lot to learn there's a lot to learn
 
00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
from youth themselves and there's a lot
 
00:41:12.050 --> 00:41:12.060 align:start position:0%
to learn from sort of Greater research
 
00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
as we move forward so I think at the end
 
00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
of the day we need to balance the good
 
00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
and the bad I think that's our job every
 
00:41:19.849 --> 00:41:19.859 align:start position:0%
day that is your job as policy makers
 
00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:21.660 align:start position:0%
it's our job here in public health or in
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:26.820 align:start position:0%
Services is to balance this um difficult
 
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
murky emerging area that we've all come
 
00:41:32.329 --> 00:41:32.339 align:start position:0%
to live in so what can kids and families
 
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
do right now so granted we don't know
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
all the answers we need to hear more
 
00:41:37.550 --> 00:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
from youth but what what are some of the
 
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:39.300 align:start position:0%
things that we can do right now this
 
00:41:41.569 --> 00:41:41.579 align:start position:0%
very second so first of all I think we
 
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
need a model responsible social media
 
00:41:45.970 --> 00:41:45.980 align:start position:0%
behavior and that goes for Mom and Dad
 
00:41:48.650 --> 00:41:48.660 align:start position:0%
in addition to kids I know I have a gen
 
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
Z daughter she is quick to call me a
 
00:41:53.569 --> 00:41:53.579 align:start position:0%
screen Ager that's at the what we say in
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
the house I had she says ma stop being a
 
00:41:58.490 --> 00:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
screenager as I am scrolling and
 
00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
answering emails perhaps from some of
 
00:42:02.569 --> 00:42:02.579 align:start position:0%
you while we're eating dinner I think
 
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:04.740 align:start position:0%
it's important to model that kind of
 
00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
boundaries about when it's okay and when
 
00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:09.660 align:start position:0%
it's not okay to be on your screens we
 
00:42:11.930 --> 00:42:11.940 align:start position:0%
need to learn about technology and the
 
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
ways in which media is designed to
 
00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:16.740 align:start position:0%
market products and move behaviors I
 
00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:17.450 align:start position:0%
market products and move behaviors I
think

00:42:17.450 --> 00:42:17.460 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
um you know corporate world is Madison
 
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
Ave is very bright there's a reason that
 
00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
we buy a lot of things and why we're
 
00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:25.740 align:start position:0%
moved to do that and I think it's
 
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
important for us to learn that those
 
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
that is often behind some of the things
 
00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
that we see on on our screens we need to
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
understand how those algorithms work we
 
00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
all need to set some boundaries for use
 
00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
Mom Dad kids everybody about tech free
 
00:42:44.089 --> 00:42:44.099 align:start position:0%
zones when we use it when we don't use
 
00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
it and have conversations about that
 
00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
that um take in account what youth need
 
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
and want knowing that brain development
 
00:42:53.810 --> 00:42:53.820 align:start position:0%
isn't quite done yet and what parents
 
00:42:56.450 --> 00:42:56.460 align:start position:0%
can do to model in that space it's
 
00:42:58.010 --> 00:42:58.020 align:start position:0%
important for us to report cyber
 
00:43:00.890 --> 00:43:00.900 align:start position:0%
bullying and any online abuse we need to
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
make that uh known we need to make that
 
00:43:05.809 --> 00:43:05.819 align:start position:0%
be something that kids feel comfortable
 
00:43:07.849 --> 00:43:07.859 align:start position:0%
telling their parents about and really
 
00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:09.660 align:start position:0%
that has repercussions at the end of the
 
00:43:11.329 --> 00:43:11.339 align:start position:0%
day and then something I know that many
 
00:43:13.309 --> 00:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
of you in this room are very passionate
 
00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:15.180 align:start position:0%
about is really about protecting and
 
00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
promoting digital privacy I think that
 
00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:19.740 align:start position:0%
that's um an area that we have a lot
 
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
more work to do on but it's critical if
 
00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
we want to be protective of kids so one
 
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
of the good things is is that we are
 
00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.650 align:start position:0%
of the good things is is that we are
okay

00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:43:33.230 --> 00:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
we have not choreographed this this in
 
00:43:35.089 --> 00:43:35.099 align:start position:0%
any way shape or form so one of the
 
00:43:36.829 --> 00:43:36.839 align:start position:0%
other pieces of good news is that there
 
00:43:38.089 --> 00:43:38.099 align:start position:0%
are Blueprints and we don't need to
 
00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:39.660 align:start position:0%
start from scratch when we talk about
 
00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:42.300 align:start position:0%
education for youth in particular
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
um there are some guidelines that are
 
00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:47.700 align:start position:0%
already out there that focus on um where
 
00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
in sort of children's developmental
 
00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
develop you know age and development
 
00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
what's important for them to learn what
 
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
we should talk about how help you know
 
00:43:57.950 --> 00:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
what healthy behaviors are and what
 
00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
impacts those healthy behaviors so we're
 
00:44:01.490 --> 00:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
very fortunate that some of those
 
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
curricula already exists out there and
 
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
are useful for us and and quite frankly
 
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
are already happening in many schools in
 
00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:09.900 align:start position:0%
the state for a second so you will see
 
00:44:11.569 --> 00:44:11.579 align:start position:0%
that we put in here some of the national
 
00:44:13.849 --> 00:44:13.859 align:start position:0%
standards and across the board in each
 
00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:15.240 align:start position:0%
of these different you know you should
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
know this in your health education by
 
00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:19.380 align:start position:0%
this age level it starts from an
 
00:44:21.170 --> 00:44:21.180 align:start position:0%
understanding of identifying ways in
 
00:44:23.569 --> 00:44:23.579 align:start position:0%
which media impacts Health behaviors and
 
00:44:25.609 --> 00:44:25.619 align:start position:0%
it moves towards analyzing those and
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
evaluating how they're affecting you so
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
it's really teaching critical thinking
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
skills but around this topic and that
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
those will help us to set what are the
 
00:44:34.730 --> 00:44:34.740 align:start position:0%
things that our youth need to know and
 
00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
our families need to know in this space
 
00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:38.819 align:start position:0%
we're also really lucky to have a
 
00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
homegrown non-profit in New Hampshire
 
00:44:41.990 --> 00:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
that's a national leader in this area
 
00:44:44.109 --> 00:44:44.119 align:start position:0%
Media power youth has National
 
00:44:46.309 --> 00:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
evidence-based programs on the samsa
 
00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:49.380 align:start position:0%
registry around how do how does media
 
00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:52.140 align:start position:0%
literacy impact health behavior so very
 
00:44:53.569 --> 00:44:53.579 align:start position:0%
happy to be working with them as well
 
00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely I can't underscore that
 
00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
enough Media power youth is a phenomenal
 
00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
organization based out of Manchester and
 
00:45:00.890 --> 00:45:00.900 align:start position:0%
they have been doing this work long
 
00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
before a tick tock Revolution is this
 
00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
listed in the slides anywhere that would
 
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
that Medium how are you no it isn't but
 
00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
I can send it we need to power youth
 
00:45:13.329 --> 00:45:13.339 align:start position:0%
Media power youth
 
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative uh Consular attorney
 
00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
Edwards let's invite the people who just
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
spoke of okay they're a great
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
organization and have worked closely
 
00:45:29.210 --> 00:45:29.220 align:start position:0%
with the Department in lots of areas um
 
00:45:31.309 --> 00:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
in our injury prevention in prevention
 
00:45:33.349 --> 00:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
work for drug and alcohol they're
 
00:45:33.359 --> 00:45:34.910 align:start position:0%
work for drug and alcohol they're
fabulous

00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
fabulous
 
00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
um so Governor sununu jumped on board as
 
00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:39.420 align:start position:0%
well earlier this month as you know and
 
00:45:41.809 --> 00:45:41.819 align:start position:0%
issued an executive order that primarily
 
00:45:44.089 --> 00:45:44.099 align:start position:0%
does three things one it looks at
 
00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
curriculum so much like we just spoke
 
00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:47.940 align:start position:0%
about it directs the New Hampshire
 
00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Education with support
 
00:45:52.730 --> 00:45:52.740 align:start position:0%
from DHHS to make recommendations and
 
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
build developmentally appropriate
 
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
Frameworks based on existing School
 
00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:58.190 align:start position:0%
Frameworks based on existing School
criteria

00:45:58.190 --> 00:45:58.200 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:01.460 align:start position:0%
two it directs us to look at the data
 
00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
DHHS and the New Hampshire Department of
 
00:46:06.349 --> 00:46:06.359 align:start position:0%
Ed will review existing research and the
 
00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
harms of social media this has already
 
00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
begun and three there's a Communications
 
00:46:13.609 --> 00:46:13.619 align:start position:0%
and a public engagement plan and I know
 
00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:15.180 align:start position:0%
that that was a particular interest to
 
00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards when we had our
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
earlier conversations and so the
 
00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:21.300 align:start position:0%
governor's order also directs Department
 
00:46:24.650 --> 00:46:24.660 align:start position:0%
of Ed HHS do it to coordinate and
 
00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:26.460 align:start position:0%
develop a communication plan to both
 
00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
inform and engage parent and youth voice
 
00:46:32.089 --> 00:46:32.099 align:start position:0%
as we move through this process there's
 
00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:33.660 align:start position:0%
90 days we have to put something
 
00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:35.030 align:start position:0%
90 days we have to put something
together

00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:36.900 align:start position:0%
um the Commissioners have already begun
 
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
meeting on this they're uh the work
 
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
really begins in Earnest in July so a
 
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
lot more to come in that space
 
00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:46.980 align:start position:0%
so as we wrap up
 
00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:48.780 align:start position:0%
um I know you have a long agenda you
 
00:46:50.569 --> 00:46:50.579 align:start position:0%
know I think uh we have a couple of
 
00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
messages that we want to make sure that
 
00:46:54.109 --> 00:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
we move forward there's an analogy
 
00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
that's been floating around my head that
 
00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
is imperfect but I think it's helpful
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
which is social media is a little bit
 
00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:02.940 align:start position:0%
like a car so when we think about cars
 
00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240 align:start position:0%
from a from a public health perspective
 
00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
um we've made the car itself safer
 
00:47:12.589 --> 00:47:12.599 align:start position:0%
um parents and families have a
 
00:47:14.809 --> 00:47:14.819 align:start position:0%
responsibility to work with their youth
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
to get them ready to drive that car and
 
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
we have policies in place as well to
 
00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:23.880 align:start position:0%
also ensure the safety of everyone who's
 
00:47:25.609 --> 00:47:25.619 align:start position:0%
on the road and I think it's important
 
00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:27.300 align:start position:0%
to think about it that way that the work
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
is not solely on the backs of Youth and
 
00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:33.780 align:start position:0%
parents to fix social media there's a
 
00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
part to play around education guidance
 
00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:38.940 align:start position:0%
boundaries but there's other work that
 
00:47:41.089 --> 00:47:41.099 align:start position:0%
can also be done not only here in New
 
00:47:42.589 --> 00:47:42.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but elsewhere to make sure
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
that the product itself is safer as well
 
00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
as to ensure that that we're all safe
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
when we get on the road or scroll
 
00:47:50.809 --> 00:47:50.819 align:start position:0%
through that screen and I know that
 
00:47:52.069 --> 00:47:52.079 align:start position:0%
Jenny probably has a couple other
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
takeaways that she wants to leave you
 
00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:55.020 align:start position:0%
with yeah I think it is just we are
 
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
thinking about sort of that awareness
 
00:47:58.970 --> 00:47:58.980 align:start position:0%
through that public information campaign
 
00:48:00.349 --> 00:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
as part of the executive order we're
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
thinking about that education and
 
00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
mentioning that we already have some
 
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
curriculum and some national standards
 
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
and I think the piece around policy that
 
00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
you know for you all to be thinking a
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
lot about is around transparency and
 
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
algorithm accountability to the
 
00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
platforms and around Online safety
 
00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
measures that can include things like
 
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
content filtering measures to protect
 
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
and prevent grooming and Reporting
 
00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
mechanisms for inappropriate content
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
right there's certain specific things
 
00:48:28.609 --> 00:48:28.619 align:start position:0%
that do have to do with policy and if we
 
00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
have sort of that multi-tiered approach
 
00:48:31.730 --> 00:48:31.740 align:start position:0%
where we have awareness and we have
 
00:48:34.250 --> 00:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
education and we have good policy will
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
be moving in the right direction
 
00:48:38.569 --> 00:48:38.579 align:start position:0%
so I would just end by saying it's all
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
about Connections that's what families
 
00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:41.940 align:start position:0%
and youth can do right now is build
 
00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:44.220 align:start position:0%
those positive social connections I
 
00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
think there are some things again that a
 
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
policy level that is going to emerge
 
00:48:49.490 --> 00:48:49.500 align:start position:0%
over time and making sure that we've got
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
great education so that's it from us
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
we're happy to answer anything or engage
 
00:48:56.809 --> 00:48:56.819 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards thank you Mr
 
00:48:59.390 --> 00:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
chair there's there's as I go through
 
00:49:02.329 --> 00:49:02.339 align:start position:0%
this presentation I got seven points I
 
00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
think I'd like to make in uh that our
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
time has been mentioned a few times so
 
00:49:08.809 --> 00:49:08.819 align:start position:0%
maybe some of these could just be
 
00:49:10.309 --> 00:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
statements for me as opposed to
 
00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
questions go ahead
 
00:49:16.970 --> 00:49:16.980 align:start position:0%
um okay on on page 14 on uh what we
 
00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
still don't know uh one of the things
 
00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
that I think is just screaming to be
 
00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:25.980 align:start position:0%
added to what we don't know is uh the
 
00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
correlation between the depression and
 
00:49:31.849 --> 00:49:31.859 align:start position:0%
sadness that's being triggered by social
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
media and uh substance misuse because I
 
00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
I suspect that there's probably an
 
00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
extremely strong correlation to
 
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
substance misuse and if we want to have
 
00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:48.300 align:start position:0%
fewer people abusing drugs that this is
 
00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:51.780 align:start position:0%
actually a key component of a state
 
00:49:53.930 --> 00:49:53.940 align:start position:0%
strategy just that's just my thought
 
00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:54.970 align:start position:0%
strategy just that's just my thought
there

00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:54.980 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:49:58.630 --> 00:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
going on to
 
00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:03.900 align:start position:0%
page 19 on the executive order
 
00:50:06.589 --> 00:50:06.599 align:start position:0%
some of this is outside of your scope
 
00:50:08.809 --> 00:50:08.819 align:start position:0%
and and maybe Mr Williams and I could
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
talk about it later but but I from
 
00:50:14.630 --> 00:50:14.640 align:start position:0%
reading these things these feel like
 
00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:20.460 align:start position:0%
all elements of existing law that the
 
00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:21.980 align:start position:0%
governor has put into
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
an executive order in other words he's
 
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
not doing anything here to make new law
 
00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
uh that he's got the legal framework to
 
00:50:32.809 --> 00:50:32.819 align:start position:0%
do all of this is that that's your
 
00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:33.900 align:start position:0%
understanding that's my understanding
 
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:36.349 align:start position:0%
okay so
um

00:50:36.349 --> 00:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:38.809 --> 00:50:38.819 align:start position:0%
so that opens up a few other questions
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
because we know that other states are
 
00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:44.700 align:start position:0%
moving to to regulate social media I
 
00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:47.960 align:start position:0%
think Utah Louisiana are a couple
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
so so I would want to start having the
 
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
dialogue about what is outside of this
 
00:50:57.290 --> 00:50:57.300 align:start position:0%
executive order that the governor's
 
00:50:59.410 --> 00:50:59.420 align:start position:0%
office would like the legislation
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
legislature to begin to consider and
 
00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
again that's not your role but but do
 
00:51:08.569 --> 00:51:08.579 align:start position:0%
you know who in his office has point on
 
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
believe it's Adam but we'll find out
 
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I I I'd like to have that
 
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
conversation and then on the final
 
00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
thoughts uh you know I I just I don't
 
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
want the boys to be overlooked I under I
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
mean I don't think you said that but you
 
00:51:29.750 --> 00:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
you spoke twice about the importance of
 
00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
taking care of our our young girls in
 
00:51:34.609 --> 00:51:34.619 align:start position:0%
this issue you didn't mention boys I'm
 
00:51:37.549 --> 00:51:37.559 align:start position:0%
sure that was just an oversight so I I
 
00:51:39.049 --> 00:51:39.059 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure we don't overlook
 
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
the boys uh on your second bullet it
 
00:51:44.589 --> 00:51:44.599 align:start position:0%
says refrain from fear-based narratives
 
00:51:47.329 --> 00:51:47.339 align:start position:0%
and I would say I would want our
 
00:51:49.849 --> 00:51:49.859 align:start position:0%
narratives to be reality based if
 
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
there's stuff we need to be afraid of
 
00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:54.780 align:start position:0%
Let's Not Be tiptoeing around it let's
 
00:51:57.890 --> 00:51:57.900 align:start position:0%
let's go ahead and if if if if there's
 
00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
something to fear let's be honest with
 
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
people I I don't want this to become too
 
00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:06.300 align:start position:0%
sugar coated and then the the youth
 
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
youth and parents should not bear all of
 
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
the responsibility in making online
 
00:52:13.849 --> 00:52:13.859 align:start position:0%
space is safer that sort of opens up the
 
00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:16.380 align:start position:0%
question of you know what does that mean
 
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:19.260 align:start position:0%
who who else needs to be involved how do
 
00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
we come up with a comprehensive strategy
 
00:52:25.130 --> 00:52:25.140 align:start position:0%
of involving all of the people that
 
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
should be bearing responsibility so so
 
00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:30.900 align:start position:0%
those those are kind of my comments that
 
00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
I just would like to get into the record
 
00:52:35.030 --> 00:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
and maybe I can work with representative
 
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
King to get that into the minutes but um
 
00:52:40.670 --> 00:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
is there any of that that you want to
 
00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
respond to uh first of all we're very
 
00:52:44.390 --> 00:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
concerned about boys as well as girls so
 
00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh but we are particularly
 
00:52:49.309 --> 00:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
in what we wanted to highlight is that
 
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
there are disparate outcomes that we
 
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
have girls are experiencing things
 
00:52:54.950 --> 00:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
differently than boys that's not to say
 
00:52:57.589 --> 00:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
that boys aren't also experiencing those
 
00:52:59.690 --> 00:52:59.700 align:start position:0%
things so just for for clarity around
 
00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:01.380 align:start position:0%
that and then at the end you know I
 
00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:03.660 align:start position:0%
think our idea about who Bears
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility that really is an open
 
00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:07.740 align:start position:0%
question to everyone in this room and
 
00:53:09.589 --> 00:53:09.599 align:start position:0%
you know society as a whole but really
 
00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:12.180 align:start position:0%
to everyone that that we uh what we
 
00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
would suggest in the department that
 
00:53:16.609 --> 00:53:16.619 align:start position:0%
this isn't a problem that can be solved
 
00:53:18.910 --> 00:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
simply on the backs of parents and kids
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
that this is much bigger and it is a
 
00:53:24.049 --> 00:53:24.059 align:start position:0%
social media is a designed product and
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
so much like my car analogy again
 
00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
imperfect there are pieces where policy
 
00:53:31.309 --> 00:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
where products need to be safer where we
 
00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:34.380 align:start position:0%
need to enjoy and ensure that
 
00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
um you know kids are using them also
 
00:53:36.599 --> 00:53:38.390 align:start position:0%
um you know kids are using them also
appropriately

00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
so additionally it is that what we were
 
00:53:42.770 --> 00:53:42.780 align:start position:0%
thinking there is that the social media
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
platforms themselves bear some
 
00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:46.559 align:start position:0%
responsibility to making their products
 
00:53:48.890 --> 00:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
safe and we bear some responsibility to
 
00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:51.300 align:start position:0%
having good policy in place that ensures
 
00:53:52.609 --> 00:53:52.619 align:start position:0%
safety including some of those
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
accountability transparency and safety
 
00:53:56.450 --> 00:53:56.460 align:start position:0%
measures that I were talking about
 
00:53:58.730 --> 00:53:58.740 align:start position:0%
earlier so that's why I mean yes Youth
 
00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:00.300 align:start position:0%
and families but they can't sort of do
 
00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
it alone it has to be a multi-pronged
 
00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
approach and then just to respond to the
 
00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:06.300 align:start position:0%
piece about the reality based versus
 
00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:07.980 align:start position:0%
fear-based narratives the reason to
 
00:54:09.890 --> 00:54:09.900 align:start position:0%
include refraining from fear-based
 
00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
narratives is specific research about
 
00:54:14.089 --> 00:54:14.099 align:start position:0%
how youth respond to fear-based
 
00:54:15.890 --> 00:54:15.900 align:start position:0%
narratives and especially because that
 
00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
frontal lobe is not fully developed
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
fear-based narratives just don't work
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
for youth so that was a very that was
 
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
more specific than sort of broad base
 
00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:24.900 align:start position:0%
it's not all that we wouldn't want it to
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
be reality based we just want to make
 
00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
sure that any education that we're
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
providing will actually be received and
 
00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:33.780 align:start position:0%
retained by young people
 
00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:35.030 align:start position:0%
retained by young people
hmm

00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
my fear would be that while it is true
 
00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:40.740 align:start position:0%
we have to involve more people than
 
00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:43.500 align:start position:0%
parents and kids my fear would be we
 
00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
overshoot it and the government so
 
00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
clamps down on things that they're
 
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
controlling and there is that fine
 
00:54:53.450 --> 00:54:53.460 align:start position:0%
balance that only exists in theory but
 
00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
we have to strive for representative
 
00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:56.750 align:start position:0%
we have to strive for representative

00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
Murphy
 
00:55:00.349 --> 00:55:00.359 align:start position:0%
thank you um a comment and question you
 
00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
know on page four I'm just curious
 
00:55:04.010 --> 00:55:04.020 align:start position:0%
because you talked about high school
 
00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
students that spend three more hours
 
00:55:07.309 --> 00:55:07.319 align:start position:0%
that's a big number in the high 70s for
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
every subcategory that's mentioned there
 
00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:12.660 align:start position:0%
but as I watched my grandchildren on
 
00:55:14.569 --> 00:55:14.579 align:start position:0%
their iPads a lot of their time is spent
 
00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:16.980 align:start position:0%
doing research homework looking at the
 
00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
Bruins highlights the next morning Etc
 
00:55:21.049 --> 00:55:21.059 align:start position:0%
so I'm kind of curious as well as to
 
00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:22.740 align:start position:0%
what is the absolute number of hours
 
00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
that we are aware of that you know kids
 
00:55:28.069 --> 00:55:28.079 align:start position:0%
at that level are spending time on the
 
00:55:29.809 --> 00:55:29.819 align:start position:0%
tick tocks and the social media and the
 
00:55:31.609 --> 00:55:31.619 align:start position:0%
bullying and stuff like that so more
 
00:55:34.970 --> 00:55:34.980 align:start position:0%
that's one question but my other one is
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
I feel like we're at the beginning of a
 
00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:40.380 align:start position:0%
a problem that we've identified and also
 
00:55:42.650 --> 00:55:42.660 align:start position:0%
now are looking for the research the
 
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
understanding of it I mean I was
 
00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
listening to a podcast about the
 
00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
dopamine receptors and the levels in
 
00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:49.500 align:start position:0%
these young kids brains and how it
 
00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
affects their use or non-use of you know
 
00:55:55.609 --> 00:55:55.619 align:start position:0%
iPads so my question is do we have
 
00:55:58.490 --> 00:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
either nationally or locally a group or
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
a definitive strategic plan moving
 
00:56:03.410 --> 00:56:03.420 align:start position:0%
forward as to how to address this or are
 
00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
we just
 
00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
first we're at a stage of identifying
 
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
right now and we don't have a really
 
00:56:10.730 --> 00:56:10.740 align:start position:0%
strategic plan going forward and should
 
00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:11.569 align:start position:0%
strategic plan going forward and should
we

00:56:11.569 --> 00:56:11.579 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
I think on the first one I'll just jump
 
00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:15.540 align:start position:0%
in around the sort of number of hours or
 
00:56:16.609 --> 00:56:16.619 align:start position:0%
what they're doing on there I think
 
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
that's a really important point is that
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
while it there are some pieces where we
 
00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:23.220 align:start position:0%
just don't want them to be used to be on
 
00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
screens all the time it is actually less
 
00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
about number of hours and more about
 
00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
what they're doing on there right so it
 
00:56:31.609 --> 00:56:31.619 align:start position:0%
is um we do know that there are lots of
 
00:56:33.349 --> 00:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
learning games for young people there
 
00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
are lots of ways they're healthy
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
connections to their friends and peers
 
00:56:37.970 --> 00:56:37.980 align:start position:0%
and that's all really important to keep
 
00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
in mind and part of the educational
 
00:56:42.349 --> 00:56:42.359 align:start position:0%
piece and part of the safety measures
 
00:56:44.450 --> 00:56:44.460 align:start position:0%
piece and to put in into place is around
 
00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
content as opposed to just is there a
 
00:56:49.069 --> 00:56:49.079 align:start position:0%
right number of hours also just like
 
00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
everything else it's very different
 
00:56:53.089 --> 00:56:53.099 align:start position:0%
person to person right and so there are
 
00:56:54.829 --> 00:56:54.839 align:start position:0%
ways that our schools are communicating
 
00:56:57.170 --> 00:56:57.180 align:start position:0%
with with parents and with youth through
 
00:57:00.349 --> 00:57:00.359 align:start position:0%
social media our clubs you know our our
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
sports teams are also using these
 
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
platforms to communicate so there's a
 
00:57:06.530 --> 00:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
lot of Engagement going on that's about
 
00:57:08.569 --> 00:57:08.579 align:start position:0%
being a part of a team or about being
 
00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:10.380 align:start position:0%
you know a part of 4-H or all these
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
different sort of things that happen on
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
social media or to your point are doing
 
00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
homework engaging with teachers things
 
00:57:17.809 --> 00:57:17.819 align:start position:0%
like that that may not necessarily all
 
00:57:19.549 --> 00:57:19.559 align:start position:0%
be detrimental to their health so this
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
is a complex balance I I couldn't agree
 
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
more thank you Jenny said that
 
00:57:25.130 --> 00:57:25.140 align:start position:0%
beautifully and you know I'll just note
 
00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:27.180 align:start position:0%
that this three hours per day on screen
 
00:57:28.970 --> 00:57:28.980 align:start position:0%
time this is a measure that has been
 
00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
measured for
 
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
um well over a decade in youth risk
 
00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:34.200 align:start position:0%
behavioral and it actually came out of
 
00:57:35.930 --> 00:57:35.940 align:start position:0%
TV watching and the amount of
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
commercials you saw that was the
 
00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
research that came up with this magic
 
00:57:42.349 --> 00:57:42.359 align:start position:0%
three hours so our media consumption has
 
00:57:44.210 --> 00:57:44.220 align:start position:0%
changed so much there I think what it
 
00:57:46.609 --> 00:57:46.619 align:start position:0%
does is indicates what we all see which
 
00:57:48.349 --> 00:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
is we're all spending a lot of time
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
scrolling but that scrolling has a lot
 
00:57:52.370 --> 00:57:52.380 align:start position:0%
of different content on it and that's
 
00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
the research that needs to be done which
 
00:57:56.329 --> 00:57:56.339 align:start position:0%
comes back to your your last point of is
 
00:57:58.370 --> 00:57:58.380 align:start position:0%
there a strategic plan and you know I'm
 
00:57:59.930 --> 00:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
certainly not aware that there is an
 
00:58:02.210 --> 00:58:02.220 align:start position:0%
overarching a strategic plan that's
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
addressing this I think in New Hampshire
 
00:58:05.630 --> 00:58:05.640 align:start position:0%
we are at the beginning we know that
 
00:58:07.849 --> 00:58:07.859 align:start position:0%
schools and Community organizations have
 
00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
certainly addressed it in the ways in
 
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
which they can I think the gov owners
 
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
order at least um while does not go far
 
00:58:16.609 --> 00:58:16.619 align:start position:0%
it certainly gathers the appropriate
 
00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
state agencies together in a room to
 
00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:27.290 --> 00:58:27.300 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald thank you Mr chair I'm
 
00:58:29.450 --> 00:58:29.460 align:start position:0%
glad you brought up the fact that kids
 
00:58:31.849 --> 00:58:31.859 align:start position:0%
are doing other things on their screens
 
00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:34.260 align:start position:0%
that's how they're watching television
 
00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:35.170 align:start position:0%
that's how they're watching television
and

00:58:35.170 --> 00:58:35.180 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:38.089 --> 00:58:38.099 align:start position:0%
they're exposed to a lot of popular
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
culture that isn't social media through
 
00:58:44.809 --> 00:58:44.819 align:start position:0%
television through movies and
 
00:58:47.770 --> 00:58:47.780 align:start position:0%
I don't feel like I could make a
 
00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:50.460 align:start position:0%
determination that social media is good
 
00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
or bad but I don't think I think I think
 
00:58:56.089 --> 00:58:56.099 align:start position:0%
your data doesn't show here
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
that it's harming kids in fact it should
 
00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
seems to show the opposite on slide 12
 
00:59:08.870 --> 00:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
and 13 the positive kids are reporting
 
00:59:11.329 --> 00:59:11.339 align:start position:0%
are like twice
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
as high as the negative so I kind of
 
00:59:18.829 --> 00:59:18.839 align:start position:0%
wonder if it if we're focusing just on
 
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
social media we're leaving out
 
00:59:26.890 --> 00:59:26.900 align:start position:0%
video games which are bigger than movies
 
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
living out television we're leaving our
 
00:59:32.569 --> 00:59:32.579 align:start position:0%
movies and maybe we're narrowing our
 
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
Focus yeah and we're gonna miss the
 
00:59:39.049 --> 00:59:39.059 align:start position:0%
point entirely so I don't think your
 
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
data shows
 
00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:44.460 align:start position:0%
I want you 've been trying to suggest I
 
00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
just want those two those two slides
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
that are youth voice and have their
 
00:59:51.410 --> 00:59:51.420 align:start position:0%
perception of whether it's positive or
 
00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
negative influence on them which I think
 
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
is really critical for us to consider
 
00:59:57.950 --> 00:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
there is data that we that is in here as
 
00:59:59.690 --> 00:59:59.700 align:start position:0%
well to suggest that there's negative
 
01:00:02.089 --> 01:00:02.099 align:start position:0%
impact on young people's mental health
 
01:00:04.370 --> 01:00:04.380 align:start position:0%
and so it's a balance of finding what
 
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
are the positives and what are the
 
01:00:07.549 --> 01:00:07.559 align:start position:0%
negatives and including that youth voice
 
01:00:09.410 --> 01:00:09.420 align:start position:0%
in that as well
 
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
um but we also can send you the links to
 
01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:13.980 align:start position:0%
the research in here so that you have
 
01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:16.140 align:start position:0%
that to dig in deeper or you know get
 
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
you more information about it I think
 
01:00:19.609 --> 01:00:19.619 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful because I don't
 
01:00:23.410 --> 01:00:23.420 align:start position:0%
think your data support your point and
 
01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:25.740 align:start position:0%
you know I agree
 
01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
um thank you for for acknowledging that
 
01:00:30.049 --> 01:00:30.059 align:start position:0%
in here I think this is also a place
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
where the data has to catch up so you
 
01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
know we have to have ways in which to
 
01:00:36.829 --> 01:00:36.839 align:start position:0%
collect that data get that data analyze
 
01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
it there have been
 
01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:39.839 align:start position:0%
um genius noted there are a number of
 
01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
reports that the Department of Justice
 
01:00:43.309 --> 01:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
has already put together are in
 
01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
preparation for this executive order for
 
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
the work there that really looks at
 
01:00:50.809 --> 01:00:50.819 align:start position:0%
specific harms but these are individual
 
01:00:50.819 --> 01:00:52.130 align:start position:0%
specific harms but these are individual
studies

01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:52.140 align:start position:0%
studies
 
01:00:53.329 --> 01:00:53.339 align:start position:0%
um I think we need to go through those
 
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
and better understand how applicable or
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
how broad-ranging those those may be we
 
01:00:59.930 --> 01:00:59.940 align:start position:0%
don't have the tools right now for
 
01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:01.799 align:start position:0%
example in yrbs we don't have the
 
01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:03.480 align:start position:0%
questions in 20 you know we can't go
 
01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
back to 2021 and rejigger those
 
01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:07.740 align:start position:0%
questions to get at some of the things
 
01:01:09.829 --> 01:01:09.839 align:start position:0%
that I think we all want to know
 
01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:11.940 align:start position:0%
I think also ultimately the surgeon
 
01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
general's report said we can't we don't
 
01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
have enough evidence to conclude that
 
01:01:17.569 --> 01:01:17.579 align:start position:0%
this is safe for children right and so
 
01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:19.500 align:start position:0%
you're point taken that we're both
 
01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
saying there's potential harms and
 
01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
there's potential benefits and our
 
01:01:25.130 --> 01:01:25.140 align:start position:0%
approach is going to have to take into
 
01:01:31.069 --> 01:01:31.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:34.609 --> 01:01:34.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
taking my uh somewhat lengthy question
 
01:01:43.609 --> 01:01:43.619 align:start position:0%
or lead into the question anyway but I
 
01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
want to I want to compliment you on a a
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
very well done presentation and I
 
01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
realize this is just the identification
 
01:01:56.089 --> 01:01:56.099 align:start position:0%
stage but this has this has prompted a
 
01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
lot of uh brainstorming in my own head
 
01:02:03.049 --> 01:02:03.059 align:start position:0%
um and I think you made a great point
 
01:02:06.770 --> 01:02:06.780 align:start position:0%
about how we used to leave school and
 
01:02:09.049 --> 01:02:09.059 align:start position:0%
school was left behind now it's
 
01:02:12.109 --> 01:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
continually in the in the child's uh
 
01:02:15.289 --> 01:02:15.299 align:start position:0%
life and and I do believe that this
 
01:02:17.809 --> 01:02:17.819 align:start position:0%
really does point to where we're seeing
 
01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:21.180 align:start position:0%
a lot of problems and I hear more
 
01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
bullying in the schools from kids that
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
that I'm connected to and I'm hearing
 
01:02:30.430 --> 01:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
where conflict resolution is a problem
 
01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
and uh and this study definitely shows
 
01:02:37.069 --> 01:02:37.079 align:start position:0%
where the this is a problem some some
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
people in my community of Milford
 
01:02:40.849 --> 01:02:40.859 align:start position:0%
sahegan Valley area
 
01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
are trying to figure out how to help
 
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
kids in this area and I'm really excited
 
01:02:50.450 --> 01:02:50.460 align:start position:0%
to see that you have a curriculum that's
 
01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
uh part of what I believe is going to
 
01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
come out of this in the future and so my
 
01:02:59.329 --> 01:02:59.339 align:start position:0%
question is kind of in line with what
 
01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:01.079 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards said earlier is
 
01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
how can we become a part of the solution
 
01:03:10.130 --> 01:03:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:12.170 --> 01:03:12.180 align:start position:0%
all of us that's continuing our own our
 
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
own education on these topics right so
 
01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
as this curriculum develops it's
 
01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:17.220 align:start position:0%
something where when when I talk to
 
01:03:19.190 --> 01:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
Media power youth I said I need to go
 
01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:21.660 align:start position:0%
through all these classes basically all
 
01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
the different programs that you have for
 
01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:24.660 align:start position:0%
young people I gotta get I gotta go
 
01:03:26.089 --> 01:03:26.099 align:start position:0%
through them too right so I think this
 
01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
is going to be just a learning curve for
 
01:03:29.930 --> 01:03:29.940 align:start position:0%
all of us together and that we need to
 
01:03:31.730 --> 01:03:31.740 align:start position:0%
continue to involve Young Voices in
 
01:03:33.530 --> 01:03:33.540 align:start position:0%
every one of those conversations so when
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
we build curriculum without young people
 
01:03:39.109 --> 01:03:39.119 align:start position:0%
um then we build something where they
 
01:03:40.849 --> 01:03:40.859 align:start position:0%
may reflect on it and say I would never
 
01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:42.599 align:start position:0%
do that right so we may say let's
 
01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
practice how we're going to say no to
 
01:03:46.609 --> 01:03:46.619 align:start position:0%
our friend during peer pressure or
 
01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
something like this and they say I would
 
01:03:49.309 --> 01:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
never do it like that but I might do it
 
01:03:51.289 --> 01:03:51.299 align:start position:0%
these four other ways so when we write
 
01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
curriculum with them we make something
 
01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
that works and I think that's going to
 
01:03:56.450 --> 01:03:56.460 align:start position:0%
be a really critical piece of what we
 
01:03:58.670 --> 01:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
move forward with as well
 
01:04:01.609 --> 01:04:01.619 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald
 
01:04:04.609 --> 01:04:04.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh and again I
 
01:04:06.349 --> 01:04:06.359 align:start position:0%
want to compliment you on this also it's
 
01:04:09.049 --> 01:04:09.059 align:start position:0%
a lot of good information in here and
 
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
you give us a good breakdown on um
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
information about you know gender a
 
01:04:18.289 --> 01:04:18.299 align:start position:0%
grade in School race ethnicity I was
 
01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:20.220 align:start position:0%
talking about other demographic factors
 
01:04:22.849 --> 01:04:22.859 align:start position:0%
like socioeconomic status if if we have
 
01:04:25.970 --> 01:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
data breakdowns along those lines also
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
and perhaps other demographic breakdowns
 
01:04:31.549 --> 01:04:31.559 align:start position:0%
sure so thank you for that question
 
01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
um so we have some other ways we can
 
01:04:35.270 --> 01:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
break this is um the data in the
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
beginning in particular the New
 
01:04:38.210 --> 01:04:38.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire youth risk behavioral survey
 
01:04:41.569 --> 01:04:41.579 align:start position:0%
yrbs we can cut that in several ways
 
01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
um we can do uh perhaps less around
 
01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic because again it's a
 
01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
child's report but there are other
 
01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:49.980 align:start position:0%
demographics for example children who
 
01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:53.400 align:start position:0%
identify as lgbtq plus we know that they
 
01:04:55.370 --> 01:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
are certainly experiencing mental health
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
crises right now as well
 
01:04:59.569 --> 01:04:59.579 align:start position:0%
um so we have that information again
 
01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:01.799 align:start position:0%
race ethnicity and age is probably the
 
01:05:04.849 --> 01:05:04.859 align:start position:0%
most stand way to look at that right now
 
01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
especially when we're thinking about
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
curricula in the school and ensuring
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
that we're getting the right curricula
 
01:05:11.809 --> 01:05:11.819 align:start position:0%
at the right developmental level at the
 
01:05:13.609 --> 01:05:13.619 align:start position:0%
right ages but there are some other ways
 
01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
data um some of the smaller studies as I
 
01:05:18.109 --> 01:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
mentioned to Senator Rosenwald again are
 
01:05:20.329 --> 01:05:20.339 align:start position:0%
limited but we have to be able to use
 
01:05:22.609 --> 01:05:22.619 align:start position:0%
these broader survey base where we have
 
01:05:24.770 --> 01:05:24.780 align:start position:0%
larger groups of individuals there's a
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
lot more work that really needs to be
 
01:05:28.010 --> 01:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
done is there anything you would add
 
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you follow up
 
01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:34.980 align:start position:0%
the reason I I mentioned socioeconomic
 
01:05:37.490 --> 01:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
and economic in particular is obviously
 
01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
a wealthier family there's more
 
01:05:42.170 --> 01:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
electronic toys a child might have
 
01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:44.700 align:start position:0%
access to than in a more disadvantaged
 
01:05:46.490 --> 01:05:46.500 align:start position:0%
household and I think that information
 
01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
would be helpful if we could get
 
01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
something like that absolutely although
 
01:05:56.329 --> 01:05:56.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:58.730 --> 01:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
um most kids have a phone you know it
 
01:06:00.829 --> 01:06:00.839 align:start position:0%
may be an older iPhone than a newer
 
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
iPhone it may not have three cameras on
 
01:06:04.430 --> 01:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
the back you may have two cameras on the
 
01:06:06.589 --> 01:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
back but they have a phone so that is
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
part that we is part of the mix right
 
01:06:09.599 --> 01:06:11.450 align:start position:0%
part that we is part of the mix right
now

01:06:11.450 --> 01:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:06:13.370 --> 01:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
representative Weber
 
01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh and and before I ask my question I
 
01:06:19.130 --> 01:06:19.140 align:start position:0%
will just second that as as somebody I
 
01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
serve as a casa and uh the the
 
01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:24.670 align:start position:0%
serve as a casa and uh the the
um

01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:28.549 --> 01:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
Arrangements that people make uh that
 
01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:30.839 align:start position:0%
parents make so that they have phones
 
01:06:34.010 --> 01:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
and their kids have phones are occupy a
 
01:06:37.789 --> 01:06:37.799 align:start position:0%
great deal of their daily lives
 
01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
um and uh are are absolutely core and
 
01:06:45.650 --> 01:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
Central to their daily lives uh I guess
 
01:06:48.410 --> 01:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
I I want to reiterate the thing that I
 
01:06:51.589 --> 01:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
think several of us have already uh
 
01:06:54.789 --> 01:06:54.799 align:start position:0%
begun to to put into the conversation
 
01:06:57.650 --> 01:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
which is a reminder directly to you
 
01:06:59.210 --> 01:06:59.220 align:start position:0%
because we've talked about it in terms
 
01:07:00.890 --> 01:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
of the governor's office and other other
 
01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:01.970 align:start position:0%
of the governor's office and other other
ways

01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:01.980 align:start position:0%
ways
 
01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
I so applaud the fact that there's a lot
 
01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
in here that are non-legislative
 
01:07:10.430 --> 01:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
Solutions and non-legislative action uh
 
01:07:12.109 --> 01:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
because the first thing I think when
 
01:07:14.089 --> 01:07:14.099 align:start position:0%
somebody proposes a bill is is there a
 
01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:16.020 align:start position:0%
way to do this without making it into a
 
01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:16.730 align:start position:0%
way to do this without making it into a
law

01:07:16.730 --> 01:07:16.740 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:20.220 align:start position:0%
uh but I think all of us want to be very
 
01:07:22.809 --> 01:07:22.819 align:start position:0%
clear that if you have
 
01:07:26.329 --> 01:07:26.339 align:start position:0%
suggestions or requests for legislative
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
action that we start hearing about them
 
01:07:31.549 --> 01:07:31.559 align:start position:0%
early so we can development develop them
 
01:07:33.410 --> 01:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
early because we have a very short
 
01:07:36.410 --> 01:07:36.420 align:start position:0%
window of opportunity in September in
 
01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
order to file bills and it's an
 
01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:41.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity I don't want to miss if
 
01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
there's something coming down the road
 
01:07:46.010 --> 01:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
so I just want to add my voice to that
 
01:07:49.010 --> 01:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
as a as a please think about it
 
01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
proactively and early and and let us
 
01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
know because as a legislature we also
 
01:07:56.930 --> 01:07:56.940 align:start position:0%
want to help be part of that solution
 
01:07:59.210 --> 01:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
thank you representative weather I know
 
01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
that at least the governor's group that
 
01:08:03.109 --> 01:08:03.119 align:start position:0%
has come pulling together you know is
 
01:08:04.970 --> 01:08:04.980 align:start position:0%
working over the summer so I think in
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
part so that we have some time to think
 
01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
if there are policies that need to be
 
01:08:11.930 --> 01:08:11.940 align:start position:0%
addressed the chair has a question is
 
01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
there a group that has come together say
 
01:08:16.669 --> 01:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
either in a middle school or a high
 
01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
school of a group of students who say
 
01:08:21.289 --> 01:08:21.299 align:start position:0%
we've had enough of this and they come
 
01:08:23.450 --> 01:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
together as perhaps a 12 step group
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
holding each other accountable or a
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
group that understands and digs deeper
 
01:08:32.269 --> 01:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
into what you presented so they can be
 
01:08:34.729 --> 01:08:34.739 align:start position:0%
peer informing it's not like a head
 
01:08:36.410 --> 01:08:36.420 align:start position:0%
squad on this I mean I think there's
 
01:08:38.809 --> 01:08:38.819 align:start position:0%
just a number of amazing youth serving
 
01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
organizations and youth groups and many
 
01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:42.900 align:start position:0%
of which are sort of Grassroots as well
 
01:08:45.769 --> 01:08:45.779 align:start position:0%
coming from young people through we can
 
01:08:47.150 --> 01:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
connect also with our Public Health
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
regions with our drug-free community
 
01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:51.179 align:start position:0%
grantees and on and on to kind of get a
 
01:08:52.910 --> 01:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
better understanding of what's the youth
 
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
voice and youth pulse on this in New
 
01:08:57.169 --> 01:08:57.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire again also the curriculum that
 
01:08:58.970 --> 01:08:58.980 align:start position:0%
Media power that I mentioned earlier
 
01:09:01.010 --> 01:09:01.020 align:start position:0%
that is an evidence-based curriculum is
 
01:09:02.209 --> 01:09:02.219 align:start position:0%
actually written with New Hampshire
 
01:09:04.729 --> 01:09:04.739 align:start position:0%
middle schoolers so that's also just an
 
01:09:06.349 --> 01:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
interesting and kind of neat piece that
 
01:09:08.749 --> 01:09:08.759 align:start position:0%
they wanted to be involved in and gave
 
01:09:10.789 --> 01:09:10.799 align:start position:0%
voice to that the existing curriculum
 
01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
that we do are you telling me or I am I
 
01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
wanting you to tell me that there's a
 
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
growing number of kids who are
 
01:09:20.809 --> 01:09:20.819 align:start position:0%
recognizing all of this stuff and said
 
01:09:22.610 --> 01:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
we've had it we're not going to take it
 
01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
anymore and we're going to fight back
 
01:09:26.329 --> 01:09:26.339 align:start position:0%
and we're going to look out for others
 
01:09:28.849 --> 01:09:28.859 align:start position:0%
who we can bring on board I don't think
 
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
that youth are saying hey we're done
 
01:09:31.870 --> 01:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
with social media
 
01:09:34.729 --> 01:09:34.739 align:start position:0%
stay healthy and safe and what do we
 
01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
need to know and questioning where it's
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
challenging them and where they find it
 
01:09:41.150 --> 01:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
helpful and connecting right and so
 
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:42.600 align:start position:0%
they're asking the same questions of
 
01:09:45.050 --> 01:09:45.060 align:start position:0%
themselves and then looking to yes
 
01:09:47.090 --> 01:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
educate themselves and their peers and
 
01:09:49.849 --> 01:09:49.859 align:start position:0%
hopefully some are influencers yes and
 
01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Edwards
 
01:09:56.270 --> 01:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
this is a segue off of I think
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
representative Weber's comment about
 
01:10:02.689 --> 01:10:02.699 align:start position:0%
what we might do uh legislatively and
 
01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
what we ought not to do I I I wanted to
 
01:10:10.490 --> 01:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
make sure also that I I thanked Miss
 
01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:13.140 align:start position:0%
Tilly because she was very open to
 
01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
beginning to discuss this months ago and
 
01:10:18.910 --> 01:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know if the governor's idea came
 
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
organically in a parallel way or if it
 
01:10:23.450 --> 01:10:23.460 align:start position:0%
was connected in some way I it doesn't
 
01:10:26.750 --> 01:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
much matter but I do appreciate the fact
 
01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:29.100 align:start position:0%
that you're willing to engage this issue
 
01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
and begin talking about it months ago
 
01:10:36.410 --> 01:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
and in our research together I think
 
01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
we've looked at two states that have
 
01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
passed social media laws restricting
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
access to minors and we looked at the
 
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
clinical research that they use to
 
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
support their legislation and I have to
 
01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
tell you that I was frankly disappointed
 
01:10:59.530 --> 01:10:59.540 align:start position:0%
in how the other legislatures
 
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
used really probably I would call it to
 
01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
be fair or nice about it they use their
 
01:11:08.149 --> 01:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
own legislative experience and judgment
 
01:11:11.149 --> 01:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
more than they seem to be relying on
 
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
existing research to drive the content
 
01:11:18.530 --> 01:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
Contours of their bills so I I would
 
01:11:22.370 --> 01:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
hope that we have efforts and approaches
 
01:11:26.030 --> 01:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
to stay on top of the emerging research
 
01:11:28.430 --> 01:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
on this so that the research can inform
 
01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
the legislature on what we ought to do I
 
01:11:33.410 --> 01:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
don't want to do this seat of the pants
 
01:11:36.410 --> 01:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
I I wanted I want to do it right so if
 
01:11:38.169 --> 01:11:38.179 align:start position:0%
you will stay on that
 
01:11:41.450 --> 01:11:41.460 align:start position:0%
I'd appreciate that and and again thank
 
01:11:43.970 --> 01:11:43.980 align:start position:0%
you for for being willing to get
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
involved early
 
01:11:48.229 --> 01:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
thank you it has been a pleasure in the
 
01:11:49.729 --> 01:11:49.739 align:start position:0%
um and you're absolutely right the the
 
01:11:51.410 --> 01:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
research is developing to Senator
 
01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
rosenwald's point to yours there's inter
 
01:11:55.130 --> 01:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
there's interesting information out
 
01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
there the surgeon Generals Report which
 
01:11:58.850 --> 01:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
we'll send out also links a number of
 
01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
studies that talk about some of the
 
01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
negative impacts again their their
 
01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
individual studies so I think we are in
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
that exploration phase certainly through
 
01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
the summer to synthesize what is out
 
01:12:11.450 --> 01:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
there right now and what are the holes
 
01:12:15.610 --> 01:12:15.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:18.649 --> 01:12:18.659 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
01:12:20.290 --> 01:12:20.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:12:22.250 --> 01:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
first of all thank you for the report
 
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's very informative and very useful
 
01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:28.020 align:start position:0%
although a lot of this is talking about
 
01:12:30.110 --> 01:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
the issue and trying to find ways made
 
01:12:32.450 --> 01:12:32.460 align:start position:0%
to prevent the issue of bullying and so
 
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
forth I commend it
 
01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
in the interim period of time what are
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
we doing for the children where can they
 
01:12:41.330 --> 01:12:41.340 align:start position:0%
turn because at this point in time if
 
01:12:45.430 --> 01:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
they're feeling hopeless and sad
 
01:12:47.450 --> 01:12:47.460 align:start position:0%
so we wait until all of a sudden
 
01:12:49.130 --> 01:12:49.140 align:start position:0%
something happens but what do we do to
 
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
be more proactive to allow the students
 
01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
a safe place to go so they can report it
 
01:12:55.850 --> 01:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
be given resources they need to deal
 
01:12:57.950 --> 01:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
with it Jenny's great to answer that so
 
01:12:59.870 --> 01:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
I think this is about connectedness and
 
01:13:01.970 --> 01:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
so where can young people feel most
 
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
connected and safe to go that is where
 
01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:05.820 align:start position:0%
they should go so it needs to be there
 
01:13:07.790 --> 01:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
need to be a lot of options so we have
 
01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
you know folks in internally inside the
 
01:13:11.870 --> 01:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
schools that people can talk to having
 
01:13:13.130 --> 01:13:13.140 align:start position:0%
trusted adults throughout our
 
01:13:15.410 --> 01:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
communities is critical and we have our
 
01:13:17.570 --> 01:13:17.580 align:start position:0%
you know crisis resources available for
 
01:13:19.370 --> 01:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health that really most
 
01:13:21.229 --> 01:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
recently we've been doing so much crisis
 
01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
transformation work and we've opened
 
01:13:25.669 --> 01:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
that up both at the national level and
 
01:13:27.530 --> 01:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire where we used to have
 
01:13:29.450 --> 01:13:29.460 align:start position:0%
you know the National Suicide Prevention
 
01:13:31.790 --> 01:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
Crisis Line we're now looking at that as
 
01:13:34.850 --> 01:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
a crisis line Lifeline more broadly and
 
01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
trying to get Upstream so that people
 
01:13:39.050 --> 01:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
can call tax chat well before a time of
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
Crisis so when young people are feeling
 
01:13:44.090 --> 01:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed is the time to make that to
 
01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
already start to make that connection
 
01:13:48.530 --> 01:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
and get some of those resources my
 
01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
five-year-old has told her whole class
 
01:13:52.189 --> 01:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
when you need police fire or ambulance
 
01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
you call 9-1-1 and when you're feeling
 
01:13:59.570 --> 01:13:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:01.330 --> 01:14:01.340 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for that's very helpful to
 
01:14:06.350 --> 01:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
hear that is there some initiative at
 
01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:08.460 align:start position:0%
least within the school system or any
 
01:14:10.669 --> 01:14:10.679 align:start position:0%
school or even a community that there is
 
01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
that trusted adult that has been
 
01:14:14.930 --> 01:14:14.940 align:start position:0%
identified if you will so the kids
 
01:14:17.689 --> 01:14:17.699 align:start position:0%
children if you will know who that adult
 
01:14:20.450 --> 01:14:20.460 align:start position:0%
is so when they call 988 which is great
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
but at the same time somebody within
 
01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:25.790 align:start position:0%
but at the same time somebody within
their

01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
environment that they know is a trusted
 
01:14:31.130 --> 01:14:31.140 align:start position:0%
an adult that's been identified as truly
 
01:14:32.570 --> 01:14:32.580 align:start position:0%
an interested adult that they can go to
 
01:14:34.550 --> 01:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
so Department of Education has social
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
emotional Wellness Division and we've
 
01:14:37.370 --> 01:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
worked closely with them to make sure
 
01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
that every school district is aware of
 
01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
our rapid response resources our mobile
 
01:14:43.490 --> 01:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
crisis teams that can respond in schools
 
01:14:45.290 --> 01:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
the resources provided you know through
 
01:14:48.410 --> 01:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
988 that students can access so making
 
01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
sure that our school districts have
 
01:14:52.130 --> 01:14:52.140 align:start position:0%
information about all of the crisis
 
01:14:55.310 --> 01:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
resources as well as every school has
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
you know has folks that are safe
 
01:14:59.450 --> 01:14:59.460 align:start position:0%
um safe people to go to but sometimes
 
01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
that might be very specific and a
 
01:15:03.229 --> 01:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
Student Assistance professional which
 
01:15:05.810 --> 01:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
works sort of like an EAP for adults but
 
01:15:08.149 --> 01:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
it's for students right and and that may
 
01:15:10.010 --> 01:15:10.020 align:start position:0%
be the identified person that doesn't
 
01:15:11.570 --> 01:15:11.580 align:start position:0%
mean the student isn't still picking the
 
01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
art teacher or the math teacher or
 
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
whomever to talk to it's going to be
 
01:15:16.790 --> 01:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
about who they feel safe and comfortable
 
01:15:19.010 --> 01:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
coming to which is why it needs to be
 
01:15:21.130 --> 01:15:21.140 align:start position:0%
that everyone has the information
 
01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
I I can't understand underscore that as
 
01:15:26.209 --> 01:15:26.219 align:start position:0%
anymore it really is a community
 
01:15:28.189 --> 01:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
response at the end of the day you know
 
01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
children are going to find those trusted
 
01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
adults in many places hopefully I mean I
 
01:15:34.669 --> 01:15:34.679 align:start position:0%
think it is incumbent on all of us
 
01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
within our communities to ensure that
 
01:15:38.149 --> 01:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
there are places where kids can connect
 
01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
and that's going to look very different
 
01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
for very different kids we have sports
 
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
teams that some kids really connect and
 
01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
they've got trusted coaches we have kids
 
01:15:47.689 --> 01:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
who are in the Arts we have kids who do
 
01:15:51.410 --> 01:15:51.420 align:start position:0%
music there are other you know 4-H we
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
need to build a resilient community that
 
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
is really focused on ensuring that kids
 
01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
have relationships with trusted adults
 
01:16:02.450 --> 01:16:02.460 align:start position:0%
and model positive peer interactions
 
01:16:04.729 --> 01:16:04.739 align:start position:0%
I will just also mention that we do have
 
01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:06.780 align:start position:0%
both Mental Health First Aid curriculum
 
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
a youth Mental Health First Aid going on
 
01:16:10.970 --> 01:16:10.980 align:start position:0%
throughout New Hampshire that's already
 
01:16:12.890 --> 01:16:12.900 align:start position:0%
available for sort of those Gatekeepers
 
01:16:14.630 --> 01:16:14.640 align:start position:0%
which means just our general population
 
01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
having an understanding of Youth mental
 
01:16:18.250 --> 01:16:18.260 align:start position:0%
health per state and how to connect to
 
01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
resources as well as nami's connect
 
01:16:23.090 --> 01:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
program are just some examples of where
 
01:16:25.430 --> 01:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
we are able to as community members
 
01:16:28.130 --> 01:16:28.140 align:start position:0%
broadly get everyone sort of some amount
 
01:16:30.169 --> 01:16:30.179 align:start position:0%
of training because really when it comes
 
01:16:32.149 --> 01:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
down to it when a young person comes to
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
you with a concern it's about having the
 
01:16:35.570 --> 01:16:35.580 align:start position:0%
courage to have a really difficult
 
01:16:38.149 --> 01:16:38.159 align:start position:0%
conversation and having the language and
 
01:16:40.370 --> 01:16:40.380 align:start position:0%
the resources right and so in the more
 
01:16:41.689 --> 01:16:41.699 align:start position:0%
people we can train in those sort of
 
01:16:44.209 --> 01:16:44.219 align:start position:0%
gatekeeper trainings the more often our
 
01:16:46.010 --> 01:16:46.020 align:start position:0%
adults are ready when their kids need
 
01:16:46.020 --> 01:16:47.270 align:start position:0%
adults are ready when their kids need
them

01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
because of the hour and the number of
 
01:16:51.050 --> 01:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
agenda items I'm going to thank you both
 
01:16:54.530 --> 01:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
for coming and keep us posted and I've
 
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
already asked um

councilor Williams to put on the
 
01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
September agenda this group from

thank you
 
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's newborn screening
 
01:18:38.649 --> 01:18:38.659 align:start position:0%
program acting in accordance with RSA
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:47.410 --> 01:18:47.420 align:start position:0%
in calendar
 
01:18:50.169 --> 01:18:50.179 align:start position:0%
2021 12
 
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
547 infants born in New Hampshire were
 
01:18:57.649 --> 01:18:57.659 align:start position:0%
screened for the 37 disorders on our
 
01:19:02.709 --> 01:19:02.719 align:start position:0%
panel this represents 99 of the births
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
there is an opt-out uh it parents do not
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
wish to have their child screened
 
01:19:13.209 --> 01:19:13.219 align:start position:0%
um in that same calendar year there were
 
01:19:16.970 --> 01:19:16.980 align:start position:0%
662 infants with abnormal screening
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
results so remember this is a screening
 
01:19:23.090 --> 01:19:23.100 align:start position:0%
program uh not uh not a definitive
 
01:19:27.470 --> 01:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
diagnosis of those infants 35 had a
 
01:19:31.010 --> 01:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
definitive positive diagnoses
 
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
what's new in our program for the first
 
01:19:36.189 --> 01:19:36.199 align:start position:0%
time since the program has been in place
 
01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:40.920 align:start position:0%
we now have two uh fte's specifically
 
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
devoted to newborn screening in the past
 
01:19:46.850 --> 01:19:46.860 align:start position:0%
we used to have to pull from other
 
01:19:49.689 --> 01:19:49.699 align:start position:0%
programs nurses from other programs from
 
01:19:52.090 --> 01:19:52.100 align:start position:0%
maternal and child health
 
01:19:55.970 --> 01:19:55.980 align:start position:0%
to to work the program but now we have
 
01:19:58.450 --> 01:19:58.460 align:start position:0%
wonderful time employee into part-time
 
01:20:01.729 --> 01:20:01.739 align:start position:0%
uh this has allowed us to expand our
 
01:20:04.370 --> 01:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
efforts in quality improvement and
 
01:20:07.130 --> 01:20:07.140 align:start position:0%
particularly in follow-up both with
 
01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
families and providers
 
01:20:12.890 --> 01:20:12.900 align:start position:0%
so timeliness so just as an example of
 
01:20:15.290 --> 01:20:15.300 align:start position:0%
our quality improvement timeliness and
 
01:20:17.470 --> 01:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
newbird screening is key
 
01:20:22.330 --> 01:20:22.340 align:start position:0%
birthing hospitals pay per filter paper
 
01:20:25.390 --> 01:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
although Medicaid does pay
 
01:20:29.870 --> 01:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
a certain percentage of that and
 
01:20:34.729 --> 01:20:34.739 align:start position:0%
um an unsatisfactory specimen requires a
 
01:20:37.970 --> 01:20:37.980 align:start position:0%
delayed time requires an infant to come
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
back and be re-screened again and it
 
01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
also costs the birthing Hospital another
 
01:20:45.910 --> 01:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
filter paper
 
01:20:49.610 --> 01:20:49.620 align:start position:0%
so we are working on
 
01:20:52.669 --> 01:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
um uh unsatisfactory specimens as part
 
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
of our quality improvement and in
 
01:20:59.630 --> 01:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
calendar year 2021 uh the estimated uh
 
01:21:02.689 --> 01:21:02.699 align:start position:0%
monetary figure for unsatisfactory
 
01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
specimens was 32 996.
 
01:21:08.350 --> 01:21:08.360 align:start position:0%
there are many reasons for
 
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
unsatisfactory specimens there's too
 
01:21:14.209 --> 01:21:14.219 align:start position:0%
much blood to too little blood timing
 
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
it's not dry
 
01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
Etc so what are quality improvement
 
01:21:20.030 --> 01:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
staff has done and has worked with
 
01:21:23.209 --> 01:21:23.219 align:start position:0%
Irving hospitals directly to reduce
 
01:21:27.530 --> 01:21:27.540 align:start position:0%
these unsatisfactory specimens on a
 
01:21:30.110 --> 01:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
quarterly basis New Hampshire's newborn
 
01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
screening program reflects back to the
 
01:21:35.450 --> 01:21:35.460 align:start position:0%
birthing hospitals and birthing centers
 
01:21:38.410 --> 01:21:38.420 align:start position:0%
their quality improvement data including
 
01:21:41.149 --> 01:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
unsatisfactory specimens time of blood
 
01:21:45.050 --> 01:21:45.060 align:start position:0%
time to get to the laboratory Etc
 
01:21:49.370 --> 01:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
so as I said I am the section head of
 
01:21:51.410 --> 01:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
maternal and child health but I'm also
 
01:21:53.090 --> 01:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
the co-chair of the newborn screening
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
advisory committee again regulated by uh
 
01:22:00.189 --> 01:22:00.199 align:start position:0%
that same law and administrative rules
 
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
we meet on a biannual basis to hear
 
01:22:06.530 --> 01:22:06.540 align:start position:0%
updates from the program uh from our
 
01:22:09.530 --> 01:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
contracted laboratory uh the New England
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh screening program at UMass Medical
 
01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:14.050 align:start position:0%
uh screening program at UMass Medical
School

01:22:14.050 --> 01:22:14.060 align:start position:0%
School
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
are contracted metabolic Specialists
 
01:22:19.870 --> 01:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
who's a physician at Boston Children's
 
01:22:23.149 --> 01:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
and often from experts and families when
 
01:22:26.330 --> 01:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
we are considering another disorder to
 
01:22:29.450 --> 01:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
the screening panel we consider new
 
01:22:33.290 --> 01:22:33.300 align:start position:0%
disorders when a disorder has it's been
 
01:22:35.689 --> 01:22:35.699 align:start position:0%
added to the National paddle of
 
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
disorders called the rust as well as by
 
01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:42.300 align:start position:0%
families often Health Care Providers and
 
01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
other Advocates and we welcome all to
 
01:22:49.250 --> 01:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go into a little bit about
 
01:22:52.850 --> 01:22:52.860 align:start position:0%
the program
 
01:22:54.709 --> 01:22:54.719 align:start position:0%
um so the two as Rhonda mentioned the
 
01:22:56.090 --> 01:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
two main
 
01:22:57.770 --> 01:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
um goals of the program are quality
 
01:22:59.689 --> 01:22:59.699 align:start position:0%
improvement and follow-up
 
01:23:01.010 --> 01:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
um and with that being said this past
 
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
year we applied for a first-time funding
 
01:23:06.709 --> 01:23:06.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity through hersa we received
 
01:23:09.229 --> 01:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
the award and this grant will help
 
01:23:11.149 --> 01:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
support State's newborn screening
 
01:23:13.130 --> 01:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
programs specifically around quality
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
improvement and follow-up so what that
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
means is that the program will continue
 
01:23:21.649 --> 01:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
to work with hospitals and providers to
 
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
make sure that accurate information and
 
01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:26.030 align:start position:0%
make sure that accurate information and
um

01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
accurate information is put on the
 
01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
filter papers in order to reduce some of
 
01:23:32.570 --> 01:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
this unsatisfactory specimen Timeless
 
01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:34.790 align:start position:0%
this unsatisfactory specimen Timeless
delays

01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
delays
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
um and then it is also going to help
 
01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:39.890 align:start position:0%
um and then it is also going to help
um

01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:43.370 --> 01:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
with sorry um quality improvement
 
01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:44.209 align:start position:0%
with sorry um quality improvement
um

01:23:44.209 --> 01:23:44.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:53.810 --> 01:23:53.820 align:start position:0%
work with The Courier Service to get the
 
01:23:58.430 --> 01:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
lab filter papers to the UMass Medical
 
01:24:02.090 --> 01:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
school for results the second thing is
 
01:24:04.250 --> 01:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
follow-up and this is really the focus
 
01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
of this grant is to ensure so we start
 
01:24:08.930 --> 01:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
off with the screening right baby screen
 
01:24:11.209 --> 01:24:11.219 align:start position:0%
there's potential out of range from
 
01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
there we need to see if the baby was
 
01:24:17.149 --> 01:24:17.159 align:start position:0%
diagnosed with a disorder from there if
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
the baby is diagnosed the goal is to
 
01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:21.719 align:start position:0%
connect the family with other families
 
01:24:24.110 --> 01:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
and to connect the family with resources
 
01:24:26.450 --> 01:24:26.460 align:start position:0%
specific to their child's Disorder so we
 
01:24:28.370 --> 01:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
know these over here disorders right so
 
01:24:30.050 --> 01:24:30.060 align:start position:0%
how can you connect the small number of
 
01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
kids with a group of families within New
 
01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for support and also to
 
01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
provide them accurate resources right so
 
01:24:38.450 --> 01:24:38.460 align:start position:0%
there's lots of stuff out there as we
 
01:24:40.610 --> 01:24:40.620 align:start position:0%
all know but this is what the goal is is
 
01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
to make sure that these families have
 
01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
accurate information and are able to
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
connect with other families within the
 
01:24:49.130 --> 01:24:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:49.140 --> 01:24:49.850 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:49.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:51.709 --> 01:24:51.719 align:start position:0%
the other thing that this grant will do
 
01:24:55.550 --> 01:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
is it will support new online ordering
 
01:24:58.610 --> 01:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
system so for hospitals instead of
 
01:25:00.410 --> 01:25:00.420 align:start position:0%
calling the program to request more
 
01:25:03.290 --> 01:25:03.300 align:start position:0%
filter papers it will provide an online
 
01:25:06.169 --> 01:25:06.179 align:start position:0%
system so that they can just call me or
 
01:25:07.970 --> 01:25:07.980 align:start position:0%
go online and order their filter papers
 
01:25:11.090 --> 01:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
it will also
 
01:25:14.810 --> 01:25:14.820 align:start position:0%
um provide what is our current vendor is
 
01:25:16.850 --> 01:25:16.860 align:start position:0%
a newborn screening module So within our
 
01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
data system so that we can follow this
 
01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
child to make sure that it is received
 
01:25:24.110 --> 01:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
all of the necessary services that it
 
01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:27.229 align:start position:0%
all of the necessary services that it
needs

01:25:27.229 --> 01:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:28.750 --> 01:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:25:34.490 --> 01:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to understand a little bit
 
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
better about this issue of the
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
availability am I right the availability
 
01:25:45.130 --> 01:25:45.140 align:start position:0%
of filter papers and
 
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
it sounded to me as I was listening like
 
01:25:50.090 --> 01:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
there were two possible places where
 
01:25:52.370 --> 01:25:52.380 align:start position:0%
things can go awry one is having the
 
01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
filter paper available initially and the
 
01:25:58.669 --> 01:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
other is uh taking the test in a timely
 
01:26:00.590 --> 01:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
manner and getting it to the lab in a
 
01:26:03.169 --> 01:26:03.179 align:start position:0%
timely manner is that correct so and so
 
01:26:04.970 --> 01:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know a little bit more about
 
01:26:07.129 --> 01:26:07.139 align:start position:0%
where the where the bumps are in those
 
01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
roads so
 
01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
um we work with all of the birthing
 
01:26:15.229 --> 01:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
hospitals and routinely send them a
 
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
large portion based on their numbers of
 
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
filter paper so there's no problem in
 
01:26:25.070 --> 01:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
that sense the problem uh is uh is
 
01:26:27.770 --> 01:26:27.780 align:start position:0%
really in timeliness you know how fast
 
01:26:30.830 --> 01:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
it gets from uh so so take for a
 
01:26:33.169 --> 01:26:33.179 align:start position:0%
disorder like galactosemia right where
 
01:26:36.310 --> 01:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:39.169 --> 01:26:39.179 align:start position:0%
absorb nutrients from formula from
 
01:26:41.450 --> 01:26:41.460 align:start position:0%
breast milk right so if something fast
 
01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
needs to be done that that test needs to
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
be done fast
 
01:26:49.010 --> 01:26:49.020 align:start position:0%
um and so we it so it's Timeless we have
 
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
a courier that goes from every birthing
 
01:26:54.890 --> 01:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
hospital to our lab in Massachusetts
 
01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
um that has been uh over the last few
 
01:27:02.090 --> 01:27:02.100 align:start position:0%
years uh sometimes great sometimes it's
 
01:27:04.850 --> 01:27:04.860 align:start position:0%
not as great um we meant you know so we
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh can work on the timeline that's
 
01:27:08.510 --> 01:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
actually something that the burning
 
01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:09.950 align:start position:0%
actually something that the burning
hospitals

01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
hospitals
 
01:27:12.669 --> 01:27:12.679 align:start position:0%
um have something to do with but not
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily right Timeless but uh when
 
01:27:18.229 --> 01:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
the specimen is taken which should be
 
01:27:22.370 --> 01:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
between uh 24 to 48 hours after birth
 
01:27:26.810 --> 01:27:26.820 align:start position:0%
um how it's taken hospitals have a a you
 
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
know huge impact on that and that's you
 
01:27:31.850 --> 01:27:31.860 align:start position:0%
know why sometimes unsatisfactory
 
01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
specimens happen because of a variety of
 
01:27:37.370 --> 01:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
different reasons overall
 
01:27:41.090 --> 01:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
um you know our our hospitals are you
 
01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
know are doing a great job of birthing
 
01:27:45.770 --> 01:27:45.780 align:start position:0%
hospitals or birthing centers too we we
 
01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:48.300 align:start position:0%
actually work with the birthing centers
 
01:27:51.129 --> 01:27:51.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:56.570 --> 01:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
filter papers so yes so I I would say
 
01:27:59.149 --> 01:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
that it's just the tweaking inequality
 
01:28:02.590 --> 01:28:02.600 align:start position:0%
Improvement but there's no problem with
 
01:28:05.330 --> 01:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
availability of filter papers
 
01:28:08.330 --> 01:28:08.340 align:start position:0%
what is what is your backup plan if and
 
01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
when UPS goes on strike excuse me what
 
01:28:15.590 --> 01:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
is your backup plan if and when UPS goes
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:24.350 --> 01:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
enough there's two different careers we
 
01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
use so we use ups and City Express so if
 
01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
there is an issue we will use our other
 
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
well the UMass will use their other
 
01:28:35.330 --> 01:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
vendor Courier to pick up the specimen
 
01:28:36.790 --> 01:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:28:39.770 --> 01:28:39.780 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy great thank you um
 
01:28:41.570 --> 01:28:41.580 align:start position:0%
so yeah I think you're answering the
 
01:28:44.090 --> 01:28:44.100 align:start position:0%
question this is not a specimen taken at
 
01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
the time of birth is it it is 24 to 48
 
01:28:49.610 --> 01:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
hours after life so it's not done at the
 
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
time of birth it can be done afterwards
 
01:28:53.149 --> 01:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
by a heel stick or something like that
 
01:28:55.129 --> 01:28:55.139 align:start position:0%
correct and where is the lab that it has
 
01:28:58.430 --> 01:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
to go to how far where is it physically
 
01:29:02.030 --> 01:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
who does this Worcester so UMass Medical
 
01:29:04.129 --> 01:29:04.139 align:start position:0%
Center yes there's no other in New
 
01:29:07.610 --> 01:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
England that has that capability
 
01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
uh we put out a request for proposals
 
01:29:16.669 --> 01:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
every certain amount of years and uh
 
01:29:20.810 --> 01:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
that particular program has uh you know
 
01:29:24.110 --> 01:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
has has won the bid there were very few
 
01:29:27.229 --> 01:29:27.239 align:start position:0%
I think they were the only people who
 
01:29:27.239 --> 01:29:28.669 align:start position:0%
I think they were the only people who
actually

01:29:28.669 --> 01:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:29:32.510 --> 01:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
um uh put a bid in put a proposal in and
 
01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:33.649 align:start position:0%
um uh put a bid in put a proposal in and
uh

01:29:33.649 --> 01:29:33.659 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:29:36.350 --> 01:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
um they also serve as Maine and Vermont
 
01:29:39.530 --> 01:29:39.540 align:start position:0%
and so there are they're a large lab
 
01:29:41.629 --> 01:29:41.639 align:start position:0%
um you know they're very well connected
 
01:29:45.890 --> 01:29:45.900 align:start position:0%
uh have a lot of staff
 
01:29:49.209 --> 01:29:49.219 align:start position:0%
just follow up thank you um 99
 
01:29:51.709 --> 01:29:51.719 align:start position:0%
screening is quite a number
 
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
is is that by Statute then I wasn't
 
01:29:58.750 --> 01:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:00.410 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:30:00.410 --> 01:30:00.420 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:30:03.050 --> 01:30:03.060 align:start position:0%
um Edwards
 
01:30:05.930 --> 01:30:05.940 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair I think I have
 
01:30:09.530 --> 01:30:09.540 align:start position:0%
three small things on on and I'll come
 
01:30:12.290 --> 01:30:12.300 align:start position:0%
back for follow-up on page four this is
 
01:30:15.110 --> 01:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
the back part or the last half of the
 
01:30:18.770 --> 01:30:18.780 align:start position:0%
table showing the number of confirmed
 
01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
cases yeah and so this this makes me
 
01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:23.270 align:start position:0%
cases yeah and so this this makes me
think

01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:24.410 align:start position:0%
think
um

01:30:24.410 --> 01:30:24.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:27.649 --> 01:30:27.659 align:start position:0%
do is this an a good enough database
 
01:30:30.649 --> 01:30:30.659 align:start position:0%
with other data sitting next to it so
 
01:30:33.410 --> 01:30:33.420 align:start position:0%
that it can be sorted and
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
cross-referenced to things like
 
01:30:37.610 --> 01:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
ethnicity or other demographics and
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
correlate it into zip codes so that we
 
01:30:41.930 --> 01:30:41.940 align:start position:0%
understand where our health disparities
 
01:30:44.930 --> 01:30:44.940 align:start position:0%
are yes so okay that's good yeah yes is
 
01:30:46.990 --> 01:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
the right answer
 
01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
on page seven uh and that oh follow okay
 
01:30:55.129 --> 01:30:55.139 align:start position:0%
uh page seven there's a that last
 
01:30:57.110 --> 01:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
paragraph there that starts from January
 
01:31:02.290 --> 01:31:02.300 align:start position:0%
1. you you compare raw data 226 to 252
 
01:31:05.330 --> 01:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
because we're simple people and we look
 
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
at Trends you may want to put that in
 
01:31:09.709 --> 01:31:09.719 align:start position:0%
percentages so that we know what what
 
01:31:12.350 --> 01:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
the trend is there thank you and and
 
01:31:14.689 --> 01:31:14.699 align:start position:0%
then uh one more and this is the last
 
01:31:17.629 --> 01:31:17.639 align:start position:0%
one okay and then maybe this is uh maybe
 
01:31:20.510 --> 01:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
for Dr Murphy as much as any as you guys
 
01:31:23.330 --> 01:31:23.340 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like there's a very fairly
 
01:31:26.229 --> 01:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
sophisticated it program to determine
 
01:31:29.570 --> 01:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
exactly what we test on these newborns
 
01:31:33.470 --> 01:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
and I guess with our emphasis on lead
 
01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
testing at an early age I'm I'm I don't
 
01:31:39.890 --> 01:31:39.900 align:start position:0%
know what the efficacy or potential
 
01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
would be of testing for lead here
 
01:31:46.430 --> 01:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
because testing for lead at six months I
 
01:31:49.250 --> 01:31:49.260 align:start position:0%
think is in the statute that that seems
 
01:31:51.709 --> 01:31:51.719 align:start position:0%
to be administratively logistically
 
01:31:54.770 --> 01:31:54.780 align:start position:0%
tougher for parents I'm wondering if if
 
01:31:58.370 --> 01:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
there's a possibility to throw into this
 
01:32:01.610 --> 01:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
mix the analysis of whether or not lead
 
01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
testing would be relevant your thoughts
 
01:32:07.010 --> 01:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
I do not know how
 
01:32:09.600 --> 01:32:10.250 align:start position:0%
I do not know how
um

01:32:10.250 --> 01:32:10.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
the lead would be affecting a newborn in
 
01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
because I don't know if it crosses the
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
placental barrier and would it be
 
01:32:19.310 --> 01:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
relevant and not at the time of birth or
 
01:32:20.689 --> 01:32:20.699 align:start position:0%
not would it be of something that would
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
have to be environmentally determined
 
01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
after the child is born for a period of
 
01:32:26.030 --> 01:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
time and therefore the six month window
 
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know enough about it to comment
 
01:32:29.930 --> 01:32:29.940 align:start position:0%
on that but I also don't know whether or
 
01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
not that the lead would actually cross
 
01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
you know a placental barrier to affect
 
01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
the child at Birth so would anybody on
 
01:32:40.189 --> 01:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
the committee with an MD or do be
 
01:32:42.050 --> 01:32:42.060 align:start position:0%
willing to research that absolutely
 
01:32:44.570 --> 01:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
01:32:47.209 --> 01:32:47.219 align:start position:0%
I do not have either an empty or a do
 
01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you just a couple of
 
01:32:50.689 --> 01:32:50.699 align:start position:0%
things one the legislation is for
 
01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
testing for lead at one year not at six
 
01:32:54.950 --> 01:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
months and part of that is just
 
01:32:56.450 --> 01:32:56.460 align:start position:0%
behavioral as well that's when your
 
01:32:58.250 --> 01:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
baby's out moving around and likely to
 
01:33:00.709 --> 01:33:00.719 align:start position:0%
touch stuff that has lead in it
 
01:33:02.810 --> 01:33:02.820 align:start position:0%
um the other point we are doing some
 
01:33:04.669 --> 01:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
pilot work right now with some of our
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
home visiting programs to start
 
01:33:09.590 --> 01:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
pregnancy to start voluntarily testing
 
01:33:11.810 --> 01:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
lead among pregnant women and to your
 
01:33:13.310 --> 01:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
point we can get you the clinical
 
01:33:14.810 --> 01:33:14.820 align:start position:0%
information on there but we're starting
 
01:33:17.209 --> 01:33:17.219 align:start position:0%
to understand that also
 
01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
um not only for their health and their
 
01:33:20.990 --> 01:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
infant's Health but also to be aware of
 
01:33:22.610 --> 01:33:22.620 align:start position:0%
whether or not that's a healthy home to
 
01:33:24.410 --> 01:33:24.420 align:start position:0%
begin with so if a mother even though
 
01:33:26.570 --> 01:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
she might not have the same negative
 
01:33:29.090 --> 01:33:29.100 align:start position:0%
health effects as a very small baby if
 
01:33:30.770 --> 01:33:30.780 align:start position:0%
she's testing positive for lead that
 
01:33:32.570 --> 01:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
that's a reason to do some investigation
 
01:33:34.669 --> 01:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
into the home it's across though and
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
it's completely volunteer
 
01:33:38.990 --> 01:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:33:43.090 --> 01:33:43.100 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald just curious what your
 
01:33:49.070 --> 01:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
99 for all births in New Hampshire 99 is
 
01:33:54.830 --> 01:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
for all so yeah so I don't know I would
 
01:33:57.229 --> 01:33:57.239 align:start position:0%
have to look into specifically for home
 
01:33:59.450 --> 01:33:59.460 align:start position:0%
births thank you because it's you're
 
01:34:01.790 --> 01:34:01.800 align:start position:0%
just reporting a hospitals in this
 
01:34:03.830 --> 01:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
document this is all birthston New
 
01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:04.910 align:start position:0%
document this is all birthston New
Hampshire

01:34:04.910 --> 01:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:06.950 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
okay

01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:34:10.970 --> 01:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:14.030 --> 01:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair also thank you for
 
01:34:16.729 --> 01:34:16.739 align:start position:0%
the report I also want to congratulate
 
01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
the department I looked at the numbers
 
01:34:21.530 --> 01:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
here on I think it was on page
 
01:34:23.209 --> 01:34:23.219 align:start position:0%
where was it
 
01:34:24.770 --> 01:34:24.780 align:start position:0%
the growth you've seen I think it was on
 
01:34:27.169 --> 01:34:27.179 align:start position:0%
page six
 
01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
um back in 2015 it was 78 percent he
 
01:34:33.950 --> 01:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
folks now getting to 96 almost 97
 
01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:35.149 align:start position:0%
folks now getting to 96 almost 97
percent

01:34:35.149 --> 01:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:34:36.590 --> 01:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
um now I think according to last one is
 
01:34:38.450 --> 01:34:38.460 align:start position:0%
99 so I want to congratulate you folks
 
01:34:39.649 --> 01:34:39.659 align:start position:0%
on that accomplishment there's something
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:34:44.890 --> 01:34:44.900 align:start position:0%
pointed out on page eight
 
01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
one of the things you talked about is
 
01:34:50.450 --> 01:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
short and long term and it's one thing
 
01:34:52.729 --> 01:34:52.739 align:start position:0%
to identify a baby who has these
 
01:34:56.270 --> 01:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
abnormalities that need to be treated
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
but following them and being sure that
 
01:35:00.290 --> 01:35:00.300 align:start position:0%
they're getting the care and the
 
01:35:01.610 --> 01:35:01.620 align:start position:0%
treatments and so what they need I think
 
01:35:03.770 --> 01:35:03.780 align:start position:0%
is really critical but at the same time
 
01:35:05.450 --> 01:35:05.460 align:start position:0%
there's a phrasing here about sharing
 
01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:06.590 align:start position:0%
there's a phrasing here about sharing
data

01:35:06.590 --> 01:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:35:07.970 --> 01:35:07.980 align:start position:0%
and I don't know whether that's going to
 
01:35:09.709 --> 01:35:09.719 align:start position:0%
require a legislative change to have
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
data sharing so that you folks can
 
01:35:13.550 --> 01:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
accomplish that because it's going to be
 
01:35:15.470 --> 01:35:15.480 align:start position:0%
some way to monitor those children over
 
01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:16.310 align:start position:0%
some way to monitor those children over
time

01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
to ensure that they're getting the
 
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
treatment they need that's probably
 
01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
going to require some sort of data
 
01:35:23.810 --> 01:35:23.820 align:start position:0%
sharing amongst different providers is
 
01:35:25.550 --> 01:35:25.560 align:start position:0%
there any barrier that legislative we
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:31.550 --> 01:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
that's a great question
 
01:35:35.090 --> 01:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
um we began the process to amend the
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
current rules to allow
 
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
um for confirmation of disorders from
 
01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:42.110 align:start position:0%
um for confirmation of disorders from
providers

01:35:42.110 --> 01:35:42.120 align:start position:0%
providers
 
01:35:44.750 --> 01:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
and then there is the potential that we
 
01:35:47.629 --> 01:35:47.639 align:start position:0%
are going to develop not the potential
 
01:35:49.629 --> 01:35:49.639 align:start position:0%
there is the need at some point to do
 
01:35:52.189 --> 01:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
data sharing agreements with certain
 
01:35:52.199 --> 01:35:56.090 align:start position:0%
data sharing agreements with certain
individuals

01:35:56.090 --> 01:35:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
so follow up so be clear at this point
 
01:36:01.790 --> 01:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
in time you don't think we need to
 
01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:08.510 --> 01:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
um we did change the administ just
 
01:36:10.850 --> 01:36:10.860 align:start position:0%
change the administrative rules so at
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
this point uh no but we're always open I
 
01:36:14.880 --> 01:36:15.830 align:start position:0%
this point uh no but we're always open I
mean

01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:36:18.169 --> 01:36:18.179 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that we look at
 
01:36:21.410 --> 01:36:21.420 align:start position:0%
when we want to add a disorder
 
01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:23.460 align:start position:0%
um is you know the availability of
 
01:36:26.570 --> 01:36:26.580 align:start position:0%
treatment or is there treatment for you
 
01:36:28.729 --> 01:36:28.739 align:start position:0%
know oftentimes for some of these
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
disorders there is no treatment or you
 
01:36:34.370 --> 01:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
know it doesn't matter at what time the
 
01:36:38.689 --> 01:36:38.699 align:start position:0%
treatment is uh is provided but they're
 
01:36:40.970 --> 01:36:40.980 align:start position:0%
costly the the disorders are very
 
01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
closely to the family and
 
01:36:46.669 --> 01:36:46.679 align:start position:0%
um so uh
 
01:36:50.450 --> 01:36:50.460 align:start position:0%
yeah so so we just
 
01:36:53.709 --> 01:36:53.719 align:start position:0%
um we think that we've developed the uh
 
01:36:57.890 --> 01:36:57.900 align:start position:0%
administrative rules to help us to
 
01:36:59.930 --> 01:36:59.940 align:start position:0%
um you know support confirmatory
 
01:36:59.940 --> 01:37:01.729 align:start position:0%
um you know support confirmatory
diagnoses

01:37:01.729 --> 01:37:01.739 align:start position:0%
diagnoses
 
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
um which is why you have 2021 data as
 
01:37:07.629 --> 01:37:07.639 align:start position:0%
opposed to 2022 because it takes between
 
01:37:10.490 --> 01:37:10.500 align:start position:0%
four or six months to about a year and a
 
01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
half between the program and and uh the
 
01:37:17.930 --> 01:37:17.940 align:start position:0%
health care provider uh that has the
 
01:37:17.940 --> 01:37:21.110 align:start position:0%
health care provider uh that has the
confirmation

01:37:21.110 --> 01:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:23.629 --> 01:37:23.639 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:37:27.770 --> 01:37:27.780 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald thank you when uh
 
01:37:32.330 --> 01:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
when a um abnormal screening is picked
 
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
up is that not a result that's given to
 
01:37:40.689 --> 01:37:40.699 align:start position:0%
the provider yes so
 
01:37:44.090 --> 01:37:44.100 align:start position:0%
the provider responsible for providing
 
01:37:46.250 --> 01:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
the case so the program is in contact
 
01:37:49.310 --> 01:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
with the provider initially but it's the
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
provider's responsibility to take care
 
01:37:55.490 --> 01:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
of the newborn that's correct the
 
01:38:00.430 --> 01:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:04.850 --> 01:38:04.860 align:start position:0%
I was curious on page two about fees for
 
01:38:07.610 --> 01:38:07.620 align:start position:0%
the filter papers and so on and I texted
 
01:38:10.370 --> 01:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
uh Ms minnehan from the hospitals and
 
01:38:13.310 --> 01:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
she reminded me that the great Committee
 
01:38:15.410 --> 01:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services and elderly
 
01:38:19.189 --> 01:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
Affairs last term passed the bill to get
 
01:38:22.070 --> 01:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
the hospitals some reimbursement so
 
01:38:26.209 --> 01:38:26.219 align:start position:0%
thank you for that reminder and thank
 
01:38:27.709 --> 01:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
you for coming and making your
 
01:38:30.649 --> 01:38:30.659 align:start position:0%
presentation and you may leave as soon
 
01:38:34.250 --> 01:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
as we recognize uh representative quick
 
01:38:37.010 --> 01:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
follow-up let can cross the placenta
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
into the fetus I knew that okay no no no
 
01:38:43.189 --> 01:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
I wasn't aware you know I called for
 
01:38:46.370 --> 01:38:46.380 align:start position:0%
doctors not Colonels with titanium not
 
01:38:48.890 --> 01:38:48.900 align:start position:0%
lead so I mean I wasn't aware of that so
 
01:38:50.629 --> 01:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
um but it can but the recommendation is
 
01:38:53.950 --> 01:38:53.960 align:start position:0%
still 9 to 12 months for testing yeah
 
01:38:56.270 --> 01:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
and now thank you
 
01:38:59.209 --> 01:38:59.219 align:start position:0%

and Sandy pharaohs uh for an update on
 
01:39:17.689 --> 01:39:17.699 align:start position:0%
the developmental Services redesign
 
01:39:20.450 --> 01:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
implementation status
 
01:39:22.669 --> 01:39:22.679 align:start position:0%
um and you are definitely one of them
 
01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
good morning yes hi I'm Melissa Hardy
 
01:39:26.990 --> 01:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
I'm the division director for long-term
 
01:39:29.209 --> 01:39:29.219 align:start position:0%
supports and services Sandy is not
 
01:39:30.890 --> 01:39:30.900 align:start position:0%
joining me today she sends her regards
 
01:39:33.229 --> 01:39:33.239 align:start position:0%
but thank you for having us on the
 
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
agenda this morning
 
01:39:37.669 --> 01:39:37.679 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to I'm here to give an
 
01:39:40.669 --> 01:39:40.679 align:start position:0%
update on the retained house bill um 608
 
01:39:43.129 --> 01:39:43.139 align:start position:0%
for developmental Services redesign
 
01:39:46.850 --> 01:39:46.860 align:start position:0%
implementation so that was introduced
 
01:39:49.189 --> 01:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
um this year for legislation as it
 
01:39:52.250 --> 01:39:52.260 align:start position:0%
relates to piloting recommendations we
 
01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
received from the Alvarez and marsal
 
01:39:58.250 --> 01:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
report for developmental services so
 
01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
we're still focused as the bureau on our
 
01:40:04.970 --> 01:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
compliance piece of our plan which is
 
01:40:07.250 --> 01:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
not part of the the piloting or the
 
01:40:10.090 --> 01:40:10.100 align:start position:0%
recommendation so I think everyone here
 
01:40:13.729 --> 01:40:13.739 align:start position:0%
is aware that our corrective action plan
 
01:40:18.110 --> 01:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
through CMS has an end date of July 1st
 
01:40:21.110 --> 01:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
so that is next Saturday we are counting
 
01:40:25.850 --> 01:40:25.860 align:start position:0%
down to that date we have not began any
 
01:40:27.530 --> 01:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
piloting of the redesign or any
 
01:40:29.450 --> 01:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
discussions of the redesign as we've
 
01:40:32.810 --> 01:40:32.820 align:start position:0%
been focused on being in our compliance
 
01:40:34.750 --> 01:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
with our corrective action plan
 
01:40:38.390 --> 01:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
so I wanted to just provide a high level
 
01:40:40.490 --> 01:40:40.500 align:start position:0%
overview of some of the stakeholder and
 
01:40:43.010 --> 01:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
family engagement that we've been doing
 
01:40:45.250 --> 01:40:45.260 align:start position:0%
at the Bureau of Developmental services
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
from the last time I reported out so we
 
01:40:51.169 --> 01:40:51.179 align:start position:0%
were able to and I won't go through
 
01:40:52.669 --> 01:40:52.679 align:start position:0%
every single one we have here but I
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
think some of the highlights we did a
 
01:40:57.649 --> 01:40:57.659 align:start position:0%
webinar series that were about two to
 
01:41:00.890 --> 01:41:00.900 align:start position:0%
five minutes each snippet that were
 
01:41:03.830 --> 01:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
directed towards families as it relates
 
01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
to what does the compliance how does it
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
impact families what does it mean why
 
01:41:10.970 --> 01:41:10.980 align:start position:0%
are we doing it so and we've gotten a
 
01:41:13.390 --> 01:41:13.400 align:start position:0%
lot of really good feedback on families
 
01:41:16.729 --> 01:41:16.739 align:start position:0%
watching those short Snippets of why are
 
01:41:18.530 --> 01:41:18.540 align:start position:0%
we doing this it's really family focused
 
01:41:19.910 --> 01:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
it went through our family
 
01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:21.310 align:start position:0%
it went through our family
Communications

01:41:21.310 --> 01:41:21.320 align:start position:0%
Communications
 
01:41:24.110 --> 01:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
subgroup to make sure it was in language
 
01:41:26.629 --> 01:41:26.639 align:start position:0%
that isn't government speak that's more
 
01:41:29.330 --> 01:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
family friendly speak
 
01:41:32.209 --> 01:41:32.219 align:start position:0%
um we did hold our first of our three
 
01:41:34.790 --> 01:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
family meetings that we were having in
 
01:41:37.550 --> 01:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
person and hybrid yesterday at the Brown
 
01:41:39.830 --> 01:41:39.840 align:start position:0%
building we have two more coming up next

um that will be in person and have a
 
01:41:51.050 --> 01:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
hybrid option so for families and
 
01:41:53.629 --> 01:41:53.639 align:start position:0%
individuals to ask questions and have
 
01:41:55.430 --> 01:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
discussion as they relate specifically
 
01:41:57.770 --> 01:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
to our corrective action plan and how
 
01:42:01.550 --> 01:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
that may impact individuals and Families
 
01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:03.169 align:start position:0%
that may impact individuals and Families
see

01:42:03.169 --> 01:42:03.179 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
we continue with our provider Readiness
 
01:42:09.530 --> 01:42:09.540 align:start position:0%
sessions so having multiple meetings
 
01:42:11.689 --> 01:42:11.699 align:start position:0%
every month on
 
01:42:13.729 --> 01:42:13.739 align:start position:0%
um having our service coordinators our
 
01:42:15.970 --> 01:42:15.980 align:start position:0%
provider agencies come to the table
 
01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
hearing from them how they feel ready
 
01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
for the changes for them on 7-1 having
 
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
trainings as it relates to how they'll
 
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
be able to build directly to Medicaid
 
01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
even going through the New Hampshire
 
01:42:32.990 --> 01:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
easy system and showing our small
 
01:42:34.970 --> 01:42:34.980 align:start position:0%
cohorts how you actually do that so
 
01:42:37.850 --> 01:42:37.860 align:start position:0%
we've been working a lot on that the
 
01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
past six six weeks or so meeting with
 
01:42:43.729 --> 01:42:43.739 align:start position:0%
them and having a lot of just open
 
01:42:46.129 --> 01:42:46.139 align:start position:0%
Office hours to be able to have them
 
01:42:47.930 --> 01:42:47.940 align:start position:0%
come to the table and ask questions in
 
01:42:51.109 --> 01:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
real time and so we can demonstrate you
 
01:42:52.609 --> 01:42:52.619 align:start position:0%
know areas in which they may have
 
01:42:54.350 --> 01:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
questions or concerns we can log right
 
01:42:56.890 --> 01:42:56.900 align:start position:0%
into the system and show them
 
01:43:00.290 --> 01:43:00.300 align:start position:0%
we also as 7-1 approaches we have
 
01:43:03.709 --> 01:43:03.719 align:start position:0%
developed a dedicated telefilled line
 
01:43:06.290 --> 01:43:06.300 align:start position:0%
and an on-call schedule that will be
 
01:43:09.109 --> 01:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
staffed by BDS employees for providers
 
01:43:12.290 --> 01:43:12.300 align:start position:0%
and individuals to contact us directly
 
01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
with any concerns that they may have
 
01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
leading up to the direct Bill process so
 
01:43:20.570 --> 01:43:20.580 align:start position:0%
we have that staffed I actually cover it
 
01:43:23.209 --> 01:43:23.219 align:start position:0%
on the weekends I don't know how uh you
 
01:43:24.470 --> 01:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
know how many people will be calling but
 
01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.360 align:start position:0%

provider Readiness we've had two

developmental Services Department roles
 
01:43:56.930 --> 01:43:56.940 align:start position:0%
information sessions I know that's a
 
01:43:58.490 --> 01:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
mouthful but
 
01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
um we were getting some feedback from
 
01:44:03.290 --> 01:44:03.300 align:start position:0%
the provider Community about who do we
 
01:44:05.510 --> 01:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
go to for what so if we have a concern
 
01:44:08.270 --> 01:44:08.280 align:start position:0%
about fraud waster abuse who do we go to
 
01:44:10.189 --> 01:44:10.199 align:start position:0%
if we have a concern just about the
 
01:44:12.350 --> 01:44:12.360 align:start position:0%
quality of services who in the
 
01:44:15.290 --> 01:44:15.300 align:start position:0%
department are we able to pick up the
 
01:44:18.169 --> 01:44:18.179 align:start position:0%
phone and make a concern to so we were
 
01:44:20.149 --> 01:44:20.159 align:start position:0%
able to pull in different departments
 
01:44:24.290 --> 01:44:24.300 align:start position:0%
from HHS including BDS The Adult
 
01:44:26.810 --> 01:44:26.820 align:start position:0%
Protective Services the office of client
 
01:44:29.950 --> 01:44:29.960 align:start position:0%
Legal Services Program Integrity
 
01:44:32.209 --> 01:44:32.219 align:start position:0%
licensing and certification and we're
 
01:44:33.709 --> 01:44:33.719 align:start position:0%
able to go through some real life
 
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
scenarios so if this were to happen and
 
01:44:38.090 --> 01:44:38.100 align:start position:0%
you're a provider or if you're an area
 
01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
agency who do you who do you go to and
 
01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
whose role is it to follow up so we were
 
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
we got really great participation
 
01:44:48.109 --> 01:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
in those two sessions and we think it's
 
01:44:50.570 --> 01:44:50.580 align:start position:0%
something beneficial not just for BDS
 
01:44:52.430 --> 01:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
but for the Department to continue to
 
01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
have those conversations with different
 
01:44:57.169 --> 01:44:57.179 align:start position:0%
providers so they know who to go to in
 
01:44:59.330 --> 01:44:59.340 align:start position:0%
areas of concern
 
01:44:59.340 --> 01:45:00.410 align:start position:0%
areas of concern
okay

01:45:00.410 --> 01:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:45:03.530 --> 01:45:03.540 align:start position:0%
and then finally some upcoming
 
01:45:06.649 --> 01:45:06.659 align:start position:0%
engagement again we are having two more
 
01:45:09.050 --> 01:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
um in-person family and individual q a
 
01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
sessions in Keenan Conway we're
 
01:45:14.030 --> 01:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
continuing our enrolled provider our
 
01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:16.320 align:start position:0%
cohort Series so that goes up through
 
01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:18.109 align:start position:0%
cohort Series so that goes up through
August

01:45:18.109 --> 01:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
August
 
01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
um which is targeted uh targeted cohort
 
01:45:23.870 --> 01:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
sessions for our new newly enrolled
 
01:45:25.930 --> 01:45:25.940 align:start position:0%
provider so we're able to spend
 
01:45:29.330 --> 01:45:29.340 align:start position:0%
one-on-one time with our our providers
 
01:45:31.850 --> 01:45:31.860 align:start position:0%
to answer their questions we also have
 
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
more New Hampshire easy trainings coming
 
01:45:37.370 --> 01:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
up and we'll we'll be participating in
 
01:45:39.470 --> 01:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
the Statewide family support
 
01:45:41.930 --> 01:45:41.940 align:start position:0%
conference Workshop
 
01:45:44.570 --> 01:45:44.580 align:start position:0%
um again kind of going over BDS systems
 
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
change work what's changing and why so
 
01:45:49.250 --> 01:45:49.260 align:start position:0%
we're able to participate that within
 
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
that with the state Family Support
 
01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.149 align:start position:0%
that with the state Family Support
conference

01:45:53.149 --> 01:45:53.159 align:start position:0%
conference
 
01:45:55.450 --> 01:45:55.460 align:start position:0%
so that's my quick update I don't know
 
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
first of all thank you so much
 
01:46:00.310 --> 01:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
especially for the direct engagement
 
01:46:03.830 --> 01:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
with families that's so important and
 
01:46:06.229 --> 01:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
this is really encouraging to me
 
01:46:09.770 --> 01:46:09.780 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards but thank you I
 
01:46:13.970 --> 01:46:13.980 align:start position:0%
one of the uh topics maybe you can loop
 
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
back around to is I understand that one
 
01:46:20.149 --> 01:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
of our conversion issues on the payment
 
01:46:22.250 --> 01:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
system is that for about three weeks
 
01:46:25.070 --> 01:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to be unable to routinely
 
01:46:28.490 --> 01:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
make payments to Providers and that to
 
01:46:30.709 --> 01:46:30.719 align:start position:0%
your credit you've come up with some
 
01:46:33.410 --> 01:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
workarounds for that and given that we
 
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
probably all have providers in our
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
communities would you just tell us a
 
01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
little bit about this this three-week
 
01:46:42.050 --> 01:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
Gap what causes that and what you're
 
01:46:45.410 --> 01:46:45.420 align:start position:0%
doing to mitigate the the problems sure
 
01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so we the
 
01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
mmis system so that's the the Medicaid
 
01:46:53.510 --> 01:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
payment system through the state will
 
01:46:56.149 --> 01:46:56.159 align:start position:0%
have a blackout period for updates I
 
01:46:59.330 --> 01:46:59.340 align:start position:0%
believe it starts on the 26th with the
 
01:46:59.340 --> 01:47:00.649 align:start position:0%
believe it starts on the 26th with the
latest

01:47:00.649 --> 01:47:00.659 align:start position:0%
latest
 
01:47:00.659 --> 01:47:01.550 align:start position:0%
latest
um

01:47:01.550 --> 01:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:03.890 --> 01:47:03.900 align:start position:0%
for it to be turning back on July 10th
 
01:47:06.050 --> 01:47:06.060 align:start position:0%
we're hoping earlier than that for our
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
conversion but it'll be on at least by
 
01:47:12.830 --> 01:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
July 10th so currently we are working
 
01:47:17.209 --> 01:47:17.219 align:start position:0%
with area agencies on some contingency
 
01:47:21.530 --> 01:47:21.540 align:start position:0%
billing plans also working with our
 
01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
finance team so if we need to provide a
 
01:47:28.609 --> 01:47:28.619 align:start position:0%
payment to an agency or a provider we
 
01:47:31.010 --> 01:47:31.020 align:start position:0%
can do that within 48 hours through our
 
01:47:34.310 --> 01:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire first system so if there's
 
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
a if there's a agency that's
 
01:47:39.050 --> 01:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
experiencing a cash flow issue due to
 
01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
the mmis system being in a blackout
 
01:47:43.729 --> 01:47:43.739 align:start position:0%
period or if they're just billing
 
01:47:46.430 --> 01:47:46.440 align:start position:0%
concerns we're able to issue them
 
01:47:48.109 --> 01:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
payment through New Hampshire first
 
01:47:54.229 --> 01:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:55.810 --> 01:47:55.820 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:47:58.189 --> 01:47:58.199 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you so much thank you
 
01:48:00.050 --> 01:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
keep it up
 
01:48:03.530 --> 01:48:03.540 align:start position:0%
and now we recognize for the monthly
 
01:48:06.229 --> 01:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
updates Mr Henry lippman Medicaid
 
01:48:06.239 --> 01:48:08.030 align:start position:0%
updates Mr Henry lippman Medicaid
director

01:48:08.030 --> 01:48:08.040 align:start position:0%

01:48:10.129 --> 01:48:10.139 align:start position:0%
who's reading my text to him as he
 
01:48:10.139 --> 01:48:12.950 align:start position:0%
who's reading my text to him as he
approaches

01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:19.689 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:48:19.689 --> 01:48:19.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:21.770 --> 01:48:21.780 align:start position:0%
good morning for the record Henry
 
01:48:24.109 --> 01:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
littmann space Medicaid director
 
01:48:26.450 --> 01:48:26.460 align:start position:0%
um what's being passed out is a little
 
01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
snapshot on enrollment uh
 
01:48:31.609 --> 01:48:31.619 align:start position:0%
I'm here today specifically on the
 
01:48:33.890 --> 01:48:33.900 align:start position:0%
agenda to address uh what happened with
 
01:48:35.810 --> 01:48:35.820 align:start position:0%
Grant Advantage I think everyone knows
 
01:48:38.270 --> 01:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
that in hb2 we got a seven year
 
01:48:40.910 --> 01:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
extension thank you very much for for
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
doing so
 
01:48:44.510 --> 01:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
um I think that was a very good
 
01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:46.070 align:start position:0%
um I think that was a very good
compromise

01:48:46.070 --> 01:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
compromise
 
01:48:49.250 --> 01:48:49.260 align:start position:0%
um in terms of just uh what's being
 
01:48:50.510 --> 01:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
passed around want to give you a little
 
01:48:52.250 --> 01:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
snapshot on what's been happening with
 
01:48:54.530 --> 01:48:54.540 align:start position:0%
granite Advantage enrollment if you look
 
01:48:57.350 --> 01:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
at the top uh at the end of March at the
 
01:49:01.129 --> 01:49:01.139 align:start position:0%
high point we're at 96 515 individuals
 
01:49:03.169 --> 01:49:03.179 align:start position:0%
and granted Advantage
 
01:49:05.090 --> 01:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
um and today
 
01:49:07.850 --> 01:49:07.860 align:start position:0%
um just under we're at six on this chart
 
01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
we're at 69 024.
 
01:49:12.709 --> 01:49:12.719 align:start position:0%
um I can give you one small update that
 
01:49:13.970 --> 01:49:13.980 align:start position:0%
I haven't had with down another
 
01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
approximately 900 individuals as of the
 
01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:19.330 align:start position:0%
approximately 900 individuals as of the
19th

01:49:19.330 --> 01:49:19.340 align:start position:0%
19th
 
01:49:23.709 --> 01:49:23.719 align:start position:0%
and basically in terms of enrollment we
 
01:49:25.850 --> 01:49:25.860 align:start position:0%
structured our enrollment so that those
 
01:49:27.410 --> 01:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
people who where we had a large
 
01:49:29.090 --> 01:49:29.100 align:start position:0%
indication that they would no longer be
 
01:49:31.669 --> 01:49:31.679 align:start position:0%
eligible of the first individuals that
 
01:49:35.390 --> 01:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
are put through the unwinding aspect of
 
01:49:37.729 --> 01:49:37.739 align:start position:0%
having to go through redetermination
 
01:49:41.629 --> 01:49:41.639 align:start position:0%
and approximately uh 50 of the
 
01:49:43.609 --> 01:49:43.619 align:start position:0%
individuals that uh
 
01:49:46.129 --> 01:49:46.139 align:start position:0%
that don't continue to qualify on an
 
01:49:48.590 --> 01:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
income base some people age out of
 
01:49:52.010 --> 01:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
granted advantage and so forth I have
 
01:49:54.169 --> 01:49:54.179 align:start position:0%
some information I can leave behind if
 
01:49:56.050 --> 01:49:56.060 align:start position:0%
time is
 
01:49:59.570 --> 01:49:59.580 align:start position:0%
an issue here in terms of what what's
 
01:50:02.090 --> 01:50:02.100 align:start position:0%
been going on with the different reasons
 
01:50:02.100 --> 01:50:03.169 align:start position:0%
been going on with the different reasons
for

01:50:03.169 --> 01:50:03.179 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:50:08.209 --> 01:50:08.219 align:start position:0%
um people losing coverage or closing
 
01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
um you know I think that about 50
 
01:50:12.229 --> 01:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
percent of the people just under 50
 
01:50:13.490 --> 01:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
percent of the people that have gone
 
01:50:15.229 --> 01:50:15.239 align:start position:0%
through redetermination have retained
 
01:50:18.470 --> 01:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
coverage people also have a window of 90
 
01:50:20.990 --> 01:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
days to to come back on without having
 
01:50:24.169 --> 01:50:24.179 align:start position:0%
to file an application but the top three
 
01:50:26.030 --> 01:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
reasons for people to lose coverage are
 
01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
are income
 
01:50:30.649 --> 01:50:30.659 align:start position:0%
failure to respond and then no longer
 
01:50:33.470 --> 01:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
categorically eligible
 
01:50:36.050 --> 01:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
and you know we expected our forecasts
 
01:50:38.149 --> 01:50:38.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of what would happen based on
 
01:50:40.790 --> 01:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
the protected population and the
 
01:50:42.229 --> 01:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
information we had on the approximately
 
01:50:45.709 --> 01:50:45.719 align:start position:0%
just under 104 000 people that we we had
 
01:50:48.050 --> 01:50:48.060 align:start position:0%
good information on before the online
 
01:50:50.209 --> 01:50:50.219 align:start position:0%
began you know we're we're tracking
 
01:50:51.950 --> 01:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
pretty close to what we expected to have
 
01:50:54.229 --> 01:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
happen at this juncture
 
01:50:55.790 --> 01:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
you can see the standard population
 
01:50:55.800 --> 01:50:57.189 align:start position:0%
you can see the standard population
where

01:50:57.189 --> 01:50:57.199 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:51:00.109 --> 01:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
we haven't seen the level of decline in
 
01:51:02.689 --> 01:51:02.699 align:start position:0%
that that group and the way
 
01:51:04.910 --> 01:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
the most vulnerable people
 
01:51:07.070 --> 01:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
um the largest group of children and the
 
01:51:09.530 --> 01:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
and the people who are on our waivers um
 
01:51:11.689 --> 01:51:11.699 align:start position:0%
they're they're not going to be going to
 
01:51:14.050 --> 01:51:14.060 align:start position:0%
their redetermination processes until
 
01:51:16.689 --> 01:51:16.699 align:start position:0%
July August and September time frame
 
01:51:20.870 --> 01:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
that I think is allowing us to perfect
 
01:51:22.370 --> 01:51:22.380 align:start position:0%
um you know our communication and
 
01:51:26.270 --> 01:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
Outreach and uh you know I know that uh
 
01:51:28.910 --> 01:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
we're also seeing just
 
01:51:31.430 --> 01:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
um we've referred as of the end of May
 
01:51:32.930 --> 01:51:32.940 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand two hundred and two
 
01:51:36.290 --> 01:51:36.300 align:start position:0%
people to uh the uh to the federal
 
01:51:38.350 --> 01:51:38.360 align:start position:0%
facilitated Marketplace
 
01:51:41.810 --> 01:51:41.820 align:start position:0%
the local Navigators just are kicking
 
01:51:43.790 --> 01:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
off I think this week
 
01:51:45.770 --> 01:51:45.780 align:start position:0%
um starting to do Outreach from the
 
01:51:47.390 --> 01:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
federal perspective to these people who
 
01:51:50.229 --> 01:51:50.239 align:start position:0%
may very well qualify for
 
01:51:53.890 --> 01:51:53.900 align:start position:0%
exchange coverage let me stop there
 
01:51:56.689 --> 01:51:56.699 align:start position:0%
on on granted advantage and an online
 
01:51:56.699 --> 01:51:58.609 align:start position:0%

promotion
 
01:52:00.770 --> 01:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
I just want to say to the committee that
 
01:52:03.770 --> 01:52:03.780 align:start position:0%
associate Commissioner of DHHS Marissa

fellowships fellows in public health and
 
01:52:10.010 --> 01:52:10.020 align:start position:0%
we were in Seattle and I happen to
 
01:52:11.990 --> 01:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
mention your name and a lot of people
 
01:52:14.090 --> 01:52:14.100 align:start position:0%
around the country who really see what
 
01:52:16.970 --> 01:52:16.980 align:start position:0%
you do here as the gold standard so now
 
01:52:19.189 --> 01:52:19.199 align:start position:0%
that I've totally embarrassed you
 
01:52:19.199 --> 01:52:20.330 align:start position:0%
that I've totally embarrassed you
um

01:52:20.330 --> 01:52:20.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:23.149 --> 01:52:23.159 align:start position:0%
it's true I appreciate that
 
01:52:25.430 --> 01:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
um you and I had had a conversation I
 
01:52:27.649 --> 01:52:27.659 align:start position:0%
was in Family Court as an observer last
 
01:52:30.109 --> 01:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
week and discovered that it's great that
 
01:52:31.910 --> 01:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
we're adding seven judges and support
 
01:52:34.129 --> 01:52:34.139 align:start position:0%
staff to the Circuit Court we can't fill
 
01:52:36.410 --> 01:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
the position the positions of support
 
01:52:38.689 --> 01:52:38.699 align:start position:0%
staff that we have now which led to a
 
01:52:40.430 --> 01:52:40.440 align:start position:0%
conversation between you and me and
 
01:52:43.250 --> 01:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
wondering uh what connectivity is there
 
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
between you and say Rich labors in order
 
01:52:49.910 --> 01:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
to say some of these people are rotating
 
01:52:53.450 --> 01:52:53.460 align:start position:0%
off or they have been Unwound and yet
 
01:52:56.209 --> 01:52:56.219 align:start position:0%
there are jobs needing to be filled so
 
01:52:57.770 --> 01:52:57.780 align:start position:0%
that there can be some kind of more
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
intentional funneling could you speak to
 
01:53:01.990 --> 01:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
that yes and
 
01:53:04.189 --> 01:53:04.199 align:start position:0%
Associate commissioner santanella who's
 
01:53:06.770 --> 01:53:06.780 align:start position:0%
worked a lot with Rich labors as well
 
01:53:08.270 --> 01:53:08.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner associate commissioner
 
01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:09.470 align:start position:0%
commissioner associate commissioner
science

01:53:09.470 --> 01:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
science
 
01:53:11.390 --> 01:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
um you know I do think that we have
 
01:53:13.310 --> 01:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
worked in the past and and we continue
 
01:53:15.290 --> 01:53:15.300 align:start position:0%
to work with them in terms of the
 
01:53:17.350 --> 01:53:17.360 align:start position:0%
special counseling that's available
 
01:53:19.550 --> 01:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
sure good afternoon
 
01:53:21.530 --> 01:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
um good morning Antonello associate
 
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner we do a lot of work with
 
01:53:25.370 --> 01:53:25.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire employment security
 
01:53:27.970 --> 01:53:27.980 align:start position:0%
um their job now work now program
 
01:53:30.590 --> 01:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
provides free job training to anybody
 
01:53:33.890 --> 01:53:33.900 align:start position:0%
who receives Medicaid snap or TANF we
 
01:53:37.490 --> 01:53:37.500 align:start position:0%
actually as a result of our
 
01:53:39.590 --> 01:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
um we had a
 
01:53:41.810 --> 01:53:41.820 align:start position:0%
pipe burst in our Claremont district
 
01:53:45.290 --> 01:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
office and so we actually relocated our
 
01:53:47.689 --> 01:53:47.699 align:start position:0%
front office in the Claremont area to
 
01:53:49.970 --> 01:53:49.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire employment security and
 
01:53:52.430 --> 01:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
now their Claremont office because of
 
01:53:55.189 --> 01:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
the joint referrals we're able to do is
 
01:53:58.330 --> 01:53:58.340 align:start position:0%
their highest performing
 
01:54:00.649 --> 01:54:00.659 align:start position:0%
office for New Hampshire employment
 
01:54:02.570 --> 01:54:02.580 align:start position:0%
security and it beats like you know
 
01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
Nashua which Claremont never has
 
01:54:07.070 --> 01:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
um and so what we've been able to find
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
is it's a lot of the same clientele and
 
01:54:11.450 --> 01:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
so when somebody's coming in and either
 
01:54:13.609 --> 01:54:13.619 align:start position:0%
they're losing their Medicaid or they're
 
01:54:14.990 --> 01:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
losing their unemployment insurance
 
01:54:18.350 --> 01:54:18.360 align:start position:0%
we're able to in real time connect with
 
01:54:21.169 --> 01:54:21.179 align:start position:0%
one another so we do a lot of programs
 
01:54:23.090 --> 01:54:23.100 align:start position:0%
in that way and we also work really
 
01:54:25.790 --> 01:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
closely when we did our Cliff effect
 
01:54:29.570 --> 01:54:29.580 align:start position:0%
study and benefits so rich and I were
 
01:54:32.570 --> 01:54:32.580 align:start position:0%
actually just emailing um earlier this
 
01:54:35.090 --> 01:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
week about okay how do we help people
 
01:54:38.090 --> 01:54:38.100 align:start position:0%
either in work now or in our snap and
 
01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
TANF programs to really look at longer
 
01:54:44.209 --> 01:54:44.219 align:start position:0%
range on employment opportunities and
 
01:54:46.010 --> 01:54:46.020 align:start position:0%
we're talking about doing some video so
 
01:54:48.410 --> 01:54:48.420 align:start position:0%
we work really collaboratively great and
 
01:54:50.510 --> 01:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:51.709 align:start position:0%
thank you
something

01:54:51.709 --> 01:54:51.719 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:54:54.770 --> 01:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:58.129 --> 01:54:58.139 align:start position:0%
um I do think that we have a question
 
01:55:01.250 --> 01:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
representative Weber thank you
 
01:55:02.870 --> 01:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:55:06.010 --> 01:55:06.020 align:start position:0%
um I've had a couple of questions from
 
01:55:09.229 --> 01:55:09.239 align:start position:0%
uh generally speaking from somebody
 
01:55:13.430 --> 01:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
calling on behalf of a relative of
 
01:55:18.050 --> 01:55:18.060 align:start position:0%
um a Medicaid recipient who by reason of
 
01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
either age or infirmity or probably both
 
01:55:22.250 --> 01:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
has not
 
01:55:22.260 --> 01:55:22.990 align:start position:0%
has not
um

01:55:22.990 --> 01:55:23.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:27.109 --> 01:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh done the appropriate paperwork and
 
01:55:30.109 --> 01:55:30.119 align:start position:0%
then you have a relative who has no clue
 
01:55:32.930 --> 01:55:32.940 align:start position:0%
what to do now and I was wondering if
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
you could give us a brief
 
01:55:41.209 --> 01:55:41.219 align:start position:0%
uh suggestion because uh the people that
 
01:55:43.669 --> 01:55:43.679 align:start position:0%
I've talked to when I say try the the
 
01:55:46.570 --> 01:55:46.580 align:start position:0%
local DHHS office
 
01:55:50.149 --> 01:55:50.159 align:start position:0%
have found that to be not very helpful
 
01:55:52.910 --> 01:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
and one of the questions is how do we
 
01:55:56.209 --> 01:55:56.219 align:start position:0%
deal about with these people who are
 
01:55:59.149 --> 01:55:59.159 align:start position:0%
um eligible now and very very unlikely
 
01:56:02.810 --> 01:56:02.820 align:start position:0%
ever to be ineligible again is what what
 
01:56:05.390 --> 01:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
they were really asking about
 
01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
um so I think there's a couple of
 
01:56:10.129 --> 01:56:10.139 align:start position:0%
strategies I think sometimes depending
 
01:56:13.910 --> 01:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
on what the ask is or the requests the
 
01:56:16.609 --> 01:56:16.619 align:start position:0%
local district office can handle it or
 
01:56:19.129 --> 01:56:19.139 align:start position:0%
um either in person or on our call we
 
01:56:21.169 --> 01:56:21.179 align:start position:0%
also work closely with our service link
 
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
and provider agencies another piece that
 
01:56:26.629 --> 01:56:26.639 align:start position:0%
we are working on is we have really good
 
01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
resource materials but they're just not
 
01:56:32.810 --> 01:56:32.820 align:start position:0%
in a prominent space on our website and
 
01:56:34.609 --> 01:56:34.619 align:start position:0%
we're working to move some of those to
 
01:56:36.709 --> 01:56:36.719 align:start position:0%
have them higher which really talks
 
01:56:38.990 --> 01:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
through all of the pieces another piece
 
01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
that we're doing
 
01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
um along you know Henry and I and our
 
01:56:46.850 --> 01:56:46.860 align:start position:0%
teams meet weekly daily all the time to
 
01:56:48.350 --> 01:56:48.360 align:start position:0%
figure out is really working with some
 
01:56:50.930 --> 01:56:50.940 align:start position:0%
of the partners that that support so if
 
01:56:53.330 --> 01:56:53.340 align:start position:0%
that person is getting Services
 
01:56:55.430 --> 01:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
um either through a nursing facility a
 
01:56:57.709 --> 01:56:57.719 align:start position:0%
provider agency a case manager is
 
01:56:59.450 --> 01:56:59.460 align:start position:0%
working with a lot of them to provide
 
01:57:01.550 --> 01:57:01.560 align:start position:0%
the information
 
01:57:05.330 --> 01:57:05.340 align:start position:0%
I I guess in the end if you have a
 
01:57:07.970 --> 01:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
constituent that has an issue call me
 
01:57:09.950 --> 01:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
and I'll try to get the right resource
 
01:57:11.810 --> 01:57:11.820 align:start position:0%
on the problem and
 
01:57:13.790 --> 01:57:13.800 align:start position:0%
um you know we fortunately have not had
 
01:57:16.070 --> 01:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
been overrun with that I do get some
 
01:57:17.810 --> 01:57:17.820 align:start position:0%
wires like that and sometimes you really
 
01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
need to get some our best experts on it
 
01:57:22.129 --> 01:57:22.139 align:start position:0%
because of a difficult situation and I I
 
01:57:25.609 --> 01:57:25.619 align:start position:0%
very much appreciate that I just uh I I
 
01:57:30.770 --> 01:57:30.780 align:start position:0%
guess I'm renewing my concern about uh
 
01:57:33.470 --> 01:57:33.480 align:start position:0%
the access to information thing and I
 
01:57:35.390 --> 01:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
you know I keep hearing oh now we're
 
01:57:37.609 --> 01:57:37.619 align:start position:0%
going to do no wrong doors and and I
 
01:57:41.390 --> 01:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
keep wanting to say I want fewer doors I
 
01:57:43.430 --> 01:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
just want the right door and I want it
 
01:57:46.490 --> 01:57:46.500 align:start position:0%
to be uh really really really available
 
01:57:49.270 --> 01:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
to people I understand that there are
 
01:57:51.589 --> 01:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
resource issues with service link and
 
01:57:54.589 --> 01:57:54.599 align:start position:0%
and other things but and I very much
 
01:57:58.070 --> 01:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate the networking and partnering
 
01:58:01.250 --> 01:58:01.260 align:start position:0%
and uh trying to get all kinds of
 
01:58:02.689 --> 01:58:02.699 align:start position:0%
different ways is for people to get the
 
01:58:05.390 --> 01:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
information but I just want to say it's
 
01:58:08.770 --> 01:58:08.780 align:start position:0%
still pretty frustrating out there
 
01:58:11.870 --> 01:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
particularly for families who are
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
suddenly thrust into a system that they
 
01:58:14.830 --> 01:58:14.840 align:start position:0%
don't understand
 
01:58:18.050 --> 01:58:18.060 align:start position:0%
so I just want to it's nothing you don't
 
01:58:19.609 --> 01:58:19.619 align:start position:0%
already know and aren't already working
 
01:58:21.950 --> 01:58:21.960 align:start position:0%
on and just keeping it in the Forefront
 
01:58:24.290 --> 01:58:24.300 align:start position:0%
there we are learning things from the
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
early part of the process that we're
 
01:58:29.810 --> 01:58:29.820 align:start position:0%
making adjustments that will won't cure
 
01:58:34.750 --> 01:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:37.490 --> 01:58:37.500 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards thank you Mr
 
01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
chair I I have uh two strategic things I
 
01:58:43.070 --> 01:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
worry about on Medicaid and I'll just
 
01:58:44.689 --> 01:58:44.699 align:start position:0%
tell you both of them and let you
 
01:58:48.470 --> 01:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
respond uh the the first is I'm
 
01:58:51.410 --> 01:58:51.420 align:start position:0%
concerned with the unwind that we're
 
01:58:53.689 --> 01:58:53.699 align:start position:0%
going to be reducing the number of
 
01:58:57.770 --> 01:58:57.780 align:start position:0%
carried lives to the point where we may
 
01:59:00.410 --> 01:59:00.420 align:start position:0%
no longer have a market sufficiently
 
01:59:03.290 --> 01:59:03.300 align:start position:0%
large to have at least three mcos
 
01:59:06.709 --> 01:59:06.719 align:start position:0%
competing I I would hate to see us in a
 
01:59:09.589 --> 01:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
situation where we only have two mcos or
 
01:59:12.970 --> 01:59:12.980 align:start position:0%
one MCL I think you would too
 
01:59:16.250 --> 01:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
should I should I keep worrying that we
 
01:59:19.550 --> 01:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
may end up with fewer than three mcos or
 
01:59:21.589 --> 01:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
do you you think we're going to be okay
 
01:59:26.629 --> 01:59:26.639 align:start position:0%
the the second strategy thing is uh do
 
01:59:29.270 --> 01:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
you do you see any roadblocks
 
01:59:32.870 --> 01:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
or barriers that are going to get in the
 
01:59:34.790 --> 01:59:34.800 align:start position:0%
way of getting the Medicaid
 
01:59:38.470 --> 01:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates input to to to
 
01:59:41.870 --> 01:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
do go ahead and do the increases
 
01:59:44.089 --> 01:59:44.099 align:start position:0%
so the on the first question we're
 
01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
forecasting to be around the end of the
 
01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:47.930 align:start position:0%
forecasting to be around the end of the
year

01:59:47.930 --> 01:59:47.940 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:59:49.850 --> 01:59:49.860 align:start position:0%
um this calendar year to be about where
 
01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
we were pre-pandemic
 
01:59:55.070 --> 01:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
um we in terms of enrollment
 
01:59:58.070 --> 01:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
um you know with the economy stronger
 
01:59:59.330 --> 01:59:59.340 align:start position:0%
um in the sense of at least the
 
02:00:01.370 --> 02:00:01.380 align:start position:0%
unemployment number
 
02:00:04.550 --> 02:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
um that that also has an impact on on it
 
02:00:06.050 --> 02:00:06.060 align:start position:0%
so I think you know if there's a certain
 
02:00:08.209 --> 02:00:08.219 align:start position:0%
economic impact standpoint but I think
 
02:00:10.609 --> 02:00:10.619 align:start position:0%
we're we'll be pretty close when we go
 
02:00:12.350 --> 02:00:12.360 align:start position:0%
up for procurement
 
02:00:14.510 --> 02:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
um to be about where we were when we
 
02:00:19.310 --> 02:00:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:21.530 --> 02:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
um you're as I mentioned too we're
 
02:00:24.109 --> 02:00:24.119 align:start position:0%
expecting to see the way we structure or
 
02:00:24.119 --> 02:00:25.430 align:start position:0%
expecting to see the way we structure or
unwind

02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
unwind
 
02:00:28.609 --> 02:00:28.619 align:start position:0%
the the larger number of uh people not
 
02:00:30.470 --> 02:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
continue to be covered to happen earlier
 
02:00:33.410 --> 02:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
because we had information or
 
02:00:36.290 --> 02:00:36.300 align:start position:0%
um likely that they were not eligible
 
02:00:38.570 --> 02:00:38.580 align:start position:0%
um but I do think that we'll settle up
 
02:00:40.729 --> 02:00:40.739 align:start position:0%
settle out somewhere where we somewhere
 
02:00:42.830 --> 02:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
near where we began
 
02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:43.669 align:start position:0%
near where we began
um

02:00:43.669 --> 02:00:43.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:46.669 --> 02:00:46.679 align:start position:0%
in terms of the the Medicaid rates we've
 
02:00:49.490 --> 02:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
been working on getting ready for that
 
02:00:51.649 --> 02:00:51.659 align:start position:0%
there's really three components to that
 
02:00:53.930 --> 02:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
there's the across the board component
 
02:00:56.330 --> 02:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
one of the first tasks that we have to
 
02:00:58.490 --> 02:00:58.500 align:start position:0%
do in order to
 
02:01:01.010 --> 02:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
um is to try to preserve the July first
 
02:01:03.050 --> 02:01:03.060 align:start position:0%
date for that across the board to happen
 
02:01:05.629 --> 02:01:05.639 align:start position:0%
where we're well on our way to to having
 
02:01:07.550 --> 02:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
that done we need to do that before the
 
02:01:10.070 --> 02:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
end of the month that involved quite a
 
02:01:11.390 --> 02:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
bit of work because we have to give the
 
02:01:13.310 --> 02:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
federal government an estimate of what
 
02:01:15.290 --> 02:01:15.300 align:start position:0%
that's going to be and so we have to run
 
02:01:19.070 --> 02:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
all sorts of analytics to you know run
 
02:01:21.109 --> 02:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
that calculation and and we're in good
 
02:01:23.750 --> 02:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
shape to be able to get that done the
 
02:01:28.070 --> 02:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
second phase is looking at that 15.7
 
02:01:29.990 --> 02:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
million which was at the commission's
 
02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:31.370 align:start position:0%
million which was at the commission's
discretion

02:01:31.370 --> 02:01:31.380 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
02:01:33.350 --> 02:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
um we're we're having conversations on
 
02:01:33.360 --> 02:01:34.310 align:start position:0%
um we're we're having conversations on
that

02:01:34.310 --> 02:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:01:36.830 --> 02:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
um and then the last piece is the the
 
02:01:38.629 --> 02:01:38.639 align:start position:0%
larger component
 
02:01:41.629 --> 02:01:41.639 align:start position:0%
um and so we're expecting to meet all
 
02:01:44.870 --> 02:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
the deadlines that are in the legis and
 
02:01:46.609 --> 02:01:46.619 align:start position:0%
hopefully do a little bit better than
 
02:01:49.490 --> 02:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
that but there is
 
02:01:51.470 --> 02:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
um you know there'll be some challenging
 
02:01:53.930 --> 02:01:53.940 align:start position:0%
areas where we for example have to
 
02:01:56.270 --> 02:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
change a a methodology in order to
 
02:01:58.510 --> 02:01:58.520 align:start position:0%
utilize the funds that were appropriated
 
02:02:01.070 --> 02:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
but I feel like we're we're going to get
 
02:02:02.810 --> 02:02:02.820 align:start position:0%
there um it's just it's going to be a
 
02:02:04.850 --> 02:02:04.860 align:start position:0%
lot of work but people understand the
 
02:02:07.310 --> 02:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
importance of what needs to be done here
 
02:02:09.709 --> 02:02:09.719 align:start position:0%
my question about blackout period can
 
02:02:11.149 --> 02:02:11.159 align:start position:0%
you explain a little bit about that
 
02:02:11.159 --> 02:02:11.990 align:start position:0%
you explain a little bit about that
please

02:02:11.990 --> 02:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
please
 
02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:18.669 align:start position:0%
please
um

02:02:18.669 --> 02:02:18.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:21.830 --> 02:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
generally I think when we're doing
 
02:02:25.609 --> 02:02:25.619 align:start position:0%
um end-of-year close like this for the I
 
02:02:28.010 --> 02:02:28.020 align:start position:0%
think as of March I mean excuse me June
 
02:02:31.669 --> 02:02:31.679 align:start position:0%
23rd that uh we had to stop running
 
02:02:33.290 --> 02:02:33.300 align:start position:0%
certain transactions through this
 
02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
through the state system to bring
 
02:02:37.490 --> 02:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
closing I think the blackout period is
 
02:02:39.830 --> 02:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
probably connected to that that year-end
 
02:02:41.390 --> 02:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
closed component
 
02:02:44.030 --> 02:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
um and that I'll let you work yeah it's
 
02:02:46.129 --> 02:02:46.139 align:start position:0%
also um related to the conversion
 
02:02:48.109 --> 02:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
process that we have to do as we're
 
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
switching over to direct bill with our
 
02:02:51.890 --> 02:02:51.900 align:start position:0%
provider so
 
02:02:55.250 --> 02:02:55.260 align:start position:0%
um so we're hoping that it turns on by
 
02:02:59.450 --> 02:02:59.460 align:start position:0%
July 10th most providers bill monthly so
 
02:03:02.450 --> 02:03:02.460 align:start position:0%
we're not expecting a large cash flow
 
02:03:04.370 --> 02:03:04.380 align:start position:0%
concern but if there are we're able to
 
02:03:08.510 --> 02:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:11.450 --> 02:03:11.460 align:start position:0%
Senator rosenbault thank you
 
02:03:16.970 --> 02:03:16.980 align:start position:0%
this eye test I love it but I think what
 
02:03:20.390 --> 02:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing is that the
 
02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
biggest reason people are disenrolled is
 
02:03:27.890 --> 02:03:27.900 align:start position:0%
a failure to ready
 
02:03:30.530 --> 02:03:30.540 align:start position:0%
what is the department
 
02:03:33.109 --> 02:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
thinking about this are these people who
 
02:03:34.490 --> 02:03:34.500 align:start position:0%
you just can't
 
02:03:37.810 --> 02:03:37.820 align:start position:0%
find they've moved or
 
02:03:41.330 --> 02:03:41.340 align:start position:0%
their phone isn't working anymore they
 
02:03:44.089 --> 02:03:44.099 align:start position:0%
change their email how is the department
 
02:03:47.570 --> 02:03:47.580 align:start position:0%
reaching out to these people who just
 
02:03:51.350 --> 02:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
have failed to do the redeem but may
 
02:03:54.830 --> 02:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise really be eligible so again I
 
02:03:57.709 --> 02:03:57.719 align:start position:0%
guess in the early stages here I think
 
02:03:59.330 --> 02:03:59.340 align:start position:0%
the information is different if you look
 
02:04:01.850 --> 02:04:01.860 align:start position:0%
over time like for example in the first
 
02:04:05.390 --> 02:04:05.400 align:start position:0%
month in the the bottom half of the eye
 
02:04:07.250 --> 02:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
test there in the bottom chart if you
 
02:04:09.229 --> 02:04:09.239 align:start position:0%
look in the month of March of the people
 
02:04:12.169 --> 02:04:12.179 align:start position:0%
who are in the protected class 70 and
 
02:04:13.669 --> 02:04:13.679 align:start position:0%
that was the people that hundred and
 
02:04:16.370 --> 02:04:16.380 align:start position:0%
four thousand roughly population that we
 
02:04:17.930 --> 02:04:17.940 align:start position:0%
have been working with for a lot of
 
02:04:21.229 --> 02:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
times that 78.6 percent of the people
 
02:04:24.410 --> 02:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
did not do a redetermination when you
 
02:04:27.609 --> 02:04:27.619 align:start position:0%
jump out to to May that's down to 30
 
02:04:30.950 --> 02:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
30.5 still a high percentage but it's
 
02:04:33.410 --> 02:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
you can see that part of what's going on
 
02:04:35.510 --> 02:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
there it depends on if you don't think
 
02:04:37.310 --> 02:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
you're eligible you might not do that
 
02:04:40.189 --> 02:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
but we're doing a lot to do Outreach
 
02:04:44.870 --> 02:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
um and uh it would I can I have a whole
 
02:04:48.290 --> 02:04:48.300 align:start position:0%
plan I can lay out to yeah yeah
 
02:04:48.300 --> 02:04:51.229 align:start position:0%
plan I can lay out to yeah yeah
yes

02:04:51.229 --> 02:04:51.239 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:04:53.589 --> 02:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
slide deck which is
 
02:04:56.810 --> 02:04:56.820 align:start position:0%
incomprehensible to me but
 
02:04:58.850 --> 02:04:58.860 align:start position:0%
um if I could just follow up if I'm
 
02:05:01.310 --> 02:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
looking at the bottom half of that chart
 
02:05:06.290 --> 02:05:06.300 align:start position:0%
though the biggest reason is failure
 
02:05:09.050 --> 02:05:09.060 align:start position:0%
to to read the not
 
02:05:12.950 --> 02:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
not income so it depends you saw three
 
02:05:15.050 --> 02:05:15.060 align:start position:0%
months yeah if you look depends on the
 
02:05:18.169 --> 02:05:18.179 align:start position:0%
group though is the the group that is
 
02:05:20.450 --> 02:05:20.460 align:start position:0%
um if you look at the grand total though
 
02:05:22.729 --> 02:05:22.739 align:start position:0%
for the first three months for people
 
02:05:24.410 --> 02:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
who are in the protected group income
 
02:05:26.750 --> 02:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
was the number one reason
 
02:05:29.089 --> 02:05:29.099 align:start position:0%
um failure to reading was for the people
 
02:05:31.850 --> 02:05:31.860 align:start position:0%
who were not protected was the number
 
02:05:35.629 --> 02:05:35.639 align:start position:0%
one reason that was a a smaller smaller
 
02:05:37.430 --> 02:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
group to begin with but that will get
 
02:05:40.070 --> 02:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
group will get bigger over time we are
 
02:05:40.080 --> 02:05:41.030 align:start position:0%
group will get bigger over time we are
doing

02:05:41.030 --> 02:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
doing
 
02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:41.770 align:start position:0%
doing
um

02:05:41.770 --> 02:05:41.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:44.510 --> 02:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of Outreach we just put
 
02:05:44.520 --> 02:05:47.030 align:start position:0%
a lot of Outreach we just put
implemented

02:05:47.030 --> 02:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
implemented
 
02:05:48.890 --> 02:05:48.900 align:start position:0%
um several things are implementing
 
02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
several things in the month of June
 
02:05:52.070 --> 02:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
based on what we've seen so far to get
 
02:05:54.530 --> 02:05:54.540 align:start position:0%
after that one of the concerns we had
 
02:05:57.050 --> 02:05:57.060 align:start position:0%
around children was this something that
 
02:05:59.629 --> 02:05:59.639 align:start position:0%
was reported nationally that because a a
 
02:06:02.390 --> 02:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
child because a parent lost their
 
02:06:04.070 --> 02:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
Medicaid coverage who had a different
 
02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
income standard that the assumption is
 
02:06:07.850 --> 02:06:07.860 align:start position:0%
that the children aren't eligible so
 
02:06:10.010 --> 02:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
doing Special Outreach on that including
 
02:06:12.709 --> 02:06:12.719 align:start position:0%
direct phone calls to to those families
 
02:06:15.010 --> 02:06:15.020 align:start position:0%
and particularly
 
02:06:18.169 --> 02:06:18.179 align:start position:0%
we've analyzed information to
 
02:06:21.350 --> 02:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
particularly to focus on those that have
 
02:06:21.360 --> 02:06:22.010 align:start position:0%
particularly to focus on those that have
um

02:06:22.010 --> 02:06:22.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:23.510 --> 02:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
shown that they've had medical
 
02:06:26.030 --> 02:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
expenditures when we we looked at a
 
02:06:27.830 --> 02:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
group of six thousand people for the
 
02:06:30.050 --> 02:06:30.060 align:start position:0%
month of May and a little over six
 
02:06:32.629 --> 02:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
thousand of that six thousand seventy
 
02:06:34.129 --> 02:06:34.139 align:start position:0%
five percent of the people in that group
 
02:06:37.010 --> 02:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
had zero zero claims in the recent uh
 
02:06:43.609 --> 02:06:43.619 align:start position:0%
period and 90 uh 95 percent had
 
02:06:43.619 --> 02:06:44.209 align:start position:0%
period and 90 uh 95 percent had
um

02:06:44.209 --> 02:06:44.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:46.729 --> 02:06:46.739 align:start position:0%
you know low dollar amount of claims
 
02:06:49.790 --> 02:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
that we sugared off out of the six
 
02:06:54.229 --> 02:06:54.239 align:start position:0%
thousand or so people to 333 people that
 
02:06:55.970 --> 02:06:55.980 align:start position:0%
we knew where they were they were
 
02:06:58.189 --> 02:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
consuming health care and that that we
 
02:07:00.169 --> 02:07:00.179 align:start position:0%
needed you were having clinical uh
 
02:07:02.330 --> 02:07:02.340 align:start position:0%
clinical team reach out to them and and
 
02:07:04.490 --> 02:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
you know one of the things that the
 
02:07:06.609 --> 02:07:06.619 align:start position:0%
national story with Kaiser Foundation
 
02:07:09.530 --> 02:07:09.540 align:start position:0%
reported on is people don't understand
 
02:07:12.050 --> 02:07:12.060 align:start position:0%
what's going on but what we found in the
 
02:07:13.669 --> 02:07:13.679 align:start position:0%
the people that have been consuming
 
02:07:15.830 --> 02:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
health care that they are much more
 
02:07:17.450 --> 02:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
aware of what's going on because I think
 
02:07:19.850 --> 02:07:19.860 align:start position:0%
they're paying attention that being said
 
02:07:22.430 --> 02:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
we're also launching um you know we've
 
02:07:24.050 --> 02:07:24.060 align:start position:0%
done the the pink letter the yellow
 
02:07:26.649 --> 02:07:26.659 align:start position:0%
letter we've started a blue letter
 
02:07:29.629 --> 02:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
Campaign which is if it's blue it's not
 
02:07:31.310 --> 02:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
too late to renew
 
02:07:32.810 --> 02:07:32.820 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
02:07:35.330 --> 02:07:35.340 align:start position:0%
um for those people that
 
02:07:37.910 --> 02:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
um have closed but still within their
 
02:07:39.589 --> 02:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come back on without
 
02:07:41.209 --> 02:07:41.219 align:start position:0%
filing a new application they're going
 
02:07:44.030 --> 02:07:44.040 align:start position:0%
to get a special blue letter and we're
 
02:07:45.890 --> 02:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
also going to be using
 
02:07:50.689 --> 02:07:50.699 align:start position:0%
um texts and uh to reach to these people
 
02:07:53.510 --> 02:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
with nudges uh several times a week for
 
02:07:55.790 --> 02:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
a period of time and then also we're
 
02:08:00.410 --> 02:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
adopting something that New Jersey uh
 
02:08:03.649 --> 02:08:03.659 align:start position:0%
um is doing that the head of CMS
 
02:08:05.810 --> 02:08:05.820 align:start position:0%
suggested that we might look at and
 
02:08:09.050 --> 02:08:09.060 align:start position:0%
we're going to adopt which is a a red
 
02:08:11.990 --> 02:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
and green postcard campaign and the the
 
02:08:14.990 --> 02:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
the green is sort of like just before
 
02:08:17.089 --> 02:08:17.099 align:start position:0%
they're about to close that they get a
 
02:08:18.890 --> 02:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
card a postcard which is different than
 
02:08:20.270 --> 02:08:20.280 align:start position:0%
we usually sent this is going to come
 
02:08:22.370 --> 02:08:22.380 align:start position:0%
through the mcos as well
 
02:08:25.189 --> 02:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
um and red if they've gone beyond in our
 
02:08:27.470 --> 02:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
clothes to to encourage them to take an
 
02:08:27.480 --> 02:08:28.850 align:start position:0%
clothes to to encourage them to take an
action

02:08:28.850 --> 02:08:28.860 align:start position:0%
action
 
02:08:31.550 --> 02:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
um you know the we held not nine
 
02:08:34.310 --> 02:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
meetings last week with the mcos and um
 
02:08:37.129 --> 02:08:37.139 align:start position:0%
and invited providers to come in to see
 
02:08:38.990 --> 02:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
how they could work together differently
 
02:08:40.910 --> 02:08:40.920 align:start position:0%
I think our mcos are doing a lot of
 
02:08:44.810 --> 02:08:44.820 align:start position:0%
creative things one MCO has created a
 
02:08:46.729 --> 02:08:46.739 align:start position:0%
database where providers can go in
 
02:08:48.830 --> 02:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
looking by their tax ID number to find
 
02:08:51.709 --> 02:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
out who's due for redetermination and
 
02:08:55.070 --> 02:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
easy look up another MCO is providing
 
02:09:01.970 --> 02:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:04.430 --> 02:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
deposit onto their sort of incentive
 
02:09:06.290 --> 02:09:06.300 align:start position:0%
programs if they do their
 
02:09:10.310 --> 02:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
redetermination I know that another MCO
 
02:09:14.629 --> 02:09:14.639 align:start position:0%
is you know hired uh about fit to to
 
02:09:16.729 --> 02:09:16.739 align:start position:0%
make calls so
 
02:09:19.490 --> 02:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
um I think that you know the mcls have a
 
02:09:22.430 --> 02:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
strong incentive to not lose enrollment
 
02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:23.089 align:start position:0%
strong incentive to not lose enrollment
um

02:09:23.089 --> 02:09:23.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:25.129 --> 02:09:25.139 align:start position:0%
you know the department is doing things
 
02:09:28.310 --> 02:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
we're also using the we even went um
 
02:09:30.890 --> 02:09:30.900 align:start position:0%
this past Friday we last Friday we went
 
02:09:33.169 --> 02:09:33.179 align:start position:0%
to out to the superintendents at the
 
02:09:33.179 --> 02:09:34.129 align:start position:0%
to out to the superintendents at the
prisons

02:09:34.129 --> 02:09:34.139 align:start position:0%
prisons
 
02:09:37.189 --> 02:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
um the county prisons that had
 
02:09:38.750 --> 02:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
um you know they have people being
 
02:09:40.850 --> 02:09:40.860 align:start position:0%
discharged who might come back on to
 
02:09:43.790 --> 02:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
Medicaid to talk to them about what's
 
02:09:46.010 --> 02:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
going on and they suggested coming up
 
02:09:48.649 --> 02:09:48.659 align:start position:0%
with a one-page one pager that they
 
02:09:50.390 --> 02:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
could hand out upon discharge from the
 
02:09:53.330 --> 02:09:53.340 align:start position:0%
prison that they could hand to people so
 
02:09:55.330 --> 02:09:55.340 align:start position:0%
we're working on doing that
 
02:09:57.229 --> 02:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
02:09:59.149 --> 02:09:59.159 align:start position:0%
you know I think
 
02:10:00.950 --> 02:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate the the national
 
02:10:03.649 --> 02:10:03.659 align:start position:0%
Expressions that I think we have an
 
02:10:06.649 --> 02:10:06.659 align:start position:0%
enormous Outreach effort going on that
 
02:10:08.390 --> 02:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
um in the end I think a lot of it is
 
02:10:11.510 --> 02:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
being able to react to someone in front
 
02:10:12.830 --> 02:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
of you or someone
 
02:10:14.750 --> 02:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
um we're even still doing
 
02:10:16.310 --> 02:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
um I think last week we did two
 
02:10:19.609 --> 02:10:19.619 align:start position:0%
in-person events with the mcos with the
 
02:10:21.290 --> 02:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
department and The Navigators come
 
02:10:22.729 --> 02:10:22.739 align:start position:0%
together and try to help people in
 
02:10:22.739 --> 02:10:24.229 align:start position:0%
together and try to help people in
person

02:10:24.229 --> 02:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:10:24.239 --> 02:10:25.750 align:start position:0%
person
um

02:10:25.750 --> 02:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:29.089 --> 02:10:29.099 align:start position:0%
representative Weber I just wanted to be
 
02:10:31.070 --> 02:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
sure that the one pager for the prisons
 
02:10:33.109 --> 02:10:33.119 align:start position:0%
is that being distributed to the county
 
02:10:35.570 --> 02:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
jails as well that that specifically was
 
02:10:37.729 --> 02:10:37.739 align:start position:0%
targeted for for the superintendents of
 
02:10:39.169 --> 02:10:39.179 align:start position:0%
the county jails is who we met with
 
02:10:41.450 --> 02:10:41.460 align:start position:0%
thank you well thank you for your update
 
02:10:43.250 --> 02:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
and we'll see you in September sure I
 
02:10:44.750 --> 02:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
have some dental information I don't
 
02:10:46.550 --> 02:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
know if we've passed it out that I know
 
02:10:48.410 --> 02:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
you don't have time for me but
 
02:10:50.089 --> 02:10:50.099 align:start position:0%
um an update how could I have forgotten
 
02:10:52.010 --> 02:10:52.020 align:start position:0%
Dental information
 
02:10:54.589 --> 02:10:54.599 align:start position:0%
um do you have some slides for us we do
 
02:10:56.689 --> 02:10:56.699 align:start position:0%
um we can for in the interest of time
 
02:10:59.149 --> 02:10:59.159 align:start position:0%
yep it's an update on the network
 
02:11:01.850 --> 02:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
um both the dashboard and a list of of
 
02:11:05.629 --> 02:11:05.639 align:start position:0%
the participating dentists we had three
 
02:11:08.570 --> 02:11:08.580 align:start position:0%
um in June we're having three van visits
 
02:11:11.689 --> 02:11:11.699 align:start position:0%
in the North Country one um in Berlin
 
02:11:14.149 --> 02:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
that happened last week and we got one
 
02:11:16.430 --> 02:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
up in uh Colebrook I think two up in
 
02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
Colebrook uh day is coming trying to
 
02:11:20.709 --> 02:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
fill in there we've had over 3 000
 
02:11:22.669 --> 02:11:22.679 align:start position:0%
appointments filled and I think that's a
 
02:11:24.410 --> 02:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
statistic we're going to add to the to
 
02:11:26.990 --> 02:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
the dash dashboard it's still you know
 
02:11:29.209 --> 02:11:29.219 align:start position:0%
and I think uh Sarah Sarah it's Dr
 
02:11:30.770 --> 02:11:30.780 align:start position:0%
Finney was saying that we're seeing an
 
02:11:32.629 --> 02:11:32.639 align:start position:0%
increasing number
 
02:11:35.149 --> 02:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
um of visits month to month still not
 
02:11:38.510 --> 02:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
where we want it to be but um it's we're
 
02:11:41.229 --> 02:11:41.239 align:start position:0%
working on thank you so much
 
02:11:44.629 --> 02:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
and uh now the chair recognizes Michael
 
02:11:48.109 --> 02:11:48.119 align:start position:0%
Holt for therapeutic cannabis items and
 
02:11:49.370 --> 02:11:49.380 align:start position:0%
would you believe somebody in the
 
02:11:52.010 --> 02:11:52.020 align:start position:0%
audience texted me how appropriate it
 
02:11:53.990 --> 02:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
being high noon
 
02:11:54.000 --> 02:12:07.930 align:start position:0%
being high noon
foreign

02:12:07.930 --> 02:12:07.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:09.890 --> 02:12:09.900 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:12:12.290 --> 02:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
um I know the hour is late I'm
 
02:12:14.629 --> 02:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to defer to a meeting if you
 
02:12:16.450 --> 02:12:16.460 align:start position:0%
can you give us like a seven minute
 
02:12:18.649 --> 02:12:18.659 align:start position:0%
bird's eye view
 
02:12:24.470 --> 02:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:26.089 --> 02:12:26.099 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:12:27.770 --> 02:12:27.780 align:start position:0%
so there's two reports that I'm here to
 
02:12:30.350 --> 02:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
present um the first is on the is the
 
02:12:32.810 --> 02:12:32.820 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program annual data
 
02:12:36.830 --> 02:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
report it's offer 20 uh 22 so it's
 
02:12:39.890 --> 02:12:39.900 align:start position:0%
important to uh recognize that this data
 
02:12:41.870 --> 02:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
in this report that has been handed out
 
02:12:45.950 --> 02:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
is um as of June 30th 2022 so it's
 
02:12:47.450 --> 02:12:47.460 align:start position:0%
almost a year old
 
02:12:49.189 --> 02:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
um the scheduling of uh the presentation
 
02:12:51.530 --> 02:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
has just such that you're you're looking
 
02:12:53.930 --> 02:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
at older data I'll give brief updates on
 
02:12:56.030 --> 02:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
what current data looks like as I go
 
02:12:57.470 --> 02:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
through the uh
 
02:12:59.750 --> 02:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
um the the highlights
 
02:13:02.209 --> 02:13:02.219 align:start position:0%
um if you look on page three of the
 
02:13:04.129 --> 02:13:04.139 align:start position:0%
report you can see a graph right up
 
02:13:06.050 --> 02:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
front that talks about
 
02:13:08.330 --> 02:13:08.340 align:start position:0%
um uh program growth since the beginning
 
02:13:10.189 --> 02:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
of the program
 
02:13:13.490 --> 02:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
um in 2022 we had a you know about a
 
02:13:15.830 --> 02:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
thousand additional patients
 
02:13:18.169 --> 02:13:18.179 align:start position:0%
um you know come on board over uh that
 
02:13:20.149 --> 02:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
year the total is thirteen thousand
 
02:13:21.950 --> 02:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
three hundred and sixty four registered
 
02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:23.510 align:start position:0%
three hundred and sixty four registered
patients

02:13:23.510 --> 02:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
patients
 
02:13:28.089 --> 02:13:28.099 align:start position:0%
um we have we have 13
 
02:13:31.790 --> 02:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
602 patients right now and so what what
 
02:13:35.390 --> 02:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
we're seeing is a um is a stagnant
 
02:13:38.089 --> 02:13:38.099 align:start position:0%
growth uh flatlining stabilized growth
 
02:13:39.890 --> 02:13:39.900 align:start position:0%
however you'd want to put it
 
02:13:41.510 --> 02:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
um but the uh the the program has
 
02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
reached saturation with the current
 
02:13:45.589 --> 02:13:45.599 align:start position:0%
qualifying conditions that we have in
 
02:13:45.599 --> 02:13:46.729 align:start position:0%
qualifying conditions that we have in
place

02:13:46.729 --> 02:13:46.739 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:13:48.830 --> 02:13:48.840 align:start position:0%
um and uh certainly with the regional
 
02:13:51.350 --> 02:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
Outlook of cannabis being accessible you
 
02:13:53.149 --> 02:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
know in every Market you know that
 
02:13:55.010 --> 02:13:55.020 align:start position:0%
surrounds uh surrounds New Hampshire so
 
02:13:57.470 --> 02:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
it is it is it is reasonable to
 
02:14:00.709 --> 02:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
understand that uh many many folks in
 
02:14:01.970 --> 02:14:01.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
02:14:03.530 --> 02:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
um are choosing to get their cannabis
 
02:14:05.870 --> 02:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
across the borders without having to go
 
02:14:08.149 --> 02:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
through a um an administrative process
 
02:14:10.790 --> 02:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
and talking to their doctors
 
02:14:12.830 --> 02:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
um we still naturally still has a
 
02:14:16.669 --> 02:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
restricted list of qualifying conditions
 
02:14:20.629 --> 02:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
um we do not give providers uh full
 
02:14:22.850 --> 02:14:22.860 align:start position:0%
um discretion on what conditions that
 
02:14:25.550 --> 02:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
they can certify patients for War
 
02:14:27.430 --> 02:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
02:14:29.990 --> 02:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
and there's simply there's a lack of uh
 
02:14:32.990 --> 02:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
stores you know the set locations
 
02:14:34.669 --> 02:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
02:14:36.290 --> 02:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
um some are still you know very very far
 
02:14:37.790 --> 02:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
away people are still very far away from
 
02:14:39.830 --> 02:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
them so barriers to accessing the
 
02:14:43.010 --> 02:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
program still uh still maintained and we
 
02:14:46.189 --> 02:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
are now seeing that in the leveling of
 
02:14:47.930 --> 02:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
the numbers of qualifying patients
 
02:14:50.930 --> 02:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:50.940 --> 02:14:53.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:14:53.390 --> 02:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:55.850 --> 02:14:55.860 align:start position:0%
if you turn to page eight you see a
 
02:14:58.430 --> 02:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
graph about the age distribution of the
 
02:15:00.530 --> 02:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
patients on the program
 
02:15:03.890 --> 02:15:03.900 align:start position:0%
um they heavily skew towards 50s and 60s
 
02:15:05.390 --> 02:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
um as you'd expect with chronic
 
02:15:08.270 --> 02:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
conditions that the the Cannabis can can
 
02:15:11.569 --> 02:15:11.579 align:start position:0%
uh help with
 
02:15:13.189 --> 02:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
um I'll point out though that we you
 
02:15:14.870 --> 02:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
know we do have someone you know I think
 
02:15:17.569 --> 02:15:17.579 align:start position:0%
there's a 97 year old on the program as
 
02:15:21.709 --> 02:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
well 96 year old 95 94 and we also have
 
02:15:24.470 --> 02:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
um six miners
 
02:15:26.450 --> 02:15:26.460 align:start position:0%
um on the program that number has remain
 
02:15:28.069 --> 02:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
relatively stable throughout the history
 
02:15:30.290 --> 02:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
of the program I think one year we had a
 
02:15:31.790 --> 02:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
Max of 10
 
02:15:33.589 --> 02:15:33.599 align:start position:0%
um but you know again very strong guard
 
02:15:35.209 --> 02:15:35.219 align:start position:0%
rails in place
 
02:15:37.729 --> 02:15:37.739 align:start position:0%
um for a minor participation
 
02:15:40.010 --> 02:15:40.020 align:start position:0%
um and uh we believe that those guard
 
02:15:43.609 --> 02:15:43.619 align:start position:0%
rails you know are appropriately in
 
02:15:46.129 --> 02:15:46.139 align:start position:0%
place and and reflected by the small
 
02:15:48.649 --> 02:15:48.659 align:start position:0%
number of uh patients uh minor patients
 
02:15:50.209 --> 02:15:50.219 align:start position:0%
on the program
 
02:15:51.830 --> 02:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
um it is a barrier to access though
 
02:15:53.390 --> 02:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
because if you look at you know the age
 
02:15:56.569 --> 02:15:56.579 align:start position:0%
range of 18 you know you'll see a uh
 
02:15:59.030 --> 02:15:59.040 align:start position:0%
you'll see a jump right I mean page page
 
02:16:01.310 --> 02:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
seven it's one one-year-old one
 
02:16:04.250 --> 02:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
six-year-old one eight-year-old one 17
 
02:16:05.990 --> 02:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
year old and then you get up to 18 year
 
02:16:08.209 --> 02:16:08.219 align:start position:0%
olds 18 year olds in this 14. so again
 
02:16:11.089 --> 02:16:11.099 align:start position:0%
it's not many but still that jump shows
 
02:16:13.250 --> 02:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
that there's a that there's a barrier
 
02:16:15.410 --> 02:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
um uh and perhaps a reasonable one you
 
02:16:18.290 --> 02:16:18.300 align:start position:0%
know uh for uh underage teen
 
02:16:18.300 --> 02:16:20.689 align:start position:0%
know uh for uh underage teen
um

02:16:20.689 --> 02:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:23.089 --> 02:16:23.099 align:start position:0%
um the vast majority of uh patients more
 
02:16:24.950 --> 02:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
than 75 percent of all patients are
 
02:16:27.229 --> 02:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
certified by their providers for
 
02:16:28.729 --> 02:16:28.739 align:start position:0%
um one of the one of the many pain
 
02:16:30.770 --> 02:16:30.780 align:start position:0%
related conditions
 
02:16:33.530 --> 02:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
um again this is uh this is this is
 
02:16:35.389 --> 02:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
reasonable due to
 
02:16:37.070 --> 02:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
um the uh
 
02:16:39.950 --> 02:16:39.960 align:start position:0%
ample evidence that cannabis is
 
02:16:43.549 --> 02:16:43.559 align:start position:0%
effective for pain relief other areas it
 
02:16:45.469 --> 02:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
may not be as a as effective or the
 
02:16:46.790 --> 02:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
science is still
 
02:16:50.030 --> 02:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
um unsure however it's it's uh pain has
 
02:16:53.330 --> 02:16:53.340 align:start position:0%
been demonstrated as being relieved
 
02:16:55.310 --> 02:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
through cannabis use and so our numbers
 
02:16:58.129 --> 02:16:58.139 align:start position:0%
reflect that as well
 
02:16:59.570 --> 02:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
um in the area of certifying medical
 
02:17:01.730 --> 02:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
providers if you want to turn to page 13
 
02:17:04.190 --> 02:17:04.200 align:start position:0%
of the uh the report
 
02:17:07.370 --> 02:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
um there's another graph that shows that
 
02:17:10.250 --> 02:17:10.260 align:start position:0%
growth and uh recent stabilization of
 
02:17:11.450 --> 02:17:11.460 align:start position:0%
the numbers
 
02:17:14.570 --> 02:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
um again approximately 1300 certifying
 
02:17:14.580 --> 02:17:16.009 align:start position:0%
um again approximately 1300 certifying
providers

02:17:16.009 --> 02:17:16.019 align:start position:0%
providers
 
02:17:17.750 --> 02:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
um in the state have certified at least
 
02:17:19.669 --> 02:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
one patient
 
02:17:23.150 --> 02:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
um so technically it's 1336 as of this
 
02:17:26.929 --> 02:17:26.939 align:start position:0%
report and we now have 1328 so we are we
 
02:17:28.610 --> 02:17:28.620 align:start position:0%
it's either stabilized or going down
 
02:17:31.730 --> 02:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
over the past you know current year
 
02:17:33.650 --> 02:17:33.660 align:start position:0%
um Physicians have absolutely leveled
 
02:17:33.660 --> 02:17:35.209 align:start position:0%
um Physicians have absolutely leveled
off

02:17:35.209 --> 02:17:35.219 align:start position:0%
off
 
02:17:38.209 --> 02:17:38.219 align:start position:0%
um aprns continue to increase slightly
 
02:17:40.429 --> 02:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
and uh PA isn't continue to increase
 
02:17:42.889 --> 02:17:42.899 align:start position:0%
slightly as well these are the only
 
02:17:44.690 --> 02:17:44.700 align:start position:0%
provider types that can certify even
 
02:17:46.490 --> 02:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
though there are many other provider
 
02:17:47.990 --> 02:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
types that have prescriptive authority
 
02:17:51.770 --> 02:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
to prescribe control substances uh to uh
 
02:17:53.690 --> 02:17:53.700 align:start position:0%
to to humans
 
02:17:56.990 --> 02:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
um there's a bill this past session
 
02:18:00.650 --> 02:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 610 which did not pass the
 
02:18:02.509 --> 02:18:02.519 align:start position:0%
committee conference
 
02:18:04.849 --> 02:18:04.859 align:start position:0%
um that would have expanded uh the
 
02:18:09.610 --> 02:18:09.620 align:start position:0%
provider types to include optometrists
 
02:18:12.889 --> 02:18:12.899 align:start position:0%
naturopathic doctors podiatrists and
 
02:18:16.549 --> 02:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
dentists that did not pass although uh
 
02:18:19.070 --> 02:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
you know we believe that you know
 
02:18:20.509 --> 02:18:20.519 align:start position:0%
patients should be able to act access
 
02:18:24.410 --> 02:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
this program through the providers that
 
02:18:27.349 --> 02:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
they see on a regular basis so as an
 
02:18:29.450 --> 02:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
example and you may have heard and you
 
02:18:30.709 --> 02:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
may have heard representative Leon say
 
02:18:32.089 --> 02:18:32.099 align:start position:0%
this on the on the floor
 
02:18:33.230 --> 02:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
um some of you
 
02:18:36.169 --> 02:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
um we've got 89 people with glaucoma
 
02:18:36.179 --> 02:18:37.190 align:start position:0%
um we've got 89 people with glaucoma
um

02:18:37.190 --> 02:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:39.830 --> 02:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
treating that glaucoma the optometrists
 
02:18:41.810 --> 02:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
how many optometrists have certified
 
02:18:44.990 --> 02:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
those 89 patients for the program zero
 
02:18:46.969 --> 02:18:46.979 align:start position:0%
you know these patients have to go these
 
02:18:49.190 --> 02:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
patients that are seeing podiatrists
 
02:18:51.950 --> 02:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
um optometrists naturopaths and uh and
 
02:18:54.049 --> 02:18:54.059 align:start position:0%
dentists even though they have
 
02:18:56.270 --> 02:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
qualifying conditions even though they
 
02:18:57.770 --> 02:18:57.780 align:start position:0%
have a relationship with these providers
 
02:19:00.469 --> 02:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
they cannot access the program through
 
02:19:02.929 --> 02:19:02.939 align:start position:0%
their providers because the law
 
02:19:05.690 --> 02:19:05.700 align:start position:0%
prohibits these providers participation
 
02:19:09.349 --> 02:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
so if anyone is interested in what we
 
02:19:10.849 --> 02:19:10.859 align:start position:0%
can do
 
02:19:12.530 --> 02:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
um legislatively that's going to be
 
02:19:16.129 --> 02:19:16.139 align:start position:0%
refiled that is so you know
 
02:19:18.950 --> 02:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
02:19:21.830 --> 02:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:24.290 --> 02:19:24.300 align:start position:0%
great that's uh that that will be
 
02:19:26.270 --> 02:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
helpful um better than better late than
 
02:19:29.750 --> 02:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:29.760 --> 02:19:30.849 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:19:30.849 --> 02:19:30.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:34.790 --> 02:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
the um the last section of this report
 
02:19:36.349 --> 02:19:36.359 align:start position:0%
um provides a summary of alternative
 
02:19:39.709 --> 02:19:39.719 align:start position:0%
treatment center information the atcs
 
02:19:41.990 --> 02:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
um you know are required to submit an
 
02:19:43.669 --> 02:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
annual report
 
02:19:46.129 --> 02:19:46.139 align:start position:0%
um patients served strains of cannabis
 
02:19:49.550 --> 02:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh offered um forms of prepared cannabis
 
02:19:51.650 --> 02:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
um nothing too dramatic uh really
 
02:19:53.270 --> 02:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
different here this year than in other
 
02:19:53.280 --> 02:19:54.830 align:start position:0%
different here this year than in other
years

02:19:54.830 --> 02:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:19:56.810 --> 02:19:56.820 align:start position:0%
um you know the the big thing that
 
02:20:01.490 --> 02:20:01.500 align:start position:0%
happened in 20 uh recently is the uh the
 
02:20:03.889 --> 02:20:03.899 align:start position:0%
allowance for uh in-state patients to go
 
02:20:05.570 --> 02:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
to any of the atcs they don't have to
 
02:20:08.330 --> 02:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
register with a particular ATC and so if
 
02:20:10.130 --> 02:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
you look on page 18 and you see the
 
02:20:11.870 --> 02:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
number of qualifying patients served
 
02:20:13.310 --> 02:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
these numbers have kind of bumped up
 
02:20:15.170 --> 02:20:15.180 align:start position:0%
because now patients are going
 
02:20:17.090 --> 02:20:17.100 align:start position:0%
um throughout the state on going to all
 
02:20:20.030 --> 02:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
the atcs to Avail themselves of you know
 
02:20:22.130 --> 02:20:22.140 align:start position:0%
the the all the strains all the products
 
02:20:23.810 --> 02:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
from the different companies
 
02:20:25.730 --> 02:20:25.740 align:start position:0%
um that has also had an impact
 
02:20:27.349 --> 02:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
um over the past couple years on
 
02:20:30.349 --> 02:20:30.359 align:start position:0%
slightly lowering prices you know
 
02:20:32.330 --> 02:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
there's now some what I would call some
 
02:20:34.190 --> 02:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
friendly competition between the three
 
02:20:36.469 --> 02:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
companies uh the non-profit entities
 
02:20:40.670 --> 02:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
that serve the patients of New Hampshire
 
02:20:42.530 --> 02:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
um because all the patients can now go
 
02:20:45.590 --> 02:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
to all the atcs we've started seeing uh
 
02:20:48.410 --> 02:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
uh prices come down modestly we've been
 
02:20:49.910 --> 02:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
seeing sales
 
02:20:51.830 --> 02:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
um and and whatnot so anything that
 
02:20:54.050 --> 02:20:54.060 align:start position:0%
brings down the price of therapeutic
 
02:20:58.010 --> 02:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
cannabis to patients is a is a positive
 
02:20:58.020 --> 02:20:58.790 align:start position:0%
cannabis to patients is a is a positive
um

02:20:58.790 --> 02:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:01.070 --> 02:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
because insurance does not cover this as
 
02:21:04.370 --> 02:21:04.380 align:start position:0%
a therapy and the prices in the regional
 
02:21:07.670 --> 02:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
market have plummeted as of late and so
 
02:21:10.250 --> 02:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
we see you know we just we we see
 
02:21:12.650 --> 02:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
patients bleeding into other markets uh
 
02:21:14.630 --> 02:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
regularly specially Maine
 
02:21:16.910 --> 02:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
um which has the the lowest prices you
 
02:21:20.570 --> 02:21:20.580 align:start position:0%
know in in the uh in the region
 
02:21:20.580 --> 02:21:22.429 align:start position:0%
know in in the uh in the region
um

02:21:22.429 --> 02:21:22.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:23.510 --> 02:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
we're very interested in the
 
02:21:25.250 --> 02:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of cannabis
 
02:21:26.990 --> 02:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
um we'll get to that with the tcmob
 
02:21:29.330 --> 02:21:29.340 align:start position:0%
report that comes later
 
02:21:31.910 --> 02:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
um you know that all the atcs do uh
 
02:21:33.950 --> 02:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
collect Effectiveness data like how is
 
02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
this product working
 
02:21:38.990 --> 02:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
um uh and the the rates of uh but it's
 
02:21:40.370 --> 02:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
all voluntary right there's no
 
02:21:42.170 --> 02:21:42.180 align:start position:0%
requirement in law in fact the law
 
02:21:43.670 --> 02:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
specifically says that Effectiveness
 
02:21:45.650 --> 02:21:45.660 align:start position:0%
data is voluntary on the part of
 
02:21:45.660 --> 02:21:46.730 align:start position:0%
data is voluntary on the part of
patients

02:21:46.730 --> 02:21:46.740 align:start position:0%
patients
 
02:21:48.650 --> 02:21:48.660 align:start position:0%
um so the the the the participation
 
02:21:52.490 --> 02:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
ranges from six percent one ATC to 35 at
 
02:21:54.230 --> 02:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
another ATC
 
02:21:56.090 --> 02:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
um the vast majority of people report
 
02:21:58.849 --> 02:21:58.859 align:start position:0%
you know uh positive outcomes
 
02:22:00.590 --> 02:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
um a very small amount report negative
 
02:22:00.600 --> 02:22:02.150 align:start position:0%
um a very small amount report negative
outcomes

02:22:02.150 --> 02:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
outcomes
 
02:22:04.550 --> 02:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
um our our patient satisfaction surveys
 
02:22:06.230 --> 02:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
that we do every year
 
02:22:08.770 --> 02:22:08.780 align:start position:0%
um as well they they show uh
 
02:22:11.570 --> 02:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
surprisingly dramatic reductions in
 
02:22:14.210 --> 02:22:14.220 align:start position:0%
prescription medications across the
 
02:22:14.220 --> 02:22:15.349 align:start position:0%
prescription medications across the
board

02:22:15.349 --> 02:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:22:17.990 --> 02:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
um uh and uh high quality of uh High
 
02:22:19.730 --> 02:22:19.740 align:start position:0%
satisfaction with the program at large
 
02:22:22.370 --> 02:22:22.380 align:start position:0%
any questions representative mark
 
02:22:22.380 --> 02:22:24.410 align:start position:0%

02:22:24.410 --> 02:22:24.420 align:start position:0%
Merchant
 
02:22:26.530 --> 02:22:26.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
02:22:29.150 --> 02:22:29.160 align:start position:0%
your comment about Maine being the
 
02:22:31.429 --> 02:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
lowest what is driving the fact that
 
02:22:34.670 --> 02:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
Maine is the lower of say New Hampshire
 
02:22:37.190 --> 02:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
is it because of what what's the dynamic
 
02:22:38.330 --> 02:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
and the other question I have is I
 
02:22:41.150 --> 02:22:41.160 align:start position:0%
picked up in this report that there are
 
02:22:43.010 --> 02:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
some times which patients have to drive
 
02:22:45.770 --> 02:22:45.780 align:start position:0%
more than two hours to refill the
 
02:22:48.230 --> 02:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
Cannabis and what we can do to
 
02:22:50.630 --> 02:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
legislatively try to minimize that so
 
02:22:52.250 --> 02:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
the first question is Maine and why the
 
02:22:53.630 --> 02:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
pricing is so much different and
 
02:22:55.130 --> 02:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
secondly how do we off the patients that
 
02:22:57.110 --> 02:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
are driving so far thank you
 
02:22:58.849 --> 02:22:58.859 align:start position:0%
representative Merchant
 
02:23:03.290 --> 02:23:03.300 align:start position:0%
um Maine's prices are so low relative to
 
02:23:05.630 --> 02:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
other states because the vast majority
 
02:23:08.030 --> 02:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
of quote medical marijuana sold in Maine
 
02:23:11.210 --> 02:23:11.220 align:start position:0%
is sold based on Maine's caregiver model
 
02:23:14.510 --> 02:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
not through licensed dispensaries the
 
02:23:16.370 --> 02:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
caregiver model in Maine is largely
 
02:23:19.010 --> 02:23:19.020 align:start position:0%
unregulated meaning that there are no
 
02:23:21.410 --> 02:23:21.420 align:start position:0%
state requirements for Laboratory
 
02:23:23.809 --> 02:23:23.819 align:start position:0%
Testing uh there are no restrictions on
 
02:23:26.050 --> 02:23:26.060 align:start position:0%
pesticides you use no restrictions or
 
02:23:29.330 --> 02:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
labeling restrictions so for the most
 
02:23:32.389 --> 02:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
part it is it is and I'm not saying that
 
02:23:33.770 --> 02:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
there are bad caregivers or good
 
02:23:37.309 --> 02:23:37.319 align:start position:0%
caregivers but there is no overhead
 
02:23:39.590 --> 02:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
um uh for a regulatory overhead for
 
02:23:41.750 --> 02:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
these uh and they proliferate they're in
 
02:23:43.849 --> 02:23:43.859 align:start position:0%
every town there this is hundreds of
 
02:23:46.790 --> 02:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
caregivers selling medical marijuana you
 
02:23:48.170 --> 02:23:48.180 align:start position:0%
know to patients
 
02:23:50.389 --> 02:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
um and they can sell at a ridiculously
 
02:23:52.550 --> 02:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
low price
 
02:23:54.590 --> 02:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
um to your second question
 
02:23:57.650 --> 02:23:57.660 align:start position:0%
um state law limits the number of
 
02:23:59.690 --> 02:23:59.700 align:start position:0%
dispensary locations there in the state
 
02:24:01.610 --> 02:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
it also limits the number of licensees
 
02:24:04.070 --> 02:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
so we have four licensees that operate
 
02:24:06.410 --> 02:24:06.420 align:start position:0%
in uh in New Hampshire
 
02:24:09.530 --> 02:24:09.540 align:start position:0%
um for licenses I'm sorry uh they're
 
02:24:13.190 --> 02:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
awarded to three entities so one of the
 
02:24:14.870 --> 02:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
nonprofits has
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
um two of the licenses each license is
 
02:24:19.790 --> 02:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
allowed to have two dispensary locations
 
02:24:21.710 --> 02:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
that's Limited in law
 
02:24:24.530 --> 02:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
um back in 2018 and 2019 there was a
 
02:24:26.450 --> 02:24:26.460 align:start position:0%
push to increase that from four
 
02:24:28.969 --> 02:24:28.979 align:start position:0%
locations uh to eight
 
02:24:31.370 --> 02:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
um still however you know um compared to
 
02:24:33.349 --> 02:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
your number of Rite Aids and CVS's
 
02:24:35.090 --> 02:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
02:24:38.210 --> 02:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
um seven is uh seven is uh is is not
 
02:24:38.220 --> 02:24:39.469 align:start position:0%
um seven is uh seven is uh is is not
many

02:24:39.469 --> 02:24:39.479 align:start position:0%
many
 
02:24:42.590 --> 02:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
um Temescal Wellness which has the two
 
02:24:42.600 --> 02:24:44.090 align:start position:0%
um Temescal Wellness which has the two
licenses

02:24:44.090 --> 02:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
02:24:47.090 --> 02:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
um including in the Seacoast they have
 
02:24:50.210 --> 02:24:50.220 align:start position:0%
yet to date they have not opened up the
 
02:24:53.090 --> 02:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
the the storefront that they were
 
02:24:55.790 --> 02:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
authorized to do a number of years ago
 
02:24:57.170 --> 02:24:57.180 align:start position:0%
um their management structure has
 
02:24:58.670 --> 02:24:58.680 align:start position:0%
recently changed
 
02:25:00.950 --> 02:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
um and we have started uh just recently
 
02:25:02.690 --> 02:25:02.700 align:start position:0%
within the past couple months and we
 
02:25:04.790 --> 02:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
have actively started uh working with
 
02:25:06.469 --> 02:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
them on getting them to open up the
 
02:25:08.809 --> 02:25:08.819 align:start position:0%
eighth store in uh in in New Hampshire
 
02:25:11.330 --> 02:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up question
 
02:25:12.889 --> 02:25:12.899 align:start position:0%
or does anyone else have another
 
02:25:16.490 --> 02:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
question oh okay one more
 
02:25:19.429 --> 02:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so this is five years
 
02:25:22.010 --> 02:25:22.020 align:start position:0%
of me basically asking the same question
 
02:25:24.469 --> 02:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
uh I worry about the long-term
 
02:25:27.469 --> 02:25:27.479 align:start position:0%
sustainability of our ATC Market I do
 
02:25:31.309 --> 02:25:31.319 align:start position:0%
too because of uh competition not just
 
02:25:34.130 --> 02:25:34.140 align:start position:0%
from atcs within that Community but you
 
02:25:37.730 --> 02:25:37.740 align:start position:0%
know recreational pot around the New
 
02:25:40.490 --> 02:25:40.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and a in a black market
 
02:25:43.969 --> 02:25:43.979 align:start position:0%
that probably exists fairly robustly I
 
02:25:45.950 --> 02:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
know you don't pay attention to the
 
02:25:50.270 --> 02:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
black market issues uh as a rule but I'm
 
02:25:53.090 --> 02:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
just wondering if you're maintaining any
 
02:25:56.690 --> 02:25:56.700 align:start position:0%
statistics to help us see the Delta over
 
02:26:01.730 --> 02:26:01.740 align:start position:0%
time between the other alternative ways
 
02:26:04.010 --> 02:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
of of a person self-medicating and
 
02:26:07.070 --> 02:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
sourcing their own pot versus going to
 
02:26:11.090 --> 02:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
uh the ADC ATC method because I'm I'm
 
02:26:12.550 --> 02:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
just think
 
02:26:15.650 --> 02:26:15.660 align:start position:0%
rationally over time if that Delta
 
02:26:18.889 --> 02:26:18.899 align:start position:0%
remains large or grows larger that
 
02:26:21.170 --> 02:26:21.180 align:start position:0%
that's going to do more harm to our ATC
 
02:26:22.910 --> 02:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
structure and it will no longer be
 
02:26:25.790 --> 02:26:25.800 align:start position:0%
sustainable could you comment on that
 
02:26:28.130 --> 02:26:28.140 align:start position:0%
these are important points
 
02:26:28.140 --> 02:26:29.690 align:start position:0%
these are important points
um

02:26:29.690 --> 02:26:29.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:31.790 --> 02:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
we're seeing it now the the numbers are
 
02:26:34.250 --> 02:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
flatlined 14 you know less than 14 000
 
02:26:36.290 --> 02:26:36.300 align:start position:0%
patients in you know the state have
 
02:26:39.110 --> 02:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
chosen to register uh many many more
 
02:26:40.790 --> 02:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
people are self-medicating
 
02:26:42.290 --> 02:26:42.300 align:start position:0%
um through you know and getting it
 
02:26:44.270 --> 02:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
through other sources
 
02:26:46.969 --> 02:26:46.979 align:start position:0%
um I can point to one piece of data so
 
02:26:48.290 --> 02:26:48.300 align:start position:0%
uh we have
 
02:26:50.210 --> 02:26:50.220 align:start position:0%
um it's not it's not stated specifically
 
02:26:50.220 --> 02:26:51.469 align:start position:0%
um it's not it's not stated specifically
but

02:26:51.469 --> 02:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:26:54.650 --> 02:26:54.660 align:start position:0%
if there are 13 500 patients registered
 
02:26:57.230 --> 02:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
in the program as of this report and we
 
02:26:58.969 --> 02:26:58.979 align:start position:0%
ask the atcs how many patients they have
 
02:27:01.610 --> 02:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
seen and they say 11 000 we know the two
 
02:27:03.410 --> 02:27:03.420 align:start position:0%
thousand of the patients have have never
 
02:27:05.750 --> 02:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
gone to one of the atcs two thousand of
 
02:27:07.429 --> 02:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
our registered patients are accessing
 
02:27:09.710 --> 02:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
you know their cannabis you know through
 
02:27:11.809 --> 02:27:11.819 align:start position:0%
any variety you know any one of those
 
02:27:13.849 --> 02:27:13.859 align:start position:0%
sources that you mention
 
02:27:15.650 --> 02:27:15.660 align:start position:0%
um there's a we you know I don't know
 
02:27:17.330 --> 02:27:17.340 align:start position:0%
the difference between Black Market I
 
02:27:19.730 --> 02:27:19.740 align:start position:0%
would call it gray market right uh um
 
02:27:21.770 --> 02:27:21.780 align:start position:0%
and you know we've we've seen you know
 
02:27:23.750 --> 02:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
we've seen THC products proliferate on
 
02:27:25.610 --> 02:27:25.620 align:start position:0%
the shelves of gas stations in New
 
02:27:28.010 --> 02:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as well hemp derived
 
02:27:30.710 --> 02:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
um hemp derived THC products you know
 
02:27:32.690 --> 02:27:32.700 align:start position:0%
and there was legislation this year to
 
02:27:35.090 --> 02:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
uh to to try to address that issue
 
02:27:37.790 --> 02:27:37.800 align:start position:0%
unregulated don't know what's in it
 
02:27:40.250 --> 02:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
um and uh and so that was set up at 180
 
02:27:43.190 --> 02:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
became 6 11 which did pass committee a
 
02:27:44.809 --> 02:27:44.819 align:start position:0%
conference so
 
02:27:46.670 --> 02:27:46.680 align:start position:0%
um I mean there's a lot of moving Parts
 
02:27:49.130 --> 02:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
here you know the issue of legalization
 
02:27:51.230 --> 02:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
I'm very concerned about that you know
 
02:27:52.730 --> 02:27:52.740 align:start position:0%
and the department is concerned about
 
02:27:55.130 --> 02:27:55.140 align:start position:0%
that in terms of the viability the atcs
 
02:27:57.410 --> 02:27:57.420 align:start position:0%
and the viability of the TCP it is
 
02:28:01.370 --> 02:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
important to keep the TCP in place under
 
02:28:04.370 --> 02:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
whatever legalization model is adopted
 
02:28:06.170 --> 02:28:06.180 align:start position:0%
by the state of New Hampshire
 
02:28:09.290 --> 02:28:09.300 align:start position:0%
um and that is why that that we I have
 
02:28:11.510 --> 02:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
Ben and others and the atcs have been in
 
02:28:13.190 --> 02:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
front of the legislature throughout this
 
02:28:15.050 --> 02:28:15.060 align:start position:0%
past session on all the legalization
 
02:28:16.730 --> 02:28:16.740 align:start position:0%
efforts that you know have the potential
 
02:28:18.230 --> 02:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
to making it
 
02:28:21.469 --> 02:28:21.479 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 639 was decent it allowed
 
02:28:24.710 --> 02:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
the atcs into the market
 
02:28:27.950 --> 02:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
um to help sustain them as ant viable
 
02:28:27.960 --> 02:28:30.050 align:start position:0%
um to help sustain them as ant viable
entities

02:28:30.050 --> 02:28:30.060 align:start position:0%
entities
 
02:28:34.309 --> 02:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
um a the the the last minute
 
02:28:38.510 --> 02:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
effort to of the house to create a state
 
02:28:41.630 --> 02:28:41.640 align:start position:0%
model legislation you know um or a state
 
02:28:41.640 --> 02:28:42.550 align:start position:0%
model legislation you know um or a state
a

02:28:42.550 --> 02:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:28:45.950 --> 02:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
state sales model legislation
 
02:28:48.469 --> 02:28:48.479 align:start position:0%
um was proposing to take out what the
 
02:28:50.690 --> 02:28:50.700 align:start position:0%
atcs not enter that market that would
 
02:28:53.090 --> 02:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
have a profound impact on their ability
 
02:28:56.570 --> 02:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
to be you know viable entities they're
 
02:28:58.670 --> 02:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
non-profits which is a barrier you know
 
02:29:00.590 --> 02:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
for you know their commercial potential
 
02:29:03.530 --> 02:29:03.540 align:start position:0%
as well so you know we're
 
02:29:05.389 --> 02:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
and the the question you're asking is
 
02:29:07.490 --> 02:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
larger than are we tracking like actual
 
02:29:09.290 --> 02:29:09.300 align:start position:0%
numbers like it's you know I don't know
 
02:29:10.490 --> 02:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
the actual numbers of people who are
 
02:29:12.050 --> 02:29:12.060 align:start position:0%
self-medicating and going to other
 
02:29:14.690 --> 02:29:14.700 align:start position:0%
places but our numbers are flatlined and
 
02:29:16.969 --> 02:29:16.979 align:start position:0%
a legalization effort you know in my
 
02:29:20.030 --> 02:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
opinion needs to be evaluated in light
 
02:29:22.910 --> 02:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
of the uh with and the goal of
 
02:29:24.469 --> 02:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
maintaining the therapeutic cannabis
 
02:29:25.849 --> 02:29:25.859 align:start position:0%
program well thank you Mr Holt we're
 
02:29:27.410 --> 02:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
going to call it off here and if anyone
 
02:29:29.690 --> 02:29:29.700 align:start position:0%
has another question they can approach
 
02:29:32.150 --> 02:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
you privately after the meeting and
 
02:29:34.849 --> 02:29:34.859 align:start position:0%
would Mr Lipman and councilor Williams
 
02:29:37.610 --> 02:29:37.620 align:start position:0%
please approach like that was the one
 
02:29:39.230 --> 02:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
that was one report
 
02:29:39.240 --> 02:29:40.130 align:start position:0%
that was one report
um

02:29:40.130 --> 02:29:40.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:44.650 --> 02:29:44.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:44.660 --> 02:29:46.990 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:29:46.990 --> 02:29:47.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:29:50.090 --> 02:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
I know I know that and maybe we can
 
02:29:54.050 --> 02:29:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:56.030 --> 02:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
thank you because it's not going to be
 
02:29:58.010 --> 02:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
answered briefly and it deserves to be
 
02:30:08.889 --> 02:30:08.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:13.490 --> 02:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
yes yeah Mr chair yes
 
02:30:16.370 --> 02:30:16.380 align:start position:0%
are we meeting in July and August no
 
02:30:17.750 --> 02:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:30:20.870 --> 02:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
the next meeting is September 22nd
 
02:30:20.880 --> 02:30:22.429 align:start position:0%
the next meeting is September 22nd
Friday

02:30:22.429 --> 02:30:22.439 align:start position:0%
Friday
 
02:30:24.050 --> 02:30:24.060 align:start position:0%
could I ask
 
02:30:26.570 --> 02:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
why we're not meeting in July and August
 
02:30:29.270 --> 02:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
given the proliferation of items on our
 
02:30:29.280 --> 02:30:30.469 align:start position:0%
given the proliferation of items on our
agenda

02:30:30.469 --> 02:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
agenda
 
02:30:34.670 --> 02:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
and well I with a lack of ability to
 
02:30:38.389 --> 02:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
thoroughly dig into the issues that
 
02:30:40.969 --> 02:30:40.979 align:start position:0%
are of concern to all of us I'm going to
 
02:30:42.469 --> 02:30:42.479 align:start position:0%
the speaker's office right after this
 
02:30:44.330 --> 02:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
and I will pose that question okay
 
02:30:46.730 --> 02:30:46.740 align:start position:0%
because I'm quite willing to do it
 
02:30:49.370 --> 02:30:49.380 align:start position:0%
but I was told we couldn't so I have to
 
02:30:52.010 --> 02:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
chase all statutory commissions are
 
02:30:55.070 --> 02:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
allowed to meet throughout the summer I
 
02:30:56.510 --> 02:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
will check it out again
 
02:30:59.090 --> 02:30:59.100 align:start position:0%
