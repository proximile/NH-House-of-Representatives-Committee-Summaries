does

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh shine a little bit of light into this
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
what the public body was doing at the
 
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:39.560 align:start position:0%
time they uh decided to go into public
 
00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:43.480 align:start position:0%
session uh you can read the thing uh
 
00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
it's legally and two sentences or three
 
00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:50.870 align:start position:0%
it's legally and two sentences or three
sentences

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
so and that also allows the public body
 
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
at a later date if necessary which they
 
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
can do now to make the uh Records public
 
00:09:03.389 --> 00:09:03.399 align:start position:0%
should that be uh required because
 
00:09:07.509 --> 00:09:07.519 align:start position:0%
of Shifting sands on which a public body
 
00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
operates I'll be happy to answer any
 
00:09:11.389 --> 00:09:11.399 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any questions
 
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
about from the committee thank you Mr
 
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
chair yes representative Oregan um
 
00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
pretty well serve a simple question
 
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
though it not sure what answer might not
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
be so clear what exctly problem does
 
00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
this solve do you have any maybe you
 
00:09:30.509 --> 00:09:30.519 align:start position:0%
give us some example something that has
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
happened that was a problem but which
 
00:09:34.069 --> 00:09:34.079 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have been a problem if we'd had
 
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:37.640 align:start position:0%
this law in place it helps them it helps
 
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
eliminate a lot of quote conspiracy
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
theory that's the common term I don't
 
00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:45.160 align:start position:0%
like it but uh that develops the board
 
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
was doing this the board was doing that
 
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
it you know it shines a sterilizing ray
 
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
of sunshine into the operations of a
 
00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
public body and just makes it more clear
 
00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
to everyone in involved as to what was
 
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
going on and why it was going on I I
 
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
mean it people understand Personnel
 
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:09.200 align:start position:0%
issues they understand that they can
 
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
back away and uh that some of the stuff
 
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
needs to be done uh in private as as
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
well it should be uh that's not a
 
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
question it also enables the public body
 
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
if there are uh reasons that uh they
 
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
need to be to uh make the the minutes or
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
decisions available for public discl
 
00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
disclosure uh uh as uh circumstances
 
00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
dictate uh around a particular thing uh
 
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
it would
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
um for example down here in Hudson as uh
 
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:47.560 align:start position:0%
several of your board members know
 
00:10:51.269 --> 00:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
there's a huge project going on um
 
00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:53.079 align:start position:0%
before the planning board if the
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
planning board were to go into private
 
00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
session as we almost did nonpublic
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
session uh because of a Personnel issue
 
00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
uh that would then mean that that would
 
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
be put in the docket as that the board
 
00:11:09.389 --> 00:11:09.399 align:start position:0%
did this and then when the inevitable
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
loss it uh it arises as it probably will
 
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
um that's an aside uh then we can say
 
00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:20.120 align:start position:0%
yeah we did and this was the purpose of
 
00:11:22.629 --> 00:11:22.639 align:start position:0%
it and
 
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
that it just protects everyone involved
 
00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
and it makes it crystal clear that no
 
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:30.200 align:start position:0%
one was hiding nothing from
 
00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
nobody to use the
 
00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
vacular right
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you um and representative
 
00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
svet did you have a question yes thank
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:11:46.269 --> 00:11:46.279 align:start position:0%
representative gy for taking my
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
question um I like the uh the
 
00:11:51.150 --> 00:11:51.160 align:start position:0%
transparency that this bill would
 
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:53.720 align:start position:0%
provide uh along constitutional
 
00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
requirement under uh part 1 article 8
 
00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:00.040 align:start position:0%
but then there is is the other side of
 
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
this uh looking at the Constitution and
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
uh an unfunded mandate a new unfunded
 
00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
mandate regarding uh part first article
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
28a can you uh give me an idea of what
 
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
your thoughts are on the balance of
 
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
those two constitutional
 
00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
issues uh thank you representative Silva
 
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
I don't see an article 28a issue in here
 
00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
because the board is already required to
 
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
keep a set of minutes all this is is
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:31.230 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
are you all set represent syia all set
 
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:41.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:44.360 align:start position:0%
wper so part of this bill is about U
 
00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
maintaining this list
 
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
and is it already required that to go
 
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:53.240 align:start position:0%
into nonpublic the board has to
 
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519 align:start position:0%
Inu State the reason why they're going
 
00:12:55.519 --> 00:12:56.790 align:start position:0%
Inu State the reason why they're going
into

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:00.240 align:start position:0%
nonpublic yes they do and all this does
 
00:13:04.629 --> 00:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
is uh add to that declaration as to uh
 
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
that we're going into nonpublic uh for a
 
00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
um particular reason
 
00:13:15.269 --> 00:13:15.279 align:start position:0%
uh then minutes of that nonpublic
 
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
session are kept and they're kept
 
00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
aren't I have a follow I need to put
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
this in so if you if I may Mr chair I'll
 
00:13:36.269 --> 00:13:36.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
two there any other questions for
 
00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:43.470 align:start position:0%
two there any other questions for
representative

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
ery seeing
 
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
none thank you for your
 
00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you Mr chair members of
 
00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
the committee kind of wish was up there
 
00:13:54.069 --> 00:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
L yeah thank you uh the next person who
 
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
signed sign up to speak uh in opposition
 
00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
gra good good morning hopefully you can
 
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
hear me all right we can thank you my
 
00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
name is n Grace I am a I'm representing
 
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
00:14:25.749 --> 00:14:25.759 align:start position:0%
this morning uh we are opposed to this
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
bill um because we think that this bill
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
would end up essentially creating a lot
 
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
of work on the part of
 
00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities without having any real
 
00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.430 align:start position:0%
municipalities without having any real
tangible

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
tangible
 
00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
benefit um a couple problems that we see
 
00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
here is that the list is ongoing and it
 
00:14:44.749 --> 00:14:44.759 align:start position:0%
justes and the bill doesn't provide for
 
00:14:46.269 --> 00:14:46.279 align:start position:0%
anything to ever be
 
00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
removed so in 20 years you're going to
 
00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
have a gigantic list in every
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
municipality and it's going to list
 
00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:56.680 align:start position:0%
every uh
 
00:14:59.870 --> 00:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
possible uh every reason that some board
 
00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
entered non-public session and then
 
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
left and you know 20 years later a lot
 
00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
of that's not going to be really
 
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
relevant because it'll be something like
 
00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
either purchasing a property in which
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
case those minutes will have been
 
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
released a long time ago and everyone
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
will have known whether or not the Town
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
Hall New Town Hall was built or
 
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
not or it'll be something like a uh an
 
00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
item sealed for reputation purposes so
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
for example uh someone
 
00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:31.839 align:start position:0%
applied for municipal welfare or had
 
00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
something involving Municipal
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
welfare happen and that was discussed at
 
00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
the board level um and that would be
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
sealed forever um so you're going to
 
00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:44.680 align:start position:0%
have this really long list that doesn't
 
00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:47.720 align:start position:0%
really serve a a
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
purpose um the second reason is it
 
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't really seem to assist the public
 
00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:56.680 align:start position:0%
uh because you know if the Public's
 
00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
interested in whatever the matter is
 
00:15:59.590 --> 00:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
before the board and then the board goes
 
00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
into non-public session members of the
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
public who are interested in that will
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
presumably be paying attention and
 
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
understand you know the board went into
 
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
nonpublic session and then they can make
 
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
the request at a later point in time to
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
unseal those minutes and as this
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
committee knows essentially what would
 
00:16:22.309 --> 00:16:22.319 align:start position:0%
happen is the the member of the public
 
00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
would come in make the right to know
 
00:16:27.749 --> 00:16:27.759 align:start position:0%
request uh the the board would get that
 
00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:29.720 align:start position:0%
request of valate it determine whether
 
00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate to unseal the minutes
 
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
and give the minutes
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
over um having the list of minutes
 
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't really help facilitate that or
 
00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
or help speed up the process um it just
 
00:16:42.309 --> 00:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
kind of creates a list so if at some
 
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
point in time someone in the future
 
00:16:47.069 --> 00:16:47.079 align:start position:0%
wants to look and see you know how many
 
00:16:49.389 --> 00:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
times uh for instance the select board
 
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
went into non-public session to discuss
 
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
a reputation issue um they now have a
 
00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
list of those things so those are really
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
our two
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:12.949 align:start position:0%
 
Gray

00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
Gray
 
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:20.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:23.839 align:start position:0%
chairman many of us most of us maybe
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
don't go to these meetings
 
00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
and don't f close attention to the
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
minutes but my question really
 
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
is without a list of the nonpublic
 
00:17:39.789 --> 00:17:39.799 align:start position:0%
session how could I for example Lear my
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
if I have some concern over what my
 
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:43.799 align:start position:0%
select is
 
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:47.480 align:start position:0%
doing and there's no list with nonpublic
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
session how can I find
 
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
out when they went in why without going
 
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
week after week after week minutes by
 
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
so presumably you're concerned about
 
00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
specific item so I guess if I can use an
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
example here um you know let's say
 
00:18:12.149 --> 00:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
there's some sort of uh employee related
 
00:18:13.669 --> 00:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
issue you're concerned about how the
 
00:18:16.029 --> 00:18:16.039 align:start position:0%
select board is interacting with let's
 
00:18:17.549 --> 00:18:17.559 align:start position:0%
say the police
 
00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:20.039 align:start position:0%
chief um when you go and make the right
 
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
to know request you're not you're
 
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
probably not going to make the request
 
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
for all nonpublic
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
because the select board could enter
 
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
non-public session for all manner of
 
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
manner of items they could you know as I
 
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:38.200 align:start position:0%
said be building a new or considering
 
00:18:40.549 --> 00:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
building a new uh Town Hall there could
 
00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:43.799 align:start position:0%
be discussions about um you know a whole
 
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
bunch of things when you make the
 
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
request you have to reasonably describe
 
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
what you want uh pursuant to the law now
 
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
so what you're going to say is you want
 
00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
all minutes related to you know uh the
 
00:18:59.149 --> 00:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
the select boards interaction with the
 
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
police chief over the past year for
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
instance and whoever is reviewing the
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
minutes is going to
 
00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
see that there's both some things in the
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
public session and there's going to be
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
something presumably in the non-public
 
00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
session and the board would then have to
 
00:19:19.029 --> 00:19:19.039 align:start position:0%
evaluate whether to release those
 
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:22.360 align:start position:0%
minutes or not um so they still have
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
this obligation to go back and make a
 
00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable search through the minutes
 
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
and that's in the law now um to to
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
determine that they're going to be
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
complying with whatever your request is
 
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
as the requester so um this wouldn't
 
00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:39.640 align:start position:0%
change that they still have that
 
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
search any followup representative oper
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.750 align:start position:0%
 
set

00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:58.760 align:start position:0%
set
 
00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for Mr
 
00:20:04.029 --> 00:20:04.039 align:start position:0%
Grace seean thank you for your testimony
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
today thank you Mr Cher the next speaker
 
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
available and I don't see him on the
 
00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:40.120 align:start position:0%
Bolton and I do see him on the list
 
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
Bolton good morning Mr chairman thank
 
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
you I'm the City attorney in Nash New
 
00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh it strikes me that this
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
U piece of
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
legislation uh just requires a separate
 
00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
list of information that's already
 
00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:09.039 align:start position:0%
available uh since a body has to be in
 
00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
public session to uh take a vote to go
 
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
into non-public session and the publicly
 
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:20.799 align:start position:0%
available minutes will uh show who made
 
00:21:24.029 --> 00:21:24.039 align:start position:0%
the motion to go into non-public session
 
00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
the specific provision of law under
 
00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.549 align:start position:0%
the specific provision of law under
which

00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
the motion is
 
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
made uh subsequently when the non-public
 
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
session ends if there is a vote to keep
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
the minutes
 
00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:42.799 align:start position:0%
confidential that motion has to be made
 
00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
in public and has to be noted in the
 
00:21:49.789 --> 00:21:49.799 align:start position:0%
public minutes so it seems to me the
 
00:21:53.269 --> 00:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
list required by this uh piece of
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
legislation is uh simply redundant adds
 
00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:01.240 align:start position:0%
to the paperwork burden that the
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
selectman secretary or some uh
 
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
clerical uh employee has to
 
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:15.400 align:start position:0%
maintain and it's hard for me to imagine
 
00:22:18.029 --> 00:22:18.039 align:start position:0%
the uh problem that it's
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
solving so thank
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
you thank you are there any questions
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
for Mr
 
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
Bolton seeing none thank you for your
 
00:22:30.149 --> 00:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
testimony today thank
 
00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
you and I did see
 
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:53.789 --> 00:22:53.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
green can you hear
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:07.240 align:start position:0%
us hello Miss
 
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
unmute this green we see your name on
 
00:23:29.269 --> 00:23:29.279 align:start position:0%
our screen but we don't
 
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
ah okay here we go there thank you for
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
your patience um I uh wasn't intending
 
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
to testify on this bill today but I am a
 
00:23:40.510 --> 00:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
member of right to know New Hampshire
 
00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:43.720 align:start position:0%
and I would like to jump in here um I
 
00:23:47.549 --> 00:23:47.559 align:start position:0%
think if anyone were to ask a sitting
 
00:23:50.789 --> 00:23:50.799 align:start position:0%
selectman or a school of board member
 
00:23:55.149 --> 00:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
how many non-public minutes they have
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
they would not have any idea and as a
 
00:24:00.789 --> 00:24:00.799 align:start position:0%
result they never go back in unseal
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
minutes that should have been
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
unsealed so in in administration a list
 
00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
would help a great deal to advance
 
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
transparency because right now in my
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
experience many public bodies have a
 
00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
huge Legacy of sealed public minutes
 
00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:23.720 align:start position:0%
that do not need to be sealed but simply
 
00:24:29.269 --> 00:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
don't remember them and a list would
 
00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
help the public remind the elected
 
00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
officials that they need to go back and
 
00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
review and unseal sealed minutes so I
 
00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
think this is a very important bill for
 
00:24:44.669 --> 00:24:44.679 align:start position:0%
transparency and to help the public
 
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
Administration thank
 
00:24:56.029 --> 00:24:56.039 align:start position:0%
you thank you are there any questions
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:03.269 --> 00:25:03.279 align:start position:0%

00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%

green thank you and is there anyone else
 
00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
who wishes to testify if you do you need
 
00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
hand seeing none we'll close the hearing
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
00:25:22.269 --> 00:25:22.279 align:start position:0%
108 and we have about three or four
 
00:25:22.279 --> 00:25:26.190 align:start position:0%
108 and we have about three or four
minutes

00:25:26.190 --> 00:25:26.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:28.269 --> 00:25:28.279 align:start position:0%
before I just know
 
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
that uh there
 
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
were 15 people who signed up and offered
 
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
their support for the bill and six
 
00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
people who signed up and indicated their
 
00:25:56.669 --> 00:25:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:56.679 --> 00:25:59.789 align:start position:0%
 
bill

00:25:59.789 --> 00:25:59.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I have a problem my computer
 
00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:04.360 align:start position:0%
at the moment take five minutes see if I
 
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
can figure
 
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:38.909 align:start position:0%

00:26:38.909 --> 00:26:38.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
while you're doing that I
 
00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:44.679 align:start position:0%
and representative bur indicated I had
 
00:26:47.909 --> 00:26:47.919 align:start position:0%
indicated that representative Burch
 
00:26:47.919 --> 00:26:49.630 align:start position:0%
indicated that representative Burch
would

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:49.640 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
um provide a parliamentary inquiry on
 
00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
cac10 if it was taken off the consent
 
00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:02.120 align:start position:0%
calendar as unlikely as that may be but
 
00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:03.919 align:start position:0%
he may not be
 
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
available for our session next week and
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
so if you could give some thought as to
 
00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
who might be able to replace him that
 
00:27:17.909 --> 00:27:17.919 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to me so I can get that
 
00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:21.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
able to do the Parliamentary inquiry on
 
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
cac10 CA cacr 10 is on the consent

any effort at all to take it off
 
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
calendar but if a parliamentary inquiry
 
00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
should be necessary I'm looking for
 
00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:10.760 align:start position:0%

transparency uh before I get into the uh
 
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
reasons for the bill I want to give you
 
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
a little bit of background on myself
 
00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
um regarding uh my experience in
 
00:31:52.509 --> 00:31:52.519 align:start position:0%
negotiations I've been a member of the
 
00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
Allied Pilots Association for almost 36
 
00:31:57.149 --> 00:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
years now and that's a union that
 
00:31:57.159 --> 00:31:58.549 align:start position:0%
years now and that's a union that
represents

00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
represents
 
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
14,500 uh Pilots of American Airlines
 
00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
and during that time I spent almost
 
00:32:06.629 --> 00:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
eight years in various leadership roles
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
at the national level including a board
 
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
of uh Board of director position several
 
00:32:14.669 --> 00:32:14.679 align:start position:0%
committee chair position and the most
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
applicable to this issue I spent two
 
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
years as a full-time
 
00:32:21.549 --> 00:32:21.559 align:start position:0%
negotiator and almost the entire uh rest
 
00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:25.240 align:start position:0%
of my time at 8 paa involved with uh
 
00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
negotiations and with the interpretation
 
00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:29.519 align:start position:0%
and defense of our section one of our
 
00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:32.200 align:start position:0%
contract our contract is a very detailed
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
one it's almost 450 pages in length and
 
00:32:39.350 --> 00:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
the section that I was uh pretty much
 
00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
the expert in section one is uh along
 
00:32:46.269 --> 00:32:46.279 align:start position:0%
with its supplements and the the pages
 
00:32:49.389 --> 00:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
itself is almost 75 pages in length so
 
00:32:51.629 --> 00:32:51.639 align:start position:0%
I've negotiated opposite the management
 
00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:53.519 align:start position:0%
of the world's largest Airlines for many
 
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
many years so I'm very ex very familiar
 
00:32:59.509 --> 00:32:59.519 align:start position:0%
with the negotiation process and
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
environment uh this bill would re this
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
bill would require negotiation sessions
 
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
to be open to the public but would still
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
allow caucus sessions by one side to be
 
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
done in close sessions since negotiating
 
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
goals strategies and tactics should be
 
00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
confidential collective bargaining
 
00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
agreements je uh generally represent one
 
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
of the single largest cost items to all
 
00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:26.120 align:start position:0%
public employers and therefore uh to the
 
00:33:29.149 --> 00:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of the cities counties and
 
00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
state collective bargaining agreements
 
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
also control many aspects of the union
 
00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
members pay benefit and quality of work
 
00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
life from the New Hampshire taxpayers
 
00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
perspective the first time they ever get
 
00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
to see the impact of a CBA is when their
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
tax bill arrives and you will
 
00:33:48.430 --> 00:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly hear testimony today that
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
says the taxpayer is the ultimate
 
00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:52.600 align:start position:0%
Authority they can vote the employer
 
00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
represent uh Representatives out
 
00:33:57.149 --> 00:33:57.159 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that's not a very very
 
00:33:57.159 --> 00:33:58.470 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that's not a very very
realistic

00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
realistic
 
00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
argument and one meant to dissuade
 
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
negotiations in public unfortunately by
 
00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:06.440 align:start position:0%
the time the taxpayers see their annual
 
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayers uh tax bill it's too late to
 
00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
have any input to those responsible for
 
00:34:13.589 --> 00:34:13.599 align:start position:0%
representing their interests at the
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
bargaining table from the union members
 
00:34:18.109 --> 00:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
side of things currently the New
 
00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire public employees normally get
 
00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
to see the final package after the
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
tenative agreement has been signed off
 
00:34:26.589 --> 00:34:26.599 align:start position:0%
on with open negotiations the union
 
00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:28.919 align:start position:0%
members could now be made aware prior to
 
00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:31.399 align:start position:0%
the agreement being finalized possibly
 
00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:33.560 align:start position:0%
allowing input to their Union reps
 
00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:36.200 align:start position:0%
officers well in advance of the tenative
 
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
agreement just as the taxpayers would
 
00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
have the ability to have their input
 
00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
prior to the agreement so with the union
 
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
membership in previous hearings on this
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
subject there's been testimony submitted
 
00:34:49.829 --> 00:34:49.839 align:start position:0%
that suggests that open negotiations
 
00:34:51.869 --> 00:34:51.879 align:start position:0%
would have a NE negative impact on the
 
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
process and I believe this suggestion uh
 
00:34:57.069 --> 00:34:57.079 align:start position:0%
suggestion to be uh what I would call a
 
00:34:58.870 --> 00:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
fear grenade to scare members of this
 
00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:01.640 align:start position:0%
body to object to the to the
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
bill I I pulled a few comments out of
 
00:35:07.069 --> 00:35:07.079 align:start position:0%
the previous testimony just so I
 
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
could I guess maybe anticipate a little
 
00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
what what you may hear
 
00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
later during a public heing on a similar
 
00:35:19.109 --> 00:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
Bill a Mr John kooy of the AFS CME who I
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
do not know in testim submitted
 
00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
testimony stated quote I'll be blunt
 
00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of arguing and yelling and
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
quote he went on further to say quote
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
opening negotiations to the public would
 
00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
stifle this type of give and take and
 
00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
thereby dras drastically curbing both
 
00:35:40.349 --> 00:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
sides ability to reach a resolution in a
 
00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:44.440 align:start position:0%
timely fashion if at all end
 
00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
quote I'm I'm I'm hoping that Mr Cy does
 
00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:49.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't really believe arguing and
 
00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
yelling are a required or necessary part
 
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
of a negotiation and if he does maybe
 
00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
putting negotiations in public View you
 
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
would actually create maybe a little bit
 
00:36:02.109 --> 00:36:02.119 align:start position:0%
more of a civil environment in my many
 
00:36:04.270 --> 00:36:04.280 align:start position:0%
years of NE negotiations I have never
 
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
once uh witnessed arguing and yelling
 
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
have I seen emotions run High yeah uh
 
00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
but I've also seen fiery emotions during
 
00:36:16.589 --> 00:36:16.599 align:start position:0%
debates on the state house floor yet the
 
00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
public gallery has been witnessed to
 
00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:20.200 align:start position:0%
this and I'm pretty sure they handled it
 
00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.430 align:start position:0%
this and I'm pretty sure they handled it
just

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079 align:start position:0%
fine have I seen pre-planned tactical
 
00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
actions by one side or another that
 
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
might involve slamming and olders and
 
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
walking out in Mass sure I've been part
 
00:36:31.109 --> 00:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
of that but the suggestion that
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
potential temper outbursts are a reason
 
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
to suppress transparen he just doesn't
 
00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
hold the
 
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
water additionally the public
 
00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
negotiations might have the effect of
 
00:36:42.309 --> 00:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
actually tempering either side's
 
00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
expectations this could convince both
 
00:36:47.109 --> 00:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
sides to open initial negotiations and
 
00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:48.920 align:start position:0%
continuing negotiations with more
 
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
realistic proposals by starting with the
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
realistic proposals the result could be
 
00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:56.440 align:start position:0%
the shortening of the time required to
 
00:36:58.109 --> 00:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
find finalize a new contract this would
 
00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
lead to lower cost for both sides
 
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
especially for the public employers and
 
00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:06.200 align:start position:0%
taxpayers another argument put forth by
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
Mr cloy previously was the need for
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
secrecy otherwise it would prevent or
 
00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:13.400 align:start position:0%
hinder open discussion of sensitive
 
00:37:16.750 --> 00:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
items of an individual employee nature
 
00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
but these particular instances relating
 
00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
to individuals can certainly be handled
 
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
without identifying the person by name
 
00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:25.720 align:start position:0%
in a generic sense historically
 
00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
Grievances and arbitrations are normally
 
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
handled confidentially outside the
 
00:37:34.030 --> 00:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
contract negotiations Arena so those do
 
00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
not need to be part of public
 
00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
negotiations and I have been involved
 
00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
with many many many arbitrations dealing
 
00:37:43.069 --> 00:37:43.079 align:start position:0%
with individuals that have been settled
 
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
without going making them public it's
 
00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
just another argument that doesn't hold
 
00:37:50.829 --> 00:37:50.839 align:start position:0%
water we have transparency for the
 
00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
public embedded in nearly every public
 
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
process selectman meetings planning
 
00:37:57.390 --> 00:37:57.400 align:start position:0%
board meetings public hearing on pending
 
00:37:59.950 --> 00:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
Les legislations as we are doing right
 
00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
here right now and floor debates and
 
00:38:04.870 --> 00:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
voting in the legislative Chambers you
 
00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:07.480 align:start position:0%
will certainly hear the opposition today
 
00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:09.160 align:start position:0%
pull the pins and toss many fear
 
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
grenades into the room excuses as to why
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
this can't be
 
00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
done I just don't believe that and I
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
believe those who were going to argue
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
against it uh may just have something
 
00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
they they they want to continue to keep
 
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
hidden from the public Okay so you could
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
just wrap up yeah I've got one more
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
quick thing and I will be done um I've
 
00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
included a couple of reports they were
 
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:37.400 align:start position:0%
sent to you last night um I will also
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
send copies of this uh testimony to you

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:44.440 align:start position:0%
thing I want to conclude my testim uh
 
00:38:46.309 --> 00:38:46.319 align:start position:0%

00:38:48.870 --> 00:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
of Washington's open public meetings act

which reads quote the people of the
 
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
state do not yield their sovereignty to
 
00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
the agencies which serve them the people
 
00:38:57.309 --> 00:38:57.319 align:start position:0%
in delegating Authority do not give
 
00:38:58.910 --> 00:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
their public servants the right to
 
00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:00.839 align:start position:0%
decide what is good for the people to
 
00:39:02.829 --> 00:39:02.839 align:start position:0%
know and what is not good for them to
 
00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
know the people insist on remaining
 
00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
informed so that they may retain control
 
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%

morning Mr chairman and committee
 
00:40:00.829 --> 00:40:00.839 align:start position:0%
members um I am president of the school
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
district governance Association of New
 
00:40:06.430 --> 00:40:06.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we are a private organization
 
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
whose mission is to give voters a voice
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
by empowering elected School District
 
00:40:13.309 --> 00:40:13.319 align:start position:0%
officials to reclaim control over
 
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
budgets and curricula in addition to
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
offering seminars and webinars to
 
00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:19.720 align:start position:0%
educate and inform Schoolboard and
 
00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
budget committee members we have a
 
00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:23.240 align:start position:0%
legislative agenda of increasing
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
transparency in the budgeting and
 
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
Collective bar bargain process in school
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
districts this is the second time we
 
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
have attempted this bill it passed the
 
00:40:35.630 --> 00:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
senate in 2018 and we are grateful to
 
00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
representative turot and the other
 
00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
sponsors for working to advance it
 
00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
again this changed to the right to no
 
00:40:45.190 --> 00:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
law is not a radical proposal nor is it
 
00:40:49.109 --> 00:40:49.119 align:start position:0%
anti-union as of 2018 15 states do not
 
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
have any exemptions from their open
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
meeting laws for Public Employee
 
00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:56.440 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining in other words 15
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
States government employees and public
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
public I personally became convinced of
 
00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
the need for public view of negotiations
 
00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
during my own experience as a school
 
00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
board member on our District's
 
00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:15.400 align:start position:0%
negotiating team it was evident to me
 
00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
that the behavior I observed from my own
 
00:41:20.069 --> 00:41:20.079 align:start position:0%
team would be unlikely to occur in
 
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
public furthermore the public I believed
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
probably assumes a lot more high-powered
 
00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:27.640 align:start position:0%
facts and arguments then ultimately
 
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
ensued pulling back the curtain of
 
00:41:31.870 --> 00:41:31.880 align:start position:0%
secrecy from all this would hold our
 
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
elected representatives to Greater
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
accountability and also give union
 
00:41:39.430 --> 00:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
members a much better understanding of
 
00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:41.480 align:start position:0%
how well their team is working on their
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
behalf based on my experience I believe
 
00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:47.560 align:start position:0%
both sides would be surprised some
 
00:41:49.870 --> 00:41:49.880 align:start position:0%
people object to public negotiations by
 
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
asserting that compromises can't be
 
00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:55.160 align:start position:0%
forged in public to them I ask what
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
kinds of compromis are you forging that
 
00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
requires secrecy with public
 
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
money in this time of great social
 
00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:05.240 align:start position:0%
unrest because of mistrust of public
 
00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
institutions I would respectfully
 
00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
suggest that it is incumbent on you to
 
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
require the most transparency possible
 
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
in the conduct of government Affairs
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
especially where the majority of our
 
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars are spent and for sadly
 
00:42:22.309 --> 00:42:22.319 align:start position:0%
diminishing results as the law stands
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
now if both sides agree on negotiating
 
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
in public they may do so if the taxpayer
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
Representatives request open
 
00:42:31.349 --> 00:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
negotiations but the union
 
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
Representatives do not an old PE ruling
 
00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:37.640 align:start position:0%
requires both parties to conduct
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
negotiations in private this is why we
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
are asking you to change the law to
 
00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
require both parties to do the right
 
00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%
thing making negotiations public will
 
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
give both pres represented parties more
 
00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
insight into how their interests are
 
00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
being represented in advanced with
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
better accountability for eled officials
 
00:42:59.910 --> 00:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
and Union leadership Miss green
 
00:43:04.589 --> 00:43:04.599 align:start position:0%
your yes your three minutes or thank you
 
00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much yes representative
 
00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
green you need to
 
00:43:17.069 --> 00:43:17.079 align:start position:0%
unmute there I'm this representative
 
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
orgon here my question is um we've heard
 
00:43:22.390 --> 00:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of I about the teachers unions as
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
something distinct from the uh from the
 
00:43:28.309 --> 00:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
teacher you know the Educators as a
 
00:43:29.829 --> 00:43:29.839 align:start position:0%
whole which doesn't seem to exist in
 
00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
other Industries because like um like
 
00:43:36.270 --> 00:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
for example R Turk his experience he his
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
organization was the voice of the of the
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
pilots collectively so I so why is it
 
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
that the uh to why is it that the uh
 
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
teachers unions are are sort of become
 
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
sort of a separate entity at least in
 
00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:51.640 align:start position:0%
some people's eyes including the
 
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
governors from the uh from the you know
 
00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
the from teachers in general and do you
 
00:44:00.549 --> 00:44:00.559 align:start position:0%
think uh you think that's more and and
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
um do you think there's a and also what
 
00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
was a problem you had with you seem be
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
dissatisfied the school school boards
 
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:08.440 align:start position:0%
negotiators what what was uh what was
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
the problem there too so those that's my
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
question you may not have much of an may
 
00:44:15.069 --> 00:44:15.079 align:start position:0%
not know the answer to it but I'll ask
 
00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
it anyway
 
00:44:20.069 --> 00:44:20.079 align:start position:0%
thanks yes representative Horgan um I
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
don't I don't have the same perception
 
00:44:24.829 --> 00:44:24.839 align:start position:0%
as you do that the teachers are separate
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
from the unions I I don't have that
 
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
perception so I can't answer that
 
00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:31.880 align:start position:0%
question um with respect to my own
 
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
experience um I thought my team was
 
00:44:37.630 --> 00:44:37.640 align:start position:0%
needlessly provocative and
 
00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
hostile um and and I did not feel it was
 
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
productive and I thought that people
 
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
would have uh objected to that kind of
 
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
behavior had it been conducted in public
 
00:44:49.990 --> 00:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
and rightly so okay yeah okay I
 
00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
understand thank you any other questions
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
from Miss
 
00:44:57.270 --> 00:44:57.280 align:start position:0%

testimony today thank you Stephen
[Music]

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
Bolton you raise your hand we can pick
 
00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:23.829 --> 00:45:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
Bolton thank you Mr chairman you able to
 
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
hear me now we are thank you I'm the
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
City attorney in
 
00:45:35.549 --> 00:45:35.559 align:start position:0%
NASA uh and as such I'm involved in many
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
of the uh collective bargaining
 
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
negotiations with our various employee
 
00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
groups uh have been
 
00:45:48.349 --> 00:45:48.359 align:start position:0%
for uh nearly 40 years now in one
 
00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:49.720 align:start position:0%
capacity or
 
00:45:54.829 --> 00:45:54.839 align:start position:0%
another um what this uh legislation
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
seeks to do obviously is to have the
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
negotiation sessions uh themselves uh
 
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
open to the
 
00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
public uh but the strategy
 
00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
sessions uh can still be in a a
 
00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:13.880 align:start position:0%
non-meeting uh environment without the
 
00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
need to allow uh the public uh to
 
00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
observe and without the requirements of
 
00:46:22.829 --> 00:46:22.839 align:start position:0%
notice and minutes uh but the
 
00:46:25.309 --> 00:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
negotiation sessions themselves would be
 
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:27.880 align:start position:0%
subject to all of those requirements
 
00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:29.960 align:start position:0%
that is the public allowed to ATT 10
 
00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:32.440 align:start position:0%
minutes would be required to be
 
00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:33.990 align:start position:0%
minutes would be required to be
kept

00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
kept
 
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh and made
 
00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:39.069 align:start position:0%
uh and made
available

00:46:39.069 --> 00:46:39.079 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:43.480 align:start position:0%
uh I think this have the potential of
 
00:46:46.549 --> 00:46:46.559 align:start position:0%
leading to protracted negotiations I
 
00:46:50.829 --> 00:46:50.839 align:start position:0%
think both sides particularly the union
 
00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:55.160 align:start position:0%
side uh would be discouraged from
 
00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
exploring ing potential
 
00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
Alternatives that they fear may not be
 
00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh immediately popular and sometimes the
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
hypothetical scenarios that eventually
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
lead to compromise uh if they are not
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
explored uh will result in negotiations
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
going on for a much longer
 
00:47:22.109 --> 00:47:22.119 align:start position:0%
time in every case the cost items of uh
 
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
a tenative agreement have to be
 
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
submitted to the legislative body so in
 
00:47:30.230 --> 00:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
towns and most school districts that's
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
the town meeting or or School District
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
meeting in cities it might be the board
 
00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
of Alman or city
 
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
council at that time the terms of all of
 
00:47:46.030 --> 00:47:46.040 align:start position:0%
the contracts the C that provide for
 
00:47:49.109 --> 00:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
Appropriations that is any cost those
 
00:47:52.589 --> 00:47:52.599 align:start position:0%
are made public and the public has the
 
00:47:57.430 --> 00:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh vote on on them or let
 
00:48:00.430 --> 00:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
their representatives uh know how they
 
00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:04.280 align:start position:0%
feel so I think there's much less
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
secrecy uh than has been
 
00:48:10.589 --> 00:48:10.599 align:start position:0%
suggested uh because everything that's
 
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
costly is disclosed before the agreement
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
becomes finalized but I do think the way
 
00:48:24.549 --> 00:48:24.559 align:start position:0%
negotiations are conducted with joint
 
00:48:28.109 --> 00:48:28.119 align:start position:0%
sessions with an negotiation takes place
 
00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:30.839 align:start position:0%
and then uh frequent breaks where each
 
00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
side uh caucuses and explores what the
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
next move is going to be uh I think
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
having that be subject to notice
 
00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
requirements and The Taking of minutes
 
00:48:44.549 --> 00:48:44.559 align:start position:0%
when you do go into
 
00:48:47.589 --> 00:48:47.599 align:start position:0%
negotiations is going to complicate and
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
elongate the
 
00:48:53.349 --> 00:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
process think it would be U thank you
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
I'll just wrap up it think this was uh
 
00:48:59.069 --> 00:48:59.079 align:start position:0%
not solved the intended problem and
 
00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
caused more problems than it solved
 
00:49:03.309 --> 00:49:03.319 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you attorney Bolton are
 
00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:09.000 align:start position:0%

00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
testimony I I still didn't quite get it
 
00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
he asked if you submitted written
 
00:50:18.789 --> 00:50:18.799 align:start position:0%
testimony I did
 
00:50:21.630 --> 00:50:21.640 align:start position:0%
not thank you for taking my question and
 
00:50:23.069 --> 00:50:23.079 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I would appreciate it if you
 
00:50:24.789 --> 00:50:24.799 align:start position:0%
would ask that question when speakers
 
00:50:24.799 --> 00:50:26.030 align:start position:0%
would ask that question when speakers
begin

00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
begin
 
00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank
 
00:50:41.549 --> 00:50:41.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:45.829 --> 00:50:45.839 align:start position:0%
bar you could raise your hand if you're
 
00:50:45.839 --> 00:50:51.789 align:start position:0%
bar you could raise your hand if you're
in

00:50:51.789 --> 00:50:51.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:54.270 --> 00:50:54.280 align:start position:0%
attendance I do not see Miss Barrett
 
00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
will come back to her
 
00:51:00.069 --> 00:51:00.079 align:start position:0%
next person is David
 
00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hello can you hear me we can
 
00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:14.200 align:start position:0%
Mr sad thank you um my name is David sad
 
00:51:16.589 --> 00:51:16.599 align:start position:0%
I live in rumney New Hampshire I am
 
00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
president of right to know New
 
00:51:21.789 --> 00:51:21.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh currently the way the law
 
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
is written uh it allows all discussions
 
00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
um of negotiations to be done in what's
 
00:51:31.390 --> 00:51:31.400 align:start position:0%
called a non- meeting and per the right
 
00:51:33.789 --> 00:51:33.799 align:start position:0%
to no law uh a non- meeting does not
 
00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
require notice be given minutes be
 
00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:39.640 align:start position:0%
published or in any way inform the
 
00:51:41.789 --> 00:51:41.799 align:start position:0%
public about the collective bargaining
 
00:51:44.309 --> 00:51:44.319 align:start position:0%
negotiations so the whole process is
 
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
essentially done in secret um the
 
00:51:51.549 --> 00:51:51.559 align:start position:0%
previous testimony has outlined a lot of
 
00:51:55.789 --> 00:51:55.799 align:start position:0%
reasons why um it should at least is far
 
00:51:58.910 --> 00:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
as the negotiations part of it be no
 
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
longer considered a non- meeting and
 
00:52:04.109 --> 00:52:04.119 align:start position:0%
instead be made part of a public meeting
 
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
um and I won't rehash U those points um
 
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
I would like to put emphasis on the fact
 
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
that when public bodies and unions meet
 
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
to negotiate a collective bargaining
 
00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
agreement the people in the room and not
 
00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:22.920 align:start position:0%
representing themselves the public body
 
00:52:25.309 --> 00:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
is representing the taxpayers and they
 
00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:27.640 align:start position:0%
Union is representing the union
 
00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:29.960 align:start position:0%
members however the taxpayers in the
 
00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
union members are not allowed to be
 
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
present during the
 
00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
negotiations so how does
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
either representative group know how
 
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
well their representatives performed on
 
00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:42.349 align:start position:0%
well their representatives performed on
their

00:52:42.349 --> 00:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:52:46.309 --> 00:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
behalf how much did each side give up
 
00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:48.760 align:start position:0%
and what did they get in return they
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
don't know but they should know uh
 
00:52:54.109 --> 00:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
transparency is
 
00:52:58.470 --> 00:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
required uh uh union members uh and
 
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers alike need to be able to
 
00:53:03.309 --> 00:53:03.319 align:start position:0%
determine how well their representatives
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
performed their
 
00:53:08.109 --> 00:53:08.119 align:start position:0%
duties only those not working to provide
 
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
full benefit to their respective group
 
00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
would feel threatened by having
 
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
negotiations open to public scrutiny the
 
00:53:17.589 --> 00:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
idea that negotiations must be done in
 
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
secret to save face or to somehow give
 
00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:24.200 align:start position:0%
people the ability to speak freely in my
 
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:26.200 align:start position:0%
opinion is just a smoke screen excuse
 
00:53:28.990 --> 00:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
for saying I won't be able to justify to
 
00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
the people I represent the positions I
 
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
took during the
 
00:53:37.109 --> 00:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
negotiations um so I
 
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
think the there there's going to be a
 
00:53:43.109 --> 00:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
lot of uh testimony both for and against
 
00:53:48.990 --> 00:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
this bill um but I believe that there's
 
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.349 align:start position:0%
this bill um but I believe that there's
a

00:53:50.349 --> 00:53:50.359 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:53:53.069 --> 00:53:53.079 align:start position:0%
balancing test that that that should
 
00:53:55.789 --> 00:53:55.799 align:start position:0%
take place similar to when people are
 
00:53:58.670 --> 00:53:58.680 align:start position:0%
asking for records and and information
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
that some want to keep uh uh private in
 
00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
in and away from public scrutiny and
 
00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
that is you have to look at the overall
 
00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:11.000 align:start position:0%
benefit because there are arguments to
 
00:54:14.309 --> 00:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
be made on both sides and you can take
 
00:54:16.910 --> 00:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
um depending upon your position you can
 
00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:18.599 align:start position:0%
agree with both
 
00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
sides but in the end you you have a
 
00:54:24.789 --> 00:54:24.799 align:start position:0%
choice is it public or is it not public
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
and I think when you balance both
 
00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:31.720 align:start position:0%
sides uh you'll find that there's a
 
00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
greater uh benefit to the public and the
 
00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:41.240 align:start position:0%
taxpayers by having it in uh the public
 
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
sad if you could just finish up I would
 
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate yeah then having it remain uh
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
secret uh thank you very much and I'll
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
represent Horgan do you have a
 
00:54:56.670 --> 00:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
question you need to unmute again might
 
00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:01.480 align:start position:0%
be useful um yes Mr sad um of course
 
00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
these um the terms of the contract are
 
00:55:08.789 --> 00:55:08.799 align:start position:0%
eventually made public so why why do we
 
00:55:11.069 --> 00:55:11.079 align:start position:0%
need to change make this small change to
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
the law when there is already the
 
00:55:15.030 --> 00:55:15.040 align:start position:0%
Safeguard the fact that officials you
 
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
know either uh Union negotiators who
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
negotiate bad contracts will probably
 
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
pretty can be fired by their membership
 
00:55:26.029 --> 00:55:26.039 align:start position:0%
since these organizations are uh those
 
00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
organizations are generally pretty small
 
00:55:30.029 --> 00:55:30.039 align:start position:0%
deed Democratic and also even it's a
 
00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:31.480 align:start position:0%
little bit harder with the public bodies
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
but they're all appointed or elected for
 
00:55:39.309 --> 00:55:39.319 align:start position:0%
uh limited terms so like why what why
 
00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
why do we need this remedy in addition
 
00:55:42.510 --> 00:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
to the obvious remedy that somebody
 
00:55:44.789 --> 00:55:44.799 align:start position:0%
negotiates a really bad contract can be
 
00:55:47.029 --> 00:55:47.039 align:start position:0%
uh costed out of either the public body
 
00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
or the union negotiating committee as
 
00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
the case may
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
be well a lot of Times Union contracts
 
00:55:55.589 --> 00:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
of course their obligation and many
 
00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
times those obligations span multiple
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
Years and we're talking also significant
 
00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
amounts of money uh so by the time the
 
00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
taxpayers find out yes they can vote the
 
00:56:07.589 --> 00:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
public officials out of office that they
 
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
felt did a poor job but long after the
 
00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:12.799 align:start position:0%
public officials are gone the
 
00:56:14.270 --> 00:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
obligations they've committed their
 
00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to remain and so I think it's
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
more important that the taxpayers be
 
00:56:21.549 --> 00:56:21.559 align:start position:0%
involved earli in the process so they
 
00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
can stop the check from getting written
 
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
in the first place as a opposed to
 
00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
living with the payments and the tax
 
00:56:31.349 --> 00:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
obligations for many many years okay all
 
00:56:31.359 --> 00:56:32.789 align:start position:0%
obligations for many many years okay all
right

00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:32.799 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
thanks uh are there any other questions
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%

morning as a longtime representative of

Labor I am intimately familiar with the
 
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining process and have
 
00:57:48.349 --> 00:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
been a part of many contract
 
00:57:50.789 --> 00:57:50.799 align:start position:0%
negotiations throughout my career the
 
00:57:52.589 --> 00:57:52.599 align:start position:0%
intent of collective bargaining is to
 
00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
create a har harmonious working

relationship ship between labor and
 
00:57:58.109 --> 00:57:58.119 align:start position:0%
management and to identify the interests
 
00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:00.200 align:start position:0%
and expectations of all parties in order
 
00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
to reach fair and Equitable
 
00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
resolutions it is difficult to
 
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
understand what the true intent of hb26
 
00:58:09.870 --> 00:58:09.880 align:start position:0%
is on its surface it would appear that
 
00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:11.440 align:start position:0%
the intent is to make the collective
 
00:58:13.349 --> 00:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
bargaining process more
 
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
transparent however the current
 
00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
mechanisms in place already allow for
 
00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.190 align:start position:0%
mechanisms in place already allow for
full

00:58:18.190 --> 00:58:18.200 align:start position:0%
full
 
00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:20.720 align:start position:0%
transparency currently in New Hampshire
 
00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
cities and towns are required to provide
 
00:58:25.230 --> 00:58:25.240 align:start position:0%
details surrounding all public employees
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
negotiations prior to any vote on the
 
00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
matter in sb2 towns this means a town
 
00:58:32.430 --> 00:58:32.440 align:start position:0%
meeting consisting of a deliberative
 
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
session which calls for explanation
 
00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
discussion debate and amendments to a
 
00:58:40.549 --> 00:58:40.559 align:start position:0%
pro a proposed contract followed by a
 
00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
voting session where the voters have an
 
00:58:44.589 --> 00:58:44.599 align:start position:0%
opportunity to make the final decision
 
00:58:48.589 --> 00:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
on said contract in non sb2 towns there
 
00:58:50.789 --> 00:58:50.799 align:start position:0%
is a public session where the details of
 
00:58:53.109 --> 00:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
a contract are shared and the public has
 
00:58:54.750 --> 00:58:54.760 align:start position:0%
afforded the opportunity and a public
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
hearing to weigh in this is a process
 
00:58:59.390 --> 00:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
that has been successful for many years
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
which leads me to believe that if
 
00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:02.799 align:start position:0%
transparency is the true intent of this
 
00:59:04.990 --> 00:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
bill we are searching for a solution to
 
00:59:07.470 --> 00:59:07.480 align:start position:0%
a problem that doesn't exist the
 
00:59:09.309 --> 00:59:09.319 align:start position:0%
suggestion that the public does not have
 
00:59:11.789 --> 00:59:11.799 align:start position:0%
input on this process prior to receiving
 
00:59:14.270 --> 00:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
their tax bill is simply misleading to
 
00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
the members of this this
 
00:59:18.190 --> 00:59:18.200 align:start position:0%
committee what seems more likely is that
 
00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill is to dilute the
 
00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining process in an
 
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
attempt to stall negotiations and make
 
00:59:26.029 --> 00:59:26.039 align:start position:0%
it more difficult to reach fair and
 
00:59:26.039 --> 00:59:27.150 align:start position:0%
it more difficult to reach fair and
Equitable

00:59:27.150 --> 00:59:27.160 align:start position:0%
Equitable
 
00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
agreements this not only damages the
 
00:59:31.190 --> 00:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
Integrity of collective bargaining but
 
00:59:33.510 --> 00:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
it is disingenuous to the New Hampshire
 
00:59:35.589 --> 00:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
taxpayer negotiations are meant to
 
00:59:37.230 --> 00:59:37.240 align:start position:0%
resolve issues in a way that both
 
00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:39.319 align:start position:0%
parties find acceptable and to do this
 
00:59:41.789 --> 00:59:41.799 align:start position:0%
in a way that is Swift and efficient by
 
00:59:43.109 --> 00:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
creating an environment where there is
 
00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:45.480 align:start position:0%
an audience during negotiations neither
 
00:59:46.950 --> 00:59:46.960 align:start position:0%
side will feel comfortable speaking
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
candidly on an issue and worse you will
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
encourage grandstanding and the sharing
 
00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:54.440 align:start position:0%
of exaggerated or misleading information
 
00:59:56.710 --> 00:59:56.720 align:start position:0%
that that uh is intended to earn public
 
00:59:59.630 --> 00:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
support this delays a timely resolution
 
01:00:01.549 --> 01:00:01.559 align:start position:0%
which translates to additional costs to
 
01:00:04.109 --> 01:00:04.119 align:start position:0%
the public the result of passing this
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
bill is really quite simple in spite of
 
01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
its likely intended effect it does not
 
01:00:11.549 --> 01:00:11.559 align:start position:0%
negatively impact any party involved in
 
01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
the collective bargaining process the
 
01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence of this bill will
 
01:00:18.309 --> 01:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
be an increased cost to the New
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayer by drawing out an
 
01:00:23.309 --> 01:00:23.319 align:start position:0%
already extensive process this is not a
 
01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
quote unquote fear grenade this is Mr if
 
01:00:28.829 --> 01:00:28.839 align:start position:0%

01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
respectfully asked this committee to
 
01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:34.230 align:start position:0%
respectfully asked this committee to
oppose

thank you Mr real for taking my question
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
um that last part you um mentioned that
 
01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
it's an increased cost for taxpayers I'm
 
01:00:58.950 --> 01:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
just wondering the bill doesn't have a
 
01:01:00.309 --> 01:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal note I'm wondering if you can
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
kind of um explain that a little more
 
01:01:06.270 --> 01:01:06.280 align:start position:0%
for me yes thank you for your questions
 
01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative um The increased cost
 
01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:12.079 align:start position:0%
that I'm referring to uh obviously uh
 
01:01:14.829 --> 01:01:14.839 align:start position:0%
City and town negotiators um are
 
01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
compensated for their time and efforts
 
01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:19.119 align:start position:0%
in the collective bargaining process uh
 
01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:20.920 align:start position:0%
as our Union officials when they're
 
01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
brought to the table um to negotiate a
 
01:01:26.029 --> 01:01:26.039 align:start position:0%
contract for those that they represent
 
01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
uh the the longer we extend out this
 
01:01:31.029 --> 01:01:31.039 align:start position:0%
process um the more compensation this
 
01:01:34.390 --> 01:01:34.400 align:start position:0%
means for those members additionally uh
 
01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
it does not allow for uh municipalities
 
01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
to um move forward with the negotiating
 
01:01:44.069 --> 01:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
process which uh could potentially lead
 
01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
to decreased costs for uh health
 
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
insurance for instance so um both sides
 
01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
want to reach an agreement because both
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
sides uh want fair and equitable
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
results um and uh that that means from
 
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
the municipalities perspective when they
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
are negotiating they're looking for
 
01:02:04.950 --> 01:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
decreased costs whether it's health
 
01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:08.200 align:start position:0%
insurance or other benefits and the
 
01:02:09.910 --> 01:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
longer we extend this process the less
 
01:02:12.269 --> 01:02:12.279 align:start position:0%
likely they're able to do
 
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
that um thank you you any other
 
01:02:17.470 --> 01:02:17.480 align:start position:0%
questions from Mr
 
01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
real seeing none thank you for your
 
01:02:22.349 --> 01:02:22.359 align:start position:0%

01:02:42.069 --> 01:02:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:45.400 align:start position:0%
yes hello Mr beton Court good morning
 
01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
I'm Don beton cour from snipe I'm a New

budget advisory committee a few years
 
01:02:56.549 --> 01:02:56.559 align:start position:0%
ago ago I believe that requiring
 
01:02:58.910 --> 01:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
transparency and negotiations with sunap
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
teachers union is the only way to avoid
 
01:03:02.789 --> 01:03:02.799 align:start position:0%
closing some or all of sunap public
 
01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
schools in the near future according to
 
01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire doe sunap already has the
 
01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:09.160 align:start position:0%
highest cost per pupil for districts

01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
these outrageous cost levels after two
 
01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:35.200 align:start position:0%
decades of declining enrollment coupled
 
01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:37.119 align:start position:0%

addressed it only when pressured six
 
01:04:15.789 --> 01:04:15.799 align:start position:0%
months later in September the chair
 
01:04:17.309 --> 01:04:17.319 align:start position:0%
claimed to be reading a statement

verbatim from the board's attorney
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%

voters signed a petition warrant article
 
01:04:41.230 --> 01:04:41.240 align:start position:0%
for the March ballot it began by
 
01:04:44.829 --> 01:04:44.839 align:start position:0%
repeating the 2018 wording the 65% yes
 
01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
result and the board's choice to ignore
 
01:04:49.829 --> 01:04:49.839 align:start position:0%
it and negotiate in secret it then asked
 
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
should the sunap school board request
 
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
that the upcoming teachers contract
 
01:04:55.710 --> 01:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
negoti iations be conducted in public
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
session and if the teachers union
 
01:04:59.470 --> 01:04:59.480 align:start position:0%
refuses to negotiate in public session
 
01:05:01.829 --> 01:05:01.839 align:start position:0%
then negotiations will not occur and the
 
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
current contract will continue in place
 
01:05:05.870 --> 01:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
until a transparent negotiation process
 
01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
can be mutually agreed upon at Senate
 
01:05:10.269 --> 01:05:10.279 align:start position:0%
pce February 1st school deliberative
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
session the teachers union demanded that
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
the above wording be entirely deleted
 
01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
and the article amended to read should
 
01:05:18.670 --> 01:05:18.680 align:start position:0%
the Senate School Board conduct
 
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
negotiations with the sun Teachers
 
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
Association in a manner consistent with
 
01:05:26.269 --> 01:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
the law including but limited RSA 273a
 
01:05:27.390 --> 01:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
and RSA
 
01:05:29.870 --> 01:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
91a the school moderator ruled that the
 
01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
amendment to be was out of order because
 
01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
it changed the subject of the petitioned
 
01:05:35.870 --> 01:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
article but the angry mob attending in
 
01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:37.640 align:start position:0%
person overruled the moderator this
 
01:05:39.349 --> 01:05:39.359 align:start position:0%
meaningless one- sentence question will
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
appear on the ballot the teachers union
 
01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:43.240 align:start position:0%
successfully eliminated the voter's
 
01:05:46.349 --> 01:05:46.359 align:start position:0%
option to vote on op for open NE
 
01:05:48.630 --> 01:05:48.640 align:start position:0%
negotiations I encourage you to pass HP
 
01:05:50.430 --> 01:05:50.440 align:start position:0%
206 so that voters will be able to
 
01:05:52.589 --> 01:05:52.599 align:start position:0%
observe how school boards deal with this
 
01:05:55.069 --> 01:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
type of teachers union bull in during
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
contract negotiations thank you thank
 
01:05:59.309 --> 01:05:59.319 align:start position:0%

01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:01.799 align:start position:0%

Court thank you for staying in your
three

01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.150 align:start position:0%
 
GRS

01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:27.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:28.589 --> 01:06:28.599 align:start position:0%
Grace could you raise your hand if
 
01:06:34.349 --> 01:06:34.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:37.150 --> 01:06:37.160 align:start position:0%
there thank
 
01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair my name is n gra
 
01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
I represent the New Hampshire Municipal
 
01:06:45.269 --> 01:06:45.279 align:start position:0%
Association um I don't want to be
 
01:06:48.029 --> 01:06:48.039 align:start position:0%
needlessly duplicative so I will just
 
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
state that attorney Bolton and Captain R
 
01:06:54.150 --> 01:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
summarized much of what I wanted to say
 
01:06:57.069 --> 01:06:57.079 align:start position:0%
uh in their testimony the only things I
 
01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:01.799 align:start position:0%
will add um is that from our our
 
01:07:04.990 --> 01:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
perspective you know we work with all
 
01:07:07.829 --> 01:07:07.839 align:start position:0%
234 cities and towns in New Hampshire
 
01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
and we know that uh from experience that
 
01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
when Public Employee compensation is
 
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
being debated it's often the employees
 
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
who fill the room at town meeting and we
 
01:07:23.269 --> 01:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
imagine the same thing would happen if
 
01:07:26.829 --> 01:07:26.839 align:start position:0%
negotiation would be open to the public
 
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
um even if it's the case that it would
 
01:07:30.990 --> 01:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
be ordinary towns people it would
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
certainly be the the most uh interested
 
01:07:36.670 --> 01:07:36.680 align:start position:0%
in the negotiations and the problem with
 
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
that is as those two prior uh speakers
 
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
stated is it makes it very performative
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
you know each side is trying
 
01:07:48.510 --> 01:07:48.520 align:start position:0%
to continue to gather the support from
 
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
their members and the people they think
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
support them and so they're less likely
 
01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
to come to a compromise romise and
 
01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
obviously the entire purpose of the
 
01:07:58.670 --> 01:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
negotiation is to come to a compromise
 
01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:01.640 align:start position:0%
in a setting where that's
 
01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
feasible uh one of the other concerns
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
that we would have is because this would
 
01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
remove the negotiation session from a
 
01:08:16.269 --> 01:08:16.279 align:start position:0%
the non- meeting status there are a
 
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
couple things that may happen here the
 
01:08:20.590 --> 01:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
first is that uh you'd have this
 
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
constant back and forth uh where the
 
01:08:26.349 --> 01:08:26.359 align:start position:0%
public body would have to open or en
 
01:08:30.030 --> 01:08:30.040 align:start position:0%
close uh you know the session um they
 
01:08:32.669 --> 01:08:32.679 align:start position:0%
need to adjourn in order to to go to
 
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
their caucus I.E their strategy session
 
01:08:37.749 --> 01:08:37.759 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
reconvene and there would obviously be
 
01:08:41.470 --> 01:08:41.480 align:start position:0%
some sort
 
01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
of there would obviously be difficulties
 
01:08:48.149 --> 01:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
um as as they try to do this and also do
 
01:08:49.950 --> 01:08:49.960 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
negotiation um the other thing is is
 
01:08:55.070 --> 01:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
it's possible that
 
01:08:58.030 --> 01:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
by changing the law and the way that
 
01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
this bill proposes um you would have
 
01:09:03.309 --> 01:09:03.319 align:start position:0%
more instances of negotiation between
 
01:09:05.149 --> 01:09:05.159 align:start position:0%
one select board member or one School
 
01:09:08.349 --> 01:09:08.359 align:start position:0%
Board member and you know the the school
 
01:09:10.990 --> 01:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
attorney or select board attorney and
 
01:09:13.669 --> 01:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
you know the whoever the administrator
 
01:09:15.630 --> 01:09:15.640 align:start position:0%
is so the Town Administrator or town
 
01:09:18.910 --> 01:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
manager and um School Board
 
01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
superintendent with the union and
 
01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
obviously you can't have a
 
01:09:28.669 --> 01:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
a board of one so again these instances
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
would not be subject to the right to no
 
01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
law at all and you'd have the same issue
 
01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
essentially that this uh that this bill
 
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
is trying to do away with and it would
 
01:09:42.789 --> 01:09:42.799 align:start position:0%
just shift the way in which these these
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
things occur and exclude more members of
 
01:09:47.749 --> 01:09:47.759 align:start position:0%
the public body from the negotiation
 
01:09:49.950 --> 01:09:49.960 align:start position:0%
process R if you could finish up it
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
would be appreciated I'm finished Mr
 
01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
chair are there any questions for Mr
 
01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
Grays yes representative Horgan um yes
 
01:10:03.709 --> 01:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
one of the I mean one of the one of the
 
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
differences between the employee side
 
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
and the public body side is the
 
01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
employer's livelihood is at stake so but
 
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
so de
 
01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
members do de member municipalities find
 
01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
that it's uh significantly harder to
 
01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
retain and retain public employees and
 
01:10:23.229 --> 01:10:23.239 align:start position:0%
hire new ones when you have relatively
 
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
generous compensation package as opposed
 
01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
to those who are doing what the
 
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
proponents bills want to do who
 
01:10:32.910 --> 01:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
um certainly I imagine that uh
 
01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
individual employees are more likely to
 
01:10:40.510 --> 01:10:40.520 align:start position:0%
stay with employers who pay them more
 
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
than other employers and to seek out
 
01:10:42.719 --> 01:10:43.910 align:start position:0%
than other employers and to seek out
those

01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%

Barrett Christina has submitted written
 
01:12:57.070 --> 01:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
testimony to the full committee I know
 
01:12:58.830 --> 01:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
you had been looking for him earlier but
 
01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
he's been pulled away unexpectedly so I
 
01:13:02.709 --> 01:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure that the
 
01:13:04.270 --> 01:13:04.280 align:start position:0%
members of the committee were in receipt
 
01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
of that testimony um and if not you will
 
01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
be getting it shortly I just wanted to
 
01:13:11.310 --> 01:13:11.320 align:start position:0%
make sure you weren't looking for him
 
01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily okay thank you very much
 
01:13:18.870 --> 01:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
day thank you and the last person to
 
01:13:26.709 --> 01:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:29.709 --> 01:13:29.719 align:start position:0%
hello Mr Durkin hello Mr chairman thank
 
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
you very much uh again for the record
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
Jim Durkin here on behalf of 4,000 New
 
01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire ask me Council 93 members and
 
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
before I begin I I just want to note
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
that the gentleman who sponsored this
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
legislation quoted extensively from our
 
01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
Union's testimony against his bill in
 
01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
the last session and while we're uh
 
01:13:48.629 --> 01:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
delighted we made such a strong
 
01:13:50.629 --> 01:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
impression I I must point out for the
 
01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
record that the remarks he quoted were
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
in fact delivered by by me not John kooy
 
01:13:58.149 --> 01:13:58.159 align:start position:0%
as he repeatedly stated uh never
 
01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
nevertheless we stand behind those
 
01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
remarks and we're here to restate a lot
 
01:14:04.070 --> 01:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
of them today look I spent a great deal
 
01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
of time talking to ask me leaders and
 
01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
staff who spend a considerable amount of
 
01:14:09.629 --> 01:14:09.639 align:start position:0%
time at the negotiating table and I've
 
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
also spoken in confidence to the people
 
01:14:13.629 --> 01:14:13.639 align:start position:0%
who sit at the other side of the table
 
01:14:15.070 --> 01:14:15.080 align:start position:0%
and suffice to say this is one of those
 
01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
rare instances where both management and
 
01:14:19.470 --> 01:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
labor are an agreement the overwhelming
 
01:14:21.390 --> 01:14:21.400 align:start position:0%
consensus is this legislation if
 
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
approved would have a chilling and
 
01:14:25.270 --> 01:14:25.280 align:start position:0%
detrimental impact on the negotiation
 
01:14:27.709 --> 01:14:27.719 align:start position:0%
process and moreover both sides believe
 
01:14:29.430 --> 01:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
it would unnecessarily lengthen the
 
01:14:31.030 --> 01:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining process and any
 
01:14:33.270 --> 01:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
agreement that might be reached would
 
01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
ultimately be less beneficial to both
 
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
sides and and look we can see why this
 
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
might be difficult to understand for
 
01:14:40.390 --> 01:14:40.400 align:start position:0%
people who haven't been part of a
 
01:14:42.709 --> 01:14:42.719 align:start position:0%
contract negotiation session and for
 
01:14:44.510 --> 01:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
those who have experience in the arena
 
01:14:46.229 --> 01:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
the reasons for opposing public
 
01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
negotiations are are almost intuitive
 
01:14:51.310 --> 01:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
but let me try to articulate a few uh
 
01:14:52.830 --> 01:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
despite what the bill sponsor said
 
01:14:55.229 --> 01:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
negoti iations particularly prolonged
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
negotiations are often heated and there
 
01:15:00.669 --> 01:15:00.679 align:start position:0%
is a great deal of Spirited debate but
 
01:15:02.510 --> 01:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
people say what needs to be said and
 
01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
they do so because they're uninhibited
 
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
and know they're working with and
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
against people who understand this is an
 
01:15:10.629 --> 01:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
important part of the process opening
 
01:15:12.669 --> 01:15:12.679 align:start position:0%
negotiations to the public would stifle
 
01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
this type of give and take and curb our
 
01:15:16.149 --> 01:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
ability to reach a resolution in a
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
timely fashion if at all and you know
 
01:15:21.070 --> 01:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
another more concrete drawback would be
 
01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
this the strong reluctance for either
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
party to raise specific personal
 
01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
examples that might be driving a
 
01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
discussion uh one side might want to
 
01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
propose a new sick leave time policy
 
01:15:32.590 --> 01:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
that was driven by health conditions of
 
01:15:34.990 --> 01:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
a specific employee and in order to be
 
01:15:36.990 --> 01:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
able to effectively advocate for that
 
01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
policy one would want to be able to
 
01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
discuss the situation or situations
 
01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
driving that proposal and and that would
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
be extremely difficult if not impossible
 
01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
without revealing even a bit of
 
01:15:48.750 --> 01:15:48.760 align:start position:0%
information that could ultimately lead
 
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
to someone's privacy being violated in a
 
01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
in a public forum which in turn could
 
01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
lead to Legal AC action and the same
 
01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
could be said for discussions focused on
 
01:15:58.590 --> 01:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
disciplinary procedures but it might be
 
01:16:00.510 --> 01:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
these very specific examples that need
 
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
to be raised in order to have an
 
01:16:03.669 --> 01:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
effective discussion that will lead to a
 
01:16:05.629 --> 01:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
binding agreement these are just a
 
01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
couple of examples but suffice to say a
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
significant portion of the the process
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
is driven by prior disputes between both
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
parties and in order for productive
 
01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
negotiations to continue both parties
 
01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
need to be able to discuss these
 
01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
disputes openly and frankly without fear
 
01:16:23.189 --> 01:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
in closing look if committee members
 
01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
looking simply to safeguard the interest
 
01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
of the taxpayers through this
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
legislation I would point out what has
 
01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
already been stated there are various
 
01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
laws and processes in place that provide
 
01:16:34.629 --> 01:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer with ultimate approval over
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
contracts that are negotiated and
 
01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
finally of course as you all know
 
01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers have a say at the voting booth
 
01:16:42.510 --> 01:16:42.520 align:start position:0%
they have the ability to elect their
 
01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
leaders and Empower these individuals to
 
01:16:46.709 --> 01:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
negotiate on their behalf it's a system
 
01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
that's worked well and continues to work
 
01:16:50.430 --> 01:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
well and I thank you for your time and
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
and and getting me into
 
01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:53.709 align:start position:0%
and and getting me into
testify

01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:53.719 align:start position:0%
testify
 
01:16:56.189 --> 01:16:56.199 align:start position:0%
any questions for Mr
 
01:16:59.149 --> 01:16:59.159 align:start position:0%

01:17:02.030 --> 01:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
for your testimony today thank you sir I
 
01:17:05.229 --> 01:17:05.239 align:start position:0%
see no I see no other hands up and we're
 
01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
we and I just note for the record that
 
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
there were 22 people who signed up in
 
01:17:23.669 --> 01:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
support of the bill and 14 people who
 
01:17:27.550 --> 01:17:27.560 align:start position:0%
signed up in opposition to the
 
01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:30.550 align:start position:0%
signed up in opposition to the
bill

01:17:30.550 --> 01:17:30.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:17:34.510 --> 01:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
and we'll I think we'll move on to House
 
01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:37.950 align:start position:0%
and we'll I think we'll move on to House
Bill

01:17:37.950 --> 01:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
216 there are just five people who have
 
01:17:43.030 --> 01:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak on
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
216 but given our time constraints we
 
01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
limit the testimony to three minutes
 
01:17:51.149 --> 01:17:51.159 align:start position:0%
this morning as we have on the other
 
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
Bill House Bill 3 16 is relative to
 
01:17:56.430 --> 01:17:56.440 align:start position:0%
public notice of and access to meetings
 
01:17:59.350 --> 01:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
under the right to no law primary
 
01:18:02.030 --> 01:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
sponsor is representative Weber and is
 
01:18:08.110 --> 01:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:10.950 --> 01:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
tesy if you are if you could raise your
 
01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:18.030 --> 01:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
be yes thank
 
01:18:21.189 --> 01:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
you good morning representative Weber
 
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman and committee
 
01:18:25.950 --> 01:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
members I uh for the record my name is
 
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
Lucy Weber I represent cheser o district
 
01:18:32.110 --> 01:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
one the Connecticut River towns of
 
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
Hinsdale Chesterfield West merland and
 
01:18:37.390 --> 01:18:37.400 align:start position:0%
Walpole and I spent my first three terms
 
01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
on this committee so it's good to be
 
01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
home um the bill today simply allows the
 
01:18:48.430 --> 01:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
provisions of the governor's emergency
 
01:18:51.390 --> 01:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
orders regarding remote meetings to
 
01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
survive the pandemic and continue on uh
 
01:18:58.229 --> 01:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
so that uh public bodies can use them
 
01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
and operate under them once the state of
 
01:19:03.669 --> 01:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
emergency has been lifted so in that
 
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
they will be very familiar to you
 
01:19:07.870 --> 01:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
because they're the rules essentially
 
01:19:10.990 --> 01:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
that we have all been operating under um
 
01:19:13.149 --> 01:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
I have two motivations for bringing this
 
01:19:16.149 --> 01:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
one is that uh various select board
 
01:19:19.110 --> 01:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
members have been heard to say that they
 
01:19:21.229 --> 01:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
really would like to be able to continue
 
01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
to operate remotely or in a hybrid form
 
01:19:26.350 --> 01:19:26.360 align:start position:0%
after the
 
01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
pandemic um and uh secondly I had the
 
01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
experience of chairing the house Health
 
01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
and Human Services oversight committee
 
01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
which meets on a Friday and has never in
 
01:19:42.629 --> 01:19:42.639 align:start position:0%
person uh when I was there had more than
 
01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
the members of the committee uh the
 
01:19:46.510 --> 01:19:46.520 align:start position:0%
members of the department who were
 
01:19:49.270 --> 01:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
coming to testify in front of us and
 
01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
possibly one or two members of the
 
01:19:55.510 --> 01:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
legisl or the public there uh but
 
01:19:59.430 --> 01:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
certainly not more uh but after these
 
01:20:02.110 --> 01:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
Provisions went in I realized that I had
 
01:20:06.229 --> 01:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
31 participants available and several of
 
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
them uh contacted me afterward about
 
01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
issues that were raised during that
 
01:20:14.189 --> 01:20:14.199 align:start position:0%
meeting that were important to them uh
 
01:20:16.310 --> 01:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
and they were able to do so because they
 
01:20:18.669 --> 01:20:18.679 align:start position:0%
could participate uh listen in from
 
01:20:20.590 --> 01:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
their offices without having to take an
 
01:20:23.189 --> 01:20:23.199 align:start position:0%
entire half a day to get to ConEd and
 
01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
listened to the meeting so I I think
 
01:20:28.030 --> 01:20:28.040 align:start position:0%
that's healthy and I'd like to preserve
 
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
it so uh the goals of the bill are to
 
01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
promote greater access um by the public
 
01:20:37.910 --> 01:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
and greater participation by the public
 
01:20:39.790 --> 01:20:39.800 align:start position:0%
when participation is
 
01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate um greater ease and access
 
01:20:45.070 --> 01:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
of participation by members of the
 
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
public body um and that would allow more
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
people the option to participate uh in
 
01:20:53.550 --> 01:20:53.560 align:start position:0%
public dialogue
 
01:20:57.470 --> 01:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
and um my intent also was to make the
 
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
bill permissive rather than mandatory
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
because my goal is to make things easier
 
01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
on a public body not harder and so I
 
01:21:10.629 --> 01:21:10.639 align:start position:0%
wanted each public body to be able to
 
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
determine what conditions and situations
 
01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
worked best for that body um so I I
 
01:21:21.550 --> 01:21:21.560 align:start position:0%
really truly wanted each body to be able
 
01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:23.800 align:start position:0%
to choose what fits for them
 
01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh I have had some discussion from with
 
01:21:27.430 --> 01:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
Mr Grace from the New Hampshire
 
01:21:29.910 --> 01:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association and I understand
 
01:21:32.070 --> 01:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
that he has an amendment that he will be
 
01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
submitting oh and I'm sorry I forgot to
 
01:21:35.870 --> 01:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
state that I don't have written
 
01:21:38.030 --> 01:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
testimony but
 
01:21:38.040 --> 01:21:39.750 align:start position:0%
testimony but
um

01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
the with respect to Mr Gray's amendment
 
01:21:47.229 --> 01:21:47.239 align:start position:0%
I wrote the Bill so that if remote
 
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
testimony or remote participation was
 
01:21:52.629 --> 01:21:52.639 align:start position:0%
offered to a board member it also had to
 
01:21:55.709 --> 01:21:55.719 align:start position:0%
to be offered to members of the public
 
01:21:58.310 --> 01:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
so because that just seemed to me to be
 
01:22:03.709 --> 01:22:03.719 align:start position:0%
fair uh but Mr Grace has some um
 
01:22:07.390 --> 01:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
realistic and important concerns about
 
01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:08.350 align:start position:0%
realistic and important concerns about
uh

01:22:08.350 --> 01:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:22:11.390 --> 01:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
connectivity Broadband access all kinds
 
01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
of issues for boards and so I think his
 
01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
um Amendment says that if there is a a
 
01:22:22.910 --> 01:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
physical location for the meeting they
 
01:22:26.110 --> 01:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
do not have to offer the other type of
 
01:22:28.750 --> 01:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
public access and I will just say that I
 
01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
will leave that entirely up to the
 
01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
wisdom of the committee uh I am open to
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
any amendment that um helps us move this
 
01:22:38.750 --> 01:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
legislation forward and I thank you for
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%

antram Hillsboro and Windsor and I'm

here in support um of this bill um I'm
 
01:23:20.270 --> 01:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
married to the chair of the local
 
01:23:23.830 --> 01:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
planning board and since probably around
 
01:23:26.110 --> 01:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
um the end of April planning board
 
01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
meetings have been being held in our
 
01:23:30.669 --> 01:23:30.679 align:start position:0%
home office um and it's been quite an
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
experience um it took a while for them
 
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
to establish a system and for all of
 
01:23:37.470 --> 01:23:37.480 align:start position:0%
them to feel comfortable but now sitting
 
01:23:38.790 --> 01:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
there with him I can hear that the
 
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
meetings move move smoothly some of the
 
01:23:43.510 --> 01:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
benefits that representative Weber
 
01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned in her testimony I've seen
 
01:23:49.310 --> 01:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
firsthand um it would be L they would be
 
01:23:50.590 --> 01:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
lucky the planning board would be lucky
 
01:23:52.590 --> 01:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
to have two or three members of the the
 
01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
public in attendance at their meetings
 
01:23:57.189 --> 01:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
when they were in a public um building
 
01:23:59.750 --> 01:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
but now they the list is quite long this
 
01:24:02.910 --> 01:24:02.920 align:start position:0%
is increased um civic participation here
 
01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
in Hillsboro and it has kept people up
 
01:24:06.830 --> 01:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
to dat on issues that they're concerned
 
01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
about being present at the meeting has
 
01:24:12.669 --> 01:24:12.679 align:start position:0%
helped that um they've not had to cancel
 
01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
a meeting for bad weather um which
 
01:24:16.790 --> 01:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
causes a problem as you know in we
 
01:24:19.790 --> 01:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
scheduling um it's helpful for elderly
 
01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
people who don't get out much at night
 
01:24:24.270 --> 01:24:24.280 align:start position:0%
with their driving difficult and also
 
01:24:25.709 --> 01:24:25.719 align:start position:0%
for young families who might have to
 
01:24:27.750 --> 01:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
hire a babysitter if they were to go out
 
01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
to a meeting I just see that this
 
01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
process is a is a good one and I'd like
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
to see them be able to keep doing it um
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
when God help us this pandemic is over
 
01:24:40.990 --> 01:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
and we're back to more of a normal uh
 
01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
type of life so for those reasons I'll
 
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
I'm supporting the bill and I would be
 
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
glad to take questions and thank you
 
01:24:50.990 --> 01:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander do you have a
 
01:24:53.709 --> 01:24:53.719 align:start position:0%
question um I do Mr chair um thank you
 
01:24:54.990 --> 01:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
representative Porter for taking my
 
01:24:58.990 --> 01:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
question um I'm my question is around um
 
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
towns that have sb2 that are sb2 towns
 
01:25:03.510 --> 01:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
that have um Town deliberate session and
 
01:25:05.229 --> 01:25:05.239 align:start position:0%
town meetings how would this Bill affect
 
01:25:06.750 --> 01:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
that um would they be able to vote
 
01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
remotely um in those
 
01:25:10.990 --> 01:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
situations I don't know representative
 
01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
Alexander I don't know how that um HS
 
01:25:16.430 --> 01:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
through I I know our school district is
 
01:25:19.470 --> 01:25:19.480 align:start position:0%
sb2 and um they held their deliberative
 
01:25:21.990 --> 01:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
session in person in the gym at the high
 
01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:22.870 align:start position:0%
session in person in the gym at the high
school

01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
um so they didn't do a remote meeting at
 
01:25:26.310 --> 01:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
all and I don't think that this bill
 
01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:29.360 align:start position:0%
requires them to hold a remote meeting
 
01:25:31.109 --> 01:25:31.119 align:start position:0%
and the voting will be in March just
 
01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
like every other town meeting
 
01:25:36.629 --> 01:25:36.639 align:start position:0%
event any other questions for
 
01:25:36.639 --> 01:25:38.550 align:start position:0%
event any other questions for
representative

01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:25:41.149 --> 01:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
Porter seeing none thank you for your
 
01:25:46.430 --> 01:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:51.270 --> 01:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:54.830 align:start position:0%
 
sad

01:25:54.830 --> 01:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:58.709 --> 01:25:58.719 align:start position:0%
okay Mr sad yep can you hear me we
 
01:26:03.229 --> 01:26:03.239 align:start position:0%
can thank you uh my name is David sad I
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
live in rumney New Hampshire and I am
 
01:26:08.149 --> 01:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
president of right to know New Hampshire
 
01:26:11.430 --> 01:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
and right to know generally supports any
 
01:26:14.070 --> 01:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
effort to make meetings more open and
 
01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
transparent and the arguments mentioned
 
01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
earlier about greater civic
 
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
participation is something we welcome um
 
01:26:24.229 --> 01:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
however as the bill is currently written
 
01:26:26.990 --> 01:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to it and uh the reason
 
01:26:29.070 --> 01:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
for that is we feel this bill does not
 
01:26:31.950 --> 01:26:31.960 align:start position:0%
provide sufficient saf guards to ensure
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
the use of electronic meetings does not
 
01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
violate the Public's right to observe
 
01:26:38.350 --> 01:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
and listen contemporaneously to all
 
01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:39.790 align:start position:0%
and listen contemporaneously to all
public

01:26:39.790 --> 01:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:26:44.109 --> 01:26:44.119 align:start position:0%
meetings um we technology is is a very
 
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
good thing it uh Zoom meetings and other
 
01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
Technologies um are very beneficial but
 
01:26:54.070 --> 01:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
it is technology and and it can cause
 
01:26:56.470 --> 01:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
problems and it can also be used to
 
01:27:00.550 --> 01:27:00.560 align:start position:0%
subvert The public's U right to know we
 
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
would support uh this bill uh if it was
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
amended to address several
 
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
shortcomings uh that we feel exist uh
 
01:27:12.270 --> 01:27:12.280 align:start position:0%
number one we think meetings held
 
01:27:13.990 --> 01:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
electronically and without a physical
 
01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
location should only be allowed during
 
01:27:18.750 --> 01:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
emergencies or a state of
 
01:27:22.510 --> 01:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
emergency uh two if during the meeting a
 
01:27:24.750 --> 01:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
member of the public notifies the public
 
01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
body that there are problems with access
 
01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:30.400 align:start position:0%
those problems must be stated in the
 
01:27:32.950 --> 01:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
minutes and if it is verified that
 
01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
problems with access existed then all
 
01:27:37.830 --> 01:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
actions taken during that portion of the
 
01:27:39.709 --> 01:27:39.719 align:start position:0%
meeting should be null and
 
01:27:43.590 --> 01:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
void um and three if the mechanism of
 
01:27:45.550 --> 01:27:45.560 align:start position:0%
public access to the meeting is capable
 
01:27:48.669 --> 01:27:48.679 align:start position:0%
of recording the meeting at nominal cost
 
01:27:50.590 --> 01:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
then the public body shall record the
 
01:27:52.830 --> 01:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
meeting as a public record
 
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
the minutes for the meeting shall
 
01:27:56.430 --> 01:27:56.440 align:start position:0%
indicate that the meeting was recorded
 
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
and the recording is available to the
 
01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
public these changes are needed to
 
01:28:03.470 --> 01:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
address potential problems created by
 
01:28:04.990 --> 01:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
the use of various electronic
 
01:28:08.750 --> 01:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
Technologies when conducting meetings um
 
01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
and I'll give you a couple of examples
 
01:28:15.030 --> 01:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh in when you meet in public in a
 
01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:15.990 align:start position:0%
uh in when you meet in public in a
physical

01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
physical
 
01:28:20.669 --> 01:28:20.679 align:start position:0%
location um uh the you know technology
 
01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
isn't going to get in the way of that
 
01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
that individual um being able to
 
01:28:28.149 --> 01:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
contemporary contemporaneously uh
 
01:28:32.510 --> 01:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
observe the meeting uh technology uh
 
01:28:34.990 --> 01:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
problems can exist and this can be
 
01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
unintentional or intentional uh I've had
 
01:28:40.270 --> 01:28:40.280 align:start position:0%
people contact our group where they've
 
01:28:41.790 --> 01:28:41.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned they've attended a public
 
01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
meeting through zoom and they were put
 
01:28:47.950 --> 01:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
in a waiting room uh and they were kept
 
01:28:50.669 --> 01:28:50.679 align:start position:0%
in that waiting room till long after the
 
01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
public meeting had already started
 
01:28:55.270 --> 01:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
started um I had people contact us and
 
01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
tell us about a situation where uh they
 
01:29:03.790 --> 01:29:03.800 align:start position:0%
even though there was public input uh uh
 
01:29:06.669 --> 01:29:06.679 align:start position:0%
available uh the individual controlling
 
01:29:09.950 --> 01:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
muting and unmuting uh muted individuals
 
01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
uh inappropriately uh and these are just
 
01:29:14.510 --> 01:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
you know problems that exist with the
 
01:29:18.109 --> 01:29:18.119 align:start position:0%
technology so uh while we we look at
 
01:29:20.629 --> 01:29:20.639 align:start position:0%
this as a good thing uh when you look at
 
01:29:24.149 --> 01:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
all of the pausal uh positive scenarios
 
01:29:27.109 --> 01:29:27.119 align:start position:0%
I asked the commission to think about
 
01:29:30.390 --> 01:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
some of the problems that can exist with
 
01:29:32.990 --> 01:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh the technology and make sure that you
 
01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
amend this bill to address some of those
 
01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
problems for example uh comments and
 
01:29:43.430 --> 01:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
chat can take place Zoom as a technology
 
01:29:45.669 --> 01:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
allows there to be comments and chat is
 
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
those comments in chat that take place
 
01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
are those going to be public records and
 
01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
available for public disclosure
 
01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:00.189 --> 01:30:00.199 align:start position:0%
sad yeah uh and then um also you know
 
01:30:03.149 --> 01:30:03.159 align:start position:0%
lack of uh disability accommodations as
 
01:30:05.870 --> 01:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
well so those are some things that uh I
 
01:30:07.870 --> 01:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
hope you will consider in amending this
 
01:30:10.510 --> 01:30:10.520 align:start position:0%
bill I did provide written testimony
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
along with the suggested amended
 
01:30:15.310 --> 01:30:15.320 align:start position:0%
language that uh if adopted we would
 
01:30:19.310 --> 01:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
support thank you thank you Mr sad and
 
01:30:20.669 --> 01:30:20.679 align:start position:0%
representative Horan did you have a
 
01:30:24.390 --> 01:30:24.400 align:start position:0%
question oh sure yes my uh first
 
01:30:26.430 --> 01:30:26.440 align:start position:0%
question is um I know certainly this
 
01:30:28.030 --> 01:30:28.040 align:start position:0%
institution in the Hampshire house did
 
01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:29.149 align:start position:0%
institution in the Hampshire house did
not

01:30:29.149 --> 01:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
routinely record committee meetings
 
01:30:35.950 --> 01:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
until uh till the pandemic um and that's
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
probably that's probably created more
 
01:30:41.390 --> 01:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
more more access so is that a you find
 
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
that other bodies
 
01:30:47.550 --> 01:30:47.560 align:start position:0%
uh don't routinely record the uh record
 
01:30:49.189 --> 01:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
you know make video and audio recordings
 
01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
of the meetings and also or or or we
 
01:30:55.550 --> 01:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
so were we were we unusual in being like
 
01:30:57.189 --> 01:30:57.199 align:start position:0%
behind the curve and doing that sort of
 
01:31:00.390 --> 01:31:00.400 align:start position:0%
thing or is that like a uh I want to say
 
01:31:02.149 --> 01:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
pendemic problem that sounds like
 
01:31:04.629 --> 01:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
pandemic is that a common problem with
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
um other other public bodies that you
 
01:31:10.830 --> 01:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
follow uh I I think a lot of times they
 
01:31:13.550 --> 01:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
don't uh they certainly don't make the
 
01:31:17.229 --> 01:31:17.239 align:start position:0%
the the the meetings uh available by
 
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
default um a as the house does I mean
 
01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
some do some don't but again there's no
 
01:31:26.109 --> 01:31:26.119 align:start position:0%
requirement in the language of the right
 
01:31:29.550 --> 01:31:29.560 align:start position:0%
to know law to make the recordings uh
 
01:31:31.470 --> 01:31:31.480 align:start position:0%
available the only requirement is that
 
01:31:35.070 --> 01:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
available follow up thank you Mr chair
 
01:31:39.910 --> 01:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
and um there's also a j just as a long
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
time M the house I've often in the past
 
01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
had difficulty figuring out what it was
 
01:31:45.149 --> 01:31:45.159 align:start position:0%
we did even sometimes when I was in the
 
01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
room just just because of uh the nature
 
01:31:50.470 --> 01:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
of the type of minutes that we kept but
 
01:31:52.709 --> 01:31:52.719 align:start position:0%
the uh other thing is
 
01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
um how do you think how do you think the
 
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
operation of the house and other public
 
01:31:59.229 --> 01:31:59.239 align:start position:0%
bodies will be affected by the fact that
 
01:32:02.270 --> 01:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
you have um you think we have a broader
 
01:32:04.750 --> 01:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
or narrower base I know certainly with
 
01:32:06.910 --> 01:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
you're an example of the right to know
 
01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
issues there's a uh we have a pretty
 
01:32:12.149 --> 01:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
like a group of frequent flyers
 
01:32:13.510 --> 01:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
including yourselves who follow the
 
01:32:16.390 --> 01:32:16.400 align:start position:0%
issue closely keep track of when all the
 
01:32:17.950 --> 01:32:17.960 align:start position:0%
KN when all the hearings are going to be
 
01:32:19.870 --> 01:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
have a lot of like institutional memory
 
01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
and now we have more people going into
 
01:32:25.669 --> 01:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
that so is that uh you think that's a uh
 
01:32:27.149 --> 01:32:27.159 align:start position:0%
you think that's you think that's a good
 
01:32:30.430 --> 01:32:30.440 align:start position:0%
thing or or a bad thing and um how how
 
01:32:33.990 --> 01:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
do we uh going forward how do we how do
 
01:32:36.109 --> 01:32:36.119 align:start position:0%
we uh continue to broaden the base of
 
01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
the members of the public who actually
 
01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
follow these meetings and observe it
 
01:32:41.830 --> 01:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
just because you know it's become I
 
01:32:44.590 --> 01:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
think a little bit simpler for somebody
 
01:32:47.030 --> 01:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
who's not quite as intimately involved
 
01:32:49.070 --> 01:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
in the issue is as you are Mr sad to
 
01:32:50.709 --> 01:32:50.719 align:start position:0%
like find out when the hearing is and
 
01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
what they need to do to sign on so kind
 
01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
of a Rand question I there's a question
 
01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
in there
 
01:32:59.350 --> 01:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
somewhere I I think it's a very good
 
01:33:02.910 --> 01:33:02.920 align:start position:0%
thing to have remote uh remote meetings
 
01:33:05.229 --> 01:33:05.239 align:start position:0%
and to you know and I'll use zoom as an
 
01:33:06.550 --> 01:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
example although there's multiple
 
01:33:09.910 --> 01:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
technologies that are being employed uh
 
01:33:12.109 --> 01:33:12.119 align:start position:0%
you know it is going to increase civic
 
01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
participation um uh and I think if you
 
01:33:19.189 --> 01:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
require that the meeting recorded and
 
01:33:21.669 --> 01:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
that recording be made a public record
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
that goes a long way to not only
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
increasing civic participation but it
 
01:33:28.990 --> 01:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
goes a long way in making sure that if
 
01:33:31.149 --> 01:33:31.159 align:start position:0%
there are any technical difficulties
 
01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
that are encountered during meetings
 
01:33:37.790 --> 01:33:37.800 align:start position:0%
those will the the recording will uh
 
01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
help identify those and will allow
 
01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
people to use that as a way to get their
 
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
public bodies to address those technical
 
01:33:47.669 --> 01:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
difficulties so that they don't continue
 
01:33:51.669 --> 01:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
to occur and and and make sure that
 
01:33:54.350 --> 01:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
people uh don't abuse some of the
 
01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
features of the technology to limit
 
01:34:00.149 --> 01:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
participation that's the concern that we
 
01:34:03.070 --> 01:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
have is make sure you amend the language
 
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
to ensure that possible abuses of the
 
01:34:09.470 --> 01:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
technology don't occur all right thanks
 
01:34:11.790 --> 01:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
all my all I had to ask thank you Mr s
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
and Mr chair representative
 
01:34:16.470 --> 01:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
syvia thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
taking my question Mr sad um of all of
 
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
the uh reports that you've had have you
 
01:34:25.790 --> 01:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
had any reports of meetings having to be
 
01:34:29.790 --> 01:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
adjourned because of Technology
 
01:34:32.189 --> 01:34:32.199 align:start position:0%
problems uh no and that's and that's
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
part of the problem uh you know we have
 
01:34:36.950 --> 01:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
this requirement that says oh there's a
 
01:34:39.109 --> 01:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
number to call if there's a technical
 
01:34:43.030 --> 01:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
problem um and you can call it I'll give
 
01:34:46.470 --> 01:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
you an example uh on hb18 I had a
 
01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
technical problem and I called that
 
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
phone number and I said I'm having a
 
01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
problem and I got a you know I forgot
 
01:34:56.830 --> 01:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
who the person was but you know they
 
01:34:58.669 --> 01:34:58.679 align:start position:0%
they certainly didn't resolve the issue
 
01:35:00.109 --> 01:35:00.119 align:start position:0%
by getting me in touch with the
 
01:35:02.550 --> 01:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
chairperson so that I could during
 
01:35:05.109 --> 01:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
testimony being open I could offer my
 
01:35:08.470 --> 01:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
testimony on 108 so you know it's all
 
01:35:10.830 --> 01:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
after the fact and of course I don't
 
01:35:12.790 --> 01:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
know when that message is going to find
 
01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:16.080 align:start position:0%
their way to the the the chairperson in
 
01:35:17.870 --> 01:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
your in your committee but it was long
 
01:35:20.310 --> 01:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
after the discussion and testimony had
 
01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
been closed so fortunately I'm able to
 
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
submit you know written testimony and
 
01:35:27.910 --> 01:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
and comments after the fact so I'm sure
 
01:35:30.270 --> 01:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
you'll still get that that input but
 
01:35:33.149 --> 01:35:33.159 align:start position:0%
during a regular meeting um somebody has
 
01:35:35.709 --> 01:35:35.719 align:start position:0%
a technical problem they call into that
 
01:35:38.990 --> 01:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
number and there's no nothing in the law
 
01:35:40.910 --> 01:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
that's going to say that the meeting is
 
01:35:42.910 --> 01:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
going to stop they're going to resolve
 
01:35:45.109 --> 01:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
the issue so that person can be
 
01:35:47.390 --> 01:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
reconnected or whatever and and the
 
01:35:49.590 --> 01:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
meeting is going to continue to resume
 
01:35:51.510 --> 01:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
at that point and I'm not saying that
 
01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
should be done but according to the
 
01:35:56.430 --> 01:35:56.440 align:start position:0%
amendment we put forth you know we want
 
01:35:58.510 --> 01:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
to make sure that any technical problems
 
01:36:00.910 --> 01:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
that are identified get recorded in the
 
01:36:04.510 --> 01:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
minutes so that helps um res make sure
 
01:36:06.390 --> 01:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
the problem does get resolved even if
 
01:36:07.910 --> 01:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
it's after the
 
01:36:11.189 --> 01:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
fact thank you representative Chase did
 
01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
you have a question uh yes I do thank
 
01:36:16.189 --> 01:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:36:19.229 --> 01:36:19.239 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned about the chat
 
01:36:22.470 --> 01:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
rooms and was that something that would
 
01:36:25.270 --> 01:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
be made available because people do tend
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
to just go off on their own tangents
 
01:36:30.229 --> 01:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
there there are ways of not having that
 
01:36:32.669 --> 01:36:32.679 align:start position:0%
on if you see we don't have it there's
 
01:36:35.350 --> 01:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
no way for us to chat with each other if
 
01:36:38.590 --> 01:36:38.600 align:start position:0%
that were um just always noted in a
 
01:36:40.350 --> 01:36:40.360 align:start position:0%
public hearing would that be something
 
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
that you would
 
01:36:46.990 --> 01:36:47.000 align:start position:0%
support uh yes um I'm talking that the
 
01:36:49.910 --> 01:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
technology does allow for chat the bill
 
01:36:51.629 --> 01:36:51.639 align:start position:0%
as it's currently written would not
 
01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
prohibit the use of chat um and it it
 
01:36:58.590 --> 01:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
also wouldn't prohibit the the
 
01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
submission of comments as well and so
 
01:37:04.430 --> 01:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying the language of the bill
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
while it it replicates the governor's
 
01:37:11.669 --> 01:37:11.679 align:start position:0%
State uh of emergency order um there's
 
01:37:14.470 --> 01:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
some loopholes that uh from have to be
 
01:37:18.149 --> 01:37:18.159 align:start position:0%
addressed in this bill to make sure that
 
01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
there isn't communication that takes
 
01:37:23.189 --> 01:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
place among members or between the
 
01:37:26.109 --> 01:37:26.119 align:start position:0%
public and members of the public body
 
01:37:30.229 --> 01:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:33.950 --> 01:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
records okay thank you yeah any other
 
01:37:35.830 --> 01:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr
 
01:37:38.590 --> 01:37:38.600 align:start position:0%
sad seeing none thank you for your
 
01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:40.189 align:start position:0%
sad seeing none thank you for your
testimony

01:37:40.189 --> 01:37:40.199 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:53.390 --> 01:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
Grace hi Mr Grace hello Mr chair uh
 
01:37:55.390 --> 01:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak again
 
01:37:58.030 --> 01:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
I represent the New Hampshire Municipal
 
01:38:00.430 --> 01:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
Association um a couple things I would
 
01:38:02.030 --> 01:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
like to address and then the proposed
 
01:38:05.030 --> 01:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
amendment that I sent to all of you
 
01:38:08.470 --> 01:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
yesterday um first I wanted to point out
 
01:38:13.310 --> 01:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
that RSA 33 hyphen a colon 3 hyphen a um
 
01:38:15.390 --> 01:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
does state within its body that if there
 
01:38:18.189 --> 01:38:18.199 align:start position:0%
is a recording made of a public
 
01:38:20.669 --> 01:38:20.679 align:start position:0%
meeting it needs only be kept until the
 
01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
minutes created after which it could be
 
01:38:26.109 --> 01:38:26.119 align:start position:0%
destroyed and it that recording would be
 
01:38:27.589 --> 01:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
subject to a right to no request and it
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
would be subject to that request for uh
 
01:38:32.629 --> 01:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
as long as that recording exists
 
01:38:34.229 --> 01:38:34.239 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether the minutes have
 
01:38:37.870 --> 01:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
been created or not um and secondly
 
01:38:38.990 --> 01:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
since the committee brought up the
 
01:38:42.629 --> 01:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
technical problem issue um that's
 
01:38:45.109 --> 01:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
obviously that's obviously a big
 
01:38:47.910 --> 01:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
issue um the way we have interpreted the
 
01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
emergency order is that if the technical
 
01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:51.910 align:start position:0%
emergency order is that if the technical
problem

01:38:51.910 --> 01:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:38:55.229 --> 01:38:55.239 align:start position:0%
uh is a problem for everyone not just
 
01:38:57.870 --> 01:38:57.880 align:start position:0%
one person trying to connect that's when
 
01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
the uh body would be required to adjourn
 
01:39:02.910 --> 01:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
so you know if I'm trying to dial into a
 
01:39:05.229 --> 01:39:05.239 align:start position:0%
meeting and it's just my phone or my
 
01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
zoom connection that's a problem um the
 
01:39:11.709 --> 01:39:11.719 align:start position:0%
the body doesn't have to do anything but
 
01:39:14.910 --> 01:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
uh if it's you know 12 people and all 12
 
01:39:17.709 --> 01:39:17.719 align:start position:0%
people can't connect um you know then
 
01:39:20.350 --> 01:39:20.360 align:start position:0%
then there's a problem at that point the
 
01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
theard would have to adjourn so that's I
 
01:39:24.750 --> 01:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
just want to let you know what our
 
01:39:27.950 --> 01:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
interpretation was there um as far as
 
01:39:31.950 --> 01:39:31.960 align:start position:0%
the amendment goes I believe that uh the
 
01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
sponsor summarized it uh quite well um
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
we would like the committee to amend um
 
01:39:42.950 --> 01:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
just a couple lines to clarify that if
 
01:39:45.109 --> 01:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
the meeting has no physical
 
01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
location that's when um Public Access
 
01:39:51.470 --> 01:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
has to be able to be done remotely um
 
01:39:54.990 --> 01:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
but under current law if the chair
 
01:39:58.629 --> 01:39:58.639 align:start position:0%
declares that an emergency has occurred
 
01:40:00.109 --> 01:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
there's still a requirement for a
 
01:40:04.709 --> 01:40:04.719 align:start position:0%
physical location and uh and then a
 
01:40:06.470 --> 01:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
quorum of the body has to be present at
 
01:40:10.390 --> 01:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
that physical location um presumably the
 
01:40:13.550 --> 01:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
public could then go to that uh physical
 
01:40:15.830 --> 01:40:15.840 align:start position:0%
location um and so that's really the
 
01:40:18.270 --> 01:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
distinction we want to make is you know
 
01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
if there's a physical location for the
 
01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
meeting that where the public should be
 
01:40:25.390 --> 01:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
going um to get access by default
 
01:40:28.510 --> 01:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
because there are uh problems as many of
 
01:40:31.390 --> 01:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
you represent um rural communities and
 
01:40:34.229 --> 01:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
communities without good connectivity as
 
01:40:37.589 --> 01:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
well as small towns you know that uh the
 
01:40:39.790 --> 01:40:39.800 align:start position:0%
conferencing software or you know
 
01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
conference lines are expensive so it
 
01:40:44.229 --> 01:40:44.239 align:start position:0%
puts a strain on your budgets to have
 
01:40:48.109 --> 01:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
those for every uh board meeting and in
 
01:40:50.470 --> 01:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
addition um you know if you have poor
 
01:40:54.270 --> 01:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
connect ity um you might be able to get
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
one person on the line but you might not
 
01:40:59.629 --> 01:40:59.639 align:start position:0%
be able to get uh get a bunch of people
 
01:41:01.669 --> 01:41:01.679 align:start position:0%
on the line um depending on what your
 
01:41:03.470 --> 01:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
internet speed is at town hall or
 
01:41:05.550 --> 01:41:05.560 align:start position:0%
wherever the meeting is taking place so
 
01:41:06.870 --> 01:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
we're just trying
 
01:41:09.149 --> 01:41:09.159 align:start position:0%
to trying to change this a little to
 
01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
make it uh more practical for for towns
 
01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:12.950 align:start position:0%
make it uh more practical for for towns
to

01:41:12.950 --> 01:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:41:15.270 --> 01:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
implement and I'm happy to take
 
01:41:18.390 --> 01:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions
 
01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:25.470 --> 01:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
I guess I I have one question and that's
 
01:41:28.830 --> 01:41:28.840 align:start position:0%
right at the beginning of the bill and
 
01:41:32.030 --> 01:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
currently it says a public body may but
 
01:41:34.669 --> 01:41:34.679 align:start position:0%
is not required to allow one or more
 
01:41:39.149 --> 01:41:39.159 align:start position:0%
members of the body participate
 
01:41:41.870 --> 01:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
electronically way it's Rewritten it's
 
01:41:44.870 --> 01:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
one or more members of the public body
 
01:41:46.830 --> 01:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
May participate in a meeting by
 
01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
electronic so it seems to
 
01:41:53.310 --> 01:41:53.320 align:start position:0%
shift the responsibility for determining
 
01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
whether people can participate
 
01:41:59.390 --> 01:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
electronically from the the from the
 
01:42:03.270 --> 01:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
public body to the individual
 
01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:05.070 align:start position:0%
public body to the individual
members

01:42:05.070 --> 01:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
yes it does seen that way and so
 
01:42:14.990 --> 01:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
if if we have a
 
01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.470 align:start position:0%
if if we have a
local

01:42:17.470 --> 01:42:17.480 align:start position:0%
local
 
01:42:20.030 --> 01:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
meeting uh and and I guess the question
 
01:42:23.430 --> 01:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
is what is a public body
 
01:42:26.629 --> 01:42:26.639 align:start position:0%
so is is a member of the public if I if
 
01:42:28.990 --> 01:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
there's a planning board
 
01:42:32.189 --> 01:42:32.199 align:start position:0%
meeting and you have a case before the
 
01:42:34.830 --> 01:42:34.840 align:start position:0%
planning board are you a member of the
 
01:42:37.550 --> 01:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
public body or is it just a planning
 
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
board member that has that op it would

just be the the board
 
01:42:45.669 --> 01:42:45.679 align:start position:0%

the membership of the the body itself
 
01:42:51.589 --> 01:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
not persons appearing before the board

although presumably even under current
 
01:42:59.350 --> 01:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
law a board could allow some sort of
 
01:43:02.589 --> 01:43:02.599 align:start position:0%
remote access for an applicant or or
 
01:43:04.149 --> 01:43:04.159 align:start position:0%

can you hear me now we can thank you um
 
01:44:28.750 --> 01:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
first off um I want to thank you for uh
 
01:44:29.950 --> 01:44:29.960 align:start position:0%
taking the time to listen to My
 
01:44:32.510 --> 01:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
Testimony uh my name is James Marshall I
 
01:44:34.070 --> 01:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
live in Derry New
 
01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:36.350 align:start position:0%
live in Derry New
Hampshire

01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
um as a resident of um New Hampshire or
 
01:44:43.229 --> 01:44:43.239 align:start position:0%
any area I think it's important to
 
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
participate in government um however
 
01:44:47.790 --> 01:44:47.800 align:start position:0%
since I work in Boston it's uh very
 
01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
difficult for me to arrange my schedule
 
01:44:52.189 --> 01:44:52.199 align:start position:0%
to attend a meeting that may start on
 
01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
time or like this one may not um or
 
01:44:56.950 --> 01:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
other meetings that I've attended um
 
01:45:00.790 --> 01:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
virtually have U Been uh suspended uh so
 
01:45:02.910 --> 01:45:02.920 align:start position:0%
testimony is given you know postponed to
 
01:45:06.669 --> 01:45:06.679 align:start position:0%
another week or whatever um so it's very
 
01:45:08.669 --> 01:45:08.679 align:start position:0%
convenient for me to be at work like I
 
01:45:12.149 --> 01:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
am right now and take an hour off um you
 
01:45:13.709 --> 01:45:13.719 align:start position:0%
know to be able to attend the meetings
 
01:45:16.229 --> 01:45:16.239 align:start position:0%
and participate I think it's important
 
01:45:18.790 --> 01:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
that um not only for the state
 
01:45:20.589 --> 01:45:20.599 align:start position:0%
government for for local governments to
 
01:45:22.589 --> 01:45:22.599 align:start position:0%
make this um
 
01:45:25.550 --> 01:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
ability um more prevalent to everyone
 
01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
the bill specifically States telephones
 
01:45:29.790 --> 01:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
uh which I think pretty much everybody
 
01:45:32.950 --> 01:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
has um you know Zoom meetings are not um
 
01:45:35.229 --> 01:45:35.239 align:start position:0%
necessarily required so I don't think
 
01:45:37.390 --> 01:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
the technology questions being raised
 
01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
are really that concerning since uh
 
01:45:41.870 --> 01:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
there should be a telephone way to
 
01:45:44.109 --> 01:45:44.119 align:start position:0%
communicate and if there isn't then the
 
01:45:46.030 --> 01:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
person could certainly go to the meeting
 
01:45:49.070 --> 01:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
themselves um basically that's all I
 
01:45:50.790 --> 01:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to say is that um I I think it's
 
01:45:52.430 --> 01:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
really important that we have public
 
01:45:55.910 --> 01:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
access to these and um I appreciate your
 
01:45:56.830 --> 01:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
time thank
 
01:45:59.390 --> 01:45:59.400 align:start position:0%

01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:00.550 align:start position:0%

01:46:24.430 --> 01:46:24.440 align:start position:0%
and um speaking on support of this
 
01:46:28.950 --> 01:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
bill um I see a lot of more people
 
01:46:31.149 --> 01:46:31.159 align:start position:0%
getting involved in our town and
 
01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
Community meetings and I believe that
 
01:46:38.109 --> 01:46:38.119 align:start position:0%
the uh having the the community involved
 
01:46:39.910 --> 01:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
when it comes to making decision is
 
01:46:42.589 --> 01:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
really important for every one of us and
 
01:46:44.430 --> 01:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
then seeing uh people doing the
 
01:46:47.310 --> 01:46:47.320 align:start position:0%
testimonies and given that perspective
 
01:46:48.750 --> 01:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
or a lot of the issues in their
 
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
communities great for us
 
01:46:52.830 --> 01:46:52.840 align:start position:0%

01:46:55.750 --> 01:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to continue giv uh people
 
01:46:58.709 --> 01:46:58.719 align:start position:0%
who maybe the older or they have uh some
 
01:47:01.510 --> 01:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
physical disabilities they can't get out
 
01:47:03.109 --> 01:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
out of their houses but that they have
 
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
the ability to have a computer and they
 
01:47:07.229 --> 01:47:07.239 align:start position:0%
have internet access and that they have
 
01:47:10.390 --> 01:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh the access to these meetings uh is
 
01:47:12.510 --> 01:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
great is a great tool to continue
 
01:47:14.750 --> 01:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
keeping the community involved and then
 
01:47:17.669 --> 01:47:17.679 align:start position:0%
um and make people feel like they are
 
01:47:20.830 --> 01:47:20.840 align:start position:0%

Jael car meeting so I don't have to rush

back but I'm here uh to introduce uh
 
01:58:50.550 --> 01:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill 630 uh to all of you this
 
01:58:53.830 --> 01:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
morning um and if you've had a chance to
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
take a look at it you will recognize the
 
01:58:59.990 --> 01:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
initial portion as uh very consistent
 
01:59:02.990 --> 01:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
with the uh announcement that uh each
 
01:59:04.950 --> 01:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
committee chair makes before we begin
 
01:59:08.510 --> 01:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
our hearings these days uh in in this
 
01:59:12.189 --> 01:59:12.199 align:start position:0%
new remote world we live in um it's just
 
01:59:14.990 --> 01:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
very much slimmed down to the to the uh
 
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
you know most Central wording um and
 
01:59:23.030 --> 01:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
purpose is not to uh to do anything
 
01:59:24.189 --> 01:59:24.199 align:start position:0%
other than to
 
01:59:28.030 --> 01:59:28.040 align:start position:0%
codify uh the governor's order so that
 
01:59:30.990 --> 01:59:31.000 align:start position:0%
uh in circumstances that may require it
 
01:59:33.589 --> 01:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
uh our committees and Boards can have
 
01:59:36.310 --> 01:59:36.320 align:start position:0%
remote meetings as we are doing now but
 
01:59:38.669 --> 01:59:38.679 align:start position:0%
at some point the emergency is going to
 
01:59:41.149 --> 01:59:41.159 align:start position:0%
uh is going to end uh but that doesn't
 
01:59:43.270 --> 01:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean that the covid
 
01:59:46.830 --> 01:59:46.840 align:start position:0%
situation will be passed uh and so the
 
01:59:48.510 --> 01:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
remote meetings serve a very useful
 
01:59:50.790 --> 01:59:50.800 align:start position:0%
function as I think I think we all agree
 
01:59:53.310 --> 01:59:53.320 align:start position:0%
um the latter portion of the bill uh
 
01:59:56.270 --> 01:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
deals with um with signature
 
01:59:58.589 --> 01:59:58.599 align:start position:0%
requirements that are currently uh you
 
02:00:02.709 --> 02:00:02.719 align:start position:0%
know in in statute uh and the uh the
 
02:00:05.229 --> 02:00:05.239 align:start position:0%
attorney for the office of professional
 
02:00:06.750 --> 02:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
license insurance
 
02:00:10.669 --> 02:00:10.679 align:start position:0%
certification uh Mr Tom bradrick uh is
 
02:00:15.109 --> 02:00:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh intending to testify on the bill um
 
02:00:19.189 --> 02:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
but uh the members of the the uh of the
 
02:00:22.350 --> 02:00:22.360 align:start position:0%
sponsors uh on the on this bill are all
 
02:00:23.910 --> 02:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
members of The Joint legislative
 
02:00:26.270 --> 02:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
committee on administrative rules the
 
02:00:31.109 --> 02:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
infamous jelar um and uh so uh we all
 
02:00:35.629 --> 02:00:35.639 align:start position:0%
recognize uh that the that these uh
 
02:00:39.310 --> 02:00:39.320 align:start position:0%
requirements uh need to be in statute uh
 
02:00:43.350 --> 02:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
or amended to be in statute uh to enable
 
02:00:45.950 --> 02:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
government to continue to function uh
 
02:00:48.109 --> 02:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
under these current unusual
 
02:00:51.669 --> 02:00:51.679 align:start position:0%
circumstances so that goes for does it
 
02:00:53.750 --> 02:00:53.760 align:start position:0%

professional LIC insurance certific
 
02:01:51.790 --> 02:01:51.800 align:start position:0%
ification or oplc for background the
 
02:01:54.669 --> 02:01:54.679 align:start position:0%
oplc provides administ and clerical
 
02:01:58.669 --> 02:01:58.679 align:start position:0%
record keeping service and processing 54
 
02:02:02.709 --> 02:02:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:05.470 --> 02:02:05.480 align:start position:0%
commission while hb6 would affect all
 
02:02:07.669 --> 02:02:07.679 align:start position:0%
the boards under opl's umbrella in what
 
02:02:09.510 --> 02:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
we feel would be a beneficial way I want
 
02:02:11.430 --> 02:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
to be clear that I'm only speaking today
 
02:02:14.830 --> 02:02:14.840 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the oplc the AY I'm not
 
02:02:16.629 --> 02:02:16.639 align:start position:0%
authorized to speak on behalf of the
 
02:02:19.629 --> 02:02:19.639 align:start position:0%
boards so as as representative
 
02:02:21.950 --> 02:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
stated um or I believe he stated this
 
02:02:24.229 --> 02:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
bill was actually requested PLC we
 
02:02:25.750 --> 02:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
worked with representative Maguire on
 
02:02:27.990 --> 02:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
this um and the bill deals with two
 
02:02:30.589 --> 02:02:30.599 align:start position:0%
general concepts the first is remote
 
02:02:33.390 --> 02:02:33.400 align:start position:0%
meetings so very similar to the bill
 
02:02:36.350 --> 02:02:36.360 align:start position:0%
prior to this that you just heard HB
 
02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
216 piece is it deals with um just a
 
02:02:42.390 --> 02:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
change to the
 
02:02:47.950 --> 02:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
procedures I'll take both in turn so um
 
02:02:50.350 --> 02:02:50.360 align:start position:0%
remote as you all know previous to the
 
02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic RSA 91a required that a quorum
 
02:02:55.069 --> 02:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
of any governmental body be physically
 
02:02:57.030 --> 02:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
present in order to hold a meeting the
 
02:02:58.589 --> 02:02:58.599 align:start position:0%
governor's emergency order number
 
02:03:01.030 --> 02:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
temporarily temporarily waved this
 
02:03:05.030 --> 02:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
requirement allowing agencies such as
 
02:03:09.149 --> 02:03:09.159 align:start position:0%
op to meet remely so long as several
 
02:03:12.870 --> 02:03:12.880 align:start position:0%
requirements are met lines 1 through 11
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
are meant to codify the governor's order
 
02:03:17.629 --> 02:03:17.639 align:start position:0%
number so if this bill passes these
 
02:03:19.350 --> 02:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
bodies would be allowed to continue to
 
02:03:21.350 --> 02:03:21.360 align:start position:0%
meet remote the state of emergency
 
02:03:24.830 --> 02:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
passed opcs wereing this change because
 
02:03:26.430 --> 02:03:26.440 align:start position:0%
quite frankly the remote meetings have
 
02:03:27.750 --> 02:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
worked out quite well from our
 
02:03:30.310 --> 02:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
perspective for um the general public
 
02:03:32.069 --> 02:03:32.079 align:start position:0%
which you heard about on the previous
 
02:03:34.910 --> 02:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
bill um two our our board members and
 
02:03:38.470 --> 02:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
three uh the oplc and broader the state
 
02:03:40.069 --> 02:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
so first on the public we found that the
 
02:03:41.629 --> 02:03:41.639 align:start position:0%
public have benefited from meetings
 
02:03:44.310 --> 02:03:44.320 align:start position:0%
being held remotely because it's
 
02:03:45.870 --> 02:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
increased public access to the
 
02:03:48.870 --> 02:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
regulatory bodies of op um pre
 
02:03:50.910 --> 02:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
previously if a doctor to listen in on a
 
02:03:53.629 --> 02:03:53.639 align:start position:0%
discussion of medicine's monthly meeting
 
02:03:55.669 --> 02:03:55.679 align:start position:0%
um they need to take time off drive to
 
02:03:57.189 --> 02:03:57.199 align:start position:0%
conquer and physically attend the
 
02:03:58.950 --> 02:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
meeting now they can just log in and out
 
02:04:00.910 --> 02:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
of the remote meetings from their home
 
02:04:03.189 --> 02:04:03.199 align:start position:0%
or or workplace they can listen to
 
02:04:04.830 --> 02:04:04.840 align:start position:0%
portion of that meeting without having
 
02:04:07.069 --> 02:04:07.079 align:start position:0%
to give up what can amount to hours to
 
02:04:09.870 --> 02:04:09.880 align:start position:0%
physically in the board meeting second
 
02:04:12.229 --> 02:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
the members of the boards under llc's
 
02:04:15.030 --> 02:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
umbrella have also benefited uh remember
 
02:04:16.990 --> 02:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
these are volunteer board members most
 
02:04:19.510 --> 02:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
of our boards meet once per month rather
 
02:04:20.950 --> 02:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
than driving in from say the North
 
02:04:22.990 --> 02:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
Country into conquered for the meetings
 
02:04:24.149 --> 02:04:24.159 align:start position:0%
the board members have been able to
 
02:04:25.910 --> 02:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
Simply log on to remote meetings to
 
02:04:27.189 --> 02:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
conduct the board's
 
02:04:29.229 --> 02:04:29.239 align:start position:0%
business um and lastly there's been a
 
02:04:30.910 --> 02:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
benefit to our agency and the state as a
 
02:04:33.229 --> 02:04:33.239 align:start position:0%
whole um for our professional boards
 
02:04:34.589 --> 02:04:34.599 align:start position:0%
most of our boards are comprised
 
02:04:36.629 --> 02:04:36.639 align:start position:0%
primarily of people currently in or
 
02:04:38.990 --> 02:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
retired from the profession with um
 
02:04:40.709 --> 02:04:40.719 align:start position:0%
generally one or two public members on
 
02:04:43.310 --> 02:04:43.320 align:start position:0%
the boards as well our board members
 
02:04:45.149 --> 02:04:45.159 align:start position:0%
generally are nominated by the governor
 
02:04:47.229 --> 02:04:47.239 align:start position:0%
and approved by the governor and Council
 
02:04:49.589 --> 02:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
but it often comes to op PLC or the
 
02:04:52.790 --> 02:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
board itself to try to find new members
 
02:04:56.790 --> 02:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
when expire so historically has been a
 
02:04:59.189 --> 02:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
struggle to find individuals who are
 
02:05:02.149 --> 02:05:02.159 align:start position:0%
actively participating in their
 
02:05:05.390 --> 02:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
profession uh half day full day every
 
02:05:07.910 --> 02:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
month to participate on these boards
 
02:05:09.549 --> 02:05:09.559 align:start position:0%
continuing to allow for remote meetings
 
02:05:10.950 --> 02:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
would expand the pool of individuals
 
02:05:12.149 --> 02:05:12.159 align:start position:0%
who' be willing to take on this
 
02:05:15.990 --> 02:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
volunteer work um I I do as an example I
 
02:05:19.270 --> 02:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
know of at least one mother who has kids
 
02:05:21.390 --> 02:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
who has said she would not be able to
 
02:05:25.629 --> 02:05:25.639 align:start position:0%
take the time to drive in to meetings um
 
02:05:27.510 --> 02:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
but would consider being a board member
 
02:05:30.229 --> 02:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
if if she was able to participate in
 
02:05:33.430 --> 02:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
remotely um you heard extensively on the
 
02:05:35.750 --> 02:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
readings piece previously so I'll now
 
02:05:38.390 --> 02:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
turn to the second concept um the
 
02:05:40.189 --> 02:05:40.199 align:start position:0%
remainder of the bill lines 12 through
 
02:05:43.149 --> 02:05:43.159 align:start position:0%
21 are meant minor change to the
 
02:05:44.950 --> 02:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
statutes concerning rulemaking that
 
02:05:46.790 --> 02:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
appears in the administrative procedures
 
02:05:50.350 --> 02:05:50.360 align:start position:0%
act RSA 541a in short for certain rule
 
02:05:53.709 --> 02:05:53.719 align:start position:0%
making steps all rule making entity um
 
02:05:53.719 --> 02:05:55.149 align:start position:0%
making steps all rule making entity um
agency

02:05:55.149 --> 02:05:55.159 align:start position:0%
agency
 
02:05:57.750 --> 02:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
heads but for us it's mainly board
 
02:06:01.109 --> 02:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
members have to submit um statements or
 
02:06:03.109 --> 02:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
cover letters that are signed by someone
 
02:06:06.830 --> 02:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
making Authority right now uh a a wet
 
02:06:09.510 --> 02:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
signature is required a photocopy or
 
02:06:11.589 --> 02:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
scan is not accepted it's been
 
02:06:14.189 --> 02:06:14.199 align:start position:0%
temporarily relax during the pandemic in
 
02:06:16.669 --> 02:06:16.679 align:start position:0%
that the administrative rules office
 
02:06:18.830 --> 02:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
will temporarily accept a photocopy or
 
02:06:21.790 --> 02:06:21.800 align:start position:0%
scan of a signature but the expectation
 
02:06:23.510 --> 02:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
unless it's changed is that the emergenc
 
02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
is over we'll need to submit a wet
 
02:06:30.350 --> 02:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
signature for everything that was filed
 
02:06:33.790 --> 02:06:33.800 align:start position:0%
um via photocopy or scan during the
 
02:06:36.589 --> 02:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
pandemic um here's where oplc is a
 
02:06:38.350 --> 02:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
little unique for most agencies the
 
02:06:40.310 --> 02:06:40.320 align:start position:0%
indivi individual granted rulle making
 
02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
Authority is a state employee so for
 
02:06:44.189 --> 02:06:44.199 align:start position:0%
instance if the person doing Ru making
 
02:06:46.069 --> 02:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
for the Department of Agriculture needs
 
02:06:48.350 --> 02:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
a signature they can usually go down the
 
02:06:50.109 --> 02:06:50.119 align:start position:0%
hall to their commissioner and get that
 
02:06:52.430 --> 02:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
signature but most of the rule making we
 
02:06:55.950 --> 02:06:55.960 align:start position:0%
do OPC is Rule making for boards where
 
02:06:57.470 --> 02:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
the board has the actual rul making
 
02:06:59.510 --> 02:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
Authority most of our boards meet once
 
02:07:02.950 --> 02:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
per month um some other smaller boards
 
02:07:05.069 --> 02:07:05.079 align:start position:0%
meet quarterly it can be difficult to
 
02:07:06.950 --> 02:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
get a wet signature from a board member
 
02:07:09.470 --> 02:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
who in in non-pandemic times is in
 
02:07:11.709 --> 02:07:11.719 align:start position:0%
office uh once per month for only
 
02:07:14.709 --> 02:07:14.719 align:start position:0%
several hours so this change would allow
 
02:07:17.589 --> 02:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
me I I do most of the ru making uh for
 
02:07:19.470 --> 02:07:19.480 align:start position:0%
the agency to get the necessary
 
02:07:21.790 --> 02:07:21.800 align:start position:0%
signature emailed or mailed to me and to
 
02:07:24.910 --> 02:07:24.920 align:start position:0%
be able to file it in a timely manner um
 
02:07:26.830 --> 02:07:26.840 align:start position:0%
photocopies of signatures are generally
 
02:07:28.589 --> 02:07:28.599 align:start position:0%
accepted by courts if you look at New
 
02:07:31.270 --> 02:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rule of evidence 103
 
02:07:33.549 --> 02:07:33.559 align:start position:0%
photocopied signatures I believe are
 
02:07:35.350 --> 02:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
accepted by governor and Council on
 
02:07:36.870 --> 02:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
tracks for the state that come in front
 
02:07:38.589 --> 02:07:38.599 align:start position:0%
of them I'm simply asking that
 
02:07:40.310 --> 02:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
photocopies of signatures be accepted
 
02:07:43.990 --> 02:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
for rule making purposes as well
 
02:07:46.870 --> 02:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
um that concludes my oral testimony I'm
 
02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
 
02:07:55.549 --> 02:07:55.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:58.750 --> 02:07:58.760 align:start position:0%

02:08:22.390 --> 02:08:22.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I'm president of right
 
02:08:25.350 --> 02:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
to know New Hampshire uh this bill is is
 
02:08:27.750 --> 02:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
quite similar to the previous bill um
 
02:08:29.350 --> 02:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
the testimony that I submitted in
 
02:08:31.750 --> 02:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
written form is virtually identical so I
 
02:08:35.709 --> 02:08:35.719 align:start position:0%
won't repeat myself I just want to um
 
02:08:38.470 --> 02:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
add that again as it's currently written
 
02:08:41.390 --> 02:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to it uh we certainly can
 
02:08:45.030 --> 02:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
support it if it's amended uh based upon
 
02:08:48.069 --> 02:08:48.079 align:start position:0%
uh the shortcomings that I uh mentioned
 
02:08:51.189 --> 02:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
in in the testimony on the previous bill
 
02:08:53.790 --> 02:08:53.800 align:start position:0%
um I would like to add a couple of
 
02:08:57.629 --> 02:08:57.639 align:start position:0%
additional comments um if you are going
 
02:09:00.709 --> 02:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
to amend the bill uh to allow the public
 
02:09:02.750 --> 02:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
body members to attend
 
02:09:06.589 --> 02:09:06.599 align:start position:0%
remotely then uh make sure that uh the
 
02:09:09.510 --> 02:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
citizens are allowed to attend remotely
 
02:09:13.109 --> 02:09:13.119 align:start position:0%
as well in other words uh don't
 
02:09:16.430 --> 02:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
discriminate to give the public body
 
02:09:19.990 --> 02:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
members greater or easier accessibility
 
02:09:22.830 --> 02:09:22.840 align:start position:0%
to the meetings than you're affording
 
02:09:24.430 --> 02:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
the public
 
02:09:28.830 --> 02:09:28.840 align:start position:0%
themselves um it should be equal equal
 
02:09:33.669 --> 02:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
access um and then I would just add um
 
02:09:36.270 --> 02:09:36.280 align:start position:0%
many people we all see the benefits of
 
02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:37.189 align:start position:0%
many people we all see the benefits of
this

02:09:37.189 --> 02:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:09:40.350 --> 02:09:40.360 align:start position:0%
technology um but please look at some of
 
02:09:42.470 --> 02:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
the amended language we're proposing to
 
02:09:44.990 --> 02:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that you address some of the
 
02:09:47.790 --> 02:09:47.800 align:start position:0%
technical problems that arise with this
 
02:09:47.800 --> 02:09:48.990 align:start position:0%
technical problems that arise with this
technology

02:09:48.990 --> 02:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
technology
 
02:09:51.950 --> 02:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
and to ensure that the public body
 
02:09:56.470 --> 02:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
whether um inadvertently or on purpose
 
02:09:59.189 --> 02:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
attempts to thwart The public's input
 
02:10:02.910 --> 02:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
during an electronic uh meeting uh and
 
02:10:06.109 --> 02:10:06.119 align:start position:0%
make sure it is a public record uh
 
02:10:08.629 --> 02:10:08.639 align:start position:0%

scene with you walking through your

to hear this afternoon is House Bill
 
03:57:52.670 --> 03:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
384 prohibiting the sharing of location
 
03:57:56.189 --> 03:57:56.199 align:start position:0%
data primary speaker is representative
 
03:57:58.030 --> 03:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
and the sponsor of the bill is
 
03:58:00.590 --> 03:58:00.600 align:start position:0%
representative wer and would you like to
 
03:58:03.870 --> 03:58:03.880 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill I would want the bill
 
03:58:07.910 --> 03:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so uh prohibiting the
 
03:58:12.910 --> 03:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:16.550 --> 03:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
data we we uh passed a constitutional
 
03:58:20.070 --> 03:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
amendment uh having to do with privacy
 
03:58:22.870 --> 03:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
and in since then we've been working on
 
03:58:24.750 --> 03:58:24.760 align:start position:0%
defining what that
 
03:58:27.469 --> 03:58:27.479 align:start position:0%
meant and this is just a small step in
 
03:58:30.630 --> 03:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
the direction of this is one thing that
 
03:58:33.189 --> 03:58:33.199 align:start position:0%
falls under that Constitutional
 
03:58:36.790 --> 03:58:36.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh it it interestingly what
 
03:58:39.030 --> 03:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
happened in Washington
 
03:58:42.550 --> 03:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
the uh just a short time
 
03:58:47.070 --> 03:58:47.080 align:start position:0%
ago the government called our phone
 
03:58:49.149 --> 03:58:49.159 align:start position:0%
companies and they said we want to know
 
03:58:52.349 --> 03:58:52.359 align:start position:0%
everybody who was in this area at this
 
03:58:55.630 --> 03:58:55.640 align:start position:0%
time and they gave it the
 
03:58:57.870 --> 03:58:57.880 align:start position:0%
information they there's no way they
 
03:58:59.269 --> 03:58:59.279 align:start position:0%
could have gotten any kind of warrants
 
03:59:00.309 --> 03:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
because they didn't know who they were
 
03:59:02.189 --> 03:59:02.199 align:start position:0%
talking about that's what they wanted to
 
03:59:04.030 --> 03:59:04.040 align:start position:0%
find out and then they went after they
 
03:59:05.990 --> 03:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
could so they could find their
 
03:59:08.750 --> 03:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
suspects they went through everybody's
 
03:59:10.630 --> 03:59:10.640 align:start position:0%
cell phone data that's what this
 
03:59:12.030 --> 03:59:12.040 align:start position:0%
business that's what this bill is really
 
03:59:17.590 --> 03:59:17.600 align:start position:0%
all about we we deal with lots of
 
03:59:20.229 --> 03:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
communications and many of them if not
 
03:59:21.189 --> 03:59:21.199 align:start position:0%
all of
 
03:59:24.870 --> 03:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
them use our cell phone data or capture
 
03:59:28.110 --> 03:59:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:31.309 --> 03:59:31.319 align:start position:0%
both we don't think that have sponsored
 
03:59:33.510 --> 03:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
this bill that that data should be
 
03:59:35.670 --> 03:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
shared for should be given to them or
 
03:59:37.870 --> 03:59:37.880 align:start position:0%
they should have it for any other
 
03:59:39.510 --> 03:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
purpose and the purpose for which we
 
03:59:42.070 --> 03:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
gave it to them so I use an app when I
 
03:59:45.309 --> 03:59:45.319 align:start position:0%
go walking and it tracks my location and
 
03:59:47.309 --> 03:59:47.319 align:start position:0%
that's wonderful I wanted to do that
 
03:59:48.830 --> 03:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
when I get lost in the woods I want to
 
03:59:48.840 --> 03:59:49.590 align:start position:0%
when I get lost in the woods I want to
get

03:59:49.590 --> 03:59:49.600 align:start position:0%
get
 
03:59:52.670 --> 03:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
home but I don't want them keeping it I
 
03:59:55.110 --> 03:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
don't want them selling it and I don't
 
03:59:56.429 --> 03:59:56.439 align:start position:0%
believe they should have the right to do
 
03:59:58.670 --> 03:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
that and that's what this bill is about
 
04:00:01.630 --> 04:00:01.640 align:start position:0%
so last year I had a house bill 1376 it
 
04:00:03.189 --> 04:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
went through this committee very nicely
 
04:00:04.670 --> 04:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
went through the house very nicely and
 
04:00:06.349 --> 04:00:06.359 align:start position:0%
get caught in the
 
04:00:09.110 --> 04:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
pandemic the bill that's in front of now
 
04:00:12.830 --> 04:00:12.840 align:start position:0%
is a um what I want to call an amalgam
 
04:00:15.870 --> 04:00:15.880 align:start position:0%
of my bill from last year and Senator
 
04:00:18.349 --> 04:00:18.359 align:start position:0%
shander's Bill from last year which I'm
 
04:00:19.870 --> 04:00:19.880 align:start position:0%
not sure exactly what happened in the
 
04:00:22.429 --> 04:00:22.439 align:start position:0%
Senate but ended up on the
 
04:00:25.950 --> 04:00:25.960 align:start position:0%
table and so I just like to say this is
 
04:00:27.229 --> 04:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do we're trying to
 
04:00:30.149 --> 04:00:30.159 align:start position:0%
protect from location data
 
04:00:34.429 --> 04:00:34.439 align:start position:0%
only from um
 
04:00:37.590 --> 04:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
exploitation so that bill goes through a
 
04:00:41.630 --> 04:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
long list of definitions Define
 
04:00:43.590 --> 04:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
everything in the world and I'll tell
 
04:00:46.469 --> 04:00:46.479 align:start position:0%
you the the the the list of definitions
 
04:00:50.670 --> 04:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
is intended to be pretty much totally
 
04:00:53.630 --> 04:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
encompassing so it talks about things
 
04:00:56.950 --> 04:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
like uh a mobile application the mobile
 
04:00:58.830 --> 04:00:58.840 align:start position:0%
application developer mobile
 
04:01:01.389 --> 04:01:01.399 align:start position:0%
Communications devices
 
04:01:01.399 --> 04:01:03.189 align:start position:0%
Communications devices
telecommunications

04:01:03.189 --> 04:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
telecommunications
 
04:01:05.429 --> 04:01:05.439 align:start position:0%
carriers the intent is to capture
 
04:01:07.110 --> 04:01:07.120 align:start position:0%
everybody that's going to capture your
 
04:01:08.870 --> 04:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
location data
 
04:01:11.149 --> 04:01:11.159 align:start position:0%
and make it apply to them and of course
 
04:01:12.790 --> 04:01:12.800 align:start position:0%
it defines what your data is your
 
04:01:12.800 --> 04:01:14.910 align:start position:0%
it defines what your data is your
geophysical

04:01:14.910 --> 04:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
geophysical
 
04:01:18.229 --> 04:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
location and it says the bill
 
04:01:21.389 --> 04:01:21.399 align:start position:0%
effectively says or I think
 
04:01:23.670 --> 04:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
effectively that they can use that data
 
04:01:25.590 --> 04:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
for the purpose for which you gave it to
 
04:01:29.070 --> 04:01:29.080 align:start position:0%
them but they shouldn't be retaining it
 
04:01:30.229 --> 04:01:30.239 align:start position:0%
and they shouldn't be giving it to
 
04:01:34.830 --> 04:01:34.840 align:start position:0%
anybody else unless there's a a um
 
04:01:37.710 --> 04:01:37.720 align:start position:0%
important reason so to protect some for
 
04:01:37.720 --> 04:01:39.269 align:start position:0%
important reason so to protect some for
emergency

04:01:39.269 --> 04:01:39.279 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
04:01:41.389 --> 04:01:41.399 align:start position:0%
situations legal
 
04:01:44.670 --> 04:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
process yes they can they can do that
 
04:01:46.429 --> 04:01:46.439 align:start position:0%
you call 911 they can share your
 
04:01:46.439 --> 04:01:47.630 align:start position:0%
you call 911 they can share your
location

04:01:47.630 --> 04:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
location
 
04:01:50.750 --> 04:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
down it's fine with me right or if it's
 
04:01:52.309 --> 04:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
just for your own
 
04:01:56.790 --> 04:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:56.800 --> 04:01:58.510 align:start position:0%
 
much

04:01:58.510 --> 04:01:58.520 align:start position:0%
much
 
04:02:02.790 --> 04:02:02.800 align:start position:0%
um there isn't well I'll come back to
 
04:02:05.830 --> 04:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
that so it provides an opportunity for
 
04:02:07.870 --> 04:02:07.880 align:start position:0%
them it ca it creates create makes it a
 
04:02:09.429 --> 04:02:09.439 align:start position:0%
crime for them to share your data
 
04:02:11.830 --> 04:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
without your explicit
 
04:02:14.950 --> 04:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
permission and they are subject anybody
 
04:02:18.990 --> 04:02:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:22.349 --> 04:02:22.359 align:start position:0%
$1,000 uh subject to a maximum of
 
04:02:26.269 --> 04:02:26.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:29.510 --> 04:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
person and it also creates a right of
 
04:02:29.520 --> 04:02:30.550 align:start position:0%
person and it also creates a right of
civil

04:02:30.550 --> 04:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
civil
 
04:02:33.710 --> 04:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
action which is unspecified being civil
 
04:02:35.950 --> 04:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
action you can sue for whatever you want
 
04:02:37.950 --> 04:02:37.960 align:start position:0%
if you can get it then you can prove to
 
04:02:40.309 --> 04:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
cour you were damaged then you're
 
04:02:42.389 --> 04:02:42.399 align:start position:0%
allowed to collect including your

04:02:50.910 --> 04:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:02:53.429 --> 04:02:53.439 align:start position:0%
because I was asked a couple questions

that's what that's Us location data
 
04:03:31.429 --> 04:03:31.439 align:start position:0%
other than to fulfill an explicit
 
04:03:33.990 --> 04:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
request from such customer unless the
 
04:03:36.830 --> 04:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
customer has affirmatively waved such
 
04:03:40.750 --> 04:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
right after being properly informed for
 
04:03:43.070 --> 04:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
the purposes of this section continuing
 
04:03:46.349 --> 04:03:46.359 align:start position:0%
to use a service or website shall not be

giving you your location data or for
 
04:03:55.030 --> 04:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
them allowing them to use
 
04:03:57.229 --> 04:03:57.239 align:start position:0%
it and that's what the meend that was
 
04:03:59.149 --> 04:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
the same paragraph that was in the house
 
04:04:02.110 --> 04:04:02.120 align:start position:0%
bill 1376 last year and I just thought
 
04:04:03.590 --> 04:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
was a better paragraph than the one we
 
04:04:05.510 --> 04:04:05.520 align:start position:0%
had so there it
 
04:04:09.910 --> 04:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
is um and with that I'll just uh take
 
04:04:09.920 --> 04:04:11.790 align:start position:0%
is um and with that I'll just uh take
any

04:04:11.790 --> 04:04:11.800 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:04:15.670 --> 04:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative
 
04:04:18.269 --> 04:04:18.279 align:start position:0%
Alexander um thank you Mr chair and
 
04:04:19.910 --> 04:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative welber for um
 
04:04:22.389 --> 04:04:22.399 align:start position:0%
introducing this um and taking my
 
04:04:24.870 --> 04:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
question um my question is specifically
 
04:04:27.229 --> 04:04:27.239 align:start position:0%
around um like the gig economy like
 
04:04:29.870 --> 04:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
specifically ride share apps um Airbnb
 
04:04:33.110 --> 04:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
things like that um for instance if I
 
04:04:34.990 --> 04:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
download if I download Uber onto my
 
04:04:36.750 --> 04:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
phone and it asks me would you like to
 
04:04:38.790 --> 04:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
share your data and that the question is
 
04:04:41.630 --> 04:04:41.640 align:start position:0%
like always allow or allow while using
 
04:04:44.950 --> 04:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
App um does this at all prevent like
 
04:04:46.870 --> 04:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
this information from being shared to
 
04:04:51.229 --> 04:04:51.239 align:start position:0%
the company for that no purpose no
 
04:04:54.950 --> 04:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
that's an explicit permission from you
 
04:04:58.070 --> 04:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
to them to collect the data what it does
 
04:05:00.070 --> 04:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
it says they can't keep it and give it
 
04:05:02.229 --> 04:05:02.239 align:start position:0%
to somebody
 
04:05:04.950 --> 04:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
else okay so if I could follow up Mr
 
04:05:08.510 --> 04:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
chair um in the Uber app it's says like
 
04:05:11.870 --> 04:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
your ride history and it'll show like
 
04:05:13.590 --> 04:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
where you traveled you know the night
 
04:05:16.110 --> 04:05:16.120 align:start position:0%
before so to get home from a bar like my
 
04:05:18.590 --> 04:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
trip from the bar to my house I can go
 
04:05:21.590 --> 04:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
back into the app and look and see my
 
04:05:23.429 --> 04:05:23.439 align:start position:0%
past trips and how much I spent in the
 
04:05:26.110 --> 04:05:26.120 align:start position:0%
miles and all that other stuff um does
 
04:05:28.990 --> 04:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
that prohibit existing apps from keeping
 
04:05:31.630 --> 04:05:31.640 align:start position:0%
that data so that I could go then go
 
04:05:34.269 --> 04:05:34.279 align:start position:0%
back and refer to that data um moving
 
04:05:37.469 --> 04:05:37.479 align:start position:0%
forward so they're keeping what you
 
04:05:39.070 --> 04:05:39.080 align:start position:0%
described they're keeping it for your
 
04:05:42.189 --> 04:05:42.199 align:start position:0%
personal use so I see no reason why
 
04:05:44.830 --> 04:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
they'd be prohibited by this from
 
04:05:47.349 --> 04:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
keeping it for your personal use but if
 
04:05:49.110 --> 04:05:49.120 align:start position:0%
I want to find out where he went last
 
04:05:52.389 --> 04:05:52.399 align:start position:0%
night that's why we're trying to stop
 
04:05:56.030 --> 04:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:02.189 --> 04:06:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:05.309 --> 04:06:05.319 align:start position:0%
Oregon you need to
 
04:06:07.950 --> 04:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
unmute people probably wish I people
 
04:06:09.229 --> 04:06:09.239 align:start position:0%
want me to have a mute button when we
 
04:06:11.189 --> 04:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
get back to meeting in person I'm sure
 
04:06:13.510 --> 04:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
but anyway president wer you brought up
 
04:06:17.830 --> 04:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh for some reason the uh the uh what
 
04:06:19.469 --> 04:06:19.479 align:start position:0%
the events of the US capital which I
 
04:06:20.950 --> 04:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
actually would term as a terrorist
 
04:06:22.710 --> 04:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
attack or at least anyway Le a pretty
 
04:06:25.870 --> 04:06:25.880 align:start position:0%
upsetting thing and um and you seem to
 
04:06:28.429 --> 04:06:28.439 align:start position:0%
be you seem to think it was a bad thing
 
04:06:31.510 --> 04:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
that uh that these individuals were able
 
04:06:33.790 --> 04:06:33.800 align:start position:0%
to be caught by using their cell phone
 
04:06:36.910 --> 04:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
data um and so that is that what you
 
04:06:39.149 --> 04:06:39.159 align:start position:0%
meant and but first I also want to point
 
04:06:41.670 --> 04:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
out there there is a a line two sections
 
04:06:45.030 --> 04:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
12 through 16 there does seem to be a uh
 
04:06:46.550 --> 04:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
section that would allow you to use the
 
04:06:48.870 --> 04:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
cell phone data if for some reason a bob
 
04:06:51.429 --> 04:06:51.439 align:start position:0%
decid terrorist decided to invade our
 
04:06:54.349 --> 04:06:54.359 align:start position:0%
cap our state house and or commit any
 
04:06:59.469 --> 04:06:59.479 align:start position:0%
other similar crime and also uh also how
 
04:07:02.550 --> 04:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
is how is this affected by the fact that
 
04:07:03.870 --> 04:07:03.880 align:start position:0%
many of the individuals who've been
 
04:07:06.269 --> 04:07:06.279 align:start position:0%
arrested actually willingly shared where
 
04:07:07.469 --> 04:07:07.479 align:start position:0%
they are went out of their way to tell
 
04:07:08.750 --> 04:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
the world what they were doing thought
 
04:07:10.469 --> 04:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
it was a good idea at the time and for
 
04:07:12.510 --> 04:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
whatever reason uh turned out not to be
 
04:07:14.790 --> 04:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
such a good idea so
 
04:07:17.550 --> 04:07:17.560 align:start position:0%
um how does the bill how does the bill
 
04:07:19.389 --> 04:07:19.399 align:start position:0%
first of all I guess I mean you might or
 
04:07:21.670 --> 04:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
might not want to say whether or not you
 
04:07:21.680 --> 04:07:22.830 align:start position:0%
might not want to say whether or not you
actually

04:07:22.830 --> 04:07:22.840 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:07:25.030 --> 04:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
support storming of the capital which
 
04:07:26.870 --> 04:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty sure you didn't mean to say
 
04:07:29.550 --> 04:07:29.560 align:start position:0%
but also like how does how does that
 
04:07:31.990 --> 04:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
affect a situation A where serious crime
 
04:07:34.429 --> 04:07:34.439 align:start position:0%
is being committed in the person is uh
 
04:07:36.109 --> 04:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
especially when some of the people are
 
04:07:37.229 --> 04:07:37.239 align:start position:0%
committing the serious crime are
 
04:07:38.750 --> 04:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
actually like willingly sharing it on
 
04:07:40.670 --> 04:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
social media and
 
04:07:43.189 --> 04:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
elsewhere thanks so we'll take the
 
04:07:46.030 --> 04:07:46.040 align:start position:0%
second part first the thing that you
 
04:07:49.389 --> 04:07:49.399 align:start position:0%
share willingly in any public for like
 
04:07:53.070 --> 04:07:53.080 align:start position:0%
social media is public information it's
 
04:07:55.830 --> 04:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
you you've lost your right to privacy
 
04:07:58.349 --> 04:07:58.359 align:start position:0%
when you put it on Facebook or Instagram
 
04:08:00.750 --> 04:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
or Twitter or something like that right
 
04:08:03.790 --> 04:08:03.800 align:start position:0%
you have sacrifi you've given it up
 
04:08:06.510 --> 04:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
right so if they get it from monitoring
 
04:08:08.349 --> 04:08:08.359 align:start position:0%
that type of thing
 
04:08:10.630 --> 04:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
then that's perfectly fine that's just
 
04:08:12.550 --> 04:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
public information it's not subject to
 
04:08:14.349 --> 04:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
your privacy right
 
04:08:18.349 --> 04:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
anymore so there's that on the other
 
04:08:21.109 --> 04:08:21.119 align:start position:0%
hand if we have a demonstration in front
 
04:08:24.189 --> 04:08:24.199 align:start position:0%
of the governor's
 
04:08:27.990 --> 04:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
house and if somebody does something to
 
04:08:32.229 --> 04:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
the governor's house I don't think that
 
04:08:36.670 --> 04:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
law enforcement should be able to go to
 
04:08:38.429 --> 04:08:38.439 align:start position:0%
uh AT&amp;T of
 
04:08:42.149 --> 04:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
Horizon and say or anybody and say I
 
04:08:44.229 --> 04:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
want to know everybody that was within
 
04:08:46.750 --> 04:08:46.760 align:start position:0%
500 feet of the governor's
 
04:08:48.870 --> 04:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
house and get that
 
04:08:50.710 --> 04:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
information I don't think they should be
 
04:08:53.269 --> 04:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
able to do that if they have a
 
04:08:53.279 --> 04:08:54.790 align:start position:0%
able to do that if they have a
specific

04:08:54.790 --> 04:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
specific
 
04:08:58.550 --> 04:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
reason New Hampshire Law requires right
 
04:09:00.349 --> 04:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
now for law enforcement to get your
 
04:09:02.710 --> 04:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
location data under the RSA
 
04:09:06.510 --> 04:09:06.520 align:start position:0%
644 a warrant signed by a
 
04:09:06.520 --> 04:09:08.830 align:start position:0%
644 a warrant signed by a
judge

04:09:08.830 --> 04:09:08.840 align:start position:0%
judge
 
04:09:12.429 --> 04:09:12.439 align:start position:0%
this is not as severe as
 
04:09:15.389 --> 04:09:15.399 align:start position:0%
that but it's along the same line and
 
04:09:16.790 --> 04:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
it's been suggested to me this should
 
04:09:19.830 --> 04:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
have been put in RSA 644 for that reason
 
04:09:22.309 --> 04:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
but I didn't draft it ol did that and we
 
04:09:23.950 --> 04:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
can talk about that as we go forward in
 
04:09:26.510 --> 04:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
the committee but I don't I just don't
 
04:09:26.520 --> 04:09:27.550 align:start position:0%
the committee but I don't I just don't
believe

04:09:27.550 --> 04:09:27.560 align:start position:0%
believe
 
04:09:29.710 --> 04:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
that if we have a right against
 
04:09:32.109 --> 04:09:32.119 align:start position:0%
unreasonable searches it seems to me
 
04:09:33.990 --> 04:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
that I want to know anybody that was
 
04:09:36.870 --> 04:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
within a substantial area of any
 
04:09:39.870 --> 04:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
particular ways is an unwarranted search
 
04:09:41.389 --> 04:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
on those people
 
04:09:46.670 --> 04:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:49.269 --> 04:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
anything did you have a followup to that
 
04:09:51.790 --> 04:09:51.800 align:start position:0%
represent how how General principle is
 
04:09:54.070 --> 04:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
that I mean it's one thing one thing if
 
04:09:56.149 --> 04:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
you're peacefully protesting but U you
 
04:09:57.590 --> 04:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
know certainly what happened to Capital
 
04:09:59.189 --> 04:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
turned something was far from peaceful
 
04:10:01.750 --> 04:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
or even demonstration the governor's
 
04:10:04.429 --> 04:10:04.439 align:start position:0%
house you know uh it's not view that's
 
04:10:06.750 --> 04:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
uh something at least seems to be uh
 
04:10:08.269 --> 04:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
perceived at least by the governor the
 
04:10:10.309 --> 04:10:10.319 align:start position:0%
family is being uh crossing the line
 
04:10:12.469 --> 04:10:12.479 align:start position:0%
from demonstrating to harassment and the
 
04:10:14.790 --> 04:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
town even has an ordinance against it
 
04:10:16.670 --> 04:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
which may or may not hold up in court so
 
04:10:18.910 --> 04:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
like where's where's the line between a
 
04:10:20.469 --> 04:10:20.479 align:start position:0%
situation where somebody's just
 
04:10:22.109 --> 04:10:22.119 align:start position:0%
peacefully protesting and where they're
 
04:10:26.030 --> 04:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
actually uh you know potentially or even
 
04:10:28.950 --> 04:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
actually committing a crime so it's a
 
04:10:31.750 --> 04:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
fascinating question to think about and
 
04:10:33.309 --> 04:10:33.319 align:start position:0%
I would
 
04:10:35.710 --> 04:10:35.720 align:start position:0%
um pretty much
 
04:10:38.349 --> 04:10:38.359 align:start position:0%
agree that it's not an easy thing to
 
04:10:40.590 --> 04:10:40.600 align:start position:0%
Define so let's just say there were only
 
04:10:43.109 --> 04:10:43.119 align:start position:0%
10,000 people at that demonstration in
 
04:10:47.269 --> 04:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
Washington only right and as far as I
 
04:10:48.870 --> 04:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
know they've actually found something
 
04:10:50.389 --> 04:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
like a hundred people who reached a
 
04:10:53.070 --> 04:10:53.080 align:start position:0%
capital building that's a one out of
 
04:10:55.149 --> 04:10:55.159 align:start position:0%
every 100 people at the demonstration I
 
04:10:56.469 --> 04:10:56.479 align:start position:0%
don't think they should be able to get
 
04:10:59.189 --> 04:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
10,000 people's location data to try and
 
04:11:02.510 --> 04:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
find the 100 I just I don't think that's
 
04:11:05.469 --> 04:11:05.479 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
04:11:11.950 --> 04:11:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:15.630 --> 04:11:15.640 align:start position:0%
Chase question I'm just curious and this
 
04:11:17.910 --> 04:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
may not even apply but you know those
 
04:11:20.309 --> 04:11:20.319 align:start position:0%
trackers that people can put on phones
 
04:11:21.910 --> 04:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
for other people so that they're
 
04:11:24.030 --> 04:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
tracking say their girlfriend or
 
04:11:27.189 --> 04:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
boyfriend or kids and and as you may
 
04:11:29.550 --> 04:11:29.560 align:start position:0%
remember from the floor you know there
 
04:11:29.560 --> 04:11:31.070 align:start position:0%
remember from the floor you know there
there

04:11:31.070 --> 04:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:11:33.590 --> 04:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
are can you guys hear me or we listening
 
04:11:35.469 --> 04:11:35.479 align:start position:0%
to somebody else can now we're having a
 
04:11:38.790 --> 04:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
little interference okay
 
04:11:42.469 --> 04:11:42.479 align:start position:0%
all right so the trackers that parents
 
04:11:45.510 --> 04:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
put on or people put on to track other
 
04:11:47.590 --> 04:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
people you have to buy those from
 
04:11:49.630 --> 04:11:49.640 align:start position:0%
somewhere or they're an app is this
 
04:11:52.630 --> 04:11:52.640 align:start position:0%
going to be under that um this
 
04:11:52.640 --> 04:11:54.429 align:start position:0%
going to be under that um this
[Music]

04:11:54.429 --> 04:11:54.439 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:11:56.950 --> 04:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
ruling because it seems to me that a lot
 
04:11:58.830 --> 04:11:58.840 align:start position:0%
of these people that are being tracked
 
04:12:01.950 --> 04:12:01.960 align:start position:0%
don't even know that they are and that
 
04:12:04.590 --> 04:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
would irritate me to no end so is this
 
04:12:06.269 --> 04:12:06.279 align:start position:0%
something where it would be a
 
04:12:10.309 --> 04:12:10.319 align:start position:0%
communication um business who sells the
 
04:12:13.830 --> 04:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
tracker device to someone or the app to
 
04:12:16.750 --> 04:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
follow another person without there
 
04:12:19.670 --> 04:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
knowing so I don't think that the
 
04:12:22.710 --> 04:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
provider the app developer or whoever
 
04:12:26.070 --> 04:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
sold it as as you suggest can be held
 
04:12:28.229 --> 04:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
responsible for the uses to which that
 
04:12:29.550 --> 04:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
app is
 
04:12:33.510 --> 04:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
put right okay so if it's the developer
 
04:12:35.990 --> 04:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
themselves who are keeping all the data
 
04:12:37.510 --> 04:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
from everything that comes through that
 
04:12:40.790 --> 04:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
app then yes it would apply to them but
 
04:12:43.790 --> 04:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
if somebody who bought the app and is
 
04:12:48.510 --> 04:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
just being a bad person then no okay
 
04:12:48.520 --> 04:12:49.349 align:start position:0%
just being a bad person then no okay
thank

04:12:49.349 --> 04:12:49.359 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:12:54.149 --> 04:12:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:57.349 --> 04:12:57.359 align:start position:0%
Simpson hi yes thank you for taking my
 
04:13:00.630 --> 04:13:00.640 align:start position:0%
question representative welper um I've
 
04:13:02.550 --> 04:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
been thinking about the public health
 
04:13:05.870 --> 04:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
implications here I I know some colleges
 
04:13:09.229 --> 04:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
have been using contact tracing apps uh
 
04:13:11.070 --> 04:13:11.080 align:start position:0%
so they can avoid uh Corona virus
 
04:13:13.710 --> 04:13:13.720 align:start position:0%
outbreaks and thankfully we haven't had
 
04:13:16.469 --> 04:13:16.479 align:start position:0%
to resort to anything like that in New
 
04:13:19.349 --> 04:13:19.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um in this pandemic but I I'm
 
04:13:22.070 --> 04:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
wondering um how something like this
 
04:13:23.830 --> 04:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
would affect if there were if we were
 
04:13:25.830 --> 04:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
ever under dire circumstances and we
 
04:13:28.429 --> 04:13:28.439 align:start position:0%
couldn't contain an outbreak for example
 
04:13:31.830 --> 04:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
and we um needed to even temporarily put
 
04:13:34.950 --> 04:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
some kind of contact tracing um get some
 
04:13:36.710 --> 04:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
kind of contact tracing data from
 
04:13:38.389 --> 04:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
people's phones I know some countries
 
04:13:41.550 --> 04:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
have done that um I'm wondering if there
 
04:13:45.109 --> 04:13:45.119 align:start position:0%
could be an exception in section four
 
04:13:47.269 --> 04:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
not just for law enforcement purposes
 
04:13:50.510 --> 04:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
but like extreme Public Health
 
04:13:52.670 --> 04:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
emergencies or something like that what
 
04:13:54.750 --> 04:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
what do you think about
 
04:13:57.189 --> 04:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
that well it's an interesting question
 
04:14:00.590 --> 04:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
and it's a difficult one so on the one
 
04:14:02.710 --> 04:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
hand I kind of like to agree that maybe
 
04:14:05.590 --> 04:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
there should be but take for example
 
04:14:06.950 --> 04:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about right now with
 
04:14:06.960 --> 04:14:07.790 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about right now with
the

04:14:07.790 --> 04:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:14:10.070 --> 04:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
virus if we're going to do that we're
 
04:14:11.870 --> 04:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
going to have to say something along the
 
04:14:11.880 --> 04:14:12.990 align:start position:0%
going to have to say something along the
lines

04:14:12.990 --> 04:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
lines
 
04:14:16.309 --> 04:14:16.319 align:start position:0%
of if the government wants to find out
 
04:14:19.309 --> 04:14:19.319 align:start position:0%
everyone who's been in contact with this
 
04:14:24.870 --> 04:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
person for a period of two weeks or
 
04:14:27.670 --> 04:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
longer they can do
 
04:14:31.429 --> 04:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
that I'm very nervous about that very
 
04:14:33.710 --> 04:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
nervous so I would I would I don't think
 
04:14:37.389 --> 04:14:37.399 align:start position:0%
we want to go that far at all right if
 
04:14:39.510 --> 04:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to do anything like that
 
04:14:40.990 --> 04:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
then I think it would have to be very
 
04:14:43.710 --> 04:14:43.720 align:start position:0%
narrowly crafted to within a day or
 
04:14:45.710 --> 04:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
maybe a couple
 
04:14:48.590 --> 04:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
days I don't know I'm skeptical that's
 
04:14:51.269 --> 04:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
why we already have RSA 644 it's because
 
04:14:52.429 --> 04:14:52.439 align:start position:0%
we've already looked at this and said
 
04:14:54.229 --> 04:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
look if the Law Enforcement wants to do
 
04:14:57.309 --> 04:14:57.319 align:start position:0%
it they have to get a warrant so in the
 
04:14:59.830 --> 04:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
public health area I can see there might
 
04:15:01.830 --> 04:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
be some benefit to it but I'm very
 
04:15:04.070 --> 04:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
concerned about a potential abuses being
 
04:15:06.149 --> 04:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
much larger than in the law enforcement
 
04:15:06.159 --> 04:15:07.670 align:start position:0%
much larger than in the law enforcement
area

04:15:07.670 --> 04:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
area
 
04:15:07.680 --> 04:15:10.070 align:start position:0%
area
my

04:15:10.070 --> 04:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:15:13.510 --> 04:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
comment represent representative Silber
 
04:15:14.950 --> 04:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:15:19.309 --> 04:15:19.319 align:start position:0%
my question really two questions one uh
 
04:15:23.590 --> 04:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
in on page two lines two and three it
 
04:15:26.950 --> 04:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
talks about uh the prohibition shall
 
04:15:28.830 --> 04:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
share shall not share a customer
 
04:15:31.870 --> 04:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
location data was collected while the
 
04:15:34.349 --> 04:15:34.359 align:start position:0%
customer's Rob mobile communication
 
04:15:37.030 --> 04:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
device was were physically present in
 
04:15:39.830 --> 04:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
the town or city why is that language
 
04:15:41.750 --> 04:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
important here it's
 
04:15:44.950 --> 04:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
not and that's why removed well it will
 
04:15:46.990 --> 04:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
be removed by the amendment that I uh
 
04:15:50.389 --> 04:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
talked to first right for early on
 
04:15:54.189 --> 04:15:54.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment 01558 says customers location
 
04:15:56.109 --> 04:15:56.119 align:start position:0%
data on line it's line four of the
 
04:15:59.149 --> 04:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
amendment but I think it's line two of
 
04:16:02.670 --> 04:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
the of the bill other than to fulfill
 
04:16:04.870 --> 04:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
explicit request from such customer
 
04:16:07.269 --> 04:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
unless the customer is affirmative who W
 
04:16:10.710 --> 04:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
the right it's extremely Broad and
 
04:16:16.030 --> 04:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
targeted and says they cannot share the
 
04:16:19.830 --> 04:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
data with absent an explicit request for
 
04:16:22.950 --> 04:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
you or in a waiver that you have
 
04:16:25.429 --> 04:16:25.439 align:start position:0%
explicitly been informed and let them
 
04:16:29.030 --> 04:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
have it okay a quick followup Mr chair
 
04:16:33.229 --> 04:16:33.239 align:start position:0%
certainly uh why is this limited to
 
04:16:33.239 --> 04:16:35.229 align:start position:0%
certainly uh why is this limited to
mobile

04:16:35.229 --> 04:16:35.239 align:start position:0%
mobile
 
04:16:38.229 --> 04:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
devices why is this because if I go on
 
04:16:41.550 --> 04:16:41.560 align:start position:0%
the web and I go to a site it it's for
 
04:16:43.590 --> 04:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
my for my desktop and not a mobile
 
04:16:46.790 --> 04:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
device frequently the site will say the
 
04:16:48.870 --> 04:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
site wants to wants you to share your
 
04:16:53.030 --> 04:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
location data yes no why is this limited
 
04:16:54.870 --> 04:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
why is this limited just to mobile
 
04:16:57.750 --> 04:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
devices not to all
 
04:17:00.070 --> 04:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
devices well I guess the reason is
 
04:17:04.590 --> 04:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
because we didn't consider the fixed
 
04:17:08.750 --> 04:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
device as being
 
04:17:10.269 --> 04:17:10.279 align:start position:0%
it doesn't move around so it's always
 
04:17:11.630 --> 04:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
going to give the same
 
04:17:15.550 --> 04:17:15.560 align:start position:0%
answer so but from a PRI from a privacy
 
04:17:18.469 --> 04:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
perspective if if if they take my
 
04:17:21.590 --> 04:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
location data from my fixed location and
 
04:17:23.189 --> 04:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
they then aggregate that and they sell
 
04:17:25.070 --> 04:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
it to these data mining companies or
 
04:17:26.990 --> 04:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
something else it's got the same privacy
 
04:17:30.030 --> 04:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:34.189 --> 04:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
it maybe maybe
 
04:17:38.429 --> 04:17:38.439 align:start position:0%
so I know that take right now now and
 
04:17:40.469 --> 04:17:40.479 align:start position:0%
Trace anything that comes into one
 
04:17:43.710 --> 04:17:43.720 align:start position:0%
computer to the geophysical location of
 
04:17:46.030 --> 04:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
the or of of
 
04:17:49.950 --> 04:17:49.960 align:start position:0%
origin right yeah they can do that
 
04:17:51.790 --> 04:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
through why I don't know how they do it
 
04:17:55.070 --> 04:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
but they can do it right so I can't stop
 
04:17:57.910 --> 04:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:01.030 --> 04:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
that I we just didn't think think of it
 
04:18:03.950 --> 04:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of a fixed
 
04:18:06.910 --> 04:18:06.920 align:start position:0%
asset okay thank you I I just I'm just I
 
04:18:08.990 --> 04:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
was just a curious why there was limited
 
04:18:10.910 --> 04:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's all because seems to me
 
04:18:13.189 --> 04:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
that the same privacy concerns would be
 
04:18:16.510 --> 04:18:16.520 align:start position:0%
valid as well for a fixed location well
 
04:18:17.950 --> 04:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
if you want to work up an amendment with
 
04:18:20.429 --> 04:18:20.439 align:start position:0%
me we'll talk about
 
04:18:23.109 --> 04:18:23.119 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
04:18:25.670 --> 04:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
Alexander um thank you and thank you um
 
04:18:26.990 --> 04:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
representative welper for letting me ask
 
04:18:29.510 --> 04:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
another question um I'm asking would
 
04:18:32.469 --> 04:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
this also prohibit um selling location
 
04:18:35.510 --> 04:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
data um when the like when it's
 
04:18:37.510 --> 04:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
Anonymous so for in I guess my question
 
04:18:41.070 --> 04:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
is like usually companies would use that
 
04:18:42.910 --> 04:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
aggregate information to determine like
 
04:18:44.990 --> 04:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
the needs of their um company or
 
04:18:47.109 --> 04:18:47.119 align:start position:0%
industry in a certain city or how it's
 
04:18:49.550 --> 04:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
used um would this also prohibit the
 
04:18:51.950 --> 04:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
company from storing it anonymously for
 
04:18:55.109 --> 04:18:55.119 align:start position:0%
those reasons for like their internal uh
 
04:18:58.030 --> 04:18:58.040 align:start position:0%
use I don't think
 
04:19:00.389 --> 04:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
so it's the best answer I can give you
 
04:19:01.790 --> 04:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
there's there's a lot of things that
 
04:19:03.790 --> 04:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
happen in the cyber world that I can't
 
04:19:06.910 --> 04:19:06.920 align:start position:0%
speak to but no I don't think so it's if
 
04:19:09.389 --> 04:19:09.399 align:start position:0%
they just say you know we have a 200
 
04:19:11.349 --> 04:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
users in the town of straford and this
 
04:19:14.510 --> 04:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
is what they do or this is what I I
 
04:19:16.870 --> 04:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
can't see why that would be a problem
 
04:19:19.149 --> 04:19:19.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
04:19:22.389 --> 04:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
you are there other questions I thought
 
04:19:24.229 --> 04:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
I saw your hand up representative Smith
 
04:19:28.670 --> 04:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
at one point in time do you have a
 
04:19:33.750 --> 04:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
question no and I I did have one one
 
04:19:36.030 --> 04:19:36.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up question this was this gets
 
04:19:39.109 --> 04:19:39.119 align:start position:0%
back to the IDE idea of you
 
04:19:42.550 --> 04:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
have 30 people outside the governor's
 
04:19:46.870 --> 04:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
home somebody commits a criminal
 
04:19:50.349 --> 04:19:50.359 align:start position:0%
act is it your intent that this bill
 
04:19:53.469 --> 04:19:53.479 align:start position:0%
would prohibit the police from
 
04:19:56.429 --> 04:19:56.439 align:start position:0%
determining who was at that location at
 
04:20:00.550 --> 04:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:03.189 --> 04:20:03.199 align:start position:0%
committed so the police right now have
 
04:20:04.670 --> 04:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
to get a
 
04:20:07.830 --> 04:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
warrant right
 
04:20:10.469 --> 04:20:10.479 align:start position:0%
so that's what I meant with a warrant
 
04:20:12.830 --> 04:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
well I said no
 
04:20:15.950 --> 04:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
because law enforce law in here in the
 
04:20:17.710 --> 04:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
exceptions of a law enforcement agency
 
04:20:19.670 --> 04:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
in response to a lawful process in
 
04:20:19.680 --> 04:20:20.950 align:start position:0%
in response to a lawful process in
section

04:20:20.950 --> 04:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:20:23.030 --> 04:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
4A they can they can give the
 
04:20:25.510 --> 04:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
information to them but they have but
 
04:20:27.149 --> 04:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
for answer law they have to have a
 
04:20:27.159 --> 04:20:29.109 align:start position:0%
for answer law they have to have a
warrant

04:20:29.109 --> 04:20:29.119 align:start position:0%
warrant
 
04:20:31.950 --> 04:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
right okay you you can tell me if you
 
04:20:33.269 --> 04:20:33.279 align:start position:0%
get a warrant for all the people whe
 
04:20:34.670 --> 04:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
they're around this house at a certain
 
04:20:37.229 --> 04:20:37.239 align:start position:0%
time I don't know that you could
 
04:20:40.990 --> 04:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:41.000 --> 04:20:42.510 align:start position:0%
 
could

04:20:42.510 --> 04:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
could
 
04:20:45.109 --> 04:20:45.119 align:start position:0%
okay and are there any other questions
 
04:20:47.550 --> 04:20:47.560 align:start position:0%
for representative
 
04:20:49.830 --> 04:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
wper seeing none thank you for your
 
04:20:52.790 --> 04:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
testimony today thank you Mr chairman
 
04:20:55.030 --> 04:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:20:58.030 --> 04:20:58.040 align:start position:0%
committee there was actually no one else
 
04:21:02.229 --> 04:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
who who uh pre-registered to speak today
 
04:21:04.309 --> 04:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
but we do have some people who have
 
04:21:07.149 --> 04:21:07.159 align:start position:0%
their hands up one of whom is
 
04:21:07.159 --> 04:21:08.990 align:start position:0%
their hands up one of whom is
representative

04:21:08.990 --> 04:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:21:11.109 --> 04:21:11.119 align:start position:0%
yella representative yella would you
 
04:21:14.710 --> 04:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:17.670 --> 04:21:17.680 align:start position:0%
testify yes I
 
04:21:21.349 --> 04:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
would you may proceed thank you Mr
 
04:21:25.189 --> 04:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
chairman I wanted to uh speak to the
 
04:21:31.750 --> 04:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
committee today about uh this bill HB
 
04:21:36.429 --> 04:21:36.439 align:start position:0%
384 and I am currently in opposition to
 
04:21:40.070 --> 04:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
to this legislation I believe
 
04:21:43.710 --> 04:21:43.720 align:start position:0%
that um it as written even with the
 
04:21:50.510 --> 04:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
amendment proposed is contrary to um the
 
04:21:50.520 --> 04:21:52.229 align:start position:0%
amendment proposed is contrary to um the
protections

04:21:52.229 --> 04:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
protections
 
04:21:56.790 --> 04:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
that that should be uh provided for
 
04:22:01.109 --> 04:22:01.119 align:start position:0%
under under our law um I think that uh
 
04:22:05.389 --> 04:22:05.399 align:start position:0%
it has major problems in so far as
 
04:22:07.309 --> 04:22:07.319 align:start position:0%
chapter 64
 
04:22:12.070 --> 04:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
4A uh talks about uh location
 
04:22:14.750 --> 04:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
information and this bill talks about
 
04:22:17.630 --> 04:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
location data and there is some
 
04:22:20.349 --> 04:22:20.359 align:start position:0%
confusion as to what those two what is
 
04:22:23.229 --> 04:22:23.239 align:start position:0%
the difference between those two things
 
04:22:27.750 --> 04:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
also there is specific uh requirements
 
04:22:27.760 --> 04:22:28.790 align:start position:0%
also there is specific uh requirements
in

04:22:28.790 --> 04:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:22:34.109 --> 04:22:34.119 align:start position:0%
644a that require search warrants and
 
04:22:37.590 --> 04:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
this uh bill
 
04:22:39.710 --> 04:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
has um its
 
04:22:44.550 --> 04:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
own language for what uh law enforcement
 
04:22:48.590 --> 04:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
agencies um are allowed to get the
 
04:22:52.070 --> 04:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
information from and it in nowhere in
 
04:22:56.670 --> 04:22:56.680 align:start position:0%
this does it say uh required a warrant
 
04:22:59.750 --> 04:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
whereas in 644a it does require a
 
04:23:05.590 --> 04:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
warrant and so my concern is that there
 
04:23:10.710 --> 04:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
is some conf usion and maybe uh either
 
04:23:13.030 --> 04:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
we need to look at both of these
 
04:23:16.710 --> 04:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
sections of RSA and combine them or
 
04:23:19.389 --> 04:23:19.399 align:start position:0%
reference um because this bill seems to
 
04:23:21.590 --> 04:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
be more focused at not government
 
04:23:25.870 --> 04:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
agencies which would be uh the issue but
 
04:23:27.469 --> 04:23:27.479 align:start position:0%
uh in uh
 
04:23:31.309 --> 04:23:31.319 align:start position:0%
644a and in the Constitutional Amendment
 
04:23:33.349 --> 04:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
it would be directed at government
 
04:23:35.429 --> 04:23:35.439 align:start position:0%
agencies not private organizations and
 
04:23:39.149 --> 04:23:39.159 align:start position:0%
what they do um this kind of also has a
 
04:23:41.349 --> 04:23:41.359 align:start position:0%
potential to get
 
04:23:45.149 --> 04:23:45.159 align:start position:0%
into uh whether or not people are able
 
04:23:45.159 --> 04:23:46.149 align:start position:0%
into uh whether or not people are able
to

04:23:46.149 --> 04:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:23:49.189 --> 04:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
contract uh if
 
04:23:52.510 --> 04:23:52.520 align:start position:0%
they about sharing their data
 
04:23:56.070 --> 04:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
and I think that so this this bill is
 
04:23:58.309 --> 04:23:58.319 align:start position:0%
more focused on the private market and
 
04:24:01.349 --> 04:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
not as much on the government
 
04:24:05.189 --> 04:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
protections and in the
 
04:24:09.070 --> 04:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
presentation uh from the sponsor it
 
04:24:14.790 --> 04:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
seems also that the goal of this bill is
 
04:24:17.070 --> 04:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
actually not achieved by the bill even
 
04:24:20.309 --> 04:24:20.319 align:start position:0%
if it was to pass
 
04:24:24.149 --> 04:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
um the the main reason why government
 
04:24:29.429 --> 04:24:29.439 align:start position:0%
agencies are able to get um data from
 
04:24:31.790 --> 04:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
the common carriers like phone calls and
 
04:24:38.429 --> 04:24:38.439 align:start position:0%
telephone companies is um the via RSA
 
04:24:42.389 --> 04:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
571a colon 1 which I have a bill to try
 
04:24:42.399 --> 04:24:44.189 align:start position:0%
571a colon 1 which I have a bill to try
and

04:24:44.189 --> 04:24:44.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:24:49.670 --> 04:24:49.680 align:start position:0%
um uh limit their access to and uh make
 
04:24:53.389 --> 04:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
sure that they uh get a warrant and so
 
04:24:56.229 --> 04:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
my concern is more from the implications
 
04:24:58.510 --> 04:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
of this bill and how it's written seem
 
04:25:01.910 --> 04:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
to be opening up kind of a back door to
 
04:25:01.920 --> 04:25:02.910 align:start position:0%
to be opening up kind of a back door to
government

04:25:02.910 --> 04:25:02.920 align:start position:0%
government
 
04:25:07.790 --> 04:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
agencies uh if the
 
04:25:10.429 --> 04:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
because because of the the language that
 
04:25:12.950 --> 04:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
is used how it's defined and that
 
04:25:15.389 --> 04:25:15.399 align:start position:0%
there's um multiple rsas dealing with
 
04:25:17.950 --> 04:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
the same type of information so thank
 
04:25:21.309 --> 04:25:21.319 align:start position:0%
you for uh letting me testify thank
 
04:25:23.590 --> 04:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
you are there any questions for
 
04:25:23.600 --> 04:25:27.750 align:start position:0%
you are there any questions for
representative

04:25:27.750 --> 04:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:30.030 --> 04:25:30.040 align:start position:0%
yella seeing none thank thank you for
 
04:25:32.229 --> 04:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
04:25:34.830 --> 04:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
today the next person who has their hand
 
04:25:49.269 --> 04:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:49.279 --> 04:25:53.109 align:start position:0%
 
ber

04:25:53.109 --> 04:25:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:01.149 --> 04:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:03.149 --> 04:26:03.159 align:start position:0%
there good afternoon members of the
 
04:26:05.670 --> 04:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
committee are you able to hear me we are
 
04:26:09.149 --> 04:26:09.159 align:start position:0%
excellent my name is Joseph Ebert it's
 
04:26:11.590 --> 04:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
EB I'm a captain with the New Hampshire
 
04:26:13.550 --> 04:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
State Police and I oversee our
 
04:26:15.670 --> 04:26:15.680 align:start position:0%
Investigative Services Bureau which is
 
04:26:18.950 --> 04:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
the detectives within the state police
 
04:26:21.309 --> 04:26:21.319 align:start position:0%
uh so I I reviewed this bill on behalf
 
04:26:23.790 --> 04:26:23.800 align:start position:0%
of the division and I didn't I don't
 
04:26:26.309 --> 04:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
have any issue uh that I need to bring
 
04:26:28.670 --> 04:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
forward with how it's written although
 
04:26:30.109 --> 04:26:30.119 align:start position:0%
uh representative Gordon I thought your
 
04:26:32.750 --> 04:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
question was exactly what my concern was
 
04:26:36.309 --> 04:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
it seemed that uh the Bill's sponsor uh
 
04:26:39.830 --> 04:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
his testimony unintentionally no doubt
 
04:26:42.269 --> 04:26:42.279 align:start position:0%
seem to differ a little bit from what
 
04:26:46.070 --> 04:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
the bill stated so my concern was uh it
 
04:26:48.790 --> 04:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
seemed like he was not in favor of what
 
04:26:50.750 --> 04:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
would commonly be referred to as a tower
 
04:26:53.830 --> 04:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
dump uh which is when there is a crime
 
04:26:56.630 --> 04:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
that's committed in uh close proximity
 
04:26:59.750 --> 04:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh to a Cellular Tower and law
 
04:27:02.389 --> 04:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement obtains a a court order or a
 
04:27:05.349 --> 04:27:05.359 align:start position:0%
warrant uh to have access to those
 
04:27:07.149 --> 04:27:07.159 align:start position:0%
individuals were within proximity of
 
04:27:07.159 --> 04:27:07.870 align:start position:0%
individuals were within proximity of
that

04:27:07.870 --> 04:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:27:07.880 --> 04:27:09.550 align:start position:0%
that
Tower

04:27:09.550 --> 04:27:09.560 align:start position:0%
Tower
 
04:27:12.229 --> 04:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
um that that is a warrant process but
 
04:27:13.710 --> 04:27:13.720 align:start position:0%
what what I was concerned with is it
 
04:27:15.790 --> 04:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
seemed he seemed to be saying that he
 
04:27:18.149 --> 04:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
disagreed with that uh because there
 
04:27:20.910 --> 04:27:20.920 align:start position:0%
would be people who uh inevitably in
 
04:27:22.750 --> 04:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
that situation have not committed a
 
04:27:24.429 --> 04:27:24.439 align:start position:0%
crime but whose information would be
 
04:27:27.269 --> 04:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
shared with law enforcement after uh we
 
04:27:30.510 --> 04:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
had obtained a warrant and to that
 
04:27:33.670 --> 04:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
extent if that is in fact uh his uh
 
04:27:36.870 --> 04:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
feeling or the feeling of uh many people
 
04:27:38.750 --> 04:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
I wanted to put forward to the committee
 
04:27:41.790 --> 04:27:41.800 align:start position:0%
that that is a an incredibly important
 
04:27:44.710 --> 04:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh tool that law enforcement uses uh it
 
04:27:47.990 --> 04:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
is done with uh great scrutiny both from
 
04:27:49.750 --> 04:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
the court system as well as from law
 
04:27:53.229 --> 04:27:53.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement as to uh to not invade the
 
04:27:55.149 --> 04:27:55.159 align:start position:0%
privacy of anybody who is not involved
 
04:27:59.349 --> 04:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
in any type of elicit activity um but to
 
04:28:00.750 --> 04:28:00.760 align:start position:0%
uh if there was the chance that this
 
04:28:03.469 --> 04:28:03.479 align:start position:0%
bill would impact the ability to do that
 
04:28:05.269 --> 04:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
uh as somebody who has worked kidnapping
 
04:28:08.109 --> 04:28:08.119 align:start position:0%
cases and homicides I I can speak to
 
04:28:11.149 --> 04:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
both of those as being uh it would it
 
04:28:14.550 --> 04:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
would create uh an obstacle uh in being
 
04:28:16.070 --> 04:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
able to successfully find the
 
04:28:18.469 --> 04:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
perpetrator in in in those cases in some
 
04:28:22.309 --> 04:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
instances so uh again as it's written I
 
04:28:24.229 --> 04:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
have uh no problem because it says for a
 
04:28:26.189 --> 04:28:26.199 align:start position:0%
lawful reason law enforcement can obtain
 
04:28:28.630 --> 04:28:28.640 align:start position:0%
this information as it was testified to
 
04:28:31.070 --> 04:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to clarify that um
 
04:28:32.910 --> 04:28:32.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh the intent is not to
 
04:28:34.710 --> 04:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
prohibit law enforcement from being able
 
04:28:36.630 --> 04:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
to get a cell tower
 
04:28:38.189 --> 04:28:38.199 align:start position:0%
uh and with that I thank the committee
 
04:28:40.389 --> 04:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
very much for the time this morning and
 
04:28:41.950 --> 04:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
I am certainly available or this
 
04:28:43.389 --> 04:28:43.399 align:start position:0%
afternoon as the case may be certainly
 
04:28:45.309 --> 04:28:45.319 align:start position:0%
available for any
 
04:28:48.149 --> 04:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
questions is there anyone who has a
 
04:28:51.670 --> 04:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:54.550 --> 04:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
Eber yes representative
 
04:28:58.670 --> 04:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
Paige Mr Ebert um you mentioned the um
 
04:29:01.670 --> 04:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
scrutiny that is applied with respect to
 
04:29:04.830 --> 04:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
um obtaining a warrant could you just
 
04:29:08.510 --> 04:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
tell us if you're in a position to those
 
04:29:11.510 --> 04:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
what the warrant requirement is what a
 
04:29:12.910 --> 04:29:12.920 align:start position:0%
what has to be demonstrated before a
 
04:29:16.070 --> 04:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
judge could issue a warrant sure so what
 
04:29:17.550 --> 04:29:17.560 align:start position:0%
I can give you is uh a bit of a
 
04:29:19.910 --> 04:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
hypothetical that's based off of many uh
 
04:29:22.429 --> 04:29:22.439 align:start position:0%
instances in which I've been involved in
 
04:29:25.670 --> 04:29:25.680 align:start position:0%
but uh for example um in a kidnapping
 
04:29:28.189 --> 04:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
situation we will have a very long
 
04:29:32.149 --> 04:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
affidavit um that lays out all of uh the
 
04:29:33.910 --> 04:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
evidence that leads us to believe that
 
04:29:35.990 --> 04:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
the crime was committed Within the
 
04:29:38.550 --> 04:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
proximity of that Cellular Tower so
 
04:29:40.870 --> 04:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
there will be a a laundry list of facts
 
04:29:43.870 --> 04:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
and circumstances that say that on this
 
04:29:46.149 --> 04:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
date at this time and is a very defined
 
04:29:49.550 --> 04:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
period of time um and this date at this
 
04:29:51.990 --> 04:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
time we are looking for every cellular
 
04:29:54.590 --> 04:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
number that hit this Tower and we are we
 
04:29:56.990 --> 04:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
are asking for that information because
 
04:29:58.750 --> 04:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
we are trying to find the perpetrator
 
04:30:01.710 --> 04:30:01.720 align:start position:0%
involved in uh taking a child from this
 
04:30:04.590 --> 04:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
location which was uh in close proximity
 
04:30:06.910 --> 04:30:06.920 align:start position:0%
to that Tower so it would not just be a
 
04:30:09.990 --> 04:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
blanket tell it would be unworkable
 
04:30:12.070 --> 04:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
first thing I should say to say give me
 
04:30:13.670 --> 04:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
everything for a week because it's
 
04:30:15.189 --> 04:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
hundreds and hundreds of thousands of
 
04:30:18.349 --> 04:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
numbers it's a time frame and there is
 
04:30:20.349 --> 04:30:20.359 align:start position:0%
an affidavit that goes along with it
 
04:30:22.590 --> 04:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
that says this is why we want this time
 
04:30:25.149 --> 04:30:25.159 align:start position:0%
frame in this specific
 
04:30:27.389 --> 04:30:27.399 align:start position:0%
area thank you for taking my question Mr
 
04:30:27.399 --> 04:30:28.510 align:start position:0%
area thank you for taking my question Mr
Eber

and members of the committee uh my name
 
04:30:58.630 --> 04:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
is Kyle Baker I'm with wrath young and

Pignatelli in coner and I'm here today
 
04:31:03.750 --> 04:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the internet Coalition um
 
04:31:05.750 --> 04:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
to respectfully oppose house building
 
04:31:09.070 --> 04:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
384 um our members feel that this uh
 
04:31:13.229 --> 04:31:13.239 align:start position:0%
bill um is incredibly broadly worded um
 
04:31:15.750 --> 04:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
and could have some serious unintended
 
04:31:18.790 --> 04:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
consequences um the internet Coalition
 
04:31:20.550 --> 04:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
supports wellth thought out and narrowly
 
04:31:22.950 --> 04:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
defined geolocation laws that adequately
 
04:31:25.790 --> 04:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
solve a specific issue uh provide
 
04:31:27.389 --> 04:31:27.399 align:start position:0%
remedies in an effective way and are
 
04:31:29.189 --> 04:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
flexible enough to allow Innovation to
 
04:31:31.670 --> 04:31:31.680 align:start position:0%
flourish while avoiding limiting an
 
04:31:35.030 --> 04:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
entire segment of data um our member
 
04:31:37.229 --> 04:31:37.239 align:start position:0%
companies adhere to strong privacy
 
04:31:38.830 --> 04:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
policies which prohibit the sale of
 
04:31:41.830 --> 04:31:41.840 align:start position:0%

Pro privacy policies are enforceable
 
04:31:46.109 --> 04:31:46.119 align:start position:0%
currently under the Federal Trade
 
04:31:48.630 --> 04:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
Commission um some of the unintended
 
04:31:51.630 --> 04:31:51.640 align:start position:0%
consequences um that we wanted to touch
 
04:31:54.070 --> 04:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
on and we did submit a letter um
 
04:31:55.950 --> 04:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
outlining these more thoroughly so I'll
 
04:31:57.510 --> 04:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
be very brief and respectful of your
 
04:32:01.229 --> 04:32:01.239 align:start position:0%
time um a big issue uh with this bill is
 
04:32:04.070 --> 04:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
the creating a patchwork state-by-state
 
04:32:06.950 --> 04:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
um approach to a sort of a national um
 
04:32:08.149 --> 04:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
conversation and something that should
 
04:32:09.870 --> 04:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
really be left more up towards the
 
04:32:11.990 --> 04:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
federal government where we can have
 
04:32:15.630 --> 04:32:15.640 align:start position:0%
uniform um because this bill as worded
 
04:32:17.109 --> 04:32:17.119 align:start position:0%
um would not only cover New Hampshire
 
04:32:18.830 --> 04:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
residents but anyone who's traveling
 
04:32:21.670 --> 04:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
through or located in the state um so
 
04:32:24.670 --> 04:32:24.680 align:start position:0%
this could mean um we would have to know
 
04:32:26.550 --> 04:32:26.560 align:start position:0%
and more location data would have to be
 
04:32:29.030 --> 04:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
shared just to find out where they where
 
04:32:30.830 --> 04:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
somebody is in order to whether or not
 
04:32:32.790 --> 04:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
they would have to be um subject to this
 
04:32:36.149 --> 04:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
law um so anyone who is requ required or
 
04:32:38.149 --> 04:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
wants to use data um as soon as they
 
04:32:40.750 --> 04:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
were entered New Hampshire or if they're
 
04:32:43.229 --> 04:32:43.239 align:start position:0%
passing through um would have to then
 
04:32:47.910 --> 04:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
consent um to using this data again um
 
04:32:50.389 --> 04:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're aware of this um
 
04:32:53.189 --> 04:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
law being in place um
 
04:32:55.910 --> 04:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
so geolocation information that's linked
 
04:32:58.389 --> 04:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
to someone um specifically um should be
 
04:33:00.910 --> 04:33:00.920 align:start position:0%
treated appropriately however excluding
 
04:33:02.990 --> 04:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
animiz data sharing um from the
 
04:33:04.949 --> 04:33:04.959 align:start position:0%
definition of authorized use um would
 
04:33:08.029 --> 04:33:08.039 align:start position:0%
impact thousands of uh business models
 
04:33:09.670 --> 04:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
out there um some of them have been
 
04:33:11.109 --> 04:33:11.119 align:start position:0%
brought up already this afternoon
 
04:33:14.070 --> 04:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
regarding whether it's ride sharing or
 
04:33:16.230 --> 04:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
um any sort of GPS service that you
 
04:33:18.109 --> 04:33:18.119 align:start position:0%
would use um that would require your
 
04:33:21.429 --> 04:33:21.439 align:start position:0%
location um our customers are already
 
04:33:23.670 --> 04:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
made aware of when their data is
 
04:33:25.590 --> 04:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
required for these apps and people have
 
04:33:28.269 --> 04:33:28.279 align:start position:0%
the ability to fully hand tailor The
 
04:33:30.390 --> 04:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
Experience on when their data is used
 
04:33:32.310 --> 04:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
and when it's not um so with that I'll
 
04:33:33.990 --> 04:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
let the rest of our written testimony
 
04:33:35.670 --> 04:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
and our letter submitted speak for
 
04:33:38.551 --> 04:33:38.561 align:start position:0%
itself and uh thank you for your time
 
04:33:43.510 --> 04:33:43.520 align:start position:0%

country um certainly you know similar to
 
04:34:46.349 --> 04:34:46.359 align:start position:0%
Mr Baker's testimony we appreciate the
 
04:34:47.990 --> 04:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor's good intention here in
 
04:34:50.709 --> 04:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
drafting this bill but unfortunately it
 
04:34:53.510 --> 04:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
is too broad and vague to be workable
 
04:34:56.230 --> 04:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
here um you know effectively the the
 
04:34:57.949 --> 04:34:57.959 align:start position:0%
sort of Topline summary here is this
 
04:35:00.070 --> 04:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
bill would not be good for consumers and
 
04:35:02.230 --> 04:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
it would not be good for businesses it
 
04:35:04.230 --> 04:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
would dramatically increase consumer
 
04:35:07.470 --> 04:35:07.480 align:start position:0%
frustration because it would require um
 
04:35:09.709 --> 04:35:09.719 align:start position:0%
and particularly with the sponsors um
 
04:35:13.269 --> 04:35:13.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment here would require a popup uh
 
04:35:15.429 --> 04:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
notification every single time any
 
04:35:18.709 --> 04:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
entity wanted to share any piece of your
 
04:35:22.551 --> 04:35:22.561 align:start position:0%
um address uh or your physical location
 
04:35:25.269 --> 04:35:25.279 align:start position:0%
where you were so uh if I ordered
 
04:35:27.230 --> 04:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
something online and had to provide my
 
04:35:29.349 --> 04:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
address I would need to provide optin
 
04:35:32.429 --> 04:35:32.439 align:start position:0%
consent um again ride sharing if I
 
04:35:34.789 --> 04:35:34.799 align:start position:0%
wanted uh groceries delivered if I
 
04:35:37.990 --> 04:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
wanted a pizza delivered um it would
 
04:35:40.310 --> 04:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
require companies to geofence the state
 
04:35:42.029 --> 04:35:42.039 align:start position:0%
so that people coming in to go
 
04:35:44.910 --> 04:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
snowmobiling for the weekend uh would
 
04:35:48.750 --> 04:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
have to get a a delug of opt-in consents
 
04:35:50.990 --> 04:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
just for crossing the state line um and
 
04:35:52.949 --> 04:35:52.959 align:start position:0%
then this would happen every weekend and
 
04:35:55.269 --> 04:35:55.279 align:start position:0%
and every time that we wanted to perform
 
04:35:57.590 --> 04:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
any of those transactions the only
 
04:36:01.470 --> 04:36:01.480 align:start position:0%
sharing that this bill permits um is me
 
04:36:05.230 --> 04:36:05.240 align:start position:0%
sharing my location with a mobile app so
 
04:36:07.310 --> 04:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
not with a telecommunications carrier
 
04:36:10.789 --> 04:36:10.799 align:start position:0%
not with um a a retailer that I wanted
 
04:36:13.629 --> 04:36:13.639 align:start position:0%
to have something somebody ship so it
 
04:36:15.590 --> 04:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't really take into account any of
 
04:36:17.310 --> 04:36:17.320 align:start position:0%
the payment processing any of the
 
04:36:19.949 --> 04:36:19.959 align:start position:0%
backend operations that the online
 
04:36:24.429 --> 04:36:24.439 align:start position:0%
ecosystem is built on um it also doesn't
 
04:36:26.750 --> 04:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
apply equally uh there are immediate
 
04:36:28.551 --> 04:36:28.561 align:start position:0%
dormant Commerce Clause issues because
 
04:36:30.510 --> 04:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
it does not apply uh just to New
 
04:36:32.910 --> 04:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents this would you know
 
04:36:35.150 --> 04:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
appear to try to apply to uh people
 
04:36:37.390 --> 04:36:37.400 align:start position:0%
outside of the state as well and it
 
04:36:39.310 --> 04:36:39.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't even apply equally to New
 
04:36:40.869 --> 04:36:40.879 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents because it only
 
04:36:44.150 --> 04:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
regulates people and locations u in
 
04:36:47.109 --> 04:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
towns so any unincorporated area would
 
04:36:51.189 --> 04:36:51.199 align:start position:0%
not be governed uh by this um again you
 
04:36:53.269 --> 04:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
know Mr Baker pointed out that because
 
04:36:55.189 --> 04:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
of the way this bill is drafted
 
04:36:56.789 --> 04:36:56.799 align:start position:0%
companies will be incentivized to
 
04:36:58.189 --> 04:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of location
 
04:36:59.789 --> 04:36:59.799 align:start position:0%
information collected so that they could
 
04:37:02.310 --> 04:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
comply with this law and know where
 
04:37:04.750 --> 04:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
people were so think of people who live
 
04:37:06.910 --> 04:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
you in Windam and South who commute into
 
04:37:09.349 --> 04:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
Boston every day would constantly be
 
04:37:12.429 --> 04:37:12.439 align:start position:0%
getting uh opt-in consent notifications
 
04:37:14.189 --> 04:37:14.199 align:start position:0%
every single day they leave and enter
 
04:37:18.109 --> 04:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:20.869 --> 04:37:20.879 align:start position:0%
um so anyways and and then the last
 
04:37:22.390 --> 04:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
piece is that you know for small
 
04:37:25.750 --> 04:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
businesses who often use free tools to
 
04:37:28.590 --> 04:37:28.600 align:start position:0%
just uh know where their customers are
 
04:37:30.869 --> 04:37:30.879 align:start position:0%
coming from right if I have a website
 
04:37:33.269 --> 04:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
and I just want to know hey where are my
 
04:37:35.429 --> 04:37:35.439 align:start position:0%
customers where are my visitors to my
 
04:37:38.189 --> 04:37:38.199 align:start position:0%
website coming from um and using you
 
04:37:41.551 --> 04:37:41.561 align:start position:0%
know free cookies um to just try to get
 
04:37:44.269 --> 04:37:44.279 align:start position:0%
a broader sense of this uh that would
 
04:37:46.789 --> 04:37:46.799 align:start position:0%
not be allowed and so it it's also going
 
04:37:48.510 --> 04:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
to hurt small New Hampshire businesses
 
04:37:51.390 --> 04:37:51.400 align:start position:0%
who are trying to increase their reach
 
04:37:54.470 --> 04:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
um and again just use Simple free
 
04:37:57.670 --> 04:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
everyday tools to uh to do that so um
 
04:37:59.269 --> 04:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
you know we would respectfully oppose
 
04:38:02.109 --> 04:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
the bill as well um and happy to answer
 
04:38:04.310 --> 04:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you are there any
 
04:38:09.349 --> 04:38:09.359 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire as we all know very has a
 
04:39:02.670 --> 04:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
reputation for being very business
 
04:39:05.590 --> 04:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
friendly uh it's a reputation this body
 
04:39:09.189 --> 04:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
has defended uh for for many many years
 
04:39:11.949 --> 04:39:11.959 align:start position:0%
um and it's a reputation that gets
 
04:39:15.109 --> 04:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
around particularly in uh as more
 
04:39:17.109 --> 04:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
Investments have been made in uh
 
04:39:19.629 --> 04:39:19.639 align:start position:0%
education and Workforce Development uh
 
04:39:21.470 --> 04:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
higher Tech Industries are are starting
 
04:39:24.150 --> 04:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
to look to Mass to New Hampshire uh I
 
04:39:25.990 --> 04:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
know this specifically because before I
 
04:39:27.349 --> 04:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
was doing this I was doing economic
 
04:39:28.670 --> 04:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
development for the state of
 
04:39:31.510 --> 04:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and we lost a handful of
 
04:39:34.269 --> 04:39:34.279 align:start position:0%
of high-tech opportunities to uh the
 
04:39:37.189 --> 04:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
granite state so um you're you're doing
 
04:39:39.430 --> 04:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
something well uh doing something right
 
04:39:42.310 --> 04:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
here but uh business friendliness is not
 
04:39:44.190 --> 04:39:44.200 align:start position:0%
just uh you know a good tax climate and
 
04:39:46.110 --> 04:39:46.120 align:start position:0%
a strong Workforce it's also about
 
04:39:49.470 --> 04:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
regulatory certainty um which is why
 
04:39:49.480 --> 04:39:50.510 align:start position:0%
regulatory certainty um which is why
this

04:39:50.510 --> 04:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:39:53.430 --> 04:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
legislation technut is opposed to this
 
04:39:56.990 --> 04:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
legislation terms as you've heard are
 
04:40:01.110 --> 04:40:01.120 align:start position:0%
vague science will be very
 
04:40:04.030 --> 04:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
difficult and the threat of potential
 
04:40:04.040 --> 04:40:05.750 align:start position:0%
difficult and the threat of potential
litigation

04:40:05.750 --> 04:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
04:40:07.868 --> 04:40:07.878 align:start position:0%
private right of action included in
 
04:40:12.788 --> 04:40:12.798 align:start position:0%
this is could have a chilling effect on
 
04:40:16.470 --> 04:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
Innovation entrepreneurship here
 
04:40:20.030 --> 04:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
particularly existing services and
 
04:40:22.470 --> 04:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh functions that New Hampshire
 
04:40:24.868 --> 04:40:24.878 align:start position:0%
residents have come to rely on could
 
04:40:27.470 --> 04:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
start to be phased out in the state well
 
04:40:31.230 --> 04:40:31.240 align:start position:0%
as uh limiting the new functions and new
 
04:40:32.670 --> 04:40:32.680 align:start position:0%
opportunities that could be rolled out
 
04:40:35.470 --> 04:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
in the future uh with that that um I'll
 
04:40:40.150 --> 04:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:46.110 --> 04:40:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:49.430 --> 04:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
gain if I could I I gather from your
 
04:40:51.750 --> 04:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
testimony what you're saying is
 
04:40:54.788 --> 04:40:54.798 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire's business interests
 
04:40:56.990 --> 04:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
outweigh the concern that's been
 
04:41:00.390 --> 04:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
expressed with regard to people's
 
04:41:04.510 --> 04:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
privacy oh I certainly uh hope I didn't
 
04:41:06.470 --> 04:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh didn't indicate that no our members
 
04:41:09.750 --> 04:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
are very take uh our consumer privacy
 
04:41:11.470 --> 04:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
very very
 
04:41:14.708 --> 04:41:14.718 align:start position:0%
seriously we have engaged on a number of
 
04:41:17.150 --> 04:41:17.160 align:start position:0%
privacy issues in this state and on a
 
04:41:17.160 --> 04:41:18.310 align:start position:0%
privacy issues in this state and on a
50-state

04:41:18.310 --> 04:41:18.320 align:start position:0%
50-state
 
04:41:23.270 --> 04:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
level we do as a general policy prefer
 
04:41:24.990 --> 04:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
that these issues be handled at a
 
04:41:26.470 --> 04:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
federal level just because it's so
 
04:41:28.750 --> 04:41:28.760 align:start position:0%
difficult to regulate uh an industry
 
04:41:31.868 --> 04:41:31.878 align:start position:0%
that crosses borders
 
04:41:34.230 --> 04:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
constantly and uh you know we're happy
 
04:41:36.948 --> 04:41:36.958 align:start position:0%
to work with the committee and and the
 
04:41:40.510 --> 04:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor on more targeted specific
 
04:41:44.070 --> 04:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
language to protect consumer privacy I
 
04:41:46.470 --> 04:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
would not suggest that the business
 
04:41:46.480 --> 04:41:48.230 align:start position:0%
would not suggest that the business
concerns

04:41:48.230 --> 04:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
04:41:51.070 --> 04:41:51.080 align:start position:0%
outweigh about
 
04:41:52.830 --> 04:41:52.840 align:start position:0%
privacy thank
 
04:41:57.430 --> 04:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:59.948 --> 04:41:59.958 align:start position:0%
Simpson hi thank you for taking my
 
04:42:03.350 --> 04:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
question um related to the previous
 
04:42:07.070 --> 04:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
question I I'm wondering if there are uh
 
04:42:09.110 --> 04:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
laws that you have worked with other
 
04:42:11.310 --> 04:42:11.320 align:start position:0%
states on that may be similar to this
 
04:42:16.070 --> 04:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
that your um Association or your members
 
04:42:18.590 --> 04:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
have been comfortable with that you
 
04:42:22.350 --> 04:42:22.360 align:start position:0%
could send to us um so that we could see
 
04:42:25.270 --> 04:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
kind of what the some of the things that
 
04:42:28.310 --> 04:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
you ways that you might be open
 
04:42:30.948 --> 04:42:30.958 align:start position:0%
to the balance that you were just
 
04:42:30.958 --> 04:42:32.150 align:start position:0%
to the balance that you were just
speaking

04:42:32.150 --> 04:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
04:42:34.510 --> 04:42:34.520 align:start position:0%
of uh thank you very much uh represent
 
04:42:36.270 --> 04:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
restive Simpson yes we'll be happy to
 
04:42:36.280 --> 04:42:39.830 align:start position:0%
restive Simpson yes we'll be happy to
follow

04:42:39.830 --> 04:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:42.230 --> 04:42:42.240 align:start position:0%

speak who hasn't had an opportunity to
 
04:42:57.430 --> 04:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
do so yes I see there's a Jason Hennessy
 
04:43:01.830 --> 04:43:01.840 align:start position:0%

Jason Hennessy I'm a resident of Amherst
 
04:43:13.150 --> 04:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I have over 15 years in
 
04:43:15.948 --> 04:43:15.958 align:start position:0%
the computer industry about and in
 
04:43:17.070 --> 04:43:17.080 align:start position:0%
addition to about 10 years as a
 
04:43:18.788 --> 04:43:18.798 align:start position:0%
researcher completing my PhD in
 
04:43:21.110 --> 04:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
computational sciences and statistics at
 
04:43:23.910 --> 04:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
South Dakota State and four years uh of
 
04:43:26.070 --> 04:43:26.080 align:start position:0%
post-doctoral studies in Computing
 
04:43:28.350 --> 04:43:28.360 align:start position:0%
topics at Boston University I've also
 
04:43:30.070 --> 04:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
spent some time in in a research group
 
04:43:32.590 --> 04:43:32.600 align:start position:0%
at a technology company since then uh
 
04:43:34.150 --> 04:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
I've published I've published numerous
 
04:43:36.030 --> 04:43:36.040 align:start position:0%
papers and wiely respected peer-reviewed
 
04:43:38.310 --> 04:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
venues on related topics including
 
04:43:40.628 --> 04:43:40.638 align:start position:0%
security privacy and system related
 
04:43:43.030 --> 04:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
topics in Computing Technologies uh
 
04:43:44.110 --> 04:43:44.120 align:start position:0%
including some that have received
 
04:43:44.120 --> 04:43:45.390 align:start position:0%
including some that have received
International

04:43:45.390 --> 04:43:45.400 align:start position:0%
International
 
04:43:48.670 --> 04:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
attention so um I wanted to make clear
 
04:43:51.550 --> 04:43:51.560 align:start position:0%
to the committee that the the the the
 
04:43:53.670 --> 04:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
scope of this uh sharing so currently
 
04:43:55.310 --> 04:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
your your location information is being
 
04:43:57.948 --> 04:43:57.958 align:start position:0%
shared by your cell phone provider and
 
04:43:59.868 --> 04:43:59.878 align:start position:0%
they don't just share it with with
 
04:44:02.270 --> 04:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
companies they trust there's an entire
 
04:44:05.030 --> 04:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
ecosystem of contractors that that sell
 
04:44:07.708 --> 04:44:07.718 align:start position:0%
and resell and resell to the point where
 
04:44:09.510 --> 04:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
pretty much anybody could buy if you
 
04:44:10.788 --> 04:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
knew who to talk to you could pretty
 
04:44:12.830 --> 04:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
much buy with a credit card and this is
 
04:44:14.910 --> 04:44:14.920 align:start position:0%
not like archived information this is
 
04:44:20.150 --> 04:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
like real time um so and this and and
 
04:44:21.430 --> 04:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
there's articles that I'll be sending
 
04:44:23.270 --> 04:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
you in my written testimony that
 
04:44:25.070 --> 04:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
document that for at least about five or
 
04:44:27.110 --> 04:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
eight years um we've known about this
 
04:44:28.590 --> 04:44:28.600 align:start position:0%
practice and it was practiced by all of
 
04:44:31.150 --> 04:44:31.160 align:start position:0%
the mobile providers so this isn't
 
04:44:32.830 --> 04:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
something that uh the free market
 
04:44:34.390 --> 04:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately could solve because
 
04:44:36.670 --> 04:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
because um all of the all of the
 
04:44:38.670 --> 04:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
companies were doing
 
04:44:41.830 --> 04:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
it um this practice was discovered and
 
04:44:44.470 --> 04:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
then uh the cell phone companies
 
04:44:46.708 --> 04:44:46.718 align:start position:0%
committed to ending it and years later
 
04:44:49.628 --> 04:44:49.638 align:start position:0%
at least 2018 we discovered they had it
 
04:44:52.590 --> 04:44:52.600 align:start position:0%
and so um and so there's a there's a big
 
04:44:54.350 --> 04:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
concern that without legislation this
 
04:44:57.310 --> 04:44:57.320 align:start position:0%
won't happen on its own um I personally
 
04:44:58.628 --> 04:44:58.638 align:start position:0%
checked with one of these aggregators
 
04:45:00.750 --> 04:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
they sold to location smart and was able
 
04:45:02.788 --> 04:45:02.798 align:start position:0%
to pinpoint my own my own location
 
04:45:04.350 --> 04:45:04.360 align:start position:0%
without having location turned on my
 
04:45:07.310 --> 04:45:07.320 align:start position:0%
cell phone or anything else um it was
 
04:45:09.230 --> 04:45:09.240 align:start position:0%
later discovered that a security flaw
 
04:45:10.788 --> 04:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
with this uh with this contractor who
 
04:45:12.750 --> 04:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
purchased everybody's location
 
04:45:15.070 --> 04:45:15.080 align:start position:0%
information um meant that anybody in the
 
04:45:16.670 --> 04:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
world with just a phone number could
 
04:45:19.430 --> 04:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
locate could locate anybody's location
 
04:45:21.708 --> 04:45:21.718 align:start position:0%
this includes stalkers burglar or other
 
04:45:24.430 --> 04:45:24.440 align:start position:0%
people acting with nefarious intent um
 
04:45:25.628 --> 04:45:25.638 align:start position:0%
in addition there were there were also
 
04:45:27.110 --> 04:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
examples where a sheriff spied on a
 
04:45:29.788 --> 04:45:29.798 align:start position:0%
judge illegally um and people spite on
 
04:45:31.948 --> 04:45:31.958 align:start position:0%
love interests or former love interests
 
04:45:34.628 --> 04:45:34.638 align:start position:0%
so this is a this is a real issue um
 
04:45:37.788 --> 04:45:37.798 align:start position:0%
this I I really like this bill SB 384
 
04:45:40.628 --> 04:45:40.638 align:start position:0%
because it uh goes beyond just the
 
04:45:42.948 --> 04:45:42.958 align:start position:0%
Telecom providers and also addresses uh
 
04:45:45.270 --> 04:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
two other major ways that that this
 
04:45:47.990 --> 04:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
information's been shared IT addresses
 
04:45:49.990 --> 04:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
um cars so many cars will share your
 
04:45:51.590 --> 04:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
location information without your
 
04:45:53.788 --> 04:45:53.798 align:start position:0%
knowledge um and also a lot of mobile
 
04:45:55.310 --> 04:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
apps that are installed in your cell
 
04:45:58.590 --> 04:45:58.600 align:start position:0%
phone so location information by itself
 
04:46:01.708 --> 04:46:01.718 align:start position:0%
is extremely sensitive um it can say
 
04:46:03.510 --> 04:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
where you know can it can show which
 
04:46:05.948 --> 04:46:05.958 align:start position:0%
doctor's office you're going to uh it
 
04:46:07.150 --> 04:46:07.160 align:start position:0%
can show where you're going to a place
 
04:46:09.628 --> 04:46:09.638 align:start position:0%
of worship um you may not you may be
 
04:46:12.350 --> 04:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
hiding from an abusive relationship or a
 
04:46:14.990 --> 04:46:15.000 align:start position:0%
person and also when you've aggregated
 
04:46:17.590 --> 04:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
all of this data on so many people a lot
 
04:46:19.590 --> 04:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
more becomes visible who your Social
 
04:46:21.788 --> 04:46:21.798 align:start position:0%
Circles are um who your friends are your
 
04:46:23.628 --> 04:46:23.638 align:start position:0%
relationships other
 
04:46:27.548 --> 04:46:27.558 align:start position:0%
things so
 
04:46:31.390 --> 04:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
um yeah so I so so I enthusiastically
 
04:46:33.868 --> 04:46:33.878 align:start position:0%
support HP 384 I wanted to address a
 
04:46:36.230 --> 04:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
couple of comments that I heard
 
04:46:38.868 --> 04:46:38.878 align:start position:0%
earlier um so rep representative Chase
 
04:46:41.310 --> 04:46:41.320 align:start position:0%
brought up the tracking devices So
 
04:46:43.110 --> 04:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
currently so in terms of tracking
 
04:46:45.190 --> 04:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
devices you don't you know almost
 
04:46:47.788 --> 04:46:47.798 align:start position:0%
everybody has a cell phone so um if you
 
04:46:49.150 --> 04:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
know the company that's selling data you
 
04:46:50.150 --> 04:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
could just bring a credit card and
 
04:46:52.070 --> 04:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
purchase it you wouldn't even need the
 
04:46:53.030 --> 04:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't even need the tracking
 
04:46:54.670 --> 04:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
device and so this bill would actually
 
04:46:58.830 --> 04:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
help to protect our privacy rights um in
 
04:47:01.830 --> 04:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
that um responding to representative
 
04:47:03.910 --> 04:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
Gordon and Captain Ebert's uh concern
 
04:47:05.750 --> 04:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
about law law enforcement my
 
04:47:06.670 --> 04:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the bill would
 
04:47:08.150 --> 04:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
continue to allow law enforcement to
 
04:47:10.470 --> 04:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
access data from anyone who has it as
 
04:47:13.150 --> 04:47:13.160 align:start position:0%
long as the a lawful process were
 
04:47:15.470 --> 04:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
followed uh responding to the internet
 
04:47:16.830 --> 04:47:16.840 align:start position:0%
Coalition statement that there there
 
04:47:19.110 --> 04:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
would be a patchwork of of States if
 
04:47:21.390 --> 04:47:21.400 align:start position:0%
this would If This Were to be passed um
 
04:47:23.590 --> 04:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
there's an AP article called influence
 
04:47:26.310 --> 04:47:26.320 align:start position:0%
game Telecom lobbying muscle kill kills
 
04:47:29.750 --> 04:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
privacy rules where it it discussed how
 
04:47:32.070 --> 04:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
in in 2016 the Telecom Lobby exceeded
 
04:47:34.910 --> 04:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
$123 million
 
04:47:37.070 --> 04:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
um in spending the year before Congress
 
04:47:38.590 --> 04:47:38.600 align:start position:0%
repealed privacy protections that would
 
04:47:39.948 --> 04:47:39.958 align:start position:0%
have prevented internet providers
 
04:47:42.070 --> 04:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
including Wireless telephone uh Telecom
 
04:47:43.788 --> 04:47:43.798 align:start position:0%
providers from selling these uh privacy
 
04:47:45.150 --> 04:47:45.160 align:start position:0%
sensitive data like location and
 
04:47:49.390 --> 04:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
browsing history so in terms of whether
 
04:47:51.990 --> 04:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
um in terms of whether like we should
 
04:47:54.230 --> 04:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
wait for a federal a federal law you
 
04:47:55.548 --> 04:47:55.558 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of money being spent
 
04:47:57.788 --> 04:47:57.798 align:start position:0%
to prevent that that these uh I suspect
 
04:47:58.990 --> 04:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
that the companies that are lobbying
 
04:48:01.670 --> 04:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
here have been spending so I I I think
 
04:48:03.030 --> 04:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
that that argument is a little
 
04:48:03.040 --> 04:48:04.590 align:start position:0%
that that argument is a little
disingenuous

04:48:04.590 --> 04:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
disingenuous
 
04:48:06.830 --> 04:48:06.840 align:start position:0%
um so keep in mind that the business
 
04:48:08.470 --> 04:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
models that would primarily be affected
 
04:48:10.310 --> 04:48:10.320 align:start position:0%
by this bill are those that sell your
 
04:48:13.310 --> 04:48:13.320 align:start position:0%
information for profit primarily without
 
04:48:16.708 --> 04:48:16.718 align:start position:0%
consent um and and in terms in terms of
 
04:48:18.230 --> 04:48:18.240 align:start position:0%
like these privacy policies I just
 
04:48:20.670 --> 04:48:20.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to I just took a look at two
 
04:48:22.910 --> 04:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
Verizon Wireless's privacy policy is 22
 
04:48:26.510 --> 04:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
pages and AT&amp;T's is 27 pages so in terms
 
04:48:29.310 --> 04:48:29.320 align:start position:0%
of actually actively getting consent um
 
04:48:32.070 --> 04:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't think that uh I don't
 
04:48:33.470 --> 04:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
think that the average person reads the
 
04:48:35.110 --> 04:48:35.120 align:start position:0%
22 27
 
04:48:38.350 --> 04:48:38.360 align:start position:0%
Pages um addressing the concern that was
 
04:48:40.670 --> 04:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh brought up about authorizing uh
 
04:48:42.310 --> 04:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
somebody's location used for Uber or
 
04:48:44.910 --> 04:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
payments I don't think that I don't
 
04:48:46.788 --> 04:48:46.798 align:start position:0%
think that that concern is is in line
 
04:48:48.670 --> 04:48:48.680 align:start position:0%
with what the bill actually says the
 
04:48:51.430 --> 04:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
bill says that U it defines authoriz
 
04:48:53.750 --> 04:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
authorized use for when you're
 
04:48:56.948 --> 04:48:56.958 align:start position:0%
fulfilling uh the the re request of the
 
04:48:59.910 --> 04:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
consumer so Uber would be able to share
 
04:49:02.070 --> 04:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
your location with anybody as long as
 
04:49:03.590 --> 04:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
it's fulfilling your request and not
 
04:49:06.548 --> 04:49:06.558 align:start position:0%
just it for any reason they feel like um
 
04:49:09.470 --> 04:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh I heard a concern brought
 
04:49:11.270 --> 04:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
up about somebody living in Windam who
 
04:49:12.548 --> 04:49:12.558 align:start position:0%
commets Massachusetts would have to
 
04:49:15.030 --> 04:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
click consent all day um there's nothing
 
04:49:16.110 --> 04:49:16.120 align:start position:0%
in this bill that says that an
 
04:49:18.070 --> 04:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
authorization expires when you cross a
 
04:49:21.190 --> 04:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
border so that just seems silly to
 
04:49:24.788 --> 04:49:24.798 align:start position:0%
me um and with that oh and then there
 
04:49:27.830 --> 04:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
was one other concern uh that made very
 
04:49:29.350 --> 04:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
little sense to me where they said pre-
 
04:49:30.830 --> 04:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
tools that show where people are coming
 
04:49:33.270 --> 04:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
from would need authorization so this
 
04:49:35.750 --> 04:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
bill only applies to your cell phone
 
04:49:37.868 --> 04:49:37.878 align:start position:0%
itself or apps running on it something
 
04:49:40.190 --> 04:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
like a a cookie is based on your IP
 
04:49:41.270 --> 04:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
address and that's collected at the
 
04:49:42.948 --> 04:49:42.958 align:start position:0%
server that would have nothing
 
04:49:46.350 --> 04:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
whatsoever uh to do with this so with
 
04:49:48.390 --> 04:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
that I would um I appreciate the
 
04:49:49.548 --> 04:49:49.558 align:start position:0%
committee's time and would be happy to
 
04:49:51.628 --> 04:49:51.638 align:start position:0%
take any questions you there any
 
04:49:55.110 --> 04:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:58.030 --> 04:49:58.040 align:start position:0%
Hennessy seeing none thank you for you
 
04:49:59.990 --> 04:50:00.000 align:start position:0%

04:50:26.440 --> 04:50:28.948 align:start position:0%
Hennessy seeing none thank you for your
testimony

04:50:28.948 --> 04:50:28.958 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:50:32.830 --> 04:50:32.840 align:start position:0%
today and I see no one else has uh
 
04:50:34.390 --> 04:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
indicated their
 
04:50:35.670 --> 04:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
intent to
 
04:50:39.150 --> 04:50:39.160 align:start position:0%
testify and so I will close the hearing
 
04:50:42.708 --> 04:50:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:45.948 --> 04:50:45.958 align:start position:0%
384 I'll note that there were 12 people
 
04:50:48.830 --> 04:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
who signed up in support of the bill six
 
04:50:56.310 --> 04:50:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:58.990 --> 04:50:59.000 align:start position:0%
opposition and that gives us just a
 
04:51:01.310 --> 04:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
couple of minutes before we end up
 
04:51:32.750 --> 04:51:32.760 align:start position:0%

04:54:32.310 --> 04:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
driver behind Senator Shandy's Bill and
 
04:54:34.110 --> 04:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
behind my bill
 
04:54:36.030 --> 04:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
I know him personally and he contacted
 
04:54:38.868 --> 04:54:38.878 align:start position:0%
me about this and I told him he contact
 
04:54:40.830 --> 04:54:40.840 align:start position:0%
his own legislators and Senator shamley
 
04:54:42.590 --> 04:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
was the only one had interest two years
 
04:55:02.390 --> 04:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:02.400 --> 04:55:29.830 align:start position:0%
 
year

04:55:29.830 --> 04:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:31.670 --> 04:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
I had to relocate I was in the other
 
04:55:34.230 --> 04:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
room and the sun was coming in the
 
04:55:36.590 --> 04:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
window was making me look completely
 
04:55:39.990 --> 04:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
white so I was wondering you've been in
 
04:55:43.788 --> 04:55:43.798 align:start position:0%
many rooms today yes get a view of your
 
04:55:45.430 --> 04:55:45.440 align:start position:0%

so well this is the this is the cottage
 
04:55:48.718 --> 04:56:00.270 align:start position:0%
so well this is the this is the cottage

04:56:12.628 --> 04:56:12.638 align:start position:0%

all the um the Cardinals it's just
 
04:56:21.470 --> 04:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
beautiful I was reading I didn't realize
 
04:56:24.190 --> 04:56:24.200 align:start position:0%
that they turn bright red in the winter
 
04:56:26.270 --> 04:56:26.280 align:start position:0%
that's why we see them so much more
 
04:56:30.708 --> 04:56:30.718 align:start position:0%

the house last year and being laid on
 
04:58:12.590 --> 04:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
the table in the Senate due to covid and
 
04:58:14.190 --> 04:58:14.200 align:start position:0%
provides the relationship of the bill to
 
04:58:16.150 --> 04:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
the Privacy amendment to New Hampshire
 
04:58:19.830 --> 04:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution passed in 2018 with 81%

voting in
 
04:58:23.150 --> 04:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
favor rather than repeating that I'll
 
04:58:25.110 --> 04:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
simply relate the changes the bill makes
 
04:58:27.430 --> 04:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
to the existing New Hampshire statute

surveillance

04:58:33.868 --> 04:58:33.878 align:start position:0%
surveillance
 
04:58:36.708 --> 04:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
this statute prohibits the state and its
 
04:58:38.788 --> 04:58:38.798 align:start position:0%
subdivisions from using surveillance
 
04:58:40.510 --> 04:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
technology to track the owner and
 
04:58:42.708 --> 04:58:42.718 align:start position:0%
occupants of motor vehicles with some
 
04:58:46.430 --> 04:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
exceptions as stated in the statute HB
 
04:58:48.628 --> 04:58:48.638 align:start position:0%
474 adds the
 
04:58:50.990 --> 04:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
following first in addition to
 
04:58:52.430 --> 04:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the determination of the
 
04:58:54.948 --> 04:58:54.958 align:start position:0%
owner and occupants of Motor Vehicles it
 
04:58:57.750 --> 04:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
also prohibits tracking their
 
04:59:01.190 --> 04:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
location second it prohibits determining
 
04:59:04.070 --> 04:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
the Identity or track the location of
 
04:59:05.910 --> 04:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
pedestrians on
 
04:59:08.990 --> 04:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
sidewalks and third it clarifies the
 
04:59:10.628 --> 04:59:10.638 align:start position:0%
relationship of the statute to our
 
04:59:12.910 --> 04:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to privacy and
 
04:59:14.590 --> 04:59:14.600 align:start position:0%
specifically references the statutes
 
04:59:17.310 --> 04:59:17.320 align:start position:0%
that Define public ways and
 
04:59:19.830 --> 04:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
sidewalks finally it provides a penalty
 
04:59:22.788 --> 04:59:22.798 align:start position:0%
of $1,000 plus attorney fees for
 
04:59:24.110 --> 04:59:24.120 align:start position:0%
violating the
 
04:59:26.628 --> 04:59:26.638 align:start position:0%
statute these are the only changes to
 
04:59:29.548 --> 04:59:29.558 align:start position:0%
the existing statute no changes are made
 
04:59:31.910 --> 04:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
to the exceptions to the prohibitions
 
04:59:34.510 --> 04:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
already in the statute
 
04:59:36.350 --> 04:59:36.360 align:start position:0%
now after preparing the above statement
 
04:59:37.670 --> 04:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
new information has come to our
 
04:59:40.390 --> 04:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
attention earlier today that the
 
04:59:42.708 --> 04:59:42.718 align:start position:0%
department of of natural and cultural
 
04:59:44.670 --> 04:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
resources has a concern as it relates to
 
04:59:46.708 --> 04:59:46.718 align:start position:0%
their current and ongoing activities and
 
04:59:48.430 --> 04:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
I believe they sent a copy of the letter
 
04:59:51.190 --> 04:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
to you all as well to bring them into
 
04:59:53.708 --> 04:59:53.718 align:start position:0%
compliance with the current statute as
 
04:59:56.430 --> 04:59:56.440 align:start position:0%
well as the statute as amended by HB
 
04:59:58.868 --> 04:59:58.878 align:start position:0%
474 we recommend adding an amendment to
 
05:00:02.788 --> 05:00:02.798 align:start position:0%
HB 474 adding a new subsection related
 
05:00:04.750 --> 05:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
to exceptions to the prohibitions in the
 
05:00:07.590 --> 05:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
statute this would be subsection Roman
 
05:00:07.600 --> 05:00:08.788 align:start position:0%
statute this would be subsection Roman
numo

05:00:08.788 --> 05:00:08.798 align:start position:0%

follows is undertaken for security and
 
05:00:16.548 --> 05:00:16.558 align:start position:0%
to facilitate law enforcement in the
 
05:00:18.948 --> 05:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
investigation of criminal activity at
 
05:00:20.510 --> 05:00:20.520 align:start position:0%
properties under the jurisdiction of the
 
05:00:22.830 --> 05:00:22.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Natural and cultural
 
05:00:25.150 --> 05:00:25.160 align:start position:0%
resources provided that no video
 
05:00:27.948 --> 05:00:27.958 align:start position:0%

05:00:30.548 --> 05:00:30.558 align:start position:0%
days except if needed in a Judicial or
 
05:00:31.830 --> 05:00:31.840 align:start position:0%
administrative proceeding in a
 
05:00:33.548 --> 05:00:33.558 align:start position:0%
particular case
 
05:00:35.390 --> 05:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
the properties on which surveillance
 
05:00:37.590 --> 05:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
occurs shall display signage indicating
 
05:00:40.390 --> 05:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
the presence of 24-hour video
 
05:00:42.910 --> 05:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
cameras I have contacted OLS with this
 
05:00:44.788 --> 05:00:44.798 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment to be prepared for
 
05:00:46.948 --> 05:00:46.958 align:start position:0%
the committee's consider
 
05:00:49.030 --> 05:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
consideration I have not yet and I'm
 
05:00:51.548 --> 05:00:51.558 align:start position:0%
looking now I have not yet um heard back
 
05:00:52.948 --> 05:00:52.958 align:start position:0%
although they did respond that they
 
05:00:54.990 --> 05:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
received it and they would look into it
 
05:00:56.948 --> 05:00:56.958 align:start position:0%
a testifying at some point after me is
 
05:00:58.948 --> 05:00:58.958 align:start position:0%
The Honorable Neil Kirk who authored the
 
05:01:00.948 --> 05:01:00.958 align:start position:0%
original bill that has been resubmitted
 
05:01:03.150 --> 05:01:03.160 align:start position:0%
this year in the interest of your time
 
05:01:04.230 --> 05:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
it might be best to address your
 
05:01:05.948 --> 05:01:05.958 align:start position:0%
questions to him as they relate to the
 
05:01:08.470 --> 05:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
HB 474s you have in front of you um as
 
05:01:10.030 --> 05:01:10.040 align:start position:0%
he can probably provide more in-depth
 
05:01:12.270 --> 05:01:12.280 align:start position:0%
answers thank you for your time today if
 
05:01:14.030 --> 05:01:14.040 align:start position:0%

05:01:15.110 --> 05:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
to address
 
05:01:18.590 --> 05:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
them do any uh does anyone have any
 
05:01:18.600 --> 05:01:21.948 align:start position:0%
them do any uh does anyone have any
questions

05:01:21.948 --> 05:01:21.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:24.990 --> 05:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
representative yes representative Silber
 
05:01:28.948 --> 05:01:28.958 align:start position:0%
uh yes H how does this affect or does it
 
05:01:32.270 --> 05:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
affect the cameras that are at the toll
 
05:01:35.430 --> 05:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
booths where you go through and if you
 
05:01:37.708 --> 05:01:37.718 align:start position:0%
have a transponder it may take your
 
05:01:39.230 --> 05:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
picture and may not may take your
 
05:01:41.390 --> 05:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
license plate or may not or if you have
 
05:01:42.948 --> 05:01:42.958 align:start position:0%
neither it takes your picture and your
 
05:01:44.708 --> 05:01:44.718 align:start position:0%
license plate and they end up sending
 
05:01:46.670 --> 05:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
you a
 
05:01:49.070 --> 05:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
bill well I can't tell how it affects it
 
05:01:51.070 --> 05:01:51.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of a the way it currently
 
05:01:53.110 --> 05:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
affects it but this this statute is
 
05:01:56.470 --> 05:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
currently in law the the only changes I
 
05:01:57.830 --> 05:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
made of the they're being made the ones
 
05:02:00.230 --> 05:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
that I that I mentioned there so you can
 
05:02:01.990 --> 05:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
already do all the things you said if if
 
05:02:03.190 --> 05:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
you can already do all the things you
 
05:02:05.110 --> 05:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
just said under current law then I
 
05:02:07.830 --> 05:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
believe there's no change but I can't
 
05:02:09.670 --> 05:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
speak to how the current law impacts
 
05:02:12.628 --> 05:02:12.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:14.990 --> 05:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
describing just a brief brief followup
 
05:02:17.948 --> 05:02:17.958 align:start position:0%
Mr yes it sounds to me like reading
 
05:02:20.390 --> 05:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
reading this proposed bill it sounds
 
05:02:24.750 --> 05:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:28.788 --> 05:02:28.798 align:start position:0%
prohibited and and in what way just says
 
05:02:30.270 --> 05:02:30.280 align:start position:0%
they're they're using a camera other
 
05:02:35.750 --> 05:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
Imaging device and to uh so that by
 
05:02:37.430 --> 05:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
itself or in conjunction with other
 
05:02:38.868 --> 05:02:38.878 align:start position:0%
devices can be used to determine the
 
05:02:41.310 --> 05:02:41.320 align:start position:0%
ownership or location of a motor vehicle
 
05:02:42.590 --> 05:02:42.600 align:start position:0%
the identity of a motor vehicle's
 
05:02:46.230 --> 05:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
occupant Etc that's in the bill here and
 
05:02:48.470 --> 05:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
that's what these cameras are doing in
 
05:02:50.868 --> 05:02:50.878 align:start position:0%
order to send a bill to somebody who's
 
05:02:52.590 --> 05:02:52.600 align:start position:0%
trying to evade the toll or who doesn't
 
05:02:54.628 --> 05:02:54.638 align:start position:0%
have a transponder uh thank you
 
05:02:56.750 --> 05:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
representative I guess I wasn't clear in
 
05:03:00.708 --> 05:03:00.718 align:start position:0%
my a presentation what you just read is
 
05:03:03.470 --> 05:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
current law that's not in the bill
 
05:03:04.910 --> 05:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
that's not in the I mean obviously it's
 
05:03:07.750 --> 05:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
still in the bill but it's not what's
 
05:03:10.430 --> 05:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
it's already the law right now and if
 
05:03:12.788 --> 05:03:12.798 align:start position:0%
you look at the entire statute which I
 
05:03:14.548 --> 05:03:14.558 align:start position:0%
don't have right in front of me but
 
05:03:16.510 --> 05:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
there's a subsection three in fact
 
05:03:17.990 --> 05:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
subsection three is what I was
 
05:03:20.430 --> 05:03:20.440 align:start position:0%
referencing in regard to making the fix
 
05:03:23.150 --> 05:03:23.160 align:start position:0%
for the uh Department of Natural and
 
05:03:25.628 --> 05:03:25.638 align:start position:0%
cultur resources giving you letter H
 
05:03:27.670 --> 05:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
there's actually a through I already in
 
05:03:30.910 --> 05:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
there which are exceptions to the
 
05:03:32.670 --> 05:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
surveillance that you're reading which
 
05:03:35.150 --> 05:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
which I presume permit what you're
 
05:03:37.310 --> 05:03:37.320 align:start position:0%
talking about since as I say it's
 
05:03:40.788 --> 05:03:40.798 align:start position:0%
already the law so if it weren't allowed
 
05:03:44.270 --> 05:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
when I'm pretty sure it is then it' be a
 
05:03:47.350 --> 05:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
problem already if you follow what I'm
 
05:03:50.390 --> 05:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
saying thank you
 
05:03:53.470 --> 05:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
05:03:57.628 --> 05:03:57.638 align:start position:0%
Chase thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:04:00.230 --> 05:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh Keith for taking my question I'm just
 
05:04:03.590 --> 05:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
curious with these
 
05:04:06.150 --> 05:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
cameras or the viewing of the say the Ry
 
05:04:08.030 --> 05:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
Police Department Hampton police fors
 
05:04:10.628 --> 05:04:10.638 align:start position:0%
management the the letter that we
 
05:04:13.030 --> 05:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
received are is this something that
 
05:04:15.350 --> 05:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
somebody sitting in an office watching
 
05:04:17.948 --> 05:04:17.958 align:start position:0%
and maintaining or is it on a loop and
 
05:04:19.948 --> 05:04:19.958 align:start position:0%
how often is
 
05:04:22.110 --> 05:04:22.120 align:start position:0%
it um I'm not familiar with the letter
 
05:04:25.070 --> 05:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
you're referring to but I do know that
 
05:04:26.750 --> 05:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative or former
 
05:04:28.628 --> 05:04:28.638 align:start position:0%
representative Kirk has spoken with
 
05:04:30.948 --> 05:04:30.958 align:start position:0%
several police departments regarding I
 
05:04:32.868 --> 05:04:32.878 align:start position:0%
think the issues you're raising so it's
 
05:04:34.270 --> 05:04:34.280 align:start position:0%
probably best to address that question
 
05:04:35.548 --> 05:04:35.558 align:start position:0%
to him and he could probably give you a
 
05:04:37.628 --> 05:04:37.638 align:start position:0%
much better answer than I can give
 
05:04:40.310 --> 05:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
you okay thank
 
05:04:45.430 --> 05:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:47.390 --> 05:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
representative see none thank you for
 
05:04:50.510 --> 05:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
your testimony today thank you
 
05:04:54.190 --> 05:04:54.200 align:start position:0%

05:04:56.788 --> 05:04:56.798 align:start position:0%
upon former representative The Honorable
 
05:04:56.798 --> 05:04:58.030 align:start position:0%

05:05:01.480 --> 05:05:07.350 align:start position:0%
 
available

05:05:07.350 --> 05:05:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:09.510 --> 05:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman can you hear me now we can
 
05:05:12.230 --> 05:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
hear you now good afternoon to you and
 
05:05:13.470 --> 05:05:13.480 align:start position:0%
to members of the committee for the
 
05:05:18.270 --> 05:05:18.280 align:start position:0%
record I'm Neil Kirk and I live in wear
 
05:05:20.548 --> 05:05:20.558 align:start position:0%
um current
 
05:05:23.868 --> 05:05:23.878 align:start position:0%
statute uh on the
 
05:05:28.470 --> 05:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
books was um interpreted by a court to
 
05:05:30.270 --> 05:05:30.280 align:start position:0%
mean something other than I believe what
 
05:05:33.270 --> 05:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
the uh legislature intends Ed and the
 
05:05:39.190 --> 05:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:42.788 --> 05:05:42.798 align:start position:0%
that the law that is being corrected is
 
05:05:46.030 --> 05:05:46.040 align:start position:0%
RSA 236
 
05:05:49.628 --> 05:05:49.638 align:start position:0%
170 and that's currently on the
 
05:05:52.788 --> 05:05:52.798 align:start position:0%
books um I received a copy of uh a
 
05:05:55.270 --> 05:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
letter from the Department of Natural
 
05:05:58.750 --> 05:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
and cultural resources saying that the
 
05:06:02.470 --> 05:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
law the amendment would impede their
 
05:06:02.480 --> 05:06:03.470 align:start position:0%
law the amendment would impede their
current

05:06:03.470 --> 05:06:03.480 align:start position:0%
current
 
05:06:07.110 --> 05:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
activities um and as I read the law now
 
05:06:09.830 --> 05:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
what they are currently doing is
 
05:06:11.830 --> 05:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
prohibited under current
 
05:06:15.990 --> 05:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
law so I believe um in order to fix the
 
05:06:18.510 --> 05:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
problems that they've raised with use of
 
05:06:21.190 --> 05:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
cameras on trails and parking lots and
 
05:06:24.628 --> 05:06:24.638 align:start position:0%
Gates uh where Vehicles access to State
 
05:06:26.910 --> 05:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
facilities requires an amendment to
 
05:06:26.920 --> 05:06:28.150 align:start position:0%
facilities requires an amendment to
current

05:06:28.150 --> 05:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
current
 
05:06:32.190 --> 05:06:32.200 align:start position:0%
law and um I believe representative F
 
05:06:34.150 --> 05:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
has indicated that he has such an
 
05:06:36.830 --> 05:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
amendment and that that will solve that
 
05:06:39.708 --> 05:06:39.718 align:start position:0%
problem if that amendment is not passed
 
05:06:42.470 --> 05:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
then then the uh department is violating
 
05:06:43.990 --> 05:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
current law and of course would be
 
05:06:45.350 --> 05:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
violating any
 
05:06:47.430 --> 05:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment the purpose of the amendment
 
05:06:49.868 --> 05:06:49.878 align:start position:0%
as I say is to correct a
 
05:06:52.548 --> 05:06:52.558 align:start position:0%
misinterpretation of this statute by the
 
05:06:55.150 --> 05:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
courts or at least what I think was a
 
05:06:57.910 --> 05:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
misinterpretation and the purpose was
 
05:06:57.920 --> 05:07:00.230 align:start position:0%
misinterpretation and the purpose was
basically

05:07:00.230 --> 05:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
basically
 
05:07:03.750 --> 05:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
to um
 
05:07:06.708 --> 05:07:06.718 align:start position:0%
bar the use of cameras on public rights
 
05:07:09.470 --> 05:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
of way meaning intended to mean State
 
05:07:13.750 --> 05:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
highways and and and uh so that uh the
 
05:07:15.470 --> 05:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
state didn't set up surveillance cameras
 
05:07:16.948 --> 05:07:16.958 align:start position:0%
the way they have them in Britain or New
 
05:07:20.750 --> 05:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
York City and track people throughout
 
05:07:22.788 --> 05:07:22.798 align:start position:0%
their uh the course of their daily or
 
05:07:25.470 --> 05:07:25.480 align:start position:0%
monthly or yearly or lifetime activities
 
05:07:27.548 --> 05:07:27.558 align:start position:0%
keep a record of this and then use it
 
05:07:31.390 --> 05:07:31.400 align:start position:0%
for whatever purposes they want um the
 
05:07:33.830 --> 05:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
recently adopted ed u informational
 
05:07:36.350 --> 05:07:36.360 align:start position:0%
privacy amendment to our constitution I
 
05:07:38.390 --> 05:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
think would prohibit that and this law
 
05:07:39.708 --> 05:07:39.718 align:start position:0%
is an effort on the part of the
 
05:07:42.470 --> 05:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
legislature to deal with that as a
 
05:07:45.270 --> 05:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
matter of public policy so the
 
05:07:48.750 --> 05:07:48.760 align:start position:0%
correction that the bill makes um which
 
05:07:50.350 --> 05:07:50.360 align:start position:0%
I believe the court
 
05:07:52.470 --> 05:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted was to make it was to
 
05:07:54.110 --> 05:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
make it clear that the existence of a
 
05:07:55.830 --> 05:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
camera taking those pictures is
 
05:07:58.110 --> 05:07:58.120 align:start position:0%
something that on the roads is something
 
05:08:00.510 --> 05:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
that the legislature didn't want if you
 
05:08:02.910 --> 05:08:02.920 align:start position:0%
or I are going to visit uh a medical
 
05:08:05.548 --> 05:08:05.558 align:start position:0%
doctor or going to a political rally and
 
05:08:08.070 --> 05:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
we take our car to do that it seems
 
05:08:09.708 --> 05:08:09.718 align:start position:0%
quite inappropriate that the state would
 
05:08:12.948 --> 05:08:12.958 align:start position:0%
be taking pictures of us and creating
 
05:08:15.070 --> 05:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
records of where we went and what we
 
05:08:18.470 --> 05:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
were doing so the first section of the
 
05:08:21.110 --> 05:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
bill prevents the or makes it clear that
 
05:08:23.628 --> 05:08:23.638 align:start position:0%
taking those kinds of pictures is is not
 
05:08:25.788 --> 05:08:25.798 align:start position:0%
allowed the second part of the bill
 
05:08:27.948 --> 05:08:27.958 align:start position:0%
expands the definition of roads to
 
05:08:27.958 --> 05:08:29.750 align:start position:0%
expands the definition of roads to
include

05:08:29.750 --> 05:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
include
 
05:08:32.990 --> 05:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
sidewalks um because the the first bill
 
05:08:34.990 --> 05:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
apparently didn't do that the statute
 
05:08:37.230 --> 05:08:37.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that and
 
05:08:41.390 --> 05:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
finally um a right of civil action is
 
05:08:43.270 --> 05:08:43.280 align:start position:0%
granted to a person whose rights have
 
05:08:45.910 --> 05:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
been violated by the state's use of this
 
05:08:48.070 --> 05:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
use of these cameras i' point out to you
 
05:08:50.190 --> 05:08:50.200 align:start position:0%
that this bill only applies to the state
 
05:08:52.590 --> 05:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
counties municipalities it does not
 
05:08:54.948 --> 05:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
apply to the private sector it strictly
 
05:08:58.110 --> 05:08:58.120 align:start position:0%
deals uh with with state government and
 
05:09:01.110 --> 05:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
state uh created
 
05:09:01.120 --> 05:09:04.190 align:start position:0%
state uh created
entities

05:09:04.190 --> 05:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:06.070 --> 05:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
that completes my testimony Mr chairman
 
05:09:08.470 --> 05:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
I'd be pleased to answer any questions I
 
05:09:09.948 --> 05:09:09.958 align:start position:0%
understood there was some sort of a
 
05:09:12.390 --> 05:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
letter from or comment from police
 
05:09:15.750 --> 05:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
departments I have not seen that um I
 
05:09:20.350 --> 05:09:20.360 align:start position:0%
was in touch with um Chief David Cahill
 
05:09:20.360 --> 05:09:20.990 align:start position:0%
was in touch with um Chief David Cahill
of

05:09:20.990 --> 05:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:09:23.788 --> 05:09:23.798 align:start position:0%
snipe asking whether or not he had or
 
05:09:25.310 --> 05:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
the police had any issues with this I
 
05:09:27.430 --> 05:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
have not heard back from him so if
 
05:09:29.390 --> 05:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
testimony has sub been submitted by the
 
05:09:31.750 --> 05:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
police Chiefs I'm not aware of it I'd be
 
05:09:33.628 --> 05:09:33.638 align:start position:0%
pleased to answer any questions Mr
 
05:09:36.430 --> 05:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative
 
05:09:38.510 --> 05:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
Alexander um thank you Mr chair and
 
05:09:40.070 --> 05:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you honorable um Kirk for
 
05:09:42.788 --> 05:09:42.798 align:start position:0%
answering my question um my question um
 
05:09:44.350 --> 05:09:44.360 align:start position:0%
specifically is around like parking
 
05:09:46.670 --> 05:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
meters so when when somebody gets a
 
05:09:48.310 --> 05:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
ticket you know in downtown Manchester
 
05:09:50.750 --> 05:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
for a parking violation um the maid will
 
05:09:52.150 --> 05:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
typically take a picture of where the
 
05:09:54.910 --> 05:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
car was um at that moment um just to use
 
05:09:56.590 --> 05:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
as evidence in case there was it like a
 
05:09:58.430 --> 05:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
hearing or anything so under this bill
 
05:10:00.750 --> 05:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
that would be prohibited and I guess my
 
05:10:03.430 --> 05:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
followup to that would
 
05:10:05.110 --> 05:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
would there be any way for the state to
 
05:10:06.628 --> 05:10:06.638 align:start position:0%
prove that the car was parked in a
 
05:10:09.670 --> 05:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
certain spot if an appeal was done if
 
05:10:11.510 --> 05:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
this if this is not a
 
05:10:11.520 --> 05:10:13.350 align:start position:0%
this if this is not a
lot

05:10:13.350 --> 05:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
lot
 
05:10:16.670 --> 05:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure what kinds of pictures
 
05:10:18.470 --> 05:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
are being taken let's assume it's with a
 
05:10:20.230 --> 05:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
cell phone that kind of picture is that
 
05:10:21.750 --> 05:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about representative
 
05:10:23.830 --> 05:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
Alexander um I'm I'm talking
 
05:10:25.788 --> 05:10:25.798 align:start position:0%
specifically about they have like pads
 
05:10:26.948 --> 05:10:26.958 align:start position:0%
that they'll do that they'll take a
 
05:10:28.750 --> 05:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
picture of where the car was like on the
 
05:10:30.470 --> 05:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
sidewalk at a certain like with a time
 
05:10:32.750 --> 05:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
stamp on it um that's happens on a
 
05:10:35.110 --> 05:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
regular basis in downtown Manchester so
 
05:10:37.788 --> 05:10:37.798 align:start position:0%
I guess that's my question well please
 
05:10:39.430 --> 05:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
note that the bill doesn't prevent
 
05:10:42.590 --> 05:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
taking pictures it prevents using a
 
05:10:45.390 --> 05:10:45.400 align:start position:0%
camera take to take pictures to identify
 
05:10:49.030 --> 05:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
a vehicle or to identify its
 
05:10:51.868 --> 05:10:51.878 align:start position:0%
occupants now I don't know exactly what
 
05:10:53.788 --> 05:10:53.798 align:start position:0%
it is that the
 
05:10:57.070 --> 05:10:57.080 align:start position:0%
um what kind of a picture the the uh
 
05:11:00.310 --> 05:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
meter made is taking but if it's not to
 
05:11:03.110 --> 05:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
identify the vehicle or the or or its
 
05:11:04.990 --> 05:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
occupants then it's not prohibited by
 
05:11:07.310 --> 05:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
this bill by this current statute or by
 
05:11:07.320 --> 05:11:11.788 align:start position:0%
this bill by this current statute or by
this

05:11:11.788 --> 05:11:11.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:16.070 --> 05:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
bill representative Chase thank you Mr
 
05:11:20.270 --> 05:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
chair and I just wanted to put my hand
 
05:11:23.310 --> 05:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
down what I was referring to before when
 
05:11:25.150 --> 05:11:25.160 align:start position:0%
I said about the Ry Police Department
 
05:11:27.350 --> 05:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
Hampton and the force it's the the
 
05:11:30.110 --> 05:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
letter that or testimony we got had
 
05:11:31.670 --> 05:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
today from the state of Hampshire
 
05:11:33.390 --> 05:11:33.400 align:start position:0%
Department Department of Natural and
 
05:11:35.670 --> 05:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
cultural resources the same one you had
 
05:11:39.390 --> 05:11:39.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned so there was nothing that was
 
05:11:40.990 --> 05:11:41.000 align:start position:0%
received from any
 
05:11:44.270 --> 05:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
individual Department as far as I know I
 
05:11:46.910 --> 05:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify that so you
 
05:11:49.628 --> 05:11:49.638 align:start position:0%
weren't wondering about it thank you
 
05:11:52.230 --> 05:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
very much that puts my mind at ease but
 
05:11:55.310 --> 05:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
I one thing I'm not sure if you are the
 
05:11:57.910 --> 05:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
one that the last person told me to
 
05:12:00.670 --> 05:12:00.680 align:start position:0%
refer to do you know how that's being
 
05:12:02.910 --> 05:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
worked is there is this something that's
 
05:12:05.070 --> 05:12:05.080 align:start position:0%
at the dispatchers office and they're
 
05:12:07.750 --> 05:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
watching the cameras or is it on a
 
05:12:10.030 --> 05:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
looped reel that after a certain amount
 
05:12:12.868 --> 05:12:12.878 align:start position:0%
of time the tapes are erased you know
 
05:12:15.628 --> 05:12:15.638 align:start position:0%
like like a surveillance camera
 
05:12:17.948 --> 05:12:17.958 align:start position:0%
and um you re
 
05:12:20.750 --> 05:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
reloaded you you may thank you for that
 
05:12:22.270 --> 05:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
question representative Shas you may
 
05:12:24.310 --> 05:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
have reached the limit of my knowledge
 
05:12:26.350 --> 05:12:26.360 align:start position:0%
about these kinds of activities but let
 
05:12:28.350 --> 05:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
me just say that there are two
 
05:12:30.670 --> 05:12:30.680 align:start position:0%
circumstances which may help you there
 
05:12:33.390 --> 05:12:33.400 align:start position:0%
is an exemption for parking lots in the
 
05:12:36.110 --> 05:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
the park and ride system in the current
 
05:12:38.430 --> 05:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
statue and in those situations they
 
05:12:40.750 --> 05:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
mount cameras on poles and the cameras
 
05:12:43.310 --> 05:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
are taking pictures and those cameras as
 
05:12:45.548 --> 05:12:45.558 align:start position:0%
I understand it are not being
 
05:12:50.070 --> 05:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
supervised they're used to um deal with
 
05:12:53.628 --> 05:12:53.638 align:start position:0%
perhaps theft or break-ins um and if
 
05:12:55.190 --> 05:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
there's a break-in then they look to the
 
05:12:59.190 --> 05:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
cameras film and use that to prosecute
 
05:13:01.830 --> 05:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
um there are also cameras I Believe on
 
05:13:05.230 --> 05:13:05.240 align:start position:0%
Route 93 that are mounted on poles that
 
05:13:08.948 --> 05:13:08.958 align:start position:0%
take pictures of vehicles going back and
 
05:13:11.868 --> 05:13:11.878 align:start position:0%
forth and those are viewed by a central
 
05:13:13.910 --> 05:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
loc at a central location I believe in
 
05:13:15.750 --> 05:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation
 
05:13:19.270 --> 05:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
facility I think it's in lonia and those
 
05:13:22.750 --> 05:13:22.760 align:start position:0%
are not recorded they are live only and
 
05:13:24.948 --> 05:13:24.958 align:start position:0%
they are used by the department in cases
 
05:13:27.030 --> 05:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
of accidents so that if a truck tips
 
05:13:29.390 --> 05:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
over and there are hazardous materials
 
05:13:31.868 --> 05:13:31.878 align:start position:0%
or something like that uh identific
 
05:13:33.910 --> 05:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
ation can be made and information passed
 
05:13:36.430 --> 05:13:36.440 align:start position:0%
on to the police departments those are
 
05:13:39.390 --> 05:13:39.400 align:start position:0%
the only areas that I'm aware of except
 
05:13:41.670 --> 05:13:41.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps some communities are illegally
 
05:13:43.868 --> 05:13:43.878 align:start position:0%
using cameras for other purposes but
 
05:13:45.510 --> 05:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
those are the only two situations that
 
05:13:48.150 --> 05:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of where cameras are being uh
 
05:13:48.160 --> 05:13:49.868 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of where cameras are being uh
used

05:13:49.868 --> 05:13:49.878 align:start position:0%
used
 
05:13:54.070 --> 05:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
appropriately thank you very much that
 
05:13:57.070 --> 05:13:57.080 align:start position:0%
helps are there other questions for
 
05:13:59.190 --> 05:13:59.200 align:start position:0%
former representative
 
05:14:01.470 --> 05:14:01.480 align:start position:0%
Kirk I guess I'd just like to follow up
 
05:14:01.480 --> 05:14:02.350 align:start position:0%
Kirk I guess I'd just like to follow up
on

05:14:02.350 --> 05:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:14:05.990 --> 05:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative sobber's question to
 
05:14:09.590 --> 05:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative Earth and with regard to
 
05:14:13.310 --> 05:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
the PO boo specifically the Easy Pass
 
05:14:14.548 --> 05:14:14.558 align:start position:0%
where they're taking pictures of
 
05:14:16.788 --> 05:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
vehicles going through and he thought
 
05:14:18.390 --> 05:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
that there might be an exception for
 
05:14:20.590 --> 05:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
that is there an exception in the law
 
05:14:24.110 --> 05:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
for that as well um I believe there is
 
05:14:26.230 --> 05:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
an exception I don't believe it's in
 
05:14:28.150 --> 05:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
this bill I believe it's in the Easy
 
05:14:28.160 --> 05:14:29.070 align:start position:0%
this bill I believe it's in the Easy
Pass

05:14:29.070 --> 05:14:29.080 align:start position:0%
Pass
 
05:14:32.670 --> 05:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
bill um but but I I found it I found it
 
05:14:35.150 --> 05:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
in the statute in the existing statute
 
05:14:35.160 --> 05:14:37.230 align:start position:0%
in the statute in the existing statute
thank

05:14:37.230 --> 05:14:37.240 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:14:40.750 --> 05:14:40.760 align:start position:0%
you and the the the other thing and I
 
05:14:42.628 --> 05:14:42.638 align:start position:0%
think this is the same question that
 
05:14:45.430 --> 05:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
came up last year in this or a similar
 
05:14:48.830 --> 05:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
Bill and that's with regard to the use
 
05:14:50.868 --> 05:14:50.878 align:start position:0%
of the word I think surveillance more
 
05:14:52.750 --> 05:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
than anything else because surveillance
 
05:14:54.590 --> 05:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
just and this is sort of a followup to
 
05:14:56.868 --> 05:14:56.878 align:start position:0%
what representative Chase was talking
 
05:14:59.670 --> 05:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
about is surveillance tends to think of
 
05:15:02.868 --> 05:15:02.878 align:start position:0%
a a continuous behav Behavior as opposed
 
05:15:06.670 --> 05:15:06.680 align:start position:0%
to a single event like just taking a
 
05:15:09.830 --> 05:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
picture a one-time picture but as I
 
05:15:13.590 --> 05:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
understand it as it's defined here it
 
05:15:17.510 --> 05:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
would mean the use of surveillance would
 
05:15:19.990 --> 05:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
include just a one time taking a picture
 
05:15:21.548 --> 05:15:21.558 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:15:21.558 --> 05:15:25.350 align:start position:0%
is that
correct

05:15:25.350 --> 05:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:28.270 --> 05:15:28.280 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe that was the intent
 
05:15:30.310 --> 05:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
but I think the language could certainly
 
05:15:32.868 --> 05:15:32.878 align:start position:0%
be interpreted that way
 
05:15:36.990 --> 05:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
um it the the as I said before uh
 
05:15:39.788 --> 05:15:39.798 align:start position:0%
representative Gordon the purpose of the
 
05:15:43.270 --> 05:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
bill was to prevent a record being kept
 
05:15:46.788 --> 05:15:46.798 align:start position:0%
of where people were and what they were
 
05:15:49.628 --> 05:15:49.638 align:start position:0%
doing and hence
 
05:15:51.708 --> 05:15:51.718 align:start position:0%
surveillance was intended to mean
 
05:15:53.990 --> 05:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
exactly what you described the ongoing
 
05:15:56.510 --> 05:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
continuous activity as opposed to a
 
05:15:56.520 --> 05:15:57.548 align:start position:0%
continuous activity as opposed to a
single

05:15:57.548 --> 05:15:57.558 align:start position:0%
single
 
05:16:01.230 --> 05:16:01.240 align:start position:0%
picture um I thought there was something
 
05:16:02.990 --> 05:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
in the statute that dealt with it but
 
05:16:08.948 --> 05:16:08.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:12.110 --> 05:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
read that that gets to the it seems to
 
05:16:13.990 --> 05:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
me it gets to the issue that was raised
 
05:16:16.470 --> 05:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
by representative Alexander that you
 
05:16:18.350 --> 05:16:18.360 align:start position:0%
know a one-time event of taking a
 
05:16:20.070 --> 05:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
picture for a
 
05:16:21.990 --> 05:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle because
 
05:16:24.548 --> 05:16:24.558 align:start position:0%
it's I think I found it Senator uh
 
05:16:27.430 --> 05:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
excuse me representative um if you look
 
05:16:32.910 --> 05:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
under uh RSA 236 130 Roman
 
05:16:36.070 --> 05:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
3B it says the prohibition set forth in
 
05:16:38.470 --> 05:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
paragraph 2 that's the surveillance
 
05:16:41.350 --> 05:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
prohibition shall not apply where
 
05:16:45.548 --> 05:16:45.558 align:start position:0%
surveillance and this is uh B is
 
05:16:48.110 --> 05:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
undertaken on a caseby casee basis in
 
05:16:50.030 --> 05:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
the investigation of a particular
 
05:16:52.150 --> 05:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
violation misdemeanor or
 
05:16:55.910 --> 05:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
felony so this I think would clearly
 
05:16:57.868 --> 05:16:57.878 align:start position:0%
exempt the meter made taking a picture
 
05:17:01.708 --> 05:17:01.718 align:start position:0%
of the car or or a policeman using a
 
05:17:03.670 --> 05:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
dash cam or anything like that to take
 
05:17:06.110 --> 05:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
pictures of a particular
 
05:17:08.390 --> 05:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
incident and I believe that was put in
 
05:17:10.150 --> 05:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
there just to deal with that situation
 
05:17:12.110 --> 05:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
so I think representative Alexander's
 
05:17:14.350 --> 05:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
concerns are specifically addressed in
 
05:17:16.270 --> 05:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
the current statute and that of course
 
05:17:19.750 --> 05:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
would continue in effect it should house
 
05:17:23.788 --> 05:17:23.798 align:start position:0%
bill um 474 be
 
05:17:26.910 --> 05:17:26.920 align:start position:0%
enacted in other words no the the house
 
05:17:29.628 --> 05:17:29.638 align:start position:0%
bill 474 does not make any change in the
 
05:17:33.230 --> 05:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
rest of this uh bill which has uh as
 
05:17:37.628 --> 05:17:37.638 align:start position:0%
representative Earth said um eight or 10
 
05:17:40.990 --> 05:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
uh exemptions from the general
 
05:17:43.190 --> 05:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
prohibition thank you representative
 
05:17:45.948 --> 05:17:45.958 align:start position:0%
Horgan um thank you very much Mr chair
 
05:17:48.990 --> 05:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
thank you much uh former representative
 
05:17:50.830 --> 05:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
Kirk good to see you again even if we
 
05:17:53.470 --> 05:17:53.480 align:start position:0%
can't actually see you but um my
 
05:17:55.708 --> 05:17:55.718 align:start position:0%
question is how does this affect uh
 
05:17:59.628 --> 05:17:59.638 align:start position:0%
public institutions like the uh like
 
05:18:01.788 --> 05:18:01.798 align:start position:0%
like the State House itself which has
 
05:18:04.670 --> 05:18:04.680 align:start position:0%
they have video surveillance cameras
 
05:18:06.750 --> 05:18:06.760 align:start position:0%
most of which don't show images of
 
05:18:08.350 --> 05:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
public ways but I know there's at least
 
05:18:11.310 --> 05:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
two camera angles there's a one that
 
05:18:13.708 --> 05:18:13.718 align:start position:0%
actually I he CH it founded on the L
 
05:18:15.868 --> 05:18:15.878 align:start position:0%
that looks the front lawn of the L and
 
05:18:17.788 --> 05:18:17.798 align:start position:0%
obviously takes in a block of North
 
05:18:20.390 --> 05:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
State Street and then there's also a one
 
05:18:22.590 --> 05:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
that overlooks the lb parking lot which
 
05:18:24.310 --> 05:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
also shows part of Green Street so was
 
05:18:25.788 --> 05:18:25.798 align:start position:0%
your tent is
 
05:18:29.070 --> 05:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
that uh public insent can still deploy
 
05:18:30.868 --> 05:18:30.878 align:start position:0%
cameras in places like that or is your
 
05:18:33.470 --> 05:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
intent to say that they should shut that
 
05:18:35.270 --> 05:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
we should example shut those two cameras
 
05:18:37.868 --> 05:18:37.878 align:start position:0%
down because they would be violation of
 
05:18:40.708 --> 05:18:40.718 align:start position:0%
of this law if I didn't know you better
 
05:18:42.190 --> 05:18:42.200 align:start position:0%
representative Oregan I would think that
 
05:18:43.030 --> 05:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
was a
 
05:18:47.070 --> 05:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
softball um it's good to see you uh
 
05:18:49.628 --> 05:18:49.638 align:start position:0%
section again the prohibition shall not
 
05:18:53.470 --> 05:18:53.480 align:start position:0%
apply to I'm reading on Roman
 
05:18:53.480 --> 05:18:55.070 align:start position:0%
apply to I'm reading on Roman
32d

05:18:55.070 --> 05:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
32d
 
05:18:58.230 --> 05:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
um is incidental to the monitoring of a
 
05:19:00.110 --> 05:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
building or other structure under the
 
05:19:02.030 --> 05:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
control of the state or a political
 
05:19:05.070 --> 05:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
subdivision of the state so if the
 
05:19:07.190 --> 05:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
conquered Public Library were to put a
 
05:19:09.150 --> 05:19:09.160 align:start position:0%
camera over its front door as you said
 
05:19:10.788 --> 05:19:10.798 align:start position:0%
the State House were to put a camera on
 
05:19:12.990 --> 05:19:13.000 align:start position:0%
the building and it caught pictures of
 
05:19:15.390 --> 05:19:15.400 align:start position:0%
people driving by on the various streets
 
05:19:17.270 --> 05:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
that would not be a violation of the
 
05:19:19.708 --> 05:19:19.718 align:start position:0%
statute that's specifically
 
05:19:19.718 --> 05:19:21.590 align:start position:0%
statute that's specifically
Exempted

05:19:21.590 --> 05:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
Exempted
 
05:19:24.190 --> 05:19:24.200 align:start position:0%
thanks and that's again that's not in
 
05:19:25.670 --> 05:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment that's not in the bill
 
05:19:29.070 --> 05:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
that's in current law okay good thanks
 
05:19:30.230 --> 05:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
any other
 
05:19:30.240 --> 05:19:31.910 align:start position:0%
any other
questions

05:19:31.910 --> 05:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:19:31.920 --> 05:19:32.750 align:start position:0%
questions
if

05:19:32.750 --> 05:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:19:35.590 --> 05:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
not first of all it's nice to hear from
 
05:19:37.150 --> 05:19:37.160 align:start position:0%
you again and thank you very much for
 
05:19:39.230 --> 05:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
your testimony I appreciate it Mr
 
05:19:40.510 --> 05:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
chairman it's good to see you in your
 
05:19:43.190 --> 05:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
role your new role one of
 
05:19:47.230 --> 05:19:47.240 align:start position:0%
many thank you uh the next person would
 
05:19:57.910 --> 05:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:00.590 --> 05:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
rusa good afternoon Mr chair and members
 
05:20:02.310 --> 05:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
of the committee and thank you for the
 
05:20:04.390 --> 05:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify this afternoon my
 
05:20:05.948 --> 05:20:05.958 align:start position:0%
name is Jeannie haruska I'm the
 
05:20:07.390 --> 05:20:07.400 align:start position:0%
political director for the American
 
05:20:09.470 --> 05:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
civil liberties Union of New Hampshire
 
05:20:11.310 --> 05:20:11.320 align:start position:0%
and I'm really here actually in support
 
05:20:14.110 --> 05:20:14.120 align:start position:0%
of Representative Kirk uh we strongly
 
05:20:16.948 --> 05:20:16.958 align:start position:0%
supported the the original bill that he
 
05:20:19.670 --> 05:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
passed in 2006 and really do see this as
 
05:20:23.470 --> 05:20:23.480 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to restore what he and we
 
05:20:25.510 --> 05:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
believe the legislature intended with
 
05:20:28.430 --> 05:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
that original bill um which was to guard
 
05:20:30.830 --> 05:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
against generalized surveillance and to
 
05:20:33.470 --> 05:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that New Hampshire does not
 
05:20:37.030 --> 05:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
become a surveillance State um just by
 
05:20:39.110 --> 05:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
way of example New York city has an
 
05:20:42.310 --> 05:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
estimated 18,000 cameras linked to a
 
05:20:44.708 --> 05:20:44.718 align:start position:0%
system the New York uh police department
 
05:20:48.070 --> 05:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
calls quote domain awareness system some
 
05:20:50.350 --> 05:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
estimates indicate that London has
 
05:20:54.310 --> 05:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
upwards of 600,000 surveillance cameras
 
05:20:56.310 --> 05:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
um and if you want a for another example
 
05:20:58.670 --> 05:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
on that by next year China is projected
 
05:21:01.510 --> 05:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
to have one public camera for every two
 
05:21:03.948 --> 05:21:03.958 align:start position:0%
people um so there are a number of
 
05:21:06.390 --> 05:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
examples where cameras are just becoming
 
05:21:09.190 --> 05:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
ubiquitous and New Hampshire for a long
 
05:21:11.270 --> 05:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
time has been a state committed to
 
05:21:13.750 --> 05:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
privacy um and rather than waiting for
 
05:21:15.590 --> 05:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
cameras to be erected and trying to take
 
05:21:18.110 --> 05:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
them down this is an effort to try and
 
05:21:21.270 --> 05:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
prevent that sort of surveillance State
 
05:21:24.708 --> 05:21:24.718 align:start position:0%
um ahead of time um so representative
 
05:21:27.310 --> 05:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
Kirk uh I actually want to quote him
 
05:21:28.788 --> 05:21:28.798 align:start position:0%
because we pulled up some of the
 
05:21:31.590 --> 05:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
testimony from the 2006
 
05:21:35.110 --> 05:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh legislation and he when he uh fought
 
05:21:37.910 --> 05:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
successfully for that 2006 legislation
 
05:21:39.910 --> 05:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
he said at the time quote this is a bill
 
05:21:41.830 --> 05:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
that basically says that the state shall
 
05:21:44.548 --> 05:21:44.558 align:start position:0%
not take General surveillance pictures
 
05:21:46.590 --> 05:21:46.600 align:start position:0%
of the citizens traveling on the state
 
05:21:49.110 --> 05:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
highways all this bill does is that it
 
05:21:52.548 --> 05:21:52.558 align:start position:0%
says that there can be no generalized
 
05:21:54.670 --> 05:21:54.680 align:start position:0%
surveillance um and so I want to stress
 
05:21:57.470 --> 05:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
that and flag um representative Kirk
 
05:22:00.310 --> 05:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned a couple there are a number of
 
05:22:03.670 --> 05:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
exceptions to this in current statute so
 
05:22:05.708 --> 05:22:05.718 align:start position:0%
I really encourage the commit to take a
 
05:22:09.948 --> 05:22:09.958 align:start position:0%
look at RSA 236 colon 130 because a lot
 
05:22:12.270 --> 05:22:12.280 align:start position:0%
of the questions that have come up um
 
05:22:15.190 --> 05:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
are addressed by those very specific
 
05:22:17.390 --> 05:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
exceptions there's um as has been noted
 
05:22:19.150 --> 05:22:19.160 align:start position:0%
there's an except there's a specific one
 
05:22:21.390 --> 05:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
for toll collection um there's a
 
05:22:24.150 --> 05:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
specific one pertaining to caseby casee
 
05:22:26.270 --> 05:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
investigations um and I think what the
 
05:22:29.390 --> 05:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
what those exceptions point to is that
 
05:22:31.990 --> 05:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
the bill is is geared towards General
 
05:22:34.310 --> 05:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
surveillance right cameras that are not
 
05:22:37.430 --> 05:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
focused on a specific incident but are
 
05:22:39.910 --> 05:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
permanently um built into the
 
05:22:42.150 --> 05:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so that there's no
 
05:22:44.110 --> 05:22:44.120 align:start position:0%
there's no way to walk down the sidewalk
 
05:22:46.070 --> 05:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
and not be captured by the camera right
 
05:22:48.230 --> 05:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
the camera is not investigating a crime
 
05:22:51.310 --> 05:22:51.320 align:start position:0%
it's just there um and so you can
 
05:22:52.750 --> 05:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
imagine right you're going to your
 
05:22:54.430 --> 05:22:54.440 align:start position:0%
therapist's office you're going to the
 
05:22:57.708 --> 05:22:57.718 align:start position:0%
doctor's office um these are times when
 
05:22:59.548 --> 05:22:59.558 align:start position:0%
you really don't want to be caught on
 
05:23:02.510 --> 05:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
camera um and so the goal is to try and
 
05:23:04.708 --> 05:23:04.718 align:start position:0%
prevent the state from just erecting
 
05:23:07.990 --> 05:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
cameras around town where when used
 
05:23:09.990 --> 05:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
together could really track your
 
05:23:12.990 --> 05:23:13.000 align:start position:0%
movements and reveal a lot about you and
 
05:23:15.910 --> 05:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
your private life um including your
 
05:23:18.948 --> 05:23:18.958 align:start position:0%
doctor your relationships your social
 
05:23:22.030 --> 05:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
life um so that's really the intent of
 
05:23:25.070 --> 05:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
the bill and again we think all this
 
05:23:28.230 --> 05:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
statute does is go back to what the
 
05:23:32.270 --> 05:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
legislature intended 14 years ago um so
 
05:23:34.430 --> 05:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
this isn't new ground it's just
 
05:23:36.390 --> 05:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
reaffirming what the legislature
 
05:23:39.190 --> 05:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
intended to do when it when it passed
 
05:23:42.470 --> 05:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
the RSA back in 2006 um so we strongly
 
05:23:44.350 --> 05:23:44.360 align:start position:0%
support this bill we supported it last
 
05:23:46.628 --> 05:23:46.638 align:start position:0%
year and we encourage the committee to
 
05:23:49.548 --> 05:23:49.558 align:start position:0%
vote a to pass I'm happy to answer any
 
05:23:55.030 --> 05:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:57.190 --> 05:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
hesa seeing none thank you for your
 
05:23:59.510 --> 05:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
testimony today thank
 
05:24:07.150 --> 05:24:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:10.390 --> 05:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
Abbott thank you uh chairman Gordon uh
 
05:24:11.990 --> 05:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
committee members for the record my
 
05:24:15.390 --> 05:24:15.400 align:start position:0%
name's Gary Abbott uh I'm the Executive
 
05:24:18.190 --> 05:24:18.200 align:start position:0%
Vice President of the associated general
 
05:24:20.390 --> 05:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
contractors of New
 
05:24:23.590 --> 05:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I'm gonna I'm probably
 
05:24:25.270 --> 05:24:25.280 align:start position:0%
gonna throw a curveball a little bit
 
05:24:27.070 --> 05:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
because I do think the chairman brought
 
05:24:28.230 --> 05:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
up the word
 
05:24:30.230 --> 05:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
surveillance uh I brought this bill
 
05:24:33.470 --> 05:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
before contractors who work on do and
 
05:24:37.390 --> 05:24:37.400 align:start position:0%
administrative Services projects and the
 
05:24:39.430 --> 05:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
construction industry uses a lot of
 
05:24:41.430 --> 05:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
cameras today more cameras today than
 
05:24:43.948 --> 05:24:43.958 align:start position:0%
they did in
 
05:24:48.990 --> 05:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
2006 and one of the concerns was we are
 
05:24:51.548 --> 05:24:51.558 align:start position:0%
we an extension of the state when we're
 
05:24:53.788 --> 05:24:53.798 align:start position:0%
working on a state
 
05:24:57.430 --> 05:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
project so if we're working on an i93
 
05:25:00.390 --> 05:25:00.400 align:start position:0%
project I I'll give you some cases we
 
05:25:03.470 --> 05:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
take lots of pictures with phones uh for
 
05:25:06.548 --> 05:25:06.558 align:start position:0%
grades all of the GPS type systems out
 
05:25:09.990 --> 05:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
there contractors use drones and we get
 
05:25:13.150 --> 05:25:13.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of the public ways so we're using
 
05:25:14.948 --> 05:25:14.958 align:start position:0%
cameras and there were I can tell you
 
05:25:17.470 --> 05:25:17.480 align:start position:0%
when I brought this up my committee
 
05:25:20.070 --> 05:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
raised a lot of uses of cameras that are
 
05:25:22.590 --> 05:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
currently being used on a construction
 
05:25:25.070 --> 05:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
site so we question the word
 
05:25:26.948 --> 05:25:26.958 align:start position:0%
surveillance uh I think we're kind of
 
05:25:28.270 --> 05:25:28.280 align:start position:0%
like some of the other people that are
 
05:25:31.350 --> 05:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
commenting to you uh we're reading this
 
05:25:34.430 --> 05:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
whether those kind of project specifics
 
05:25:36.868 --> 05:25:36.878 align:start position:0%
where we might get a vehicle we might
 
05:25:40.590 --> 05:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
get a person on a sidewalk um whether
 
05:25:43.590 --> 05:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
this applies to us so I don't have the
 
05:25:45.310 --> 05:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
legal question of whether we're an
 
05:25:48.510 --> 05:25:48.520 align:start position:0%
extension or a political subdivision of
 
05:25:50.990 --> 05:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
the government when working on their
 
05:25:53.548 --> 05:25:53.558 align:start position:0%
projects I also recognized when it went
 
05:25:56.470 --> 05:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
in uh I watched this bill back when it
 
05:25:59.150 --> 05:25:59.160 align:start position:0%
was first proposed represent Kirk
 
05:26:01.868 --> 05:26:01.878 align:start position:0%
regarding toll boost and I believe the
 
05:26:03.708 --> 05:26:03.718 align:start position:0%
addition in this bill it was raised
 
05:26:06.628 --> 05:26:06.638 align:start position:0%
earlier you add the word or
 
05:26:09.190 --> 05:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
location uh unless you put some kind of
 
05:26:12.150 --> 05:26:12.160 align:start position:0%
exemption under the toll boost statute
 
05:26:14.708 --> 05:26:14.718 align:start position:0%
that this doesn't apply that this it
 
05:26:16.628 --> 05:26:16.638 align:start position:0%
would conflict because toll boosts are
 
05:26:18.430 --> 05:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
clearly taking the picture of the
 
05:26:21.150 --> 05:26:21.160 align:start position:0%
license plate and the location the time
 
05:26:23.788 --> 05:26:23.798 align:start position:0%
and all of those things and it is new in
 
05:26:26.230 --> 05:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
this new language and it could be in
 
05:26:29.788 --> 05:26:29.798 align:start position:0%
Conflict but let's go back to um it's
 
05:26:31.350 --> 05:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
great to have a he hearing where I can
 
05:26:35.910 --> 05:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
pull up on a computer uh RSA 236 colon
 
05:26:40.030 --> 05:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
130 I could not find construction as
 
05:26:41.750 --> 05:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
exempt on that
 
05:26:44.310 --> 05:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
list I looked at all the different
 
05:26:48.030 --> 05:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
options and I don't see where it's clear
 
05:26:50.590 --> 05:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
uh whether we be in compliance or not in
 
05:26:53.510 --> 05:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
compliance with the proposed statute and
 
05:26:56.270 --> 05:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
clearly we're in the public RightWay
 
05:26:58.628 --> 05:26:58.638 align:start position:0%
within the ways of the the the
 
05:27:01.750 --> 05:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
definition of this so I guess I'm going
 
05:27:03.230 --> 05:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
to leave it up to the wisdom of the
 
05:27:05.510 --> 05:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
committee whether there's an exemption
 
05:27:08.070 --> 05:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
that should be put in because I I
 
05:27:10.270 --> 05:27:10.280 align:start position:0%
definitely heard uh former
 
05:27:12.708 --> 05:27:12.718 align:start position:0%
representative Neil Kirk say it really
 
05:27:14.430 --> 05:27:14.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't involve the
 
05:27:16.788 --> 05:27:16.798 align:start position:0%
individuals but in the case where we
 
05:27:18.990 --> 05:27:19.000 align:start position:0%
might be considered an extension of the
 
05:27:21.430 --> 05:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
state it's not really clear it's getting
 
05:27:23.868 --> 05:27:23.878 align:start position:0%
a little gray so my group wanted me to
 
05:27:27.390 --> 05:27:27.400 align:start position:0%
bring forward to you these concerns and
 
05:27:28.868 --> 05:27:28.878 align:start position:0%
it really is a question of whether we
 
05:27:31.310 --> 05:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
should be added to the exemption
 
05:27:36.350 --> 05:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
under 236 130 uh that section where it
 
05:27:38.230 --> 05:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
has clear exemptions for the state and
 
05:27:40.990 --> 05:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
their cameras whether construction for
 
05:27:44.628 --> 05:27:44.638 align:start position:0%
the incidental use of uh doing a project
 
05:27:47.230 --> 05:27:47.240 align:start position:0%
would be considered uh exempt from this
 
05:27:49.830 --> 05:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
regulation so what I'd end my testimony
 
05:27:52.230 --> 05:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
with those two issues that are before us
 
05:27:55.110 --> 05:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
as we're trying to interpret this new
 
05:27:58.070 --> 05:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
language thank you for your testimony
 
05:28:03.390 --> 05:28:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:05.350 --> 05:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none again thank you for
 
05:28:08.230 --> 05:28:08.240 align:start position:0%

05:28:26.708 --> 05:28:26.718 align:start position:0%
Conley hi Mr chairman can you can you
 
05:28:30.390 --> 05:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
hear me we can oh thank you so much for
 
05:28:32.190 --> 05:28:32.200 align:start position:0%
for having this hearing today uh just
 
05:28:34.750 --> 05:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Ross Connelly
 
05:28:36.628 --> 05:28:36.638 align:start position:0%
the deputy state director for Americans
 
05:28:38.948 --> 05:28:38.958 align:start position:0%
for Prosperity in New Hampshire and I'm
 
05:28:42.310 --> 05:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
here to voice our support for HB
 
05:28:45.070 --> 05:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
474 uh as we've heard this bill protects
 
05:28:47.670 --> 05:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
state agencies or prohibits I'm sorry
 
05:28:50.110 --> 05:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
prohibits state agencies from engaging
 
05:28:51.670 --> 05:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
in warrantless surveillance of the
 
05:28:55.230 --> 05:28:55.240 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire HB 474 updates
 
05:28:57.510 --> 05:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
existing law on Highway video
 
05:28:59.150 --> 05:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
surveillance and prevents cameras and
 
05:29:00.948 --> 05:29:00.958 align:start position:0%
other devices from being used to
 
05:29:03.510 --> 05:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
determine the ownership or location of a
 
05:29:06.390 --> 05:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle and as the Supreme Court
 
05:29:08.628 --> 05:29:08.638 align:start position:0%
has recognized we all have a lower
 
05:29:11.150 --> 05:29:11.160 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy when we drive on
 
05:29:14.150 --> 05:29:14.160 align:start position:0%
public roads but the court has only
 
05:29:16.590 --> 05:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
created a constitutional floor for
 
05:29:19.030 --> 05:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
privacy and this legislature can and
 
05:29:22.150 --> 05:29:22.160 align:start position:0%
should do more to protect privacy and
 
05:29:24.628 --> 05:29:24.638 align:start position:0%
given the rapid deployment of tracking
 
05:29:26.190 --> 05:29:26.200 align:start position:0%
technology this prohibition is
 
05:29:26.200 --> 05:29:27.430 align:start position:0%
technology this prohibition is
absolutely

05:29:27.430 --> 05:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
05:29:29.750 --> 05:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
necessary uh the people of New Hampshire
 
05:29:32.990 --> 05:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
spoke very loudly two years ago when 81%
 
05:29:34.948 --> 05:29:34.958 align:start position:0%
of Voters passed the Constitutional
 
05:29:38.070 --> 05:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
amendment to protect their privacy and
 
05:29:40.030 --> 05:29:40.040 align:start position:0%
this bill goes a long way to protect the
 
05:29:42.830 --> 05:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
right to as the amendment States live
 
05:29:45.310 --> 05:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
free from government intrusion uh in
 
05:29:47.350 --> 05:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
private or personal information is
 
05:29:50.470 --> 05:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
natural essential and inherent uh and
 
05:29:53.350 --> 05:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
just want to be brief uh and for those
 
05:29:55.868 --> 05:29:55.878 align:start position:0%
reasons we urge uh the committee to to
 
05:29:59.110 --> 05:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
move HB 474 ought to pass and I'd be
 
05:30:00.910 --> 05:30:00.920 align:start position:0%
happy to take any question
 
05:30:02.948 --> 05:30:02.958 align:start position:0%

article 7 is clear and prescriptive

language of article 83 is clearly
 
05:33:04.590 --> 05:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
aspirational not prescriptive words

prescriptive if it were prescriptive
 
05:33:10.150 --> 05:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
then would we not be obligated as a
 
05:33:11.910 --> 05:33:11.920 align:start position:0%
legislature to provide financing for the
 
05:33:14.150 --> 05:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
other things article 83 encourages and
 
05:33:17.030 --> 05:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
cherishes the article say cited above
 
05:33:18.708 --> 05:33:18.718 align:start position:0%
are plain English of our constitution
 
05:33:19.990 --> 05:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
words that aren't found in our
 
05:33:23.070 --> 05:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution are President uh precedent
 
05:33:25.470 --> 05:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
steroid diseases and co-equal these are
 
05:33:27.350 --> 05:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
legal constructs they may be useful to
 
05:33:28.948 --> 05:33:28.958 align:start position:0%
the courts but they are clearly inferior
 
05:33:30.510 --> 05:33:30.520 align:start position:0%
to the people's Constitution tion into
 
05:33:32.788 --> 05:33:32.798 align:start position:0%
the statutes enacted by The People's
 
05:33:35.590 --> 05:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
representatives from Wikipedia one of
 
05:33:37.350 --> 05:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
the most important rules of Precedence
 
05:33:39.310 --> 05:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
or roles of precedents is to resolve
 
05:33:41.270 --> 05:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
ambiguities in other legal texts such as
 
05:33:43.948 --> 05:33:43.958 align:start position:0%
constitutions statutes and regulations
 
05:33:46.030 --> 05:33:46.040 align:start position:0%
the process involves first and foremost
 
05:33:47.548 --> 05:33:47.558 align:start position:0%
consultation of the plain language of
 
05:33:50.430 --> 05:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
the text as enlightened by legislative
 
05:33:51.868 --> 05:33:51.878 align:start position:0%
history of enactment subsequent
 
05:33:53.788 --> 05:33:53.798 align:start position:0%
precedent and experience with very
 
05:33:57.548 --> 05:33:57.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:00.350 --> 05:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
text um capricious use of precedent the
 
05:34:02.230 --> 05:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
courts have addicts full of conflicting
 
05:34:05.030 --> 05:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
precedents in Claremont the court chose
 
05:34:06.750 --> 05:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
to base their decision on a Kentucky
 
05:34:09.230 --> 05:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
president while a ignoring article 7 of
 
05:34:11.470 --> 05:34:11.480 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution they used
 
05:34:13.390 --> 05:34:13.400 align:start position:0%
article 83 of our constitution as a
 
05:34:16.070 --> 05:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
false justification of their decision in
 
05:34:17.708 --> 05:34:17.718 align:start position:0%
doing so they turned the plain
 
05:34:20.150 --> 05:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
aspirational language of article 83 on
 
05:34:22.670 --> 05:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
its head it said that precedents make
 
05:34:24.430 --> 05:34:24.440 align:start position:0%
the law predictable and knowable to lay
 
05:34:26.350 --> 05:34:26.360 align:start position:0%
people however the converse is often
 
05:34:27.948 --> 05:34:27.958 align:start position:0%
true if the courts are free to pick and
 
05:34:29.470 --> 05:34:29.480 align:start position:0%
choose among precedents and ignore
 
05:34:31.430 --> 05:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
pieces of the Constitution and statut
 
05:34:33.310 --> 05:34:33.320 align:start position:0%
that don't suit their whim then they use
 
05:34:35.230 --> 05:34:35.240 align:start position:0%
of precedents to justify their position
 
05:34:36.708 --> 05:34:36.718 align:start position:0%
is essentially an overturning of the
 
05:34:39.430 --> 05:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
Constitution and elected government when
 
05:34:41.390 --> 05:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
our constitutions were first enacted in
 
05:34:43.270 --> 05:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
1784 and
 
05:34:45.548 --> 05:34:45.558 align:start position:0%
1789 they were the philosophy of freedom
 
05:34:47.830 --> 05:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
and self-government put into words quote
 
05:34:49.548 --> 05:34:49.558 align:start position:0%
Thomas Payne one of the philosophers
 
05:34:51.390 --> 05:34:51.400 align:start position:0%
precedent law is one of the viol systems
 
05:34:54.510 --> 05:34:54.520 align:start position:0%
that can be set up here we are 237 years
 
05:34:56.230 --> 05:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
later and our constitution has been
 
05:34:58.310 --> 05:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
supplanted by precedent law the people's
 
05:35:00.510 --> 05:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
Representatives have become infer to
 
05:35:02.750 --> 05:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
unelected judges I ask the vote
 
05:35:04.150 --> 05:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
committee to vote off to pass on this
 
05:35:06.230 --> 05:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
HCR and take one step toward restoring
 
05:35:07.708 --> 05:35:07.718 align:start position:0%
self-government and the people's
 
05:35:09.788 --> 05:35:09.798 align:start position:0%
Constitution thank you Mr chairman and
 
05:35:11.190 --> 05:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
committee members if there are any
 
05:35:13.310 --> 05:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
questions I'll be happy to take them
 
05:35:15.110 --> 05:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative
 
05:35:17.470 --> 05:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
Horgan oh thank you very much Mr chair
 
05:35:20.430 --> 05:35:20.440 align:start position:0%
thank you much represent Wiki um I'm
 
05:35:24.470 --> 05:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
just trying to figure out here is U
 
05:35:25.830 --> 05:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
obviously you objected to Claremont
 
05:35:27.990 --> 05:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
decision but is that strictly because of
 
05:35:31.788 --> 05:35:31.798 align:start position:0%
the policy where like that we frankly
 
05:35:34.430 --> 05:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
have never gotten around to passing laws
 
05:35:36.110 --> 05:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
that eat the requirement to clont
 
05:35:38.628 --> 05:35:38.638 align:start position:0%
decision or is it uh or do
 
05:35:41.470 --> 05:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
also object to the result of it which is
 
05:35:43.670 --> 05:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
where which is whereby towns that have
 
05:35:46.430 --> 05:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
uh lower tax bases still uh have a
 
05:35:47.788 --> 05:35:47.798 align:start position:0%
better chance of educating their
 
05:35:50.708 --> 05:35:50.718 align:start position:0%
children so is it the it merely the
 
05:35:52.230 --> 05:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
result of the Claremont decision that
 
05:35:53.628 --> 05:35:53.638 align:start position:0%
we're trying to overturn here or is it
 
05:35:56.190 --> 05:35:56.200 align:start position:0%
also like the uh it merely the process
 
05:35:58.990 --> 05:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
but that followed that decision today is
 
05:36:00.910 --> 05:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
specifically for
 
05:36:03.110 --> 05:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
however the basic principle that the
 
05:36:05.350 --> 05:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
constitution belongs to the people not
 
05:36:08.110 --> 05:36:08.120 align:start position:0%
to the courts is the basis for this know
 
05:36:11.190 --> 05:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
the fact that we've had to uh reinforce
 
05:36:13.590 --> 05:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
our Bell of Rights numerous times um
 
05:36:16.868 --> 05:36:16.878 align:start position:0%
article 2A article 8 uh concerning
 
05:36:18.788 --> 05:36:18.798 align:start position:0%
standing um the one that was mentioned
 
05:36:20.750 --> 05:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
before concerning privacy these things
 
05:36:22.910 --> 05:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
were all in the Constitution already and
 
05:36:24.990 --> 05:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
this is just really an attempt on the
 
05:36:27.110 --> 05:36:27.120 align:start position:0%
specific subject of school funding to
 
05:36:29.110 --> 05:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
say that that is the perview of the
 
05:36:31.030 --> 05:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
legislature are not of the courts very
 
05:36:34.270 --> 05:36:34.280 align:start position:0%
clearly money bills must um or originate
 
05:36:36.548 --> 05:36:36.558 align:start position:0%
in the house they don't originate in the
 
05:36:38.110 --> 05:36:38.120 align:start position:0%
courts and this is clearly the opposite
 
05:36:40.708 --> 05:36:40.718 align:start position:0%
of that and so we need to overturn it
 
05:36:42.310 --> 05:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
and doing it just simply by a
 
05:36:43.830 --> 05:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
declaration of the house
 
05:36:46.230 --> 05:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
saying essentially pound sand for this
 
05:36:50.670 --> 05:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
session is what this uh resolution says
 
05:36:54.628 --> 05:36:54.638 align:start position:0%
that's thank you for follow up Mr chair
 
05:36:55.948 --> 05:36:55.958 align:start position:0%
may I guess that sounds like it's a
 
05:36:58.470 --> 05:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
process you didn't like but U and the
 
05:37:01.310 --> 05:37:01.320 align:start position:0%
represent Bon's I sitting here so I've
 
05:37:03.708 --> 05:37:03.718 align:start position:0%
got the website you can look up what

interim studies was that the HCR you're
 
05:37:28.310 --> 05:37:28.320 align:start position:0%

it and to provide accountability this is
 
05:39:37.670 --> 05:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
also stated on page one of hcr3 line 7
 
05:39:40.230 --> 05:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
and8 I would challenge the sponsor to
 
05:39:42.590 --> 05:39:42.600 align:start position:0%
site those places where the court has
 
05:39:45.110 --> 05:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
done so nothing could be further from
 
05:39:47.590 --> 05:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
the truth the court in its numerous
 
05:39:50.150 --> 05:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
opinions on this issue has stated
 
05:39:52.590 --> 05:39:52.600 align:start position:0%
clearly that those responsibilities are
 
05:39:55.510 --> 05:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
the domain of the legislature the court
 
05:39:57.948 --> 05:39:57.958 align:start position:0%
has stated that whatever decisions the
 
05:40:00.070 --> 05:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
legislature makes however
 
05:40:03.070 --> 05:40:03.080 align:start position:0%
must comply with the two constitutional
 
05:40:05.670 --> 05:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to provide education
 
05:40:09.190 --> 05:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
and that tax rates must not vary among
 
05:40:12.350 --> 05:40:12.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayers some of what follows in hcr3
 
05:40:15.190 --> 05:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
is noted already is copied from text of
 
05:40:20.070 --> 05:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
HCR 26 and that in turn was copied from
 
05:40:22.270 --> 05:40:22.280 align:start position:0%
a legislation in the
 
05:40:25.708 --> 05:40:25.718 align:start position:0%
2001 uh legislative
 
05:40:29.708 --> 05:40:29.718 align:start position:0%
session page two lines 16 and 18 through
 
05:40:32.628 --> 05:40:32.638 align:start position:0%
18 if you've read the paper I submitted
 
05:40:35.468 --> 05:40:35.478 align:start position:0%
you will recognize that this is a
 
05:40:37.830 --> 05:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
complete misunderstanding of the first
 
05:40:41.868 --> 05:40:41.878 align:start position:0%
50 years cited during those years it was
 
05:40:44.788 --> 05:40:44.798 align:start position:0%
this legislature that set the amount to
 
05:40:47.868 --> 05:40:47.878 align:start position:0%
be raised and spent on schools in every
 
05:40:50.350 --> 05:40:50.360 align:start position:0%
town in the state there were no school
 
05:40:53.548 --> 05:40:53.558 align:start position:0%
boards Selectmen who may or may not have
 
05:40:55.788 --> 05:40:55.798 align:start position:0%
funded schools under the old provincial
 
05:40:58.868 --> 05:40:58.878 align:start position:0%
laws were told on no uncertain terms by
 
05:41:02.750 --> 05:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
this legislature that they were required
 
05:41:05.670 --> 05:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
required to raise by taxes the amount
 
05:41:09.150 --> 05:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
the legislature deemed necessary under
 
05:41:11.628 --> 05:41:11.638 align:start position:0%
the new constitution this was a complete
 
05:41:14.788 --> 05:41:14.798 align:start position:0%
takeover of school funding by the state
 
05:41:17.670 --> 05:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
from what had been a relatively L Fair
 
05:41:21.310 --> 05:41:21.320 align:start position:0%
system under earlier law to make their
 
05:41:24.230 --> 05:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
point even further the new law stated
 
05:41:27.310 --> 05:41:27.320 align:start position:0%
that any Selectmen who did not comply
 
05:41:29.270 --> 05:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
would have the necessary funds for the
 
05:41:31.868 --> 05:41:31.878 align:start position:0%
schools in their towns taken from their
 
05:41:31.878 --> 05:41:33.510 align:start position:0%
schools in their towns taken from their
personal

05:41:33.510 --> 05:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
personal
 
05:41:36.430 --> 05:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
Estates later the legislature even
 
05:41:40.670 --> 05:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
doubled the amount to be taken for
 
05:41:44.548 --> 05:41:44.558 align:start position:0%
non-compliance page three lines 13 to 16
 
05:41:44.558 --> 05:41:45.750 align:start position:0%
non-compliance page three lines 13 to 16
of

05:41:45.750 --> 05:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:41:49.150 --> 05:41:49.160 align:start position:0%
hcr3 here it cites that important first
 
05:41:51.830 --> 05:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
law and states that that
 
05:41:55.510 --> 05:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
law quote constitutionality was never
 
05:41:59.788 --> 05:41:59.798 align:start position:0%
cast in doubt unquote so true but the
 
05:42:02.548 --> 05:42:02.558 align:start position:0%
sponsor of hcr3 never describes what
 
05:42:05.910 --> 05:42:05.920 align:start position:0%
that law did as I've described it took
 
05:42:08.270 --> 05:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
control over the funding of schools from
 
05:42:11.190 --> 05:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
local Boards of Selectmen and gave it to
 
05:42:11.200 --> 05:42:12.510 align:start position:0%
local Boards of Selectmen and gave it to
this

05:42:12.510 --> 05:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:42:15.030 --> 05:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
legislature our Supreme Court did not
 
05:42:17.110 --> 05:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
ignore the action of the first
 
05:42:20.110 --> 05:42:20.120 align:start position:0%
legislator as stated in these lines it
 
05:42:22.990 --> 05:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
reminded current legislatures of what
 
05:42:26.270 --> 05:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
those early legislator understood to be
 
05:42:29.150 --> 05:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
State responsibility and had done to up
 
05:42:30.628 --> 05:42:30.638 align:start position:0%
hold that
 
05:42:33.510 --> 05:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility it was only in the 1890
 
05:42:36.670 --> 05:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
to 1919 period that local school boards
 
05:42:38.910 --> 05:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
began to supplement the amount required
 
05:42:41.670 --> 05:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
by the legislature the way schools are
 
05:42:45.430 --> 05:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
now funded were funded in our generation
 
05:42:48.390 --> 05:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
and in our parents generation is most
 
05:42:50.350 --> 05:42:50.360 align:start position:0%
certainly not how they were funded
 
05:42:50.360 --> 05:42:51.868 align:start position:0%
certainly not how they were funded
before

05:42:51.868 --> 05:42:51.878 align:start position:0%
before
 
05:42:55.310 --> 05:42:55.320 align:start position:0%
1900 page three lines 21 and
 
05:42:58.628 --> 05:42:58.638 align:start position:0%
22 if this legislature quote findes and
 
05:43:00.270 --> 05:43:00.280 align:start position:0%
declares that the amount of State
 
05:43:03.270 --> 05:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
funding for public education required by
 
05:43:05.990 --> 05:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
the Constitution has been and remains
 
05:43:09.270 --> 05:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
zero dollar on quote it would come as a
 
05:43:12.468 --> 05:43:12.478 align:start position:0%
complete surprise to John Sullivan John
 
05:43:14.708 --> 05:43:14.718 align:start position:0%

to testify this afternoon on house
 
05:44:36.990 --> 05:44:37.000 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution three for the
 
05:44:39.230 --> 05:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
record my name is Jeff mcclinch and I'm
 
05:44:40.390 --> 05:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
the Project Director of the New
 
05:44:41.830 --> 05:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school funding fairness
 
05:44:44.350 --> 05:44:44.360 align:start position:0%
project uh the fair funding project
 
05:44:47.270 --> 05:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
opposes hcr3 and respectfully request
 
05:44:48.948 --> 05:44:48.958 align:start position:0%
that the committee recommend the measure
 
05:44:51.548 --> 05:44:51.558 align:start position:0%
as inexpedient to legislate it does so
 
05:44:53.830 --> 05:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
for two reasons first as Mr H has
 
05:44:55.868 --> 05:44:55.878 align:start position:0%
already explained the measure is based
 
05:44:58.150 --> 05:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
on a misreading of legal history and the
 
05:44:59.468 --> 05:44:59.478 align:start position:0%
history of the state of New Hampshire's
 
05:45:01.430 --> 05:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
role in ensuring that every child
 
05:45:02.390 --> 05:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
receives an
 
05:45:05.948 --> 05:45:05.958 align:start position:0%
education second offers no constructive
 
05:45:08.548 --> 05:45:08.558 align:start position:0%
response to the very real short and
 
05:45:10.670 --> 05:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
long-term challenges now before New
 
05:45:12.750 --> 05:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's public schools and instead
 
05:45:14.750 --> 05:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
seeks to absolve the state of its well
 
05:45:16.270 --> 05:45:16.280 align:start position:0%
established responsibility for
 
05:45:20.430 --> 05:45:20.440 align:start position:0%
supporting them and I on
 
05:45:22.830 --> 05:45:22.840 align:start position:0%
second in the coming year cities and
 
05:45:24.948 --> 05:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
towns are expected to lose close to $90
 
05:45:27.750 --> 05:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
million in State education Aid due both
 
05:45:30.468 --> 05:45:30.478 align:start position:0%
to the covid-19 pandemic and changes in
 
05:45:32.868 --> 05:45:32.878 align:start position:0%
law that decline would likely Force
 
05:45:34.628 --> 05:45:34.638 align:start position:0%
municipalities to turn to significant
 
05:45:36.868 --> 05:45:36.878 align:start position:0%
property tax increases or to severe
 
05:45:38.310 --> 05:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
spending cuts as they set their school
 
05:45:41.948 --> 05:45:41.958 align:start position:0%
budgets for the next academic year hcr3
 
05:45:44.590 --> 05:45:44.600 align:start position:0%
would neither prevent such declines nor
 
05:45:46.750 --> 05:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
ease the potentially damaging decisions
 
05:45:49.270 --> 05:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
local officials now face nor ensure that
 
05:45:50.628 --> 05:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
the children of our state receive a
 
05:45:53.190 --> 05:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
quality education rather it offers a
 
05:45:54.788 --> 05:45:54.798 align:start position:0%
rhetorical declaration that the checks
 
05:45:57.750 --> 05:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
and balances so vital to our democracy
 
05:45:59.788 --> 05:45:59.798 align:start position:0%
are simply null and void
 
05:46:00.990 --> 05:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
other measures now before the
 
05:46:03.548 --> 05:46:03.558 align:start position:0%
legislature such as Senate Bill 135
 
05:46:05.628 --> 05:46:05.638 align:start position:0%
which the Senate approved yesterday
 
05:46:07.390 --> 05:46:07.400 align:start position:0%
would address those chall in a far more
 
05:46:09.670 --> 05:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
subsi Manner and I urge the members of
 
05:46:11.468 --> 05:46:11.478 align:start position:0%
the committee to support them
 
05:46:13.590 --> 05:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
instead sadly these short-term
 
05:46:17.430 --> 05:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
challenges are in some ways extension of
 
05:46:19.390 --> 05:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
of those much longer of excuse me
 
05:46:21.430 --> 05:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
extension of the much longer term
 
05:46:23.510 --> 05:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
problems plaguing New Hampshire's school
 
05:46:25.868 --> 05:46:25.878 align:start position:0%
funding system our report prepared for
 
05:46:27.310 --> 05:46:27.320 align:start position:0%
the recent commission to study school
 
05:46:29.270 --> 05:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
funding summarizes those problems
 
05:46:31.628 --> 05:46:31.638 align:start position:0%
clearly and succinctly noting and I'll
 
05:46:34.070 --> 05:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
just quote briefly the current system is
 
05:46:36.230 --> 05:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
inqu inequitable from both student and
 
05:46:38.708 --> 05:46:38.718 align:start position:0%
taxpayer perspectives District serving
 
05:46:40.750 --> 05:46:40.760 align:start position:0%
the highest proportion of students who
 
05:46:42.430 --> 05:46:42.440 align:start position:0%
are economically disadvantaged spend
 
05:46:47.548 --> 05:46:47.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:49.708 --> 05:46:49.718 align:start position:0%
District moreover the districts with the
 
05:46:51.948 --> 05:46:51.958 align:start position:0%
least property wealth per student impose
 
05:46:54.190 --> 05:46:54.200 align:start position:0%
the highest local education tax rates to
 
05:46:55.990 --> 05:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
be able to fund their children's
 
05:46:58.230 --> 05:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
education other legislation now under
 
05:47:00.230 --> 05:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
consideration in both Chambers Senate
 
05:47:03.270 --> 05:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
Bill 155 in the case of the Senate and
 
05:47:05.150 --> 05:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
and House Bill 608 in the case of the
 
05:47:07.430 --> 05:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
house would take important steps towards
 
05:47:09.230 --> 05:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
mitigating these inequities and
 
05:47:11.430 --> 05:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
empowering local districts to provide
 
05:47:13.030 --> 05:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
every child with the kind of education
 
05:47:16.708 --> 05:47:16.718 align:start position:0%
they will need to thrive hcr3 represents
 
05:47:18.948 --> 05:47:18.958 align:start position:0%
not a concrete plan for future action
 
05:47:20.910 --> 05:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
but a rhetorical revisitation of past
 
05:47:23.628 --> 05:47:23.638 align:start position:0%
debates accordingly I want more urge the
 
05:47:25.310 --> 05:47:25.320 align:start position:0%

chairman and members of the committee
 
05:48:37.708 --> 05:48:37.718 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Dan Maguire
 
05:48:41.350 --> 05:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
I'm from Epsom and I'm here to support
 
05:48:44.468 --> 05:48:44.478 align:start position:0%
representative lii and and
 
05:48:47.628 --> 05:48:47.638 align:start position:0%
hcr3 and I don't want to argue with the
 
05:48:50.190 --> 05:48:50.200 align:start position:0%
representative Hall's scholarship which
 
05:48:52.548 --> 05:48:52.558 align:start position:0%
certainly I have not read his paper but
 
05:48:56.270 --> 05:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
it sounds complete and the question here
 
05:49:01.750 --> 05:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
is not whether the the um legislature in
 
05:49:05.628 --> 05:49:05.638 align:start position:0%
the past uh supported schools and if so
 
05:49:08.628 --> 05:49:08.638 align:start position:0%
how it's the question is can they be
 
05:49:11.070 --> 05:49:11.080 align:start position:0%
ordered by the court to do so in a in a
 
05:49:14.270 --> 05:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
specific way and in more detail does our
 
05:49:17.868 --> 05:49:17.878 align:start position:0%
constitution in uh part two article 83
 
05:49:20.990 --> 05:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
require them to support schools in a
 
05:49:24.230 --> 05:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
particular way to a particular amount
 
05:49:27.708 --> 05:49:27.718 align:start position:0%
and so on and um if you read the
 
05:49:29.390 --> 05:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
original clar
 
05:49:34.150 --> 05:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
decision uh the court said uh I I'll
 
05:49:38.390 --> 05:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
give you a short quote here um that we
 
05:49:40.670 --> 05:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
do not construe the terms uh shall be
 
05:49:43.430 --> 05:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
the duty to cherish in our constitution
 
05:49:46.430 --> 05:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
as a mere statement of aspiration the
 
05:49:49.628 --> 05:49:49.638 align:start position:0%
language commands commands in no
 
05:49:52.270 --> 05:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
uncertain terms that the state provideed
 
05:49:54.070 --> 05:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
an education to all its citizens and
 
05:49:57.030 --> 05:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
support all public schools now I think
 
05:50:00.190 --> 05:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
that is you know clearly
 
05:50:00.200 --> 05:50:01.750 align:start position:0%
that is you know clearly
false

05:50:01.750 --> 05:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
false
 
05:50:05.948 --> 05:50:05.958 align:start position:0%
um article 83 as representative luiki
 
05:50:09.430 --> 05:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
pointed out has the exact same language
 
05:50:12.230 --> 05:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
regarding seminaries literature and the
 
05:50:18.788 --> 05:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
sciences and so on and the Arts um and
 
05:50:21.510 --> 05:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
no one is at all suggesting that the
 
05:50:24.548 --> 05:50:24.558 align:start position:0%
legislature is required to fund those
 
05:50:27.708 --> 05:50:27.718 align:start position:0%
things um public schools are just
 
05:50:30.788 --> 05:50:30.798 align:start position:0%
mentioned as one of of many items in
 
05:50:33.270 --> 05:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
that sentence so so anything that
 
05:50:35.150 --> 05:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
applies to Public Schools would clearly
 
05:50:38.350 --> 05:50:38.360 align:start position:0%
apply to others the other part of the uh
 
05:50:42.110 --> 05:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court's
 
05:50:44.750 --> 05:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
reasoning is the is their interpretation
 
05:50:47.830 --> 05:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
of the word cherish as requiring
 
05:50:51.948 --> 05:50:51.958 align:start position:0%
spending and um the way they said that
 
05:50:55.230 --> 05:50:55.240 align:start position:0%
was they used a an ancient dictionary
 
05:50:57.830 --> 05:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
and thought that somehow uh the word
 
05:50:59.788 --> 05:50:59.798 align:start position:0%
cherish means support and support means
 
05:51:02.430 --> 05:51:02.440 align:start position:0%
spending and stuff like that but but the
 
05:51:05.030 --> 05:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
word cherish the meaning of it has not
 
05:51:07.590 --> 05:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
changed from the time that the uh
 
05:51:10.310 --> 05:51:10.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution was written and as evidence
 
05:51:14.868 --> 05:51:14.878 align:start position:0%
for that let me uh quote you from uh one
 
05:51:17.110 --> 05:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
of George Washington's most famous
 
05:51:19.110 --> 05:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
speeches so George Washington had two
 
05:51:21.468 --> 05:51:21.478 align:start position:0%
very famous speeches his inaugural
 
05:51:24.350 --> 05:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
address and his farewell address and his
 
05:51:26.628 --> 05:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
farewell address in
 
05:51:29.708 --> 05:51:29.718 align:start position:0%
1796 used the word word cherish three
 
05:51:33.510 --> 05:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
times and all three of those uh uses of
 
05:51:35.750 --> 05:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
the word cherish were exactly the same
 
05:51:39.390 --> 05:51:39.400 align:start position:0%
way we would use the word today um
 
05:51:43.430 --> 05:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
meaning to you know hold in high esteem
 
05:51:46.830 --> 05:51:46.840 align:start position:0%
and um support and so on but not has
 
05:51:48.910 --> 05:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with spending or or paying
 
05:51:51.990 --> 05:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
for it so so here's um three short
 
05:51:53.430 --> 05:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
quotes from that
 
05:51:56.750 --> 05:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
speech um it is of an infinite moment
 
05:51:58.628 --> 05:51:58.638 align:start position:0%
that you should properly estimate the
 
05:52:02.190 --> 05:52:02.200 align:start position:0%
immense value of your National Union to
 
05:52:04.788 --> 05:52:04.798 align:start position:0%
your Collective and individual happiness
 
05:52:08.310 --> 05:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
you should cherish uh a cordial habitual
 
05:52:12.110 --> 05:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
and immovable attachment to it so you
 
05:52:14.310 --> 05:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
know you're cherishing an attachment to
 
05:52:16.190 --> 05:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
the National Union it has nothing to do
 
05:52:18.190 --> 05:52:18.200 align:start position:0%
with with taxes or spending or anything
 
05:52:22.110 --> 05:52:22.120 align:start position:0%
like that later on in the speech he says
 
05:52:24.750 --> 05:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
um of all the dispositions and habits
 
05:52:27.150 --> 05:52:27.160 align:start position:0%
which lead to political Prosperity
 
05:52:30.548 --> 05:52:30.558 align:start position:0%
religion and moral it are indispensable
 
05:52:33.548 --> 05:52:33.558 align:start position:0%
supports the mere politician equally
 
05:52:36.190 --> 05:52:36.200 align:start position:0%
with the pious man ought to respect and
 
05:52:39.868 --> 05:52:39.878 align:start position:0%
cherish them so you you should cherish
 
05:52:42.190 --> 05:52:42.200 align:start position:0%
uh religion and morality clearly it
 
05:52:45.310 --> 05:52:45.320 align:start position:0%
didn't mean spending any money on them
 
05:52:46.310 --> 05:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
and then
 
05:52:49.350 --> 05:52:49.360 align:start position:0%
finally as a very important source of
 
05:52:52.948 --> 05:52:52.958 align:start position:0%
strength and security cherish Public
 
05:52:55.910 --> 05:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
Credit One method of preserving it is to
 
05:52:59.910 --> 05:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
use it as sparingly as possible so again
 
05:53:02.310 --> 05:53:02.320 align:start position:0%
he's saying that the the uh credit of
 
05:53:05.750 --> 05:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
the US government ought to be um
 
05:53:09.270 --> 05:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
cherished I mean ought ought to be uh
 
05:53:12.270 --> 05:53:12.280 align:start position:0%
preserved but it has nothing to do with
 
05:53:14.310 --> 05:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
with specifically with spending in some
 
05:53:17.190 --> 05:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
way so the word cherish means what it's
 
05:53:20.510 --> 05:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
always meant um and our constitution
 
05:53:23.230 --> 05:53:23.240 align:start position:0%
means what it's always meant so
 
05:53:25.230 --> 05:53:25.240 align:start position:0%
representative liwicki was absolutely
 
05:53:27.708 --> 05:53:27.718 align:start position:0%
correct on on those points thank you
 
05:53:29.830 --> 05:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chairman and members of the
 
05:53:32.548 --> 05:53:32.558 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for your testimony
 
05:53:34.390 --> 05:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
and representative silver do you have a
 
05:53:37.230 --> 05:53:37.240 align:start position:0%
question I have a question yes it it see
 
05:53:40.948 --> 05:53:40.958 align:start position:0%
you the question really isn't from a you
 
05:53:43.468 --> 05:53:43.478 align:start position:0%
know a a a long-term view of the
 
05:53:45.830 --> 05:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
Claremont decision if we don't like the
 
05:53:47.510 --> 05:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
Claremont decision and we don't think
 
05:53:50.070 --> 05:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
the people like the Claremont
 
05:53:53.390 --> 05:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
decision why don't we just have a cacr
 
05:53:55.150 --> 05:53:55.160 align:start position:0%
for a constitutional amendment present
 
05:53:57.030 --> 05:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
to the people to overturn The Claremont
 
05:53:59.350 --> 05:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
decision instead of resolution which the
 
05:54:01.230 --> 05:54:01.240 align:start position:0%
court can just you know put up in the
 
05:54:03.548 --> 05:54:03.558 align:start position:0%
wall in the bathroom or
 
05:54:06.030 --> 05:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
something well thank you very much
 
05:54:08.910 --> 05:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
representative but it's not what the
 
05:54:10.788 --> 05:54:10.798 align:start position:0%
court will do in response to this
 
05:54:12.670 --> 05:54:12.680 align:start position:0%
resolution the question is what will the
 
05:54:15.830 --> 05:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
legislature do in terms of its decisions
 
05:54:18.270 --> 05:54:18.280 align:start position:0%
about education and funding and so on
 
05:54:20.868 --> 05:54:20.878 align:start position:0%
right what will it put in its budget um
 
05:54:25.190 --> 05:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
and that kind of thing and so
 
05:54:28.190 --> 05:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
um some would you know many people would
 
05:54:29.788 --> 05:54:29.798 align:start position:0%
agree with you that the way to respond
 
05:54:32.190 --> 05:54:32.200 align:start position:0%
to the court is with a constitutional
 
05:54:36.590 --> 05:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
amendment but I can tell you I I was um
 
05:54:39.350 --> 05:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
personally uh very involved in the
 
05:54:41.788 --> 05:54:41.798 align:start position:0%
passing of our last two Constitutional
 
05:54:45.590 --> 05:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
Amendments uh the ones about um privacy
 
05:54:49.150 --> 05:54:49.160 align:start position:0%
and so on and it it is extremely
 
05:54:51.110 --> 05:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
difficult to pass a constitutional
 
05:54:54.510 --> 05:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
amendment and so the question is if the
 
05:54:57.750 --> 05:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
court is acting as in a dictatorial
 
05:54:57.760 --> 05:54:58.868 align:start position:0%
court is acting as in a dictatorial
fashion

05:54:58.868 --> 05:54:58.878 align:start position:0%
fashion
 
05:55:00.708 --> 05:55:00.718 align:start position:0%
is the only
 
05:55:03.468 --> 05:55:03.478 align:start position:0%
response uh when many many in the
 
05:55:06.788 --> 05:55:06.798 align:start position:0%
legislature may agree with their uh
 
05:55:10.830 --> 05:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
conclusions uh to require 2third of vote
 
05:55:12.910 --> 05:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
of the people and 60% vote of the
 
05:55:16.510 --> 05:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
legislature and so on to to overcome
 
05:55:20.708 --> 05:55:20.718 align:start position:0%
that error um or should it simply be
 
05:55:23.590 --> 05:55:23.600 align:start position:0%
that the legislature together with the
 
05:55:28.510 --> 05:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
executive um who also have uh re they're
 
05:55:30.788 --> 05:55:30.798 align:start position:0%
also required by their Oaths to follow
 
05:55:33.430 --> 05:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
the Constitution and interpret the
 
05:55:36.070 --> 05:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution um should just the actions
 
05:55:38.708 --> 05:55:38.718 align:start position:0%
of those two bodies be sufficient and I
 
05:55:41.670 --> 05:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
would say the latter there's nothing in
 
05:55:44.150 --> 05:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
our constitution either the us or the
 
05:55:46.350 --> 05:55:46.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution that somehow
 
05:55:48.548 --> 05:55:48.558 align:start position:0%
makes the Judiciary superior to the
 
05:55:51.030 --> 05:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
other two branches and so if the other
 
05:55:52.910 --> 05:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
two branches want to conduct their
 
05:55:55.310 --> 05:55:55.320 align:start position:0%
Affairs in their opinion
 
05:55:57.150 --> 05:55:57.160 align:start position:0%
constitutionally they should be allowed
 
05:56:00.150 --> 05:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:01.990 --> 05:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
sober do you have a
 
05:56:06.110 --> 05:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
f no I I I I think I understand I
 
05:56:08.230 --> 05:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
understand the argument I just it would
 
05:56:11.150 --> 05:56:11.160 align:start position:0%
just seemed to me that a uh no forget it
 
05:56:12.990 --> 05:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's enough I raised the issue
 
05:56:17.548 --> 05:56:17.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:21.070 --> 05:56:21.080 align:start position:0%
Oregan the uh the next to last paragraph
 
05:56:23.830 --> 05:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
it says uh whereas the legislature
 
05:56:25.350 --> 05:56:25.360 align:start position:0%
hereby finds declares the amount of
 
05:56:26.830 --> 05:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
State funding for public education
 
05:56:28.670 --> 05:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
required by the Constitution
 
05:56:33.390 --> 05:56:33.400 align:start position:0%
has been remain zero dollars and um so
 
05:56:35.270 --> 05:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether or what you what
 
05:56:37.430 --> 05:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
you're a Claremont decision try to make
 
05:56:38.830 --> 05:56:38.840 align:start position:0%
a cost argument that it had to be
 
05:56:41.430 --> 05:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
something other than zero do you think a
 
05:56:43.310 --> 05:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
zero dollar State contribution where
 
05:56:45.548 --> 05:56:45.558 align:start position:0%
there's no state aid to school districts
 
05:56:49.910 --> 05:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
is a good idea or or or not and you have
 
05:56:52.830 --> 05:56:52.840 align:start position:0%
any opinion on what if it's not zero
 
05:56:56.548 --> 05:56:56.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:59.190 --> 05:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
be um thank you representative for the
 
05:57:02.030 --> 05:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
question I think it's
 
05:57:04.708 --> 05:57:04.718 align:start position:0%
somewhat uh irrelevant what I would
 
05:57:08.430 --> 05:57:08.440 align:start position:0%
think on that subject um
 
05:57:12.070 --> 05:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I think it's very unlikely I mean
 
05:57:14.030 --> 05:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
just politically it's very unlikely the
 
05:57:16.830 --> 05:57:16.840 align:start position:0%
legislature would ever spend zero on
 
05:57:16.840 --> 05:57:18.868 align:start position:0%
legislature would ever spend zero on
public

05:57:18.868 --> 05:57:18.878 align:start position:0%
public
 
05:57:20.948 --> 05:57:20.958 align:start position:0%
