Greenland who's right behind me and
 
00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
Brad's going to be the other researchers
 
00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:45.050 align:start position:0%
Brad's going to be the other researchers
so

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:45.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 align:start position:0%

right here and Jamie just started
 
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
um this January and she might might as
 
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
well have been here 10 years she's been
 
00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.060 align:start position:0%
right she got she just came right in the
 
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.220 align:start position:0%
thick things and has been great since
 
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.060 align:start position:0%
she arrived um Jamie is in and is in
 
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
your uh binder she's in room 301 and her
 
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
extension is 3125. and of course Brad
 
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
and Jen they're on the fourth floor with
 
00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:27.539 align:start position:0%
the rest of us
 
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
so the first thing that I want to
 
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.529 align:start position:0%
so the first thing that I want to
mention

00:07:30.529 --> 00:07:30.539 align:start position:0%
mention
 
00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
um is I sent you a corrected or I
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
delivered to all of you this morning I
 
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:37.620 align:start position:0%
corrected uh special committee on
 
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
commission's membership and staff
 
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:41.460 align:start position:0%
listing because I had a member's name
 
00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:44.699 align:start position:0%
wrong but it has um all the members
 
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
there now and it has your meeting room
 
00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
which is 104 and then it has the
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
researchers as well as Jamie with the
 
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
numbers so you can reach anybody and
 
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to help you
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
um and I asked so as president Dylan
 
00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.570 align:start position:0%
um and I asked so as president Dylan
mentioned

00:07:59.570 --> 00:07:59.580 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
we received a couple of questions
 
00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
regarding things and we said well
 
00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:05.759 align:start position:0%
um Deborah and I thought that would
 
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
probably be helpful if we could walk you
 
00:08:11.089 --> 00:08:11.099 align:start position:0%
through the binder because you know
 
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes you just get we know what it
 
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
is but also you say oh
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
can someone help me figure out what all
 
00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
this material is is about so that's why
 
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
I thought it'd be helpful to walk you
 
00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:22.199 align:start position:0%
through it unfortunately
 
00:08:23.749 --> 00:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
um I told Deborah that we didn't we
 
00:08:25.369 --> 00:08:25.379 align:start position:0%
didn't both have to be here that I could
 
00:08:27.469 --> 00:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
walk us you all through this and if she
 
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
has um or you have any questions
 
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:30.969 align:start position:0%
has um or you have any questions
um

00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:30.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:33.800 align:start position:0%
just feel free to call either one of us
 
00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
so your first section on committee was
 
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
where we had done the membership in
 
00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
staff and then the committee on
 
00:08:42.649 --> 00:08:42.659 align:start position:0%
commissions the
 
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:44.700 align:start position:0%
the problem statement the special
 
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
committee's charge
 
00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:48.300 align:start position:0%
um Deborah went over that when we did
 
00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
our um
 
00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
our slide uh presentation last week the
 
00:08:56.329 --> 00:08:56.339 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint but that's all listed right
 
00:08:59.090 --> 00:08:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:02.329 --> 00:09:02.339 align:start position:0%
um review or access as you're looking
 
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
back figuring out why where you're doing
 
00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
what you're doing
 
00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
the next uh listing is the relevant
 
00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
statutes and house rules so this comes
 
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
from our office house key services and
 
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:17.240 align:start position:0%
the most important obviously is RSA 1449
 
00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
which oversees
 
00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:20.870 align:start position:0%
which oversees
um

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
the the aspect of the legislative study
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
committee and commissions and this was
 
00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
amended last year to make those uh what
 
00:09:32.449 --> 00:09:32.459 align:start position:0%
we think are significant changes which
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
includes that no commission shelled more
 
00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
than 15 members and may include
 
00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:39.180 align:start position:0%
employees who are not members of general
 
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
court but that the majority are our
 
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
members of the um
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
the general court and that the
 
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
appointment for the members is
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
coterminous with their term in office
 
00:09:51.839 --> 00:09:52.550 align:start position:0%
coterminous with their term in office
um

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.050 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:56.690 --> 00:09:56.700 align:start position:0%
so that status right there and then
 
00:10:00.889 --> 00:10:00.899 align:start position:0%
um house rule 37 which refers to the
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
chapter study committee duration and
 
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.250 align:start position:0%
chapter study committee duration and
membership

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
membership
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
so those are two there are other some
 
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:08.940 align:start position:0%
other statutes that may apply
 
00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:11.820 align:start position:0%
and some other rules but these are the
 
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:12.769 align:start position:0%
and some other rules but these are the
major

00:10:12.769 --> 00:10:12.779 align:start position:0%
major
 
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
um house this is Major house Rule and
 
00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
statute that applies to the commissions
 
00:10:22.009 --> 00:10:22.019 align:start position:0%
um the next one are the initiatives
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
we staff pull together
 
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.490 align:start position:0%
we staff pull together
um

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
highlights of
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
what we thought were significant and
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to go we can go back Beyond
 
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
93 but I think I mentioned last week we
 
00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:35.220 align:start position:0%
thought 30 years
 
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
was a pretty good perspective but you
 
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:40.380 align:start position:0%
can see that's that is start off that's
 
00:10:44.449 --> 00:10:44.459 align:start position:0%
when um 1449 was enacted in 93 and
 
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%
initially was thought to help curb these
 
00:10:51.889 --> 00:10:51.899 align:start position:0%
studies and then in 1995 the OLS
 
00:10:51.899 --> 00:10:53.290 align:start position:0%
studies and then in 1995 the OLS
director

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:53.300 align:start position:0%
director
 
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
had a memo which I can get a copy to you
 
00:10:59.449 --> 00:10:59.459 align:start position:0%
but both the house and sudden leadership
 
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
met and before this we never had the
 
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
boilerplate language regarding reports
 
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
due by November 1 and that they're
 
00:11:09.949 --> 00:11:09.959 align:start position:0%
supposed to go to the governor said a
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
present speaker they just went anywhere
 
00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
and they were just a hodgepodge of
 
00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:16.860 align:start position:0%
whatever so there was a this was not
 
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:18.420 align:start position:0%
obviously done through legislation it
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
was just a joint agreement and a memo
 
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
from the OLS director stating
 
00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:25.079 align:start position:0%
moving forward that that information had
 
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
to be included in every single
 
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
um study committee report
 
00:11:33.889 --> 00:11:33.899 align:start position:0%
but a sidebar as that stuff goes astray
 
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
is when
 
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.769 align:start position:0%
is when
uh

00:11:36.769 --> 00:11:36.779 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:38.820 align:start position:0%
a term or two terms down the road a new
 
00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:40.140 align:start position:0%
Senator came in and said why do we have
 
00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:42.300 align:start position:0%
to here to adhere to November one I want
 
00:11:44.569 --> 00:11:44.579 align:start position:0%
December one and that's how things begin
 
00:11:47.269 --> 00:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
to change
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
so uh in 09 House Bill 2 that's where
 
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
this original the Lori Harding study
 
00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:56.509 align:start position:0%
this original the Lori Harding study
commission

00:11:56.509 --> 00:11:56.519 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
um started and that's and you can see it
 
00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:00.650 align:start position:0%
um started and that's and you can see it
um

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:00.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:02.519 align:start position:0%
they reviewed everything and
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
non-regulatory committees uh created by
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
state law because the regulatory
 
00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
committees have a different role and we
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
we don't over uh see those obviously
 
00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
um when they met
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
um what their goals were
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
um and how they filed legislation to
 
00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
eliminate duplicative outdated or
 
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.090 align:start position:0%
eliminate duplicative outdated or
um

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:23.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
or unnecessary committees
 
00:12:27.949 --> 00:12:27.959 align:start position:0%
um the suggested PL of 62 committees and
 
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
they completed that process in by 2010
 
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
and 2011.
 
00:12:35.329 --> 00:12:35.339 align:start position:0%
and then in 2010 they had another
 
00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:37.740 align:start position:0%
committee I think this was
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
um an offshoot of 09 and they continued
 
00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
that was part of the cleanup process
 
00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
that they went through to get rid of all
 
00:12:52.009 --> 00:12:52.019 align:start position:0%
of those uh suggested 62 committees
 
00:12:52.019 --> 00:12:57.290 align:start position:0%
of those uh suggested 62 committees
um

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
yes that's that was that was the
 
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
initiative for 2010 and 2011 we'd have
 
00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:02.820 align:start position:0%
to look up every single one to make sure
 
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
they were there might have been
 
00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
an argument why one or two weren't but
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
yes it was a bulk a huge a huge bulk of
 
00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
them and I would say probably all of
 
00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.750 align:start position:0%
them and I would say probably all of
them

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
um and then in uh
 
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
wait what years and then in 2011 we also
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
had house rule 37g
 
00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
um which we we added um
 
00:13:30.889 --> 00:13:30.899 align:start position:0%
any study commute Commission test for
 
00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:32.220 align:start position:0%
any other like entity creative
 
00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
authorized by chapter lost shall file
 
00:13:36.769 --> 00:13:36.779 align:start position:0%
its report and dissolved by November 1st
 
00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
of the second year only legislators
 
00:13:41.569 --> 00:13:41.579 align:start position:0%
shall be members of such entities that
 
00:13:41.579 --> 00:13:42.290 align:start position:0%
shall be members of such entities that
was

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.370 align:start position:0%
was
um

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:43.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
that was to include
 
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:46.980 align:start position:0%
um that we we thought that this was a
 
00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:48.420 align:start position:0%
good inclusion
 
00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
um from the restrictions from 1449 we
 
00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
wanted that in the house in the house
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
rule as well
 
00:13:56.509 --> 00:13:56.519 align:start position:0%
um in 2019
 
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
that was uh representative Evil's first
 
00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
um study commission you can see all the
 
00:14:05.449 --> 00:14:05.459 align:start position:0%
bullets that are there the work they
 
00:14:07.509 --> 00:14:07.519 align:start position:0%
they did in that and then the subsequent
 
00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:12.180 align:start position:0%
2020 and 2022.
 
00:14:14.329 --> 00:14:14.339 align:start position:0%
um those are the highlights of work that
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
we've done I think last week I didn't
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
bring it down today but I have a
 
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
expandable file about this big with all
 
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
the suggestions even though this lists
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
the highlights
 
00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
we staff and and legislative have worked
 
00:14:26.279 --> 00:14:26.930 align:start position:0%
we staff and and legislative have worked
on

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:14:29.509 --> 00:14:29.519 align:start position:0%
a variety of suggestions to leadership
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
on on how we could do this and um
 
00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:37.980 align:start position:0%
sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't
 
00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:38.870 align:start position:0%
sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't
um

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:41.449 --> 00:14:41.459 align:start position:0%
so we just wanted to this is just the
 
00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
highlights and stuff going into all that
 
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
detail and all the anecdotal situations
 
00:14:47.449 --> 00:14:47.459 align:start position:0%
so you could see the efforts that were
 
00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:49.860 align:start position:0%
put in uh before
 
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
um the next piece which is the past
 
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
committee on committee reports
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
um you can see this is the report of the
 
00:15:00.889 --> 00:15:00.899 align:start position:0%
first one is the 2010 one of
 
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
Representative Harding
 
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
um and this is the work that was done on
 
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:09.060 align:start position:0%
Um this can be also lists everything
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
that they went through and have the the
 
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
actual report is uh only the first
 
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:18.540 align:start position:0%
um 10 pages the appendix's appendices
 
00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
has have all the um
 
00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:22.620 align:start position:0%
committees that were removed or how how
 
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
they moved how they uh tried to get rid
 
00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
of um the ones that they weren't
 
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
that just weren't functioning
 
00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
the next report represents evil it's
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
January 2020.
 
00:15:40.009 --> 00:15:40.019 align:start position:0%
um January 30th 2020 then we have
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
following one November 1 2020 so we have
 
00:15:45.889 --> 00:15:45.899 align:start position:0%
for House Bill 4-1 then her house bill
 
00:15:45.899 --> 00:15:48.410 align:start position:0%
for House Bill 4-1 then her house bill
1245

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:48.420 align:start position:0%
1245
 
00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:49.970 align:start position:0%
1245
um

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:49.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
she she is going to be the best one to
 
00:15:58.850 --> 00:15:58.860 align:start position:0%
walk you through all of this because she
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
knows this off the top of her head and
 
00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned we can also see if Pam
 
00:16:05.329 --> 00:16:05.339 align:start position:0%
could come in and meet with you to walk
 
00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:06.180 align:start position:0%
you through some of this but
 
00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:07.860 align:start position:0%
representative people having to share
 
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
this and and representative is the type
 
00:16:13.009 --> 00:16:13.019 align:start position:0%
of chair who is totally immersed in the
 
00:16:15.769 --> 00:16:15.779 align:start position:0%
process so that's the one in that's in
 
00:16:17.569 --> 00:16:17.579 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet format
 
00:16:17.579 --> 00:16:20.990 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet format
yes

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:24.180 align:start position:0%
well it says current committees and
 
00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
commissions you've got the tab this no
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
this one is the tab is pass committee on
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
committee reports
 
00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
oh got it okay yeah
 
00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:37.740 align:start position:0%
um but I think I think it again she will
 
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
be the best one to walk you through that
 
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
um the current committees and
 
00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:44.810 align:start position:0%
um the current committees and
commissions

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:44.820 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
um that has the listing of
 
00:16:50.329 --> 00:16:50.339 align:start position:0%
joint The Joint legislative statutory
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
that first listing those are all
 
00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
committees that have to exist their
 
00:16:55.560 --> 00:16:56.810 align:start position:0%
committees that have to exist their
legislative

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:56.820 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
um committees and
 
00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:01.380 align:start position:0%
we actually when they looked at 2010
 
00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:02.759 align:start position:0%
they did bring all those committees
 
00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:04.740 align:start position:0%
before them but those are just the
 
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
Committees that exist
 
00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:08.220 align:start position:0%
um so that we can
 
00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
um function and then obviously have
 
00:17:12.169 --> 00:17:12.179 align:start position:0%
capital budget administrative rules
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds but those are considered
 
00:17:19.549 --> 00:17:19.559 align:start position:0%
um joint legislative statutory
 
00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
committees but we also have so if I was
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
to say how many
 
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
current committees there are that's the
 
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
job to go to and just count them all up
 
00:17:32.810 --> 00:17:32.820 align:start position:0%
um no not yet we're going to be adding
 
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
to that Deborah's going to be getting
 
00:17:36.049 --> 00:17:36.059 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheet for all of you that that
 
00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet is going to be a different
 
00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet this one just has the joint
 
00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:40.740 align:start position:0%
legislative ones right now but that
 
00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:42.660 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet will be coming as we
 
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
finalize that that's the one
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
where every office so my office the
 
00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
clerk's office uh my counterpart in the
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
senate senate clerk's office Deborah and
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
the Senate president's office everybody
 
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
had maintained a separate spreadsheet of
 
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
all 200 because we all have different
 
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:01.810 align:start position:0%
all 200 because we all have different
um

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:01.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:04.980 align:start position:0%
needs so what happened was Deborah
 
00:18:09.409 --> 00:18:09.419 align:start position:0%
met with it and they're developing
 
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
um a brand new spreadsheet that we can
 
00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:12.900 align:start position:0%
all have access to and we will all have
 
00:18:15.409 --> 00:18:15.419 align:start position:0%
the exact same information so that is
 
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:16.860 align:start position:0%
what we're working on so that's why that
 
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
this will be coming but in the meantime
 
00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:21.780 align:start position:0%
we will get a spreadsheet
 
00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
um so you will have something to work
 
00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
from but again it's going to help with
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
representative to
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
um put those pieces of the puzzle
 
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
together because there may be some on
 
00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:32.510 align:start position:0%
together because there may be some on
there

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:34.740 align:start position:0%
um that she'll know the reason why
 
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
they're in existence even if they
 
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
haven't met and I think it will be
 
00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
helpful too if we get the questionnaires
 
00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
for you to see how we sent those
 
00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:43.799 align:start position:0%
questionnaires out in the past and
 
00:18:45.770 --> 00:18:45.780 align:start position:0%
she'll be able to explain how that
 
00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:47.940 align:start position:0%
process went
 
00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
um the questionnaires I thought
 
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
were really helpful because they'll
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
explain like
 
00:18:55.549 --> 00:18:55.559 align:start position:0%
how can that you be named to that child
 
00:18:59.150 --> 00:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
care commission hasn't met for 11 years
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
I wonder what they explained to the
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
and so she may be able to to fill you in
 
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:19.850 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:19.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:22.740 align:start position:0%
the the next piece is
 
00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:23.450 align:start position:0%
the the next piece is
um

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:23.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
the study committee process we explain
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
out of the first named it has to
 
00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:36.860 align:start position:0%
organize their committee
 
00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
we have a study Community share
 
00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.810 align:start position:0%
we have a study Community share
responsibilities

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:43.799 align:start position:0%
and then we have this chart that we
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
designed for you called comparison study
 
00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
creation study elements and this has
 
00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:51.900 align:start position:0%
the legislative
 
00:19:54.409 --> 00:19:54.419 align:start position:0%
what the process is you can see it's
 
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
multi-colored we thought we put it in
 
00:19:58.970 --> 00:19:58.980 align:start position:0%
color it would be easy to see and you
 
00:20:00.409 --> 00:20:00.419 align:start position:0%
can see how if you start out with the
 
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
start out with the statutory commission
 
00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
all the steps you have to go through to
 
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
create one a chaptered study is similar
 
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
but um as you can see retained Bill gets
 
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
less interim study and ad hoc
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
has very um very few steps but as we
 
00:20:18.169 --> 00:20:18.179 align:start position:0%
know every one of these entities does
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
conducts a study
 
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:20.940 align:start position:0%
it's just that
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
um the different steps that one has to
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
go through and obviously the
 
00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:26.460 align:start position:0%
the the ones that take the most time are
 
00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
statutory and chapters statutory in
 
00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
particular because of all of the
 
00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:31.799 align:start position:0%
appointments and chapters today because
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
it goes through the whole process house
 
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
senate and then and then it has to be um
 
00:20:39.049 --> 00:20:39.059 align:start position:0%
signed off by the governor
 
00:20:39.059 --> 00:20:40.070 align:start position:0%
signed off by the governor
um

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:41.700 align:start position:0%
the next
 
00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:43.430 align:start position:0%
the next
tab

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
tab
 
00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:46.980 align:start position:0%
are samples and what what we did the
 
00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:48.650 align:start position:0%
are samples and what what we did the
first

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
three letters are the samples of the
 
00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
appointments letters that the speaker
 
00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
makes and that
 
00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:57.660 align:start position:0%
um Deborah
 
00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:01.020 align:start position:0%
has to get the letters together and send
 
00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:02.700 align:start position:0%
the appointments out
 
00:21:06.049 --> 00:21:06.059 align:start position:0%
to um wherever they have to go now as
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
you saw last week Deborah has this
 
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
binder with many people would like a
 
00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
copy of us about that's what this is
 
00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:13.799 align:start position:0%
it's all filled with these letters
 
00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
and we we will get calls we're getting
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
calls now how come I'm still laying for
 
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:21.980 align:start position:0%
appointments for this Commission because
 
00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
besides doing everything else the
 
00:21:25.669 --> 00:21:25.679 align:start position:0%
speaker has to that's always the first
 
00:21:27.169 --> 00:21:27.179 align:start position:0%
shock for the speaker when they arise
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
what do you mean I have to make like 400
 
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
appointments that that's part of the job
 
00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:33.169 align:start position:0%
appointments that that's part of the job
um

00:21:33.169 --> 00:21:33.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:33.179 --> 00:21:34.490 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:21:34.490 --> 00:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
those are samples of the letters that
 
00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:38.050 align:start position:0%
are sent out
 
00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:38.570 align:start position:0%
are sent out
[Music]

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:38.580 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:39.529 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:21:39.529 --> 00:21:39.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
the next one is Paul from the house
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
flirt and
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
um this uh
 
00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
is how Paul notifies our clerk's office
 
00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:53.340 align:start position:0%
notifies the different agencies that
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
they must make an appointment
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
and he wanted to show you what
 
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
um that looks like and so he has to send
 
00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:02.220 align:start position:0%
out to all those entities that are
 
00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:04.490 align:start position:0%
out to all those entities that are
listed

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
listed
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
the next one is from my office
 
00:22:07.919 --> 00:22:09.169 align:start position:0%
the next one is from my office
um

00:22:09.169 --> 00:22:09.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:13.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:16.860 align:start position:0%
1991 we designed this template because
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
before this reports were any which way
 
00:22:21.289 --> 00:22:21.299 align:start position:0%
and what would drive us crazy wouldn't
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
have the year on it wouldn't have the
 
00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
chapter law or the bill number and we we
 
00:22:27.649 --> 00:22:27.659 align:start position:0%
need all that to um
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
to file it or find out that the report
 
00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.070 align:start position:0%
to file it or find out that the report
was

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:22:33.169 --> 00:22:33.179 align:start position:0%
um the community worked so anyway we did
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
this letter of transmittal it was
 
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
actually designed by a former member
 
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
Gary cowanhoven God Rest us all he he
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
did designed this for a big study he had
 
00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:46.980 align:start position:0%
done and we've we've stuck with this
 
00:22:50.149 --> 00:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
ever since then and then the next page
 
00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
um he did a lot of transmissible at
 
00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:53.940 align:start position:0%
transmittal and the researchers we
 
00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
created the um template for the report
 
00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
itself to make sure that the commission
 
00:23:00.649 --> 00:23:00.659 align:start position:0%
charge is in there the study purpose the
 
00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
proposition on the process and
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
procedures so that anybody who goes if
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
you're looking back at a report from 10
 
00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
years ago you can see oh this is how
 
00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
they organize and this is
 
00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:11.990 align:start position:0%
they organize and this is
um

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
how they got to where where they decided
 
00:23:18.049 --> 00:23:18.059 align:start position:0%
for their um
 
00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:19.860 align:start position:0%
in the end if they have proposed
 
00:23:21.529 --> 00:23:21.539 align:start position:0%
legislation or what their final
 
00:23:24.289 --> 00:23:24.299 align:start position:0%
conclusions are it's right there and and
 
00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:26.220 align:start position:0%
it's easy for people to see so we
 
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
thought a similar format for every
 
00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
report would help people
 
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:30.649 align:start position:0%
report would help people
um

00:23:30.649 --> 00:23:30.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
the pictures which you saw last week on
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
the screen our report Library this
 
00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
is is we have a closet in my office and
 
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
uh these hold all the reports and this
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't even include all the reports
 
00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:44.700 align:start position:0%
that step in the Attic of the LOB
 
00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
so often
 
00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.049 align:start position:0%
so often
um

00:23:48.049 --> 00:23:48.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:50.149 --> 00:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
at the conclusion of report we send it
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
out to those other sources or the uh
 
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
where we mentioned that the clerk's the
 
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
speaker the Senate President the
 
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
governor at the State library and then
 
00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
we keep a copy here if we're involved
 
00:24:04.669 --> 00:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
with the study sometimes we're not
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
involved at all even if it's a House
 
00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
member the house member does everything
 
00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:10.140 align:start position:0%
on their own and never even comes to our
 
00:24:12.289 --> 00:24:12.299 align:start position:0%
office to ask her any assistance and
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes we reach out and they'll say
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
nope we're all set
 
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
so that that can occur because there's
 
00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:19.010 align:start position:0%
so that that can occur because there's
no

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:22.740 align:start position:0%
as we've mentioned before these studies
 
00:24:24.409 --> 00:24:24.419 align:start position:0%
are on their own they can they can
 
00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:25.860 align:start position:0%
pretty much do what they want they have
 
00:24:27.649 --> 00:24:27.659 align:start position:0%
to follow the right to know but they
 
00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:28.980 align:start position:0%
don't report to the speaker or the
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
Senate President
 
00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:31.549 align:start position:0%
Senate President
um

00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:31.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
they can if it's a member members
 
00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
usually try to stay involved with us but
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
there are those occasions and especially
 
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
if it's another outside group with the
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
chairman with an outside group
 
00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:42.900 align:start position:0%
um they don't necessarily come back to
 
00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:45.240 align:start position:0%
us for assistance and this came up in
 
00:24:48.289 --> 00:24:48.299 align:start position:0%
our initial discussion uh last week
 
00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
uh what would
 
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:53.940 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't we want to be able to take
 
00:24:55.909 --> 00:24:55.919 align:start position:0%
all the the current
 
00:24:55.919 --> 00:24:57.169 align:start position:0%
all the the current
study

00:24:57.169 --> 00:24:57.179 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:00.780 align:start position:0%
commissions and map them into committee
 
00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:01.850 align:start position:0%
commissions and map them into committee
chairman

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:01.860 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh to say okay you're a committee
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
chairman you're the committee chairman
 
00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:07.820 align:start position:0%
for Edna
 
00:25:11.029 --> 00:25:11.039 align:start position:0%
you've got these 18 study commissions
 
00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:13.860 align:start position:0%
that are alive and well alive maybe
 
00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:16.020 align:start position:0%
they're not well they're alive
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
and it's your job to manage them and we
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
all have to Define what that means by
 
00:25:23.149 --> 00:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
managing them but what would what's
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
wrong with that concept I
 
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
I from a staff perspective I don't see a
 
00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
problem with it at all it's one way to
 
00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:32.090 align:start position:0%
problem with it at all it's one way to
follow

00:25:32.090 --> 00:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
what's going on I think again
 
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
representative evil can explain if they
 
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
want to I do know that representative
 
00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
umberger and represent people they both
 
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
were working together with legislative
 
00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:44.700 align:start position:0%
Administration with a lot of suggestions
 
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
last year and and I represent umberger
 
00:25:49.250 --> 00:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
told me that was one of her plans she
 
00:25:51.529 --> 00:25:51.539 align:start position:0%
was going she want
 
00:25:54.409 --> 00:25:54.419 align:start position:0%
to suggest something like that because
 
00:25:57.049 --> 00:25:57.059 align:start position:0%
for instance one of the issues is take
 
00:25:58.909 --> 00:25:58.919 align:start position:0%
House Education and they have the public
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
higher ed study commission well that's
 
00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:02.820 align:start position:0%
been around forever and they look at
 
00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:05.460 align:start position:0%
obviously public higher ed and then
 
00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
another a member brought in a bill to
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
look at the college the public College
 
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
University system to have a study
 
00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:14.220 align:start position:0%
commission to look at that well you
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
already have one so that would be nice
 
00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:19.980 align:start position:0%
for the chairman of the committee
 
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
to to see that um
 
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
to explain or just in that way my
 
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
thought that that way it wouldn't matter
 
00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:31.740 align:start position:0%
who who had the leadership in the in the
 
00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:32.930 align:start position:0%
who who had the leadership in the in the
house

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:32.940 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:26:35.390 --> 00:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
no matter which side it went to which
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
party you went to that the same
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
pedigree of chairman would still have
 
00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:43.620 align:start position:0%
oversight maybe the chair the name of
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
the chairman would change but say hey
 
00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
you just you're going to be take you're
 
00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:49.940 align:start position:0%
going to be the new chairman of of Edna
 
00:26:54.169 --> 00:26:54.179 align:start position:0%
and hear your 22
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
committees to look after and they and I
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
think as part of that that's me talking
 
00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:01.860 align:start position:0%
not the committee but think of part of
 
00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
that it's that new chairman might go
 
00:27:06.649 --> 00:27:06.659 align:start position:0%
through that and says we don't need all
 
00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
these we need we can get rid of half a
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
dozen of these then then that would
 
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
start with a cleansing process if you
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
will to some degree
 
00:27:19.549 --> 00:27:19.559 align:start position:0%
with change of priority
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
I I think that that's obviously I'm up
 
00:27:24.289 --> 00:27:24.299 align:start position:0%
for the committee to to look at but
 
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
that's something I know when I stopped
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
how said a long time ago I used to
 
00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
prepare a list on my own for the chairs
 
00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:32.700 align:start position:0%
every time a new chair came in and said
 
00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
oh by the way these 10
 
00:27:39.289 --> 00:27:39.299 align:start position:0%
statutories all fall under you
 
00:27:42.409 --> 00:27:42.419 align:start position:0%
and and then even know that um but then
 
00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
you change you change chairs I know
 
00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
representative Vlad is on top of it but
 
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
you could get a new chair in-house said
 
00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
who it's like what do you mean actually
 
00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
we did one year in my game was I said I
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
have no idea they have 10 other
 
00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
committees that I have to pay attention
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
to so
 
00:27:58.730 --> 00:27:58.740 align:start position:0%
um that is a good way to to follow it
 
00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
but sometimes there are those
 
00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
commissions that don't connect to I
 
00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:04.020 align:start position:0%
would imagine if we did something like
 
00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:05.940 align:start position:0%
that it would be some orphans
 
00:28:08.029 --> 00:28:08.039 align:start position:0%
that nobody wants to claim to that's not
 
00:28:10.130 --> 00:28:10.140 align:start position:0%
I don't want that that's not then those
 
00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:11.090 align:start position:0%
I don't want that that's not then those
become

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
become
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
I would think
 
00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
Prime candidates to get rid of if nobody
 
00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
wants them no nobody wants to claim them
 
00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:19.620 align:start position:0%
then we then we'd have to look for
 
00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:21.900 align:start position:0%
sponsors to say hey this is a good idea
 
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:23.220 align:start position:0%
this committee really needs to be
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
retained or kept in in uh
 
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
in existence and then make sure it gets
 
00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:32.700 align:start position:0%
assigned to a committee chair that
 
00:28:36.769 --> 00:28:36.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
I really appreciate this conversation
 
00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:43.020 align:start position:0%
because I think it is unclear which I
 
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
think you know which which of these uh
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
committees both you know go to each of
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:56.220 align:start position:0%
I wonder if there can be
 
00:28:57.649 --> 00:28:57.659 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
00:29:00.409 --> 00:29:00.419 align:start position:0%
you know committee chairs claiming them
 
00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
I wonder if we need to go through the
 
00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:04.620 align:start position:0%
process of formally assigning and saying
 
00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
these fit under you know each of the
 
00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:08.940 align:start position:0%
each of the statuary committees or
 
00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:10.740 align:start position:0%
making some decisions because there may
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
be some where there's an intersection
 
00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
between Health and Human Services and
 
00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:16.140 align:start position:0%
education for example
 
00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:17.090 align:start position:0%
education for example
um

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
I also just cognizant of how much work
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
that is for in this case German lad
 
00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%
right like 10 of these different
 
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
committees wonder if there's a role for
 
00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
the clerk on the committee to to play in
 
00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
that or you know I think there's some
 
00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
different ways we could design it but
 
00:29:36.649 --> 00:29:36.659 align:start position:0%
um wouldn't want to leave it up to the
 
00:29:39.049 --> 00:29:39.059 align:start position:0%
committee chairs to decide because
 
00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:41.700 align:start position:0%
ultimately you know they're inheriting
 
00:29:43.490 --> 00:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
those they're kind of being stewards of
 
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
that work for the to your term and
 
00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:48.230 align:start position:0%
that work for the to your term and
um

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
I think I think there needs to and who
 
00:29:51.889 --> 00:29:51.899 align:start position:0%
knows maybe it could be an ongoing
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
committee like this that is you know
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
continuing to kind of do the maintenance
 
00:29:59.389 --> 00:29:59.399 align:start position:0%
and uh just making sure that
 
00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
um expectations are clear and I know
 
00:30:06.289 --> 00:30:06.299 align:start position:0%
from observing uh how
 
00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
Carol Maguire does the manages her
 
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
committee she has I think four different
 
00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.549 align:start position:0%
committee she has I think four different
subcommittees

00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:13.559 align:start position:0%
subcommittees
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
then when a particular issue it's
 
00:30:17.990 --> 00:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
difficult comes up
 
00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:20.220 align:start position:0%
he assigned it to a subcommittee to to
 
00:30:22.669 --> 00:30:22.679 align:start position:0%
go work it and then bring back a
 
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
solution to the full committee as
 
00:30:27.529 --> 00:30:27.539 align:start position:0%
opposed to trying to do it all or itself
 
00:30:30.769 --> 00:30:30.779 align:start position:0%
uh which seems to be a model that could
 
00:30:32.049 --> 00:30:32.059 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
right I was
 
00:30:39.230 --> 00:30:39.240 align:start position:0%
for us I'm sorry and you did you have
 
00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:40.860 align:start position:0%
more that you wanted to yeah I was just
 
00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:41.940 align:start position:0%
good I was just going to take you
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
through the rest of the binder and then
 
00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:46.860 align:start position:0%
please do it I just um I um
 
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
so the the next page is
 
00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
this uh was our so we have that web page
 
00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:55.559 align:start position:0%
which I was showing representative Dolan
 
00:30:57.889 --> 00:30:57.899 align:start position:0%
Ripley was she and before the um
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
before we started if you go on the
 
00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
general court webpage and you go all the
 
00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
way to the bottom there's a ribbon
 
00:31:06.649 --> 00:31:06.659 align:start position:0%
um and it's under helpful links it'll
 
00:31:06.659 --> 00:31:07.370 align:start position:0%
um and it's under helpful links it'll
say

00:31:07.370 --> 00:31:07.380 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
statutory slash study committee so
 
00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:11.640 align:start position:0%
that's what it says Brad
 
00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
I think statutory whatever it says it's
 
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
the second one down and anyway once you
 
00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
link onto that
 
00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:19.620 align:start position:0%
um it will it will
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
you plug in a keyword and it'll bring up
 
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
without a study you're looking for and
 
00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
we also have archive studies in there
 
00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
but the next there's another link
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
we don't do this for every committee we
 
00:31:33.649 --> 00:31:33.659 align:start position:0%
do it if they request it some committees
 
00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
wish to have their own committee web
 
00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
page beyond that and so we've designed
 
00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
that in this first page that I'm showing
 
00:31:42.289 --> 00:31:42.299 align:start position:0%
you the New Hampshire citizens trade
 
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
policy commission this is just a sample
 
00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:47.700 align:start position:0%
this was the old web page and this was
 
00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:49.260 align:start position:0%
designed by
 
00:31:51.649 --> 00:31:51.659 align:start position:0%
um Patrick Murphy and the senate in
 
00:31:54.529 --> 00:31:54.539 align:start position:0%
Senate research and we all love this so
 
00:31:58.010 --> 00:31:58.020 align:start position:0%
much our the house took on this style as
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
well so how staff because the way it was
 
00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:01.860 align:start position:0%
laid out it's very easy to find
 
00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
legislation calendar notices agendas
 
00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
minutes membership and that was our our
 
00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:09.470 align:start position:0%
minutes membership and that was our our
style

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:09.480 align:start position:0%
style
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
um and so for instance Exotic Aquatic
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
weeds which has now been around for 25
 
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
plus years that was the layout that we
 
00:32:20.149 --> 00:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
use so former representative Suzanne
 
00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:22.140 align:start position:0%
Smith will send her information to our
 
00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
office from that study commission then
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
we send it over to it and they wouldn't
 
00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:28.260 align:start position:0%
plug it in when we had the new revamp of
 
00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
our general court webpage page because
 
00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
of how they pulled everything in
 
00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
the new style is the second page where
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
it says joint Community dedicated funds
 
00:32:39.529 --> 00:32:39.539 align:start position:0%
as you can see it's just
 
00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
a listing of
 
00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
everything you can find the individual
 
00:32:46.690 --> 00:32:46.700 align:start position:0%
reports we want to
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
re we as staff want to go back to the
 
00:32:50.930 --> 00:32:50.940 align:start position:0%
old design we're going to work with them
 
00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
because we just think it's easier to
 
00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:53.330 align:start position:0%
because we just think it's easier to
read

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
read
 
00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
but we thought we wanted to show you the
 
00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:57.230 align:start position:0%
but we thought we wanted to show you the
previous

00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
previous
 
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
um document and the previous web page in
 
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
the current one which um
 
00:33:04.909 --> 00:33:04.919 align:start position:0%
just has a list of all the information
 
00:33:06.769 --> 00:33:06.779 align:start position:0%
we like to have as much electronic
 
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
information up there as possible so that
 
00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:11.100 align:start position:0%
members of the public can access or
 
00:33:12.889 --> 00:33:12.899 align:start position:0%
members can access whatever they need
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
but we're working on that as well so we
 
00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:17.460 align:start position:0%
want to redesign it and get it back to
 
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
the old
 
00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
um Style
 
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:22.860 align:start position:0%
and then the final item is the glossary
 
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
of terms as we were as you you heard us
 
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:28.140 align:start position:0%
we throw on all these terms
 
00:33:30.970 --> 00:33:30.980 align:start position:0%
um like what chapter studies statutory
 
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
non-regulatory so what we decided to do
 
00:33:35.389 --> 00:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
was put together a glossary of terms for
 
00:33:35.399 --> 00:33:36.350 align:start position:0%
was put together a glossary of terms for
you

00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:36.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:37.549 align:start position:0%
you
so

00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:37.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:37.559 --> 00:33:38.450 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
and you can read because someone has
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
said wouldn't it be nice if we had a
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
list of all the terms that are used in
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
this process and it was a member who who
 
00:33:48.889 --> 00:33:48.899 align:start position:0%
inquired about that and that's when we
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
said wait a minute we already did this
 
00:33:51.409 --> 00:33:51.419 align:start position:0%
and that's how Deborah and I thought you
 
00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:52.860 align:start position:0%
know what maybe we ought to walk
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
everybody through the binder so they'll
 
00:33:57.529 --> 00:33:57.539 align:start position:0%
know what's in there so you can see that
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
just lists the terms and the then we
 
00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:02.340 align:start position:0%
broke it down into groupings of the
 
00:34:03.769 --> 00:34:03.779 align:start position:0%
different offices are involved in the
 
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
process the relevant statutes the study
 
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
committee types
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
um and we did bullets we couldn't just
 
00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
do we tried to do one sentence
 
00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
descriptions then we realized no we have
 
00:34:17.089 --> 00:34:17.099 align:start position:0%
to have bullets under each item to
 
00:34:17.099 --> 00:34:18.470 align:start position:0%
to have bullets under each item to
explain

00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
explain
 
00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.369 align:start position:0%
explain
um

00:34:19.369 --> 00:34:19.379 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
uh exactly in Greater detail what each
 
00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:24.409 align:start position:0%
uh exactly in Greater detail what each
um

00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:24.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
term refers to
 
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
so so that that was it um regarding
 
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
the binder and then we did some
 
00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:34.010 align:start position:0%
the binder and then we did some
um

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
updates I was going to ask um Brad and
 
00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:39.419 align:start position:0%
Jamie if they could pass this out
 
00:34:39.419 --> 00:34:40.250 align:start position:0%
Jamie if they could pass this out
um

00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
this one is the number of
 
00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:45.419 align:start position:0%
um active studies we did a an exercise
 
00:34:48.829 --> 00:34:48.839 align:start position:0%
from 0-1 to 2022.
 
00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
and we did a chart Brad had put this
 
00:34:53.450 --> 00:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
together were you PM smarling did the
 
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
initial one and then Brad updated it and
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
then this is the current amount we have
 
00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.690 align:start position:0%
then this is the current amount we have
27

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:02.700 align:start position:0%
27
 
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
um these are Commissions in existence
 
00:35:06.650 --> 00:35:06.660 align:start position:0%
right now we have this one broken down
 
00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
by um thanks Jamie and it's broken down
 
00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:11.460 align:start position:0%
by committee for you Brad put that
 
00:35:12.829 --> 00:35:12.839 align:start position:0%
together as well
 
00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:15.180 align:start position:0%
for you so you can see
 
00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:18.060 align:start position:0%
what the numbers are right now what the
 
00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.130 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:22.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:24.540 align:start position:0%
again is uh
 
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
I'm a disposition standpoint it might be
 
00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:31.020 align:start position:0%
a question for Paul Smith and is the
 
00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:33.180 align:start position:0%
let's say that we want to get rid of a
 
00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
study convention
 
00:35:37.849 --> 00:35:37.859 align:start position:0%
that one that the the Vanessa was
 
00:35:39.290 --> 00:35:39.300 align:start position:0%
talking about earlier that hadn't met
 
00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
since 2011. let me see that one's we're
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
going to get rid of it and we all agree
 
00:35:45.589 --> 00:35:45.599 align:start position:0%
that's what we're going to do what is
 
00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
the the right is the right way to do it
 
00:35:49.609 --> 00:35:49.619 align:start position:0%
is to repeal it through your legislation
 
00:35:52.730 --> 00:35:52.740 align:start position:0%
yes so you have to repeal it we'd have
 
00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
to bring forth a bill a new bill that
 
00:35:57.530 --> 00:35:57.540 align:start position:0%
says we go to OLS and say we want to
 
00:35:58.970 --> 00:35:58.980 align:start position:0%
repeal this and they'd come up with the
 
00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:00.069 align:start position:0%
repeal this and they'd come up with the
language

00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:00.079 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
so when I was telling you about the
 
00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
former majority leaders who had done
 
00:36:05.390 --> 00:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
that that's what they did they just put
 
00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
in they they created legislation we can
 
00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
get copies of from years ago that listed
 
00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:11.940 align:start position:0%
them but also representative Harding's
 
00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:15.060 align:start position:0%
commission and representative evil they
 
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:22.380 align:start position:0%
we talked about Senator Sherman had a
 
00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:24.050 align:start position:0%
we talked about Senator Sherman had a
pfas

00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:24.060 align:start position:0%
pfas
 
00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
study going on that hasn't met in a long
 
00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:29.940 align:start position:0%
long time but he probably doesn't he I
 
00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:32.220 align:start position:0%
would imagine he probably doesn't want
 
00:36:35.329 --> 00:36:35.339 align:start position:0%
to be associated with killing the pfas
 
00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:38.339 align:start position:0%
study that his maybe on some of his
 
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:40.200 align:start position:0%
constituents really want to see happen
 
00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.710 align:start position:0%
constituents really want to see happen
but

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:41.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:44.220 align:start position:0%
nothing's happening on it so let's say
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
let's play this out the house we put
 
00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
some legislation in that kills it
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
can't the Senate
 
00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:55.980 align:start position:0%
just refuse to accept that and was it to
 
00:36:59.089 --> 00:36:59.099 align:start position:0%
stay alive yes so that's the potential
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
issue we have with with uh repealing
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
legislation is the Senate doesn't agree
 
00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:07.740 align:start position:0%
then it just stays indefinitely Or until
 
00:37:09.650 --> 00:37:09.660 align:start position:0%
some other action is taken
 
00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:11.630 align:start position:0%
some other action is taken
yes

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
that's that is that has happened uh
 
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:17.640 align:start position:0%
before or as I said that the legislation
 
00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
comes in they'll say notwithstanding
 
00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:21.170 align:start position:0%
comes in they'll say notwithstanding
um

00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:21.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:24.349 --> 00:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
whatever we've we've generous I said the
 
00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:26.460 align:start position:0%
said I know the senator and I I loved
 
00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:27.900 align:start position:0%
her to death the one who changed the
 
00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
November one she'd been in the house she
 
00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
met she got
 
00:37:33.050 --> 00:37:33.060 align:start position:0%
then she was Senate she left Senate came
 
00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:34.740 align:start position:0%
back and she was the one who said what's
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
November one
 
00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:38.460 align:start position:0%
deadline I don't like this I'm changing
 
00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:40.140 align:start position:0%
December one and then once she did that
 
00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
then another Senator did and and the
 
00:37:44.569 --> 00:37:44.579 align:start position:0%
problem is with the December 1 deadline
 
00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.200 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:48.660 align:start position:0%
um we have a new we have the election we
 
00:37:50.329 --> 00:37:50.339 align:start position:0%
always like the November one because it
 
00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
was a firm date was before the election
 
00:37:55.069 --> 00:37:55.079 align:start position:0%
but if it's it's the problem
 
00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
when you um go into the next biennium
 
00:37:59.150 --> 00:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
and you have
 
00:38:01.010 --> 00:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
um to replace those members and that has
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
happened all of a sudden we have a
 
00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:06.060 align:start position:0%
deadline date that that goes beyond
 
00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:06.710 align:start position:0%
deadline date that that goes beyond
um

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
you're swearing in deadline and then
 
00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
also we have all new members we have to
 
00:38:11.690 --> 00:38:11.700 align:start position:0%
wait for the speaker to reappoint and
 
00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:13.140 align:start position:0%
we'll they say well no we're getting
 
00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
ready to have our final report of
 
00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
December 15th it's like well there are
 
00:38:18.349 --> 00:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
no members those numbers are no longer
 
00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:21.300 align:start position:0%
that must become doubly difficult when
 
00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:24.180 align:start position:0%
if you get a new speaker yes
 
00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:26.040 align:start position:0%
because you have people knocking at his
 
00:38:30.109 --> 00:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
or her door saying we're we're um
 
00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:32.700 align:start position:0%
where where the we need this right away
 
00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
but every everything needs to be
 
00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:37.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:39.780 align:start position:0%
anyone else have any questions for Ryan
 
00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:41.300 align:start position:0%
watches it yeah
 
00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
I don't have a question I just want to
 
00:38:47.329 --> 00:38:47.339 align:start position:0%
comment on how much I appreciate the the
 
00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
thoroughness and this is the perfect
 
00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
balance of
 
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
information because I know you know we
 
00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
could probably fill multiple binders
 
00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:38:58.970 --> 00:38:58.980 align:start position:0%
but as somebody just walking into this
 
00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:01.020 align:start position:0%
relatively blind I feel like you've
 
00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
given us exactly what we need to to hit
 
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
the ground running so thank you so much
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
for doing such a phenomenal job thank
 
00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:08.940 align:start position:0%
you to you and your staff thank you
 
00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and I want to say
 
00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for all you're doing
 
00:39:15.890 --> 00:39:15.900 align:start position:0%
you press to stop this you saw the staff
 
00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:18.780 align:start position:0%
last week and we are we're very happy
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
and excited about all the work you're
 
00:39:21.650 --> 00:39:21.660 align:start position:0%
going to be doing
 
00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:23.569 align:start position:0%
going to be doing
huh

00:39:23.569 --> 00:39:23.579 align:start position:0%
huh
 
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you Mr chairman
 
00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:27.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for everything thank
 
00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:30.180 align:start position:0%
the staff also I'm still trying to
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
figure out if there's a commission that
 
00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:34.440 align:start position:0%
exists currently that hasn't been
 
00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:36.660 align:start position:0%
terribly active that's been on the verge
 
00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:39.180 align:start position:0%
of repeal from what I read this week in
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
over and over again
 
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
and if we decide this commission should
 
00:39:47.569 --> 00:39:47.579 align:start position:0%
be repealed but the people really want
 
00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:50.220 align:start position:0%
to exist under some thing
 
00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
do you have any concept of how we can
 
00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:55.980 align:start position:0%
help guide a group if we don't want them
 
00:39:58.849 --> 00:39:58.859 align:start position:0%
to be a commission under law I'll tell
 
00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
you what I'm talking about and they're
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
very upset about it there's been a lot
 
00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
in the newspapers about the New
 
00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Commission on Native American
 
00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:06.530 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Commission on Native American
Affairs

00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
Affairs
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
and they do do an annual report but they
 
00:40:13.130 --> 00:40:13.140 align:start position:0%
haven't been awfully active they're
 
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:16.020 align:start position:0%
scared to death that if the repeal
 
00:40:17.569 --> 00:40:17.579 align:start position:0%
that's been threatened several times
 
00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
actually occurs what will they do do we
 
00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:24.020 align:start position:0%
have any sense of direction to help them
 
00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:26.820 align:start position:0%
be organized and do what they feel they
 
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
want to do without having them be a
 
00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:31.140 align:start position:0%
commission well
 
00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:32.510 align:start position:0%
commission well
so

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:34.740 align:start position:0%
um again I would refer to representative
 
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
Ebel because of what because they they
 
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
have the groups come before them explain
 
00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
why they need to exist
 
00:40:43.970 --> 00:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that we did
 
00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:46.740 align:start position:0%
recognize and it's something I think
 
00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:48.900 align:start position:0%
maybe you could put on your list of
 
00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
items to consider
 
00:40:52.370 --> 00:40:52.380 align:start position:0%
is that as I mentioned representative
 
00:40:54.109 --> 00:40:54.119 align:start position:0%
Gary cowanhoven who had done that first
 
00:40:57.829 --> 00:40:57.839 align:start position:0%
study it was on um you hear you knew you
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
knew Gary Right Gary Cowan open
 
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
um it was on EMTs because he was an EMT
 
00:41:06.349 --> 00:41:06.359 align:start position:0%
and an emergency services
 
00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:08.820 align:start position:0%
anyway so we'd start out as a
 
00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:11.460 align:start position:0%
legislative study and
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
um they did a wonderful report they had
 
00:41:16.250 --> 00:41:16.260 align:start position:0%
all these um ideas but they didn't
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
create legislation from it what they did
 
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
was they created
 
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
um HHS created their own entity and and
 
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
legislators weren't on that anymore and
 
00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:28.980 align:start position:0%
that became part of the um agency's
 
00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:30.410 align:start position:0%
that became part of the um agency's
Endeavor

00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
Endeavor
 
00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
um and that's sometimes what people do
 
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't necessarily have to be there
 
00:41:36.530 --> 00:41:36.540 align:start position:0%
may be a legislator involved initially
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
but once the work gets going and they
 
00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
don't really need legislative oversight
 
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
they can create their own entity within
 
00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
their department or agency
 
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:49.140 align:start position:0%
and then we had another one a few years
 
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
ago that was just all Commissioners they
 
00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
had been meeting as an informal group
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
and decided that they wanted to
 
00:41:59.329 --> 00:41:59.339 align:start position:0%
formalize as a group which they did and
 
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
we didn't have a legislative appointment
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
to that and they just exist
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
on their own somewhere
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much I just wondered
 
00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:09.180 align:start position:0%
if there was precedent for something
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
like this how a group or an entity can
 
00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
become something other than a commission
 
00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:19.079 align:start position:0%
so thank you you're welcome
 
00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
um so any any questions Jennifer and um
 
00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
Gen 4 and Brad will be here at the
 
00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:27.660 align:start position:0%
meetings and anything you need from any
 
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
of the staff any question on anything we
 
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
will come running just like that any
 
00:42:36.589 --> 00:42:36.599 align:start position:0%
assistance we can give you you will give
 
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
to us
 
00:42:40.849 --> 00:42:40.859 align:start position:0%
so thank you so much and thank you for
 
00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:42.660 align:start position:0%
um the opportunity to get you to talk

with you about this all again and
 
00:42:46.609 --> 00:42:46.619 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we're going to run into a
 
00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
number of questions that we're going to
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
be stumped yeah
 
00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:53.220 align:start position:0%
thank you and also stop up um never
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
hesitate to stop up on the fourth floor
 
00:42:58.609 --> 00:42:58.619 align:start position:0%
um just stop and see us and and we can
 
00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:01.140 align:start position:0%
help you with any any questions you have
 
00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:11.220 align:start position:0%
we left last week's meeting with within
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
at least the initial thought
 
00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
that perhaps we would ask
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
ourselves to think of splitting up into
 
00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:24.440 align:start position:0%
groups and trying to take this in pieces
 
00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:26.460 align:start position:0%
one group
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
I thought makes sense is a process group
 
00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:33.900 align:start position:0%
what is the process and we have a good
 
00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:36.900 align:start position:0%
notebook to help uh guide us with that
 
00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:37.609 align:start position:0%
notebook to help uh guide us with that
but

00:43:37.609 --> 00:43:37.619 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
but also that would serve as a
 
00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
as a primer for
 
00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:46.980 align:start position:0%
new legislatures legislative doors uh
 
00:43:49.069 --> 00:43:49.079 align:start position:0%
new freshmen that that come in to try to
 
00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
figure out
 
00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
the lay of the land and so forth and
 
00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
what's going on and that would help
 
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
serve that purpose as well but a process
 
00:43:58.250 --> 00:43:58.260 align:start position:0%
group is to
 
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh what do we do with a with a
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
commission that
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
Vanessa was was before the meeting
 
00:44:08.809 --> 00:44:08.819 align:start position:0%
started had an example that hadn't met
 
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
since 0-1 I think
 
00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.170 align:start position:0%
since 0-1 I think
um

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:14.450 --> 00:44:14.460 align:start position:0%
and we already know that one of the
 
00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:15.829 align:start position:0%
and we already know that one of the
excuses

00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:15.839 align:start position:0%
excuses
 
00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:19.260 align:start position:0%
I I use that term loosely is that well
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
it was covet
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
well this we haven't had covert around
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
since 2001 so it must be something other
 
00:44:30.829 --> 00:44:30.839 align:start position:0%
than covid that's caused that group to
 
00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
stop meeting and so what do we do what's
 
00:44:37.069 --> 00:44:37.079 align:start position:0%
the first step once when something we
 
00:44:39.770 --> 00:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
recognize a problem
 
00:44:44.030 --> 00:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh of non-meeting what happens next and
 
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
that then we would I think look to the
 
00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:49.020 align:start position:0%
this process subcommittee to say okay
 
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
the first thing to do is
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
bring the
 
00:44:57.290 --> 00:44:57.300 align:start position:0%
chairman in and question the chair and
 
00:44:59.390 --> 00:44:59.400 align:start position:0%
find out you know is it what's really
 
00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:01.140 align:start position:0%
the problem here or is there a problem
 
00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
or the chair might come in and say I
 
00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:06.060 align:start position:0%
don't think we need this anymore or we
 
00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
really do need it but we can't get
 
00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
anybody to show up whatever the issue is
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
we investigate that and then as a
 
00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:15.300 align:start position:0%
committee we make it a decision that's
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
what the disposition of that committee
 
00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:19.980 align:start position:0%
uh that committee ought to be and then
 
00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:22.740 align:start position:0%
we've we have to understand the reality
 
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
that we've got to get that through
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh the house leadership to agree that
 
00:45:32.089 --> 00:45:32.099 align:start position:0%
whatever action we're going to take is
 
00:45:36.589 --> 00:45:36.599 align:start position:0%
the the right action and we have to also
 
00:45:39.470 --> 00:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
live in the real world that we have a we
 
00:45:41.089 --> 00:45:41.099 align:start position:0%
have another organization called the
 
00:45:43.609 --> 00:45:43.619 align:start position:0%
Senate and we need to probably if we're
 
00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
going to take some action we need to
 
00:45:45.300 --> 00:45:46.190 align:start position:0%
going to take some action we need to
probably

00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:45:48.349 --> 00:45:48.359 align:start position:0%
consult with somebody over on that side
 
00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:50.700 align:start position:0%
of the of the wall to say hey this is
 
00:45:52.609 --> 00:45:52.619 align:start position:0%
coming are you guys going to fight it
 
00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
are you going to embrace it because if
 
00:45:56.329 --> 00:45:56.339 align:start position:0%
they're going to fight it it's it's
 
00:45:58.130 --> 00:45:58.140 align:start position:0%
going to be a dead end street because
 
00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
they can just kill it and then we don't
 
00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
make any progress unless we want to just
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
make a state
 
00:46:06.650 --> 00:46:06.660 align:start position:0%
which I I think is kind of a waste of
 
00:46:08.809 --> 00:46:08.819 align:start position:0%
time but you know that that'll be up to
 
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
us as a group so
 
00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
if we split into
 
00:46:15.410 --> 00:46:15.420 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking three groups
 
00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:18.300 align:start position:0%
one group for process
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
another another two groups to say hey uh
 
00:46:21.839 --> 00:46:23.510 align:start position:0%
another another two groups to say hey uh
this

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:26.220 align:start position:0%
you take these 10 commissions or you
 
00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:28.740 align:start position:0%
take these 20 commissions and go through
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
them the way Karen did uh and the last
 
00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
time she had the had the uh the Baton
 
00:46:38.030 --> 00:46:38.040 align:start position:0%
and come back to this group and make
 
00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:39.540 align:start position:0%
some recommendations to keep the
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
commission disband it or investigate it
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
or let's
 
00:46:49.069 --> 00:46:49.079 align:start position:0%
these 10 commissions we think that three
 
00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:51.540 align:start position:0%
need to be killed seven need to be
 
00:46:53.089 --> 00:46:53.099 align:start position:0%
investigated and we're gonna schedule
 
00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:55.380 align:start position:0%
those seven to come before us and
 
00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
testify as to as to what their status is
 
00:47:00.530 --> 00:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
and why they want to continue or not
 
00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:01.430 align:start position:0%
and why they want to continue or not
continue

00:47:01.430 --> 00:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
uh so I I lay that out to you all as a
 
00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
as a as a loose process if you will uh
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
to get get to get started into and start
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
digging into the meat of of the tasks we
 
00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:17.220 align:start position:0%
had before us does anybody have any
 
00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
thoughts or any comments about that
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
everybody was in a wall so thank you Mr
 
00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
chairman um a lot of this overlaps
 
00:47:26.809 --> 00:47:26.819 align:start position:0%
some of what you mentioned in the
 
00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:29.460 align:start position:0%
process also has to do with dissolution
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
of some of these or repeals of some of
 
00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:33.900 align:start position:0%
these commissions I almost think where
 
00:47:36.290 --> 00:47:36.300 align:start position:0%
it's not an awfully large group that we
 
00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:37.490 align:start position:0%
it's not an awfully large group that we
have

00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
that we almost ought to work together
 
00:47:41.089 --> 00:47:41.099 align:start position:0%
because some of this will overlap I'm
 
00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
thinking again as I went through it this
 
00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:44.870 align:start position:0%
thinking again as I went through it this
weekend

00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
weekend
 
00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:46.980 align:start position:0%
I saw different commissions come up over
 
00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:49.140 align:start position:0%
and over again possible repeal or not
 
00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:55.380 align:start position:0%
we I'm just thinking if we work on
 
00:47:58.490 --> 00:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
process for example and have a separate
 
00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
group work on that in the group working
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
whether or not that something ought to
 
00:48:05.210 --> 00:48:05.220 align:start position:0%
be repealed
 
00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
the group work in something possible
 
00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:13.740 align:start position:0%
or possible repeal may very well
 
00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
have a totally different opinion from us
 
00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:19.980 align:start position:0%
or US whoever we would be working on the
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
process wouldn't it make sense for us
 
00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
all to work together
 
00:48:25.970 --> 00:48:25.980 align:start position:0%
well you
 
00:48:29.210 --> 00:48:29.220 align:start position:0%
I I do get your point what I'm concerned
 
00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
about is
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
we've been asked by uh
 
00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
house leadership to come forth
 
00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:38.700 align:start position:0%
by the end of the year with some pretty
 
00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:40.740 align:start position:0%
strong recommendations and I'm looking
 
00:48:43.849 --> 00:48:43.859 align:start position:0%
at the calendar and we've got
 
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
basically I'm a month and a half before
 
00:48:49.390 --> 00:48:49.400 align:start position:0%
we take a break
 
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
I guess uh middle middle to the end of
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
June is when we're going to shut shut
 
00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:56.460 align:start position:0%
things down
 
00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:57.650 align:start position:0%
things down
um

00:48:57.650 --> 00:48:57.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:59.450 --> 00:48:59.460 align:start position:0%
and we can stock back up again as early
 
00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:01.500 align:start position:0%
as we want but I'm just thinking we're
 
00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
going to run out of time before we have
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
anything really meaty that we can we can
 
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
put on the table yes
 
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I was wondering
 
00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
representative wall if if we flipped it
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
if we started by going through
 
00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
what exists and what our thoughts might
 
00:49:18.410 --> 00:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
be initially in terms of repeal or
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
whether that means starting with
 
00:49:22.609 --> 00:49:22.619 align:start position:0%
categorizing by statutory committee like
 
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
touched on
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
and then then after that come up with
 
00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
the process for the actual repeal
 
00:49:31.309 --> 00:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
because we'll have a better sense of
 
00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:33.300 align:start position:0%
if they're themes of the kinds of of
 
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
committees that we're looking to repeal
 
00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:37.569 align:start position:0%
committees that we're looking to repeal
um

00:49:37.569 --> 00:49:37.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:39.890 --> 00:49:39.900 align:start position:0%
you know what I was thinking working
 
00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
together as a whole to begin with and
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
then when we see we might need to break
 
00:49:46.609 --> 00:49:46.619 align:start position:0%
to figure out a problem divide into
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
groups of that point to more efficiently
 
00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
and effectively get something done it
 
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
was a little frustrated as I read this
 
00:49:57.230 --> 00:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
and I saw recommendations made for
 
00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
how commissions should be developed and
 
00:50:02.930 --> 00:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
put into law and what the details should
 
00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
be and I I was disappointed to see that
 
00:50:08.089 --> 00:50:08.099 align:start position:0%
over and over recommendations have been
 
00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:10.380 align:start position:0%
made but that haven't been followed
 
00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
and that fits into the process aspect of
 
00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:16.980 align:start position:0%
this into what I said last week about
 
00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
the need for continuing education the
 
00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
need for chairman and vice chairman and
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
clerks to be involved from the very
 
00:50:26.569 --> 00:50:26.579 align:start position:0%
beginning knowing what responsibilities
 
00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:29.880 align:start position:0%
they have as well as for orientation but
 
00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:32.220 align:start position:0%
then we have that whole gap of members
 
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:34.140 align:start position:0%
who have been here for a while
 
00:50:36.589 --> 00:50:36.599 align:start position:0%
who either haven't ever had experience
 
00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:38.940 align:start position:0%
for one reason or another
 
00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:40.740 align:start position:0%
um either helping to form a commission
 
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:42.780 align:start position:0%
or serving on one and what do we do
 
00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:43.980 align:start position:0%
about them
 
00:50:46.849 --> 00:50:46.859 align:start position:0%
right I'm thinking uh thank you for that
 
00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:48.300 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking
 
00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
accountability is a key issue that and
 
00:50:54.349 --> 00:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
that's why I was talking about mapping
 
00:50:56.530 --> 00:50:56.540 align:start position:0%
to committee chair
 
00:50:59.690 --> 00:50:59.700 align:start position:0%
that somebody needs to be held account I
 
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
I don't it's I think unacceptable to say
 
00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:04.500 align:start position:0%
that we've heard the stories that's an
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
important thing but don't appoint me to
 
00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
it that's a lack of accountability and
 
00:51:12.109 --> 00:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
that if if a committee chairman
 
00:51:14.089 --> 00:51:14.099 align:start position:0%
really thinks this this is an important
 
00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:16.740 align:start position:0%
thing to do and he has to be held or she
 
00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:18.300 align:start position:0%
has to be held accountable
 
00:51:19.970 --> 00:51:19.980 align:start position:0%
to the rest of us
 
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
as legislators that uh
 
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
I'm going to manage this I'm going to
 
00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:25.559 align:start position:0%
oversee it or I'm going to make sure
 
00:51:30.109 --> 00:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
people attend and this lack of
 
00:51:32.089 --> 00:51:32.099 align:start position:0%
accountability I think is is one of the
 
00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:34.500 align:start position:0%
root causes of the problem that we're
 
00:51:36.770 --> 00:51:36.780 align:start position:0%
facing and that that's why I thought
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
that was an important thing it's part of
 
00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:43.260 align:start position:0%
our process to look at that that mapping
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
is probably an early step
 
00:51:49.849 --> 00:51:49.859 align:start position:0%
and then once we do that if if we were
 
00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:51.839 align:start position:0%
to do that I'm sure there's going to be
 
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
some orphans that are going to drop out
 
00:51:57.049 --> 00:51:57.059 align:start position:0%
that that don't map into any
 
00:51:59.930 --> 00:51:59.940 align:start position:0%
don't clearly map into any chairman or
 
00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:02.460 align:start position:0%
maybe map into two or three because
 
00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:04.380 align:start position:0%
because of the
 
00:52:06.650 --> 00:52:06.660 align:start position:0%
the nature of the subject matter then
 
00:52:08.750 --> 00:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
we've got to pick one say all right this
 
00:52:11.329 --> 00:52:11.339 align:start position:0%
goes to three different chairmen but
 
00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:13.740 align:start position:0%
you're going to be the lead on this and
 
00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:16.140 align:start position:0%
we'll have to get somebody probably more
 
00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
important than us to decide that that's
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
how it's going to be but but that would
 
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
be our recommendation and then if things
 
00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:24.920 align:start position:0%
don't happen
 
00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
than this someone to turn to to say why
 
00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:29.220 align:start position:0%
didn't this happen the way it was
 
00:52:31.549 --> 00:52:31.559 align:start position:0%
supposed to I'm not interested in it no
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
you can't say that because you are the
 
00:52:35.809 --> 00:52:35.819 align:start position:0%
one being held accountable if you don't
 
00:52:37.370 --> 00:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
if you don't think this is important
 
00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
then let's put in legislation to kill it
 
00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:41.460 align:start position:0%
get rid of it or change it to something
 
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:48.049 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:52:48.049 --> 00:52:48.059 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:52:50.569 --> 00:52:50.579 align:start position:0%
um I'm certain I think that's a that's a
 
00:52:53.089 --> 00:52:53.099 align:start position:0%
fine idea to maybe work on the process
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
together for a while and then switch
 
00:52:58.849 --> 00:52:58.859 align:start position:0%
our methodology over to in individual
 
00:53:01.549 --> 00:53:01.559 align:start position:0%
commissions themselves yes thank you and
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
as you were talking I was thinking
 
00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:06.300 align:start position:0%
um many of us have been appointed to one
 
00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
thing or another over time and we will
 
00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:12.300 align:start position:0%
often receive a notice saying first name
 
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
member will call the commission for
 
00:53:16.490 --> 00:53:16.500 align:start position:0%
example together
 
00:53:18.470 --> 00:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
and it's not the chairman of the
 
00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:19.849 align:start position:0%
and it's not the chairman of the
community

00:53:19.849 --> 00:53:19.859 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
um of the house committee or the senate
 
00:53:22.319 --> 00:53:23.569 align:start position:0%
um of the house committee or the senate
committee

00:53:23.569 --> 00:53:23.579 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
um it's that first name Person calls no
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that person has to
 
00:53:27.839 --> 00:53:28.609 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that person has to
chair

00:53:28.609 --> 00:53:28.619 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:53:30.890 --> 00:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
but at least they call the meeting and
 
00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
maybe we need to clarify that a little
 
00:53:35.089 --> 00:53:35.099 align:start position:0%
bit too thank you right yeah and that
 
00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:37.380 align:start position:0%
whole process discussion that's I think
 
00:53:39.049 --> 00:53:39.059 align:start position:0%
that's that's part of the up up front
 
00:53:42.170 --> 00:53:42.180 align:start position:0%
process and that maybe part of the
 
00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:44.700 align:start position:0%
process that in the first meeting well
 
00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:46.559 align:start position:0%
within the first couple of meetings a
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
chair is elected and a vice chair is
 
00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
elected or whatever are chosen and that
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
then you move from there
 
00:53:57.170 --> 00:53:57.180 align:start position:0%
I like that and that goes along with
 
00:53:59.150 --> 00:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
your whole issue of accountability also
 
00:54:01.069 --> 00:54:01.079 align:start position:0%
because someone has to get up and
 
00:54:03.230 --> 00:54:03.240 align:start position:0%
running and doing something thank you
 
00:54:06.349 --> 00:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
right and if if
 
00:54:08.809 --> 00:54:08.819 align:start position:0%
the issue of of it being coterminous
 
00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
that these appointments are coterminous
 
00:54:12.829 --> 00:54:12.839 align:start position:0%
if somebody
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't get reelected then that becomes
 
00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:20.460 align:start position:0%
a very uh visible opportunity for a
 
00:54:23.450 --> 00:54:23.460 align:start position:0%
changeover or a switch or maybe even
 
00:54:25.930 --> 00:54:25.940 align:start position:0%
eliminating it because because of that
 
00:54:29.510 --> 00:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
but again it would drop back to the
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
committee chair to decide oh I'm going
 
00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
to have to appoint somebody else the
 
00:54:36.170 --> 00:54:36.180 align:start position:0%
feeling that this the seat that that
 
00:54:38.349 --> 00:54:38.359 align:start position:0%
person didn't get reelected
 
00:54:40.370 --> 00:54:40.380 align:start position:0%
re-elected to
 
00:54:42.349 --> 00:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
and and that's why as you read through
 
00:54:44.329 --> 00:54:44.339 align:start position:0%
this you'll see that it's very important
 
00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
that we have sun setting Provisions as
 
00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:49.140 align:start position:0%
well as dates for final reports uh
 
00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
making it so that at the end of the
 
00:54:53.089 --> 00:54:53.099 align:start position:0%
two-year term
 
00:54:53.099 --> 00:54:53.930 align:start position:0%
two-year term
um

00:54:53.930 --> 00:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:55.980 align:start position:0%
things have to happen
 
00:54:58.490 --> 00:54:58.500 align:start position:0%
um you either have to repeal or you have
 
00:55:01.790 --> 00:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
to establish a process to go forward
 
00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
because as we I read in here when you
 
00:55:07.010 --> 00:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
have that Gap when you have someone who
 
00:55:09.770 --> 00:55:09.780 align:start position:0%
isn't re-elected it causes the
 
00:55:11.329 --> 00:55:11.339 align:start position:0%
commission or the committee to become
 
00:55:13.970 --> 00:55:13.980 align:start position:0%
relatively ineffective for a while until
 
00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:15.780 align:start position:0%
people get their feet wet and get going
 
00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:17.460 align:start position:0%
again and that's part of the reason why
 
00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:20.220 align:start position:0%
some of these drag on thank you
 
00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:21.349 align:start position:0%
some of these drag on thank you
right

00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:55:21.359 --> 00:55:22.010 align:start position:0%
right
um

00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:26.030 --> 00:55:26.040 align:start position:0%
and like I was saying to uh Vanessa
 
00:55:29.089 --> 00:55:29.099 align:start position:0%
earlier that I would personally be
 
00:55:32.450 --> 00:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
skeptical to just blatantly uh
 
00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
blankenly accept covet as the reason why
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
it should it should continue because we
 
00:55:39.119 --> 00:55:39.829 align:start position:0%
it should it should continue because we
just

00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
we couldn't meet well again if it's a
 
00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
this is 2011 is the is the important
 
00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
date I think that's an empty excuse to
 
00:55:50.569 --> 00:55:50.579 align:start position:0%
say covid because we've been haven't had
 
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
coveted what 2019 or 2020 so yeah yeah I
 
00:55:57.890 --> 00:55:57.900 align:start position:0%
want to point out I mean covet is still
 
00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:00.660 align:start position:0%
a thing right you know I I think your
 
00:56:02.809 --> 00:56:02.819 align:start position:0%
your point though right is that that
 
00:56:03.890 --> 00:56:03.900 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be the reason that the
 
00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
committee is not right not meeting or
 
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
commission's not being right right I
 
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
I yeah Mr chair thanks I I uh I'm trying
 
00:56:15.470 --> 00:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
to think about process for us and and
 
00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
the work that we have ahead and trying
 
00:56:19.549 --> 00:56:19.559 align:start position:0%
to think through you know and it was a
 
00:56:21.049 --> 00:56:21.059 align:start position:0%
nice exchange between representative
 
00:56:23.329 --> 00:56:23.339 align:start position:0%
wall and representative Rambo about
 
00:56:25.309 --> 00:56:25.319 align:start position:0%
sort of what what should come first
 
00:56:29.089 --> 00:56:29.099 align:start position:0%
whether we dig into the uh you know kind
 
00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
of looking at all the different
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
commissions and trying to figure out
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
which ones you know may need to be
 
00:56:35.809 --> 00:56:35.819 align:start position:0%
sunsetted or you know what kind of
 
00:56:38.089 --> 00:56:38.099 align:start position:0%
recommendations to make there versus the
 
00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:39.780 align:start position:0%
work of
 
00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
um establishing some standards for for
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
commissions and
 
00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
I'm just I'm trying to think through
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
what's the most
 
00:56:51.170 --> 00:56:51.180 align:start position:0%
effective way to you know if one should
 
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
come first if we because I think there's
 
00:56:56.450 --> 00:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
a lot that we we know already and that's
 
00:56:58.370 --> 00:56:58.380 align:start position:0%
thanks to the staff and and their
 
00:57:00.049 --> 00:57:00.059 align:start position:0%
presentations but also probably a lot
 
00:57:01.609 --> 00:57:01.619 align:start position:0%
that we don't know and a lot of unique
 
00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:03.240 align:start position:0%
things that each of these commissions
 
00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
are facing
 
00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:06.900 align:start position:0%
um or reasons that commissions are
 
00:57:08.930 --> 00:57:08.940 align:start position:0%
really effective or reasons that they're
 
00:57:10.849 --> 00:57:10.859 align:start position:0%
not uh reasons that they're meeting
 
00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:12.839 align:start position:0%
reasons why they're not
 
00:57:14.690 --> 00:57:14.700 align:start position:0%
um and so I wonder if there might be a
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
way for us to solicit some information
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
from the chairs of those commissions or
 
00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:21.240 align:start position:0%
members of those commissions or you know
 
00:57:23.210 --> 00:57:23.220 align:start position:0%
our colleagues who establish those
 
00:57:25.730 --> 00:57:25.740 align:start position:0%
commissions in the first place
 
00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
um that would help guide our work not
 
00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:30.420 align:start position:0%
just in you know both both pieces both
 
00:57:32.210 --> 00:57:32.220 align:start position:0%
figuring out what changes need to be
 
00:57:34.609 --> 00:57:34.619 align:start position:0%
made to the existing commissions and you
 
00:57:36.109 --> 00:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
know setting up process moving forward
 
00:57:38.890 --> 00:57:38.900 align:start position:0%
so I throw that out there
 
00:57:42.890 --> 00:57:42.900 align:start position:0%
as a a possible you know kind of interim
 
00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:45.180 align:start position:0%
step here where we don't have to choose
 
00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
one or the other but just suggesting
 
00:57:48.349 --> 00:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
that we we may not have all the
 
00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
information quite yet
 
00:57:51.049 --> 00:57:51.059 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am
 
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:52.559 align:start position:0%
Matt do you think
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
we can in effort to use time wisely we
 
00:57:57.049 --> 00:57:57.059 align:start position:0%
could sort of simultaneously solicit
 
00:57:59.150 --> 00:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
feedback while maybe working on mapping
 
00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
to statutory committees I just I keep
 
00:58:03.410 --> 00:58:03.420 align:start position:0%
coming back to that as seeming like a
 
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
good starting point
 
00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:06.660 align:start position:0%
to be able to go through the list when
 
00:58:09.290 --> 00:58:09.300 align:start position:0%
we have the full list and trying to tag
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
them to the standing committees I know
 
00:58:13.069 --> 00:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
they won't be perfect but in fact that's
 
00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
something you can do with the outset and
 
00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:15.770 align:start position:0%
something you can do with the outset and
then

00:58:15.770 --> 00:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
if we don't get feedback maybe we didn't
 
00:58:20.450 --> 00:58:20.460 align:start position:0%
go to those chairs of those committees
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
to solicit some feedback
 
00:58:22.319 --> 00:58:23.089 align:start position:0%
to solicit some feedback
um

00:58:23.089 --> 00:58:23.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:25.010 --> 00:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
I don't know just seems like that
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
it seems like a concrete first step I
 
00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
don't know if other people think that
 
00:58:29.630 --> 00:58:29.640 align:start position:0%
should happen later but good point let
 
00:58:32.030 --> 00:58:32.040 align:start position:0%
me ask our assistants
 
00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:33.410 align:start position:0%
me ask our assistants
uh

00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:58:39.289 --> 00:58:39.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
our binders and be able to help us do
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
that mapping to say here's
 
00:58:48.049 --> 00:58:48.059 align:start position:0%
you know here are the here are the
 
00:58:51.109 --> 00:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
commissions and here's what they map to
 
00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
and and when it's not clear in your mind
 
00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
you just
 
00:58:57.650 --> 00:58:57.660 align:start position:0%
make a guess or maybe a response is I
 
00:58:59.329 --> 00:58:59.339 align:start position:0%
have no idea if you can't tell or
 
00:59:01.069 --> 00:59:01.079 align:start position:0%
whatever and that would be in a
 
00:59:03.770 --> 00:59:03.780 align:start position:0%
reasonable response but to bring us back
 
00:59:06.770 --> 00:59:06.780 align:start position:0%
that list uh it doesn't have to be a
 
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
flowchart but just you know a kind of a
 
00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet here are the commissions
 
00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:13.559 align:start position:0%
here's who they map to
 
00:59:13.559 --> 00:59:14.390 align:start position:0%
here's who they map to
um

00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:18.589 --> 00:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
and that would that would beautiful
 
00:59:22.910 --> 00:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
you know some people away cracking
 
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:27.359 --> 00:59:28.510 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:59:28.510 --> 00:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
that that's one way to look at it one
 
00:59:32.630 --> 00:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
way to look at it would be what current
 
00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
committee is managing it or as it
 
00:59:38.450 --> 00:59:38.460 align:start position:0%
acknowledges it uh for example the
 
00:59:40.609 --> 00:59:40.619 align:start position:0%
the agricultural committee
 
00:59:44.089 --> 00:59:44.099 align:start position:0%
must have a certain number of of uh
 
00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:47.460 align:start position:0%
study committees that it's that fall
 
00:59:50.809 --> 00:59:50.819 align:start position:0%
into that subject matter and
 
00:59:52.849 --> 00:59:52.859 align:start position:0%
if you could identify those for us then
 
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
we then we can go to the agricultural
 
00:59:57.170 --> 00:59:57.180 align:start position:0%
committee chair and say do you recognize
 
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
this as yours and see if they move the
 
01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:02.220 align:start position:0%
head up and down or back and forth and
 
01:00:03.770 --> 01:00:03.780 align:start position:0%
then we then we kind of take the next
 
01:00:04.970 --> 01:00:04.980 align:start position:0%
step all right if you don't recognize
 
01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
the jewels we need to maybe again as we
 
01:00:11.089 --> 01:00:11.099 align:start position:0%
develop our process maybe we need to go
 
01:00:14.089 --> 01:00:14.099 align:start position:0%
to the speaker and the minority leader
 
01:00:15.230 --> 01:00:15.240 align:start position:0%
and say
 
01:00:18.049 --> 01:00:18.059 align:start position:0%
this is something obviously is important
 
01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
you know do you agree that this is
 
01:00:22.730 --> 01:00:22.740 align:start position:0%
something that the that the committee
 
01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:25.980 align:start position:0%
chair ought to be uh managing or you
 
01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
know at least overseeing and if as long
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
as the head keeps going up and down then
 
01:00:32.809 --> 01:00:32.819 align:start position:0%
we can pursue that but if they say no we
 
01:00:32.819 --> 01:00:33.589 align:start position:0%
we can pursue that but if they say no we
don't

01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:36.660 align:start position:0%
that really belongs over in Edna not
 
01:00:39.109 --> 01:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
agriculture okay we'll have to sort
 
01:00:48.170 --> 01:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:50.329 --> 01:00:50.339 align:start position:0%
yeah representative walls thank you Mr
 
01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you very much
 
01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
um yeah some of the groundwork for that
 
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
has been laid out in here already and if
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
they can separate that out and carry it
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
a little further
 
01:01:02.089 --> 01:01:02.099 align:start position:0%
that would be really helpful
 
01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:03.900 align:start position:0%
um and I'll simply up the reason I keep
 
01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
bringing up the um I have to keep
 
01:01:07.849 --> 01:01:07.859 align:start position:0%
forgetting the official name New
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Commission on Native American
 
01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:13.380 align:start position:0%
Affairs uh um I worked at length last
 
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
week we it was suggested we worked with
 
01:01:18.109 --> 01:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
Myla and I I worked with her at length
 
01:01:20.690 --> 01:01:20.700 align:start position:0%
because I remember testifying on the
 
01:01:23.089 --> 01:01:23.099 align:start position:0%
original bill that came in and we found
 
01:01:25.490 --> 01:01:25.500 align:start position:0%
all kinds of information that was
 
01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
helpful to bring us up to date but we
 
01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
could not find that original bill that
 
01:01:33.049 --> 01:01:33.059 align:start position:0%
established the study committee
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
um initially what happened was and I
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
cannot for the life of me and I'm sure
 
01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:39.540 align:start position:0%
somewhere in my files at home I have it
 
01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
I was not a sponsor I just happened to
 
01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:44.460 align:start position:0%
meet people out here in the hall one day
 
01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
who wanted help
 
01:01:46.799 --> 01:01:47.690 align:start position:0%
who wanted help
um

01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:47.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:50.390 --> 01:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
it all started out with the abernakis
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
wanting to be recognized as a tribe in
 
01:01:55.130 --> 01:01:55.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:01:57.410 --> 01:01:57.420 align:start position:0%
and I thought
 
01:01:59.390 --> 01:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
why not I mean they were sitting out
 
01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
here making baskets they were beautiful
 
01:02:02.990 --> 01:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
they were talking about going to powwows
 
01:02:06.109 --> 01:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
and how all other states in New England
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
had recognized tribes so they could sell
 
01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
their baskets and whatever else they
 
01:02:13.490 --> 01:02:13.500 align:start position:0%
were making as their artifacts from
 
01:02:15.890 --> 01:02:15.900 align:start position:0%
their tribes but in New Hampshire or
 
01:02:18.530 --> 01:02:18.540 align:start position:0%
wherever these abernakis went they could
 
01:02:22.010 --> 01:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
not say they said the Abenaki like or
 
01:02:24.049 --> 01:02:24.059 align:start position:0%
Native American alike they preferred it
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
by the way to be called Indians at that
 
01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:29.880 align:start position:0%
point but so I thought gee you know if
 
01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:31.380 align:start position:0%
they're going to these powwows why
 
01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
shouldn't they be able to do this
 
01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:37.559 align:start position:0%
and what happened in the Senate was
 
01:02:37.559 --> 01:02:38.510 align:start position:0%
and what happened in the Senate was
shocking

01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
shocking
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
to me all of a sudden floodgates opened
 
01:02:43.309 --> 01:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to return all their
 
01:02:45.049 --> 01:02:45.059 align:start position:0%
artifacts that our state archaeologist
 
01:02:48.109 --> 01:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
Howard Sergeant found years ago and
 
01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
cataloged and Captain a Barney had built
 
01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
for them and sold to Harvard and this
 
01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
that and the other and they're going to
 
01:02:54.650 --> 01:02:54.660 align:start position:0%
want those back they're going to want
 
01:02:56.930 --> 01:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
their lands back they're going to want
 
01:03:00.049 --> 01:03:00.059 align:start position:0%
um the sacred territories and burial
 
01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
sites back they're going to want
 
01:03:03.230 --> 01:03:03.240 align:start position:0%
recompense from the federal government
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
so it went beyond what we could do here
 
01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
therefore in order to do something to
 
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
help these people and I'm sorry it takes
 
01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:13.799 align:start position:0%
so long but it that's sort of why some
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
of these get established
 
01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
um it finally worked out that at least
 
01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
there'd be a study committee well that
 
01:03:22.849 --> 01:03:22.859 align:start position:0%
didn't get very far and that's why it
 
01:03:25.730 --> 01:03:25.740 align:start position:0%
became a commission but we cannot find
 
01:03:28.549 --> 01:03:28.559 align:start position:0%
I've got the working from now back but
 
01:03:31.089 --> 01:03:31.099 align:start position:0%
we cannot find that original
 
01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
material to get this commission study
 
01:03:37.789 --> 01:03:37.799 align:start position:0%
committee recognition going backwards in
 
01:03:40.490 --> 01:03:40.500 align:start position:0%
time we can't find it anywhere
 
01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:43.079 align:start position:0%
so if if you could
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
perform a miracle it would be helpful
 
01:03:49.430 --> 01:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
it would just helped us to decide you
 
01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:50.760 align:start position:0%
know what else if these people really
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
wanted in the beginning besides
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
recognition what you know we we couldn't
 
01:03:57.049 --> 01:03:57.059 align:start position:0%
find testimony
 
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
or minutes from that hearing and we
 
01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
couldn't even find the original bill
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
it's got to be somewhere in our records
 
01:04:06.829 --> 01:04:06.839 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of recent testimonies
 
01:04:06.839 --> 01:04:08.690 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of recent testimonies
yeah

01:04:08.690 --> 01:04:08.700 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:04:10.849 --> 01:04:10.859 align:start position:0%
in the Edna committee so maybe that's a
 
01:04:19.849 --> 01:04:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
yeah it's Jim you had to come in
 
01:04:26.690 --> 01:04:26.700 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you Mr chairman so
 
01:04:28.849 --> 01:04:28.859 align:start position:0%
returning to the question of sort of
 
01:04:28.859 --> 01:04:29.809 align:start position:0%
returning to the question of sort of
what

01:04:29.809 --> 01:04:29.819 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:32.700 align:start position:0%
committees would each of these
 
01:04:35.030 --> 01:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
committees or commissions belong to I
 
01:04:37.789 --> 01:04:37.799 align:start position:0%
think that the this this section current
 
01:04:40.730 --> 01:04:40.740 align:start position:0%
committees and commissions actually
 
01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:43.140 align:start position:0%
has done that for a lot of these because
 
01:04:45.289 --> 01:04:45.299 align:start position:0%
it has the an originating committee and
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
a house committee with jurisdiction
 
01:04:49.549 --> 01:04:49.559 align:start position:0%
and a corresponding state agency for
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
what that's worth but
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
um yeah it's the it's the section that's
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
called current committees and
 
01:04:56.930 --> 01:04:56.940 align:start position:0%
commissions and it's kind of it's in
 
01:04:59.690 --> 01:04:59.700 align:start position:0%
landscape mode so I think a good deal of
 
01:05:01.549 --> 01:05:01.559 align:start position:0%
that is already done
 
01:05:04.370 --> 01:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
um I guess my question is are there
 
01:05:07.849 --> 01:05:07.859 align:start position:0%
other data points that we want to add to
 
01:05:09.650 --> 01:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
this so presumably there is a
 
01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet or a word table or something
 
01:05:14.089 --> 01:05:14.099 align:start position:0%
that contains this information that
 
01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
there is a a column that says is is the
 
01:05:18.849 --> 01:05:18.859 align:start position:0%
are they meeting still
 
01:05:23.030 --> 01:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
it might be interesting to to know when
 
01:05:24.890 --> 01:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
was the last time they met if we know
 
01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
that it might be interesting to know
 
01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:31.140 align:start position:0%
um if they have any members if they have
 
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
a chair if they have a quorum of members
 
01:05:37.549 --> 01:05:37.559 align:start position:0%
appointed so I asked so I guess I asked
 
01:05:39.890 --> 01:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
Dan while she was before she gets
 
01:05:41.690 --> 01:05:41.700 align:start position:0%
started I said I was looking at the
 
01:05:43.309 --> 01:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet I said there's a lot of
 
01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
blank spaces for the meetings still I
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
said we that's a that's an important
 
01:05:50.809 --> 01:05:50.819 align:start position:0%
piece of data that seems to be missing
 
01:05:53.930 --> 01:05:53.940 align:start position:0%
in many ways I I guess so so a list of
 
01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
members would be one thing but I I guess
 
01:05:58.430 --> 01:05:58.440 align:start position:0%
my suggestion is that we work off of
 
01:05:59.930 --> 01:05:59.940 align:start position:0%
this and see
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
answer the question what other data
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
points would we like to see
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
um I've mentioned a few I think it would
 
01:06:09.730 --> 01:06:09.740 align:start position:0%
be also also be helpful to know
 
01:06:12.049 --> 01:06:12.059 align:start position:0%
which members you know who are the
 
01:06:14.329 --> 01:06:14.339 align:start position:0%
members if there are any of these
 
01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
commissions currently if we know some of
 
01:06:18.289 --> 01:06:18.299 align:start position:0%
those folks sometimes we can get a
 
01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
clearer picture just by you know picking
 
01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
up the phone and saying hey tell me
 
01:06:24.069 --> 01:06:24.079 align:start position:0%
about this this commission
 
01:06:27.289 --> 01:06:27.299 align:start position:0%
we want to bring them in right query
 
01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
them we'll know who to ask to come
 
01:06:31.010 --> 01:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
forward right I know get them scheduled
 
01:06:32.809 --> 01:06:32.819 align:start position:0%
Deborah Childs had asked me about a
 
01:06:35.089 --> 01:06:35.099 align:start position:0%
commission that I served on very briefly
 
01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
last biennium and I I think I was able
 
01:06:39.950 --> 01:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
to kind of give her off the top of my
 
01:06:42.829 --> 01:06:42.839 align:start position:0%
head information that probably wasn't
 
01:06:44.569 --> 01:06:44.579 align:start position:0%
written down anywhere but that
 
01:06:45.950 --> 01:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
essentially it was that the the
 
01:06:49.309 --> 01:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
commission had completed its work so
 
01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
um so I think if we if we can come up
 
01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
with the additional data points and
 
01:06:55.549 --> 01:06:55.559 align:start position:0%
build out from what we have here that
 
01:06:58.190 --> 01:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
would be a helpful starting point for
 
01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:05.990 align:start position:0%
would be a helpful starting point for
this

01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:08.990 --> 01:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
communities that started in so all right
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
so you know what we're talking about in
 
01:07:19.730 --> 01:07:19.740 align:start position:0%
the in the notebook
 
01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:21.349 align:start position:0%
the in the notebook
foreign

01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:07:26.270 --> 01:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:29.450 --> 01:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
so so as part of that effort to do the
 
01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
mapping we we you need to identify who
 
01:07:34.130 --> 01:07:34.140 align:start position:0%
the chair is
 
01:07:36.589 --> 01:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
of that committee that shouldn't be that
 
01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
hard and then and then we can you know
 
01:07:43.849 --> 01:07:43.859 align:start position:0%
at least be it and as as uh
 
01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
representative Koval mentioned
 
01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:50.220 align:start position:0%
perhaps an explosion of of the of the
 
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet as to who is on that
 
01:07:56.690 --> 01:07:56.700 align:start position:0%
committee not just the chair but it's a
 
01:07:58.609 --> 01:07:58.619 align:start position:0%
chair that over oversees the committee
 
01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
but here are the 10 or 12 members that
 
01:08:04.010 --> 01:08:04.020 align:start position:0%
are on the committee and that gives us a
 
01:08:05.809 --> 01:08:05.819 align:start position:0%
source of people to call
 
01:08:08.450 --> 01:08:08.460 align:start position:0%
not only to ask questions to but also to
 
01:08:18.890 --> 01:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:25.130 --> 01:08:25.140 align:start position:0%
yes legislative members but that would
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
be the priority but also anyone else
 
01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
that's still
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh listed as a member of the commission
 
01:08:34.249 --> 01:08:34.259 align:start position:0%
we should maybe maybe is at two levels
 
01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:35.940 align:start position:0%
of a spreadsheet maybe you if you
 
01:08:38.269 --> 01:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
clicked on the on the thing then you'd
 
01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
have a drop down menu
 
01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
as to who all the people on commission
 
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yeah that's what I was
 
01:08:46.249 --> 01:08:46.259 align:start position:0%
getting at in the very beginning of this
 
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
section of the notebook for example on
 
01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
the first page
 
01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:52.669 align:start position:0%
the first page
um

01:08:52.669 --> 01:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:54.829 --> 01:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
you see a whole column are they meeting
 
01:08:56.689 --> 01:08:56.699 align:start position:0%
still what year were they were
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
established right right I mean so one of
 
01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
them advisory committee on brother
 
01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:02.870 align:start position:0%
them advisory committee on brother
analyzer

01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
analyzer
 
01:09:06.169 --> 01:09:06.179 align:start position:0%
um machines established in 1988 we don't
 
01:09:08.030 --> 01:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
even know if they're still meeting right
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
things like that you need to know that
 
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
and why they're not meeting yeah those
 
01:09:15.470 --> 01:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
if you can help fill those dates in as
 
01:09:17.390 --> 01:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
to are they meetings still if the answer
 
01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
is no then you know it doesn't it
 
01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:22.140 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh indict anybody just let's
 
01:09:23.809 --> 01:09:23.819 align:start position:0%
gives us information they're not meeting
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
and then it's going to be up to us to
 
01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:26.689 align:start position:0%
and then it's going to be up to us to
call

01:09:26.689 --> 01:09:26.699 align:start position:0%
call
 
01:09:30.189 --> 01:09:30.199 align:start position:0%
uh on the committee chair and probably
 
01:09:34.189 --> 01:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
uh if it's a car if it's the safety uh
 
01:09:36.769 --> 01:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
commission why why isn't this meeting
 
01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
and they think well we don't really need
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
it or whatever okay that's good
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
information for us
 
01:09:45.249 --> 01:09:45.259 align:start position:0%
to deal with yes ma'am
 
01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'm I'm wondering if
 
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
there's more information
 
01:09:53.809 --> 01:09:53.819 align:start position:0%
it looks to me like there's more
 
01:09:56.270 --> 01:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
information in the report from November
 
01:09:59.630 --> 01:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
1st 2020. this is Karen's that Karen's
 
01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
exactly Karen's rather thick memo
 
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
there's a whole um
 
01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
section of that spreadsheet that has a
 
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
lot of information about
 
01:10:14.150 --> 01:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
weather in 2020 they thought that it
 
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
should be kept
 
01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
and I think I feel like
 
01:10:21.890 --> 01:10:21.900 align:start position:0%
covet or no covid I I bet that the
 
01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:24.900 align:start position:0%
information from 2020 is pretty relevant
 
01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:28.500 align:start position:0%
to us for today because it it might be a
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
really good place to start because it
 
01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
might be that some of the places in this
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
other spreadsheet that are empty I'm not
 
01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
sure if if they're all filled in with
 
01:10:40.729 --> 01:10:40.739 align:start position:0%
the data that's
 
01:10:43.970 --> 01:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
um that's also in Karen's
 
01:10:46.370 --> 01:10:46.380 align:start position:0%
right report from 2020. it's just it's
 
01:10:49.550 --> 01:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
much more up to date you're right I'm
 
01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
very hopeful that Karen will be here at
 
01:10:53.689 --> 01:10:53.699 align:start position:0%
the next meeting because I think that
 
01:10:57.010 --> 01:10:57.020 align:start position:0%
she can help explain the current status
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
yeah and you know
 
01:11:01.850 --> 01:11:01.860 align:start position:0%
for example you might want to say gee
 
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
here's a committee that hasn't met in 12
 
01:11:06.169 --> 01:11:06.179 align:start position:0%
years but there's a recommendation to
 
01:11:11.330 --> 01:11:11.340 align:start position:0%
keep it why oh because of XYZ and so
 
01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
forth oh okay I mean that
 
01:11:15.709 --> 01:11:15.719 align:start position:0%
that explanation I think would really
 
01:11:20.689 --> 01:11:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
hey John how are you
 
01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:25.430 align:start position:0%
hey John how are you
okay

01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:11:27.649 --> 01:11:27.659 align:start position:0%
I told you I'd be late
 
01:11:30.290 --> 01:11:30.300 align:start position:0%
Wendy's the worst day of the week for me
 
01:11:33.110 --> 01:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
and uh like I said our
 
01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:34.189 align:start position:0%
and uh like I said our
other

01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:11:38.450 --> 01:11:38.460 align:start position:0%
mission do you set will not be here yeah
 
01:11:41.410 --> 01:11:41.420 align:start position:0%
I have one I hear it
 
01:11:44.870 --> 01:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
okay so uh yes ma'am I have the question
 
01:11:46.130 --> 01:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
actually as I'm looking at this the
 
01:11:48.229 --> 01:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
appendix from representative evil church
 
01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
so since I was 2020 we know a lot of
 
01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:51.350 align:start position:0%
so since I was 2020 we know a lot of
things

01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
these throughout all these
 
01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:54.900 align:start position:0%
recommendations do we know what happened
 
01:11:56.450 --> 01:11:56.460 align:start position:0%
with it did anything happen with any of
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
them they just or they just sit at a
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation stage
 
01:12:02.209 --> 01:12:02.219 align:start position:0%
like what did the repeals go into it you
 
01:12:04.130 --> 01:12:04.140 align:start position:0%
know it's recommending key for repeal or
 
01:12:05.689 --> 01:12:05.699 align:start position:0%
right I assume nothing happened that way
 
01:12:07.870 --> 01:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
because that's a great thing happened
 
01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:10.450 align:start position:0%
because that's a great thing happened
already

01:12:10.450 --> 01:12:10.460 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:12:15.649 --> 01:12:15.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:15.659 --> 01:12:28.010 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
huh okay so is this I feel like we have
 
01:12:31.970 --> 01:12:31.980 align:start position:0%
like a spreadsheet issue where they're
 
01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
needing to combine what we have or
 
01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
cross-reference what we because maybe
 
01:12:37.729 --> 01:12:37.739 align:start position:0%
between those two maybe a lot of these
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
have been repealed and we need to narrow
 
01:12:41.209 --> 01:12:41.219 align:start position:0%
down what hasn't been
 
01:12:42.590 --> 01:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
and I know that's one bucket in the
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
other bucket is the process going
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
forward especially if they have been
 
01:12:47.149 --> 01:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
repealed it would would make sense for
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
us to spend a lot yeah I don't want to
 
01:12:49.790 --> 01:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
waste time going through a chart that
 
01:12:50.630 --> 01:12:50.640 align:start position:0%
you know that we don't need to
 
01:12:53.330 --> 01:12:53.340 align:start position:0%
subtracting down do that
 
01:12:55.550 --> 01:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
um yeah so maybe he wants to starting
 
01:12:59.570 --> 01:12:59.580 align:start position:0%
with the 2020 right chart and finding
 
01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
out or
 
01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:02.460 align:start position:0%
finding out which of those were actually
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
enacted in terms of the report you're
 
01:13:05.990 --> 01:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
talking about the the one the E what
 
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
I'll call the evil yeah from January
 
01:13:10.010 --> 01:13:10.020 align:start position:0%
30th 2020.
 
01:13:10.020 --> 01:13:11.149 align:start position:0%
30th 2020.
uh

01:13:11.149 --> 01:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
the January
 
01:13:14.570 --> 01:13:14.580 align:start position:0%
the memo is for November but I'm looking
 
01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
into the
 
01:13:22.250 --> 01:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
so for your edification we're looking at
 
01:13:28.850 --> 01:13:28.860 align:start position:0%
the the middle one of the middle tabs
 
01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
that's titled
 
01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
past committee on committee reports and
 
01:13:37.970 --> 01:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of lengthy memos in
 
01:13:41.570 --> 01:13:41.580 align:start position:0%
there from uh author probably by Karen
 
01:13:45.530 --> 01:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
Ebel uh one stated January 30th and one
 
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
shaded dated November 1st 2020.
 
01:13:52.850 --> 01:13:52.860 align:start position:0%
and Karen evil is the uh
 
01:13:57.229 --> 01:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
identified uh author of both of those so
 
01:13:58.970 --> 01:13:58.980 align:start position:0%
just as a point of reference as you're
 
01:14:01.010 --> 01:14:01.020 align:start position:0%
looking through the book that's what
 
01:14:03.229 --> 01:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
we're talking about right to the
 
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
November 1 memo and you reference at
 
01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:08.460 align:start position:0%
1240 HP 12 45 this would be sort of the
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
most recent work right or or
 
01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:14.750 align:start position:0%
most recent work right or or
recollection

01:14:14.750 --> 01:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:19.140 align:start position:0%
so can I add I I think that that is the
 
01:14:21.050 --> 01:14:21.060 align:start position:0%
one with the most data but this
 
01:14:23.149 --> 01:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet the smaller one in landscape
 
01:14:26.510 --> 01:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
says it was updated April 10th
 
01:14:29.330 --> 01:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
as of April 10th of this year
 
01:14:32.450 --> 01:14:32.460 align:start position:0%
so I wonder does it reflect the repeals
 
01:14:36.050 --> 01:14:36.060 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned Brad do you know
 
01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:38.280 align:start position:0%
this one apple tab is that again oh yeah
 
01:14:40.669 --> 01:14:40.679 align:start position:0%
the tab is current committees
 
01:14:46.370 --> 01:14:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:48.229 --> 01:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
because what I what I am what I wasn't
 
01:14:51.350 --> 01:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
very clear about articulating is I I
 
01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
think this landscape spreadsheet might
 
01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:55.250 align:start position:0%
think this landscape spreadsheet might
be

01:14:55.250 --> 01:14:55.260 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:14:58.130 --> 01:14:58.140 align:start position:0%
up to date on
 
01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
what we have now and what the Committees
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
are now
 
01:15:04.189 --> 01:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
um and the committee with jurisdiction
 
01:15:07.490 --> 01:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
right I I just think there might be a
 
01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:13.450 --> 01:15:13.460 align:start position:0%
different information
 
01:15:16.250 --> 01:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
in Karen's report that tells us like
 
01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
that they thought something should be
 
01:15:20.090 --> 01:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
kept and maybe a little bit about why so
 
01:15:22.669 --> 01:15:22.679 align:start position:0%
maybe adding that piece so Karen's
 
01:15:24.169 --> 01:15:24.179 align:start position:0%
question might be
 
01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
for example if Karen had recommended to
 
01:15:29.630 --> 01:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
be repealed
 
01:15:31.850 --> 01:15:31.860 align:start position:0%
did it fought and it was repealed did it
 
01:15:40.209 --> 01:15:40.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:40.219 --> 01:15:44.050 align:start position:0%
 
.com

01:15:44.050 --> 01:15:44.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:46.669 --> 01:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
that would be good it's so
 
01:15:48.770 --> 01:15:48.780 align:start position:0%
so the one of the issues is going to be
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
is if we look at the recommendations
 
01:15:55.729 --> 01:15:55.739 align:start position:0%
uh 2020 that Karen came up with
 
01:15:58.250 --> 01:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
how many of them or which ones of them
 
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
were successfully accomplished so that
 
01:16:03.229 --> 01:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
the spreadsheet
 
01:16:05.689 --> 01:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
which would reflect on the accuracy and
 
01:16:08.410 --> 01:16:08.420 align:start position:0%
the up-to-date datedness that's a term
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
of the spreadsheet
 
01:16:13.010 --> 01:16:13.020 align:start position:0%
that you know don't worry about this
 
01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:14.649 align:start position:0%
that you know don't worry about this
particular

01:16:14.649 --> 01:16:14.659 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:16:16.430 --> 01:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee because it's already been
 
01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:24.709 align:start position:0%
 
was

01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:16:24.719 --> 01:16:31.430 align:start position:0%
was
outside

01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:34.250 --> 01:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
right that's that's a good that'd be
 
01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
very helpful thank you
 
01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
so good ideas both of them I appreciate
 
01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:40.490 align:start position:0%
so good ideas both of them I appreciate
that

01:16:40.490 --> 01:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
uh as we start digging into this we're
 
01:16:47.090 --> 01:16:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
and if there are those
 
01:16:52.010 --> 01:16:52.020 align:start position:0%
committees I I think I mentioned this uh
 
01:16:53.810 --> 01:16:53.820 align:start position:0%
last week if there are those committees
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
that look like they're important like
 
01:16:58.189 --> 01:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
that one we talked about the peace ass
 
01:17:00.169 --> 01:17:00.179 align:start position:0%
committee that Thomas Sherman
 
01:17:03.169 --> 01:17:03.179 align:start position:0%
in the Senate was looking after if that
 
01:17:05.930 --> 01:17:05.940 align:start position:0%
if that if that's going to be a
 
01:17:08.510 --> 01:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
a hill that he wants to die on
 
01:17:11.630 --> 01:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
uh then my recommendation is we step
 
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:13.320 align:start position:0%
back because we're not going to get
 
01:17:15.649 --> 01:17:15.659 align:start position:0%
anywhere anyway they'll they'll kill
 
01:17:18.290 --> 01:17:18.300 align:start position:0%
that legislation let's spend our time on
 
01:17:19.490 --> 01:17:19.500 align:start position:0%
something that
 
01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
both houses agree that it's time to end
 
01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
it and uh and put it in the
 
01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:27.709 align:start position:0%
it and uh and put it in the
accomplish

01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:27.719 align:start position:0%
accomplish
 
01:17:31.490 --> 01:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
column yes thank you chairman I think
 
01:17:35.209 --> 01:17:35.219 align:start position:0%
it'd be interesting for us to consider
 
01:17:35.219 --> 01:17:36.610 align:start position:0%
it'd be interesting for us to consider
um

01:17:36.610 --> 01:17:36.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:40.669 --> 01:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
requiring commissions to determine their
 
01:17:42.410 --> 01:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
own fate
 
01:17:44.090 --> 01:17:44.100 align:start position:0%
you know like are there things that we
 
01:17:45.890 --> 01:17:45.900 align:start position:0%
could be doing to basically say we're
 
01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
not taking immediate action to dissolve
 
01:17:49.970 --> 01:17:49.980 align:start position:0%
this commission however
 
01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:52.440 align:start position:0%
if you're still going to continue
 
01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
here's what you need to meet these
 
01:17:56.270 --> 01:17:56.280 align:start position:0%
minimum requirements and that those
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
minimum requirements stay in place for
 
01:17:59.870 --> 01:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
the future and that are things that
 
01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:01.260 align:start position:0%
we're considering before we even
 
01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
establish it in the first place
 
01:18:06.050 --> 01:18:06.060 align:start position:0%
that's good that's a that's a I think
 
01:18:08.570 --> 01:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
that's a good idea that's a good process
 
01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:10.729 align:start position:0%
that's a good idea that's a good process
issue

01:18:10.729 --> 01:18:10.739 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
you know if that oh by the way here's
 
01:18:16.010 --> 01:18:16.020 align:start position:0%
your first notice we're looking at this
 
01:18:17.630 --> 01:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
here's the second notice we're getting
 
01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
ready to
 
01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
right repeal legislation
 
01:18:23.810 --> 01:18:23.820 align:start position:0%
uh you you better come forward and talk
 
01:18:26.149 --> 01:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
us out of it if you really think it
 
01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
needs to uh to stay or whatever yes
 
01:18:30.410 --> 01:18:30.420 align:start position:0%
ma'am thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:18:32.930 --> 01:18:32.940 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr leader
 
01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:33.890 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr leader
um

01:18:33.890 --> 01:18:33.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:36.050 --> 01:18:36.060 align:start position:0%
that goes along with the final reports
 
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
on some of these Commissions in terms of
 
01:18:40.490 --> 01:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
recommendations for what should happen
 
01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
if the commission's inactive or if
 
01:18:45.649 --> 01:18:45.659 align:start position:0%
they've stalled or if they seem to be
 
01:18:48.229 --> 01:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
going in a different direction because
 
01:18:50.930 --> 01:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
each commission is given a charge as to
 
01:18:52.850 --> 01:18:52.860 align:start position:0%
what they're supposed to do
 
01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
and we need to know if they are sticking
 
01:18:56.709 --> 01:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
to that or if they're just going off
 
01:18:59.149 --> 01:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly in some other direction I
 
01:19:01.130 --> 01:19:01.140 align:start position:0%
can't imagine that they do but who knows
 
01:19:03.649 --> 01:19:03.659 align:start position:0%
when someone's meeting for off and on
 
01:19:06.290 --> 01:19:06.300 align:start position:0%
for 10 or 15 or 20 years I mean I can't
 
01:19:07.850 --> 01:19:07.860 align:start position:0%
believe they're sticking to the original
 
01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:18.290 --> 01:19:18.300 align:start position:0%
who else have any uh comments uh or
 
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
ideas that you might want to throw on
 
01:19:22.010 --> 01:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
the table
 
01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
maybe this is a process point for
 
01:19:28.669 --> 01:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
putting in place structure When Future
 
01:19:31.370 --> 01:19:31.380 align:start position:0%
commissions are considered by a house
 
01:19:31.380 --> 01:19:32.209 align:start position:0%
commissions are considered by a house
but

01:19:32.209 --> 01:19:32.219 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
I just it seems that there should be a
 
01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
default sense you know if you haven't
 
01:19:37.490 --> 01:19:37.500 align:start position:0%
met in x amount of time where you
 
01:19:39.709 --> 01:19:39.719 align:start position:0%
haven't submitted a report but that's it
 
01:19:42.169 --> 01:19:42.179 align:start position:0%
it ends and then and there could be an
 
01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
appeal process maybe or something where
 
01:19:46.610 --> 01:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
for circumstances that justify but I I
 
01:19:49.370 --> 01:19:49.380 align:start position:0%
just think there needs that was part of
 
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
the process issue that I was talking
 
01:19:52.189 --> 01:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
about last week that
 
01:19:55.370 --> 01:19:55.380 align:start position:0%
that we we ought to think about I I
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
think we ought to think about that if if
 
01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
a commission hasn't met an X number of
 
01:20:03.290 --> 01:20:03.300 align:start position:0%
term next number of times in a row that
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
they go on the chopping block or if a
 
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
Committee Member doesn't show up X
 
01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
number of times in a row for a meeting
 
01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
then they're they're off the committee
 
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
and they need to be replaced things like
 
01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
rules like that I think it seems to me
 
01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
at least coming into the summer blindly
 
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:22.800 align:start position:0%
as they were saying before it seems like
 
01:20:24.590 --> 01:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
the default right now is
 
01:20:26.510 --> 01:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
in perpetuity you know there there are
 
01:20:28.130 --> 01:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
no guard rails like that right
 
01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:29.330 align:start position:0%
no guard rails like that right
necessarily

01:20:29.330 --> 01:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:30.470 align:start position:0%
necessarily
um

01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
or not not across the board at least so
 
01:20:34.490 --> 01:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
that that seems like it would be
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
worthwhile to me to explore
 
01:20:39.290 --> 01:20:39.300 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
I I also wonder if uh
 
01:20:45.890 --> 01:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
there should be a process for
 
01:20:49.550 --> 01:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
dissolution I like is there like we we
 
01:20:51.649 --> 01:20:51.659 align:start position:0%
can't put it on the committee chairs for
 
01:20:53.090 --> 01:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
example like the standing committee
 
01:20:54.830 --> 01:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
chairs to dissolve a like they don't
 
01:20:56.330 --> 01:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
they don't have the statutory authority
 
01:20:58.250 --> 01:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
to do that but should we establish
 
01:21:00.350 --> 01:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority
 
01:21:05.450 --> 01:21:05.460 align:start position:0%
to Sunset these more quickly that Sunset
 
01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
isn't the right word but to dissolve a
 
01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
commission uh if they aren't Meeting
 
01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
those specific requirements I'm I'm way
 
01:21:14.630 --> 01:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
more excited about the kind of proactive
 
01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
like how do we manage this moving
 
01:21:17.689 --> 01:21:17.699 align:start position:0%
forward then
 
01:21:19.370 --> 01:21:19.380 align:start position:0%
been actually taking on the political
 
01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
responsibility of saying we're chopping
 
01:21:23.330 --> 01:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
all these you know we're going to get
 
01:21:25.010 --> 01:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
rid of all these commissions but I do
 
01:21:26.450 --> 01:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
think that there's a way that the two
 
01:21:28.490 --> 01:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
can come to get that we can actually
 
01:21:30.350 --> 01:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
establish the process
 
01:21:32.450 --> 01:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:21:35.689 --> 01:21:35.699 align:start position:0%
quickly get rid of some of them that you
 
01:21:37.130 --> 01:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
know aren't Meeting those minimum right
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
I think if you make it a if you haven't
 
01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
met an x amount of time then it's not a
 
01:21:42.169 --> 01:21:42.179 align:start position:0%
political there shouldn't
 
01:21:43.970 --> 01:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
write that and it's just a
 
01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
logistical issue not a prioritizing this
 
01:21:48.290 --> 01:21:48.300 align:start position:0%
committee over that committee it should
 
01:21:51.050 --> 01:21:51.060 align:start position:0%
be a trigger yeah yeah and and some of
 
01:21:52.250 --> 01:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
them might be meeting some of that might
 
01:21:54.590 --> 01:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
be filing reports you know maybe there
 
01:21:56.090 --> 01:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
is a requirement if there isn't already
 
01:21:58.430 --> 01:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
for you know the commissions to file
 
01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:00.229 align:start position:0%
for you know the commissions to file
reports

01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
reports
 
01:22:03.470 --> 01:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
um maybe there is a not to create a new
 
01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
one but a uh you know maybe there's a
 
01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.030 align:start position:0%
one but a uh you know maybe there's a
joint

01:22:07.030 --> 01:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
joint
 
01:22:11.209 --> 01:22:11.219 align:start position:0%
uh legislative committee on commissions
 
01:22:14.270 --> 01:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
that just meets quarterly and
 
01:22:17.570 --> 01:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
you know is empowered by Statute to
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
do the cutting
 
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
and then it isn't house versus Senate
 
01:22:22.189 --> 01:22:22.199 align:start position:0%
either it's something that we can do
 
01:22:22.199 --> 01:22:24.050 align:start position:0%
either it's something that we can do
together

01:22:24.050 --> 01:22:24.060 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:22:26.209 --> 01:22:26.219 align:start position:0%
can I ask you a question and your
 
01:22:28.729 --> 01:22:28.739 align:start position:0%
suggestion so you're saying not so much
 
01:22:29.930 --> 01:22:29.940 align:start position:0%
to take the time to go through every
 
01:22:33.890 --> 01:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
single one of them to set up a procedure
 
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
going forward and they'll just they'll
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
just automatically either fall off or
 
01:22:39.290 --> 01:22:39.300 align:start position:0%
stay on
 
01:22:41.090 --> 01:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
according to the procedure that we come
 
01:22:43.669 --> 01:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
up with I think that's a way that's a
 
01:22:45.229 --> 01:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
way we could go
 
01:22:47.630 --> 01:22:47.640 align:start position:0%
um which
 
01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
I think that's I think that's impossible
 
01:22:51.709 --> 01:22:51.719 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not saying that's the what
 
01:22:52.729 --> 01:22:52.739 align:start position:0%
we should do but I think we should
 
01:22:54.709 --> 01:22:54.719 align:start position:0%
consider it I like that solution I've
 
01:22:59.149 --> 01:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
plant a plan forward has to be one at a
 
01:23:04.669 --> 01:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
time legislative
 
01:23:06.590 --> 01:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation for each commission
 
01:23:08.630 --> 01:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
that we want to want to kill that's
 
01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's what I've been told because we
 
01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
have to undo what was done in the first
 
01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:13.970 align:start position:0%
have to undo what was done in the first
place

01:23:13.970 --> 01:23:13.980 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:23:16.370 --> 01:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
and that we can't there's there's no
 
01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
Sunset clause or nothing that we can
 
01:23:21.770 --> 01:23:21.780 align:start position:0%
take advantage of now I don't know
 
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh and you might know this but I don't
 
01:23:26.270 --> 01:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
know if if maybe it's we approach the
 
01:23:28.729 --> 01:23:28.739 align:start position:0%
rules committee to say that they can
 
01:23:31.070 --> 01:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
help us come up with
 
01:23:34.970 --> 01:23:34.980 align:start position:0%
language or uh the right to do what
 
01:23:37.070 --> 01:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking about but right now I
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
don't think that right exists but we I'm
 
01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
not sure that it can't exist and I don't
 
01:23:44.630 --> 01:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
know that we can do it in house rules
 
01:23:47.630 --> 01:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
because it we need to involve the senate
 
01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
in some way right so that's where we
 
01:23:51.530 --> 01:23:51.540 align:start position:0%
need we need to figure out how the two
 
01:23:52.970 --> 01:23:52.980 align:start position:0%
come together
 
01:23:52.980 --> 01:23:54.290 align:start position:0%
come together
um

01:23:54.290 --> 01:23:54.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:57.410 --> 01:23:57.420 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am and agree with
 
01:24:00.110 --> 01:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
with Mr leader and thank you Mr chairman
 
01:24:02.990 --> 01:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
um if you if we can take time before our
 
01:24:04.850 --> 01:24:04.860 align:start position:0%
next meeting to read the final reports
 
01:24:06.169 --> 01:24:06.179 align:start position:0%
in here there's some pretty good
 
01:24:09.169 --> 01:24:09.179 align:start position:0%
recommendations the previous committees
 
01:24:12.290 --> 01:24:12.300 align:start position:0%
on commissions came up with and some of
 
01:24:14.689 --> 01:24:14.699 align:start position:0%
what you've spoken with is in there and
 
01:24:16.970 --> 01:24:16.980 align:start position:0%
part of what when you mentioned Sunset
 
01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
Provisions that should be in the
 
01:24:20.510 --> 01:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
original legislation I think OLS has
 
01:24:23.810 --> 01:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
some responsibility here as well
 
01:24:25.790 --> 01:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot they can't do they
 
01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
can't tell us and advise us on previous
 
01:24:32.090 --> 01:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
bills that have been put in but if we
 
01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
read the final reports here
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
um members who are new can get guidance
 
01:24:38.159 --> 01:24:39.530 align:start position:0%
um members who are new can get guidance
from

01:24:39.530 --> 01:24:39.540 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:41.570 align:start position:0%
from
orientation

01:24:41.570 --> 01:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
orientation
 
01:24:43.490 --> 01:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
members who have been here can get
 
01:24:45.649 --> 01:24:45.659 align:start position:0%
guidance from their chairman
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
and go to OLS and these bills can be
 
01:24:50.930 --> 01:24:50.940 align:start position:0%
drafted more specifically I was stunned
 
01:24:54.290 --> 01:24:54.300 align:start position:0%
when I saw some of this to see that some
 
01:24:57.649 --> 01:24:57.659 align:start position:0%
commissions are set up without details I
 
01:25:00.110 --> 01:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
mean when I served on Judiciary we had
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
details for everything and we had Sunset
 
01:25:05.870 --> 01:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
Provisions when it was important and we
 
01:25:09.290 --> 01:25:09.300 align:start position:0%
had specific goals the commissions had
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
to meet
 
01:25:14.030 --> 01:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
so except we ran into that problem as we
 
01:25:15.590 --> 01:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
heard last week with the right to know
 
01:25:17.450 --> 01:25:17.460 align:start position:0%
commission that dragged on and on it was
 
01:25:19.850 --> 01:25:19.860 align:start position:0%
bulky too many people from too many
 
01:25:21.890 --> 01:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
parts of the state never able to get a
 
01:25:24.290 --> 01:25:24.300 align:start position:0%
quorum never able to fulfill their
 
01:25:27.050 --> 01:25:27.060 align:start position:0%
responsibilities but continued so these
 
01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
final reports have some very helpful
 
01:25:32.030 --> 01:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
information and we can build upon that I
 
01:25:34.850 --> 01:25:34.860 align:start position:0%
think yeah I I agree I I one of the
 
01:25:36.950 --> 01:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
things when we get ready to tackle the
 
01:25:38.510 --> 01:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
process pieces
 
01:25:41.209 --> 01:25:41.219 align:start position:0%
uh I've already spoken to the OLS
 
01:25:43.610 --> 01:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
attorneys and what they can they said
 
01:25:46.130 --> 01:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
they could do they're a little nervous
 
01:25:48.590 --> 01:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
but what they could do is they could
 
01:25:50.209 --> 01:25:50.219 align:start position:0%
they could come up with statutory
 
01:25:50.219 --> 01:25:51.470 align:start position:0%
they could come up with statutory
language

01:25:51.470 --> 01:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:25:53.630 --> 01:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
that would serve as a template
 
01:25:56.450 --> 01:25:56.460 align:start position:0%
that a legislate legislators that come
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
to them say I want to uh study
 
01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
Commission on such and such they'd be
 
01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
material they would be handed back to
 
01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:06.780 align:start position:0%
them they that well we've been asked to
 
01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:10.020 align:start position:0%
supply you with a template of how this
 
01:26:12.590 --> 01:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
has to work and have Sunset Clauses in
 
01:26:14.689 --> 01:26:14.699 align:start position:0%
it and all that stuff so
 
01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
I've already talked to them about that
 
01:26:18.169 --> 01:26:18.179 align:start position:0%
but that's something as a group we'd
 
01:26:20.209 --> 01:26:20.219 align:start position:0%
have to decide that we want to do that
 
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
and what that step that template might
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
look like yeah now you want that yeah I
 
01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
and I really like that idea I also think
 
01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:31.310 align:start position:0%
and I really like that idea I also think
that

01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:33.410 --> 01:26:33.420 align:start position:0%
um even though in order to take action
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
on each of these
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
commissions you'd have to do it
 
01:26:40.430 --> 01:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
individually I wonder if we could we
 
01:26:41.570 --> 01:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
could create
 
01:26:44.209 --> 01:26:44.219 align:start position:0%
and maybe this is a question for OLS
 
01:26:48.110 --> 01:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
could we once we've we've decided on the
 
01:26:49.550 --> 01:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
template for how things are going to
 
01:26:53.209 --> 01:26:53.219 align:start position:0%
work moving forward can we adjust all
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
the existing commissions
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:26:59.530 --> 01:26:59.540 align:start position:0%
those same
 
01:27:01.610 --> 01:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
requirements are applied to the ones
 
01:27:03.890 --> 01:27:03.900 align:start position:0%
that already exist and so I think it's
 
01:27:06.229 --> 01:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
in my mind it would be a single Bill
 
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
something like a 1449 adjustment
 
01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and it just goes through and
 
01:27:13.370 --> 01:27:13.380 align:start position:0%
it says here are the changes that we're
 
01:27:14.689 --> 01:27:14.699 align:start position:0%
making to each of the commissions
 
01:27:16.430 --> 01:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
because some of them may already have it
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
I mean it's a lot of work but what it
 
01:27:29.090 --> 01:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:30.610 --> 01:27:30.620 align:start position:0%
very easily
 
01:27:34.310 --> 01:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
as a group decide that we want to
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
kill we want to repeal I just changed my
 
01:27:40.250 --> 01:27:40.260 align:start position:0%
life if you want to repeal these 30
 
01:27:43.070 --> 01:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
commissions and we and we all agree if
 
01:27:45.010 --> 01:27:45.020 align:start position:0%
it's a 10 to nothing vote
 
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
in the second consent calendar
 
01:27:50.270 --> 01:27:50.280 align:start position:0%
it would happen pretty fast now would it
 
01:27:51.709 --> 01:27:51.719 align:start position:0%
go through the Senate
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's another question do we have
 
01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors and all that stuff they're
 
01:27:58.370 --> 01:27:58.380 align:start position:0%
there but that would that's also
 
01:28:01.129 --> 01:28:01.139 align:start position:0%
available to us as a consent calendar so
 
01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
we don't have to take this to a Fluff a
 
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
flawed discussion
 
01:28:08.810 --> 01:28:08.820 align:start position:0%
and somebody for you know that sponsors
 
01:28:11.570 --> 01:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
uh one of the Indian tribes gets all
 
01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
emotional about it that uh say
 
01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
you you know you watch the speaker is
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
there do we have a motion to accept the
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
consent calendar boom it's a ton but
 
01:28:27.290 --> 01:28:27.300 align:start position:0%
not that we want to be sneaky about it
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
but that's that is available to us with
 
01:28:31.490 --> 01:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
a lot less arguments yes yes sir and I
 
01:28:33.110 --> 01:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
also think that we could come to the
 
01:28:35.570 --> 01:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
conclusion that we want to put
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
these changes into the existing statutes
 
01:28:41.930 --> 01:28:41.940 align:start position:0%
and that then puts all every Commission
 
01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
on notice to say you need to meet these
 
01:28:44.689 --> 01:28:44.699 align:start position:0%
minimum requirements so that we don't
 
01:28:46.669 --> 01:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
need to put repeal
 
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:48.719 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't need to be the ones
 
01:28:50.750 --> 01:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
deciding on which ones to reveal that
 
01:28:53.330 --> 01:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
there's some self-selection or if we see
 
01:28:55.370 --> 01:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
that there it makes sense to merge some
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
of these or I don't know what the other
 
01:29:00.530 --> 01:29:00.540 align:start position:0%
you know legislative remedies might be
 
01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:01.970 align:start position:0%
you know legislative remedies might be
but

01:29:01.970 --> 01:29:01.980 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
um it allows us to do that and I hope
 
01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
that we could come to a strong
 
01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
bipartisan consensus I think so too I I
 
01:29:12.070 --> 01:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
think that uh
 
01:29:16.510 --> 01:29:16.520 align:start position:0%
in fact a lot of the uh
 
01:29:20.149 --> 01:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of the uh selection to be on this
 
01:29:21.890 --> 01:29:21.900 align:start position:0%
committee was
 
01:29:25.850 --> 01:29:25.860 align:start position:0%
having a bipartisan uh predisposition
 
01:29:28.490 --> 01:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
going into it so that's
 
01:29:30.770 --> 01:29:30.780 align:start position:0%
that's a compliment to you all it was
 
01:29:32.270 --> 01:29:32.280 align:start position:0%
you were thought in that that regard yes
 
01:29:34.490 --> 01:29:34.500 align:start position:0%
John okay thank you Mr chair uh going
 
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
along with representative wilhelm's idea
 
01:29:38.930 --> 01:29:38.940 align:start position:0%
I was I was going through this and I
 
01:29:40.189 --> 01:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
actually was sitting there online
 
01:29:42.770 --> 01:29:42.780 align:start position:0%
looking at some of the bills and making
 
01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
up like a checklist on basically how you
 
01:29:47.390 --> 01:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
do a presentation who what why where
 
01:29:49.790 --> 01:29:49.800 align:start position:0%
when how you know all those questions
 
01:29:52.010 --> 01:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
and you look through the through these
 
01:29:54.229 --> 01:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
commissions they don't answer all the
 
01:29:56.450 --> 01:29:56.460 align:start position:0%
questions and like I said use the
 
01:29:59.030 --> 01:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
standard create a standard form and if
 
01:30:01.790 --> 01:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
they don't answer the questions
 
01:30:03.950 --> 01:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
fill out the fill out the form so they
 
01:30:06.050 --> 01:30:06.060 align:start position:0%
do it they do answer the questions you
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
know when do they meet who is it why why
 
01:30:09.770 --> 01:30:09.780 align:start position:0%
are they there what are they doing
 
01:30:11.930 --> 01:30:11.940 align:start position:0%
what's their Charter how are they doing
 
01:30:13.729 --> 01:30:13.739 align:start position:0%
it do they meet every month do they meet
 
01:30:15.050 --> 01:30:15.060 align:start position:0%
every quarter
 
01:30:17.209 --> 01:30:17.219 align:start position:0%
it it'll and they'll answer all that
 
01:30:18.950 --> 01:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
you'll have a checklist that everybody
 
01:30:21.890 --> 01:30:21.900 align:start position:0%
can go through as they if they want to
 
01:30:23.330 --> 01:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
create a commission you know is it
 
01:30:25.370 --> 01:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
sunset right right on the bottom is it
 
01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
sunsetting yes it must be sunset and or
 
01:30:30.890 --> 01:30:30.900 align:start position:0%
it must be like a five-year review if
 
01:30:32.990 --> 01:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
it's a really good commission you go
 
01:30:35.209 --> 01:30:35.219 align:start position:0%
into review and you know you justify
 
01:30:36.950 --> 01:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
what you're doing and say okay you're
 
01:30:39.050 --> 01:30:39.060 align:start position:0%
good for another five years you know
 
01:30:40.189 --> 01:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
like some of these commissions are
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
really really important and they do good
 
01:30:44.090 --> 01:30:44.100 align:start position:0%
work but the some of the ones that are
 
01:30:46.610 --> 01:30:46.620 align:start position:0%
that are like uh you know one year two
 
01:30:49.189 --> 01:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
year they have a specific very tight
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
question that they're answering and
 
01:30:52.610 --> 01:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
they're done
 
01:30:54.770 --> 01:30:54.780 align:start position:0%
so yeah I think that's a great idea I'm
 
01:30:57.050 --> 01:30:57.060 align:start position:0%
almost I'm a big fan of standardization
 
01:31:01.010 --> 01:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
so that would definitely fill the bill
 
01:31:04.490 --> 01:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:05.629 --> 01:31:05.639 align:start position:0%
and it's evil
 
01:31:07.129 --> 01:31:07.139 align:start position:0%
I mean she's
 
01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:09.540 align:start position:0%
she's already gone through this several
 
01:31:12.590 --> 01:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
terms in maybe when she's here the next
 
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
meeting she probably has a good idea
 
01:31:17.510 --> 01:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
which ones should be repealed which ones
 
01:31:20.930 --> 01:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
should stay so yeah I think that getting
 
01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
her input yeah
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
this uh meeting today early
 
01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:27.530 align:start position:0%
this uh meeting today early
uh

01:31:27.530 --> 01:31:27.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:31:29.090 --> 01:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
but I think
 
01:31:32.270 --> 01:31:32.280 align:start position:0%
per the next time if she comes next time
 
01:31:34.370 --> 01:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
let's have an understanding that we're
 
01:31:35.870 --> 01:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
probably going to go run over because
 
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to spend spend some time
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
going through the things that she's we
 
01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
need to take advantage of her
 
01:31:45.890 --> 01:31:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:48.169 --> 01:31:48.179 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna try a Target that we get out
 
01:31:51.229 --> 01:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
of here by noon today anybody reject to
 
01:31:54.290 --> 01:31:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:55.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:31:55.310 --> 01:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:57.410 --> 01:31:57.420 align:start position:0%
so you guys you guys
 
01:31:59.870 --> 01:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
our assistants here you guys understand
 
01:32:04.370 --> 01:32:04.380 align:start position:0%
what we're looking for uh and is are we
 
01:32:06.530 --> 01:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
being reasonable that that by next
 
01:32:08.510 --> 01:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
Monday we could have something to look
 
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
at oh two weeks school vacation week
 
01:32:14.570 --> 01:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
well that's a good question do we do we
 
01:32:18.590 --> 01:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
want to skip a week and meet in two
 
01:32:19.729 --> 01:32:19.739 align:start position:0%
weeks so do we want to try to find
 
01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
another day
 
01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:25.010 align:start position:0%
another day
yeah

01:32:25.010 --> 01:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:27.110 --> 01:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
okay so we made first to be our next
 
01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:29.030 align:start position:0%
okay so we made first to be our next
meeting

01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:32:32.209 --> 01:32:32.219 align:start position:0%
and I will be late I told you when is
 
01:32:34.010 --> 01:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
the worst day I have standing
 
01:32:36.530 --> 01:32:36.540 align:start position:0%
appointments Monday mornings so we made
 
01:32:39.290 --> 01:32:39.300 align:start position:0%
me eat longer and I'll still be here
 
01:32:44.390 --> 01:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
yes yeah I would say on May 1st plan on
 
01:32:45.850 --> 01:32:45.860 align:start position:0%
maybe two o'clock
 
01:32:48.590 --> 01:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
until two yeah I think it's gonna be a
 
01:32:51.229 --> 01:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
lot of long morning
 
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I I've spoken to Karen a
 
01:32:54.830 --> 01:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
couple of times
 
01:32:58.129 --> 01:32:58.139 align:start position:0%
uh informally and she's
 
01:33:00.290 --> 01:33:00.300 align:start position:0%
she's bubbling over with all kinds of
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
information that we can take advantage
 
01:33:01.920 --> 01:33:03.229 align:start position:0%
information that we can take advantage
of

01:33:03.229 --> 01:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:33:04.610 --> 01:33:04.620 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am
 
01:33:06.169 --> 01:33:06.179 align:start position:0%
um we have a little time I know but I
 
01:33:08.330 --> 01:33:08.340 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask if
 
01:33:10.129 --> 01:33:10.139 align:start position:0%
are there assignments that we think we
 
01:33:12.169 --> 01:33:12.179 align:start position:0%
could be working on in the interim are
 
01:33:14.330 --> 01:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
there things as Mr chairman there are
 
01:33:15.649 --> 01:33:15.659 align:start position:0%
tasks you'd like any of us to be
 
01:33:15.659 --> 01:33:16.790 align:start position:0%
tasks you'd like any of us to be
particularly

01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
01:33:19.370 --> 01:33:19.380 align:start position:0%
giving thought or drafting I don't I
 
01:33:20.270 --> 01:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
don't know if we're there yet I was
 
01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
thinking in the two weeks or are there
 
01:33:23.930 --> 01:33:23.940 align:start position:0%
things we could be doing well I
 
01:33:26.629 --> 01:33:26.639 align:start position:0%
uh yes and no first of all it's
 
01:33:28.430 --> 01:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
important for us to become intimately
 
01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
familiar with the three ring buying is
 
01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
in front of us to go through I mean we
 
01:33:36.590 --> 01:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
were giving it to us last week and
 
01:33:39.350 --> 01:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully over the past weekend we we
 
01:33:42.169 --> 01:33:42.179 align:start position:0%
flipped through it but I think we need
 
01:33:45.410 --> 01:33:45.420 align:start position:0%
to get an intimate knowledge of of it
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
write down the questions that you have
 
01:33:50.990 --> 01:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
in in the margins and come to the next
 
01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
meeting ready to ask you questions of
 
01:33:58.070 --> 01:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
our researchers and our more experienced
 
01:34:01.970 --> 01:34:01.980 align:start position:0%
members like like Karen
 
01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
that have been through the company when
 
01:34:05.450 --> 01:34:05.460 align:start position:0%
I think representative wall you've been
 
01:34:07.490 --> 01:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
through some degree yes I just want to
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
add on that please do take time it
 
01:34:11.390 --> 01:34:11.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't take that long to read through
 
01:34:13.729 --> 01:34:13.739 align:start position:0%
this notebook and those final reports of
 
01:34:15.770 --> 01:34:15.780 align:start position:0%
very very helpful
 
01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
and that can help us develop our
 
01:34:20.930 --> 01:34:20.940 align:start position:0%
concepts of where we might want to go
 
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
because they have laid out some
 
01:34:24.709 --> 01:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
groundwork some of which as I said has
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
been good and has been followed through
 
01:34:29.689 --> 01:34:29.699 align:start position:0%
and some of which it's just been out
 
01:34:32.090 --> 01:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
there and no one's done much so I must
 
01:34:34.129 --> 01:34:34.139 align:start position:0%
have been so very helpful thank you I'm
 
01:34:37.250 --> 01:34:37.260 align:start position:0%
sorry to your question I think that if
 
01:34:39.709 --> 01:34:39.719 align:start position:0%
any of us have some real solid ideas
 
01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
about process changes to start making
 
01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
note of those and bring them with you to
 
01:34:48.050 --> 01:34:48.060 align:start position:0%
the next meeting about
 
01:34:50.450 --> 01:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
what do you do when you sit with uh with
 
01:34:53.330 --> 01:34:53.340 align:start position:0%
OLS and you're trying to start up a
 
01:34:56.450 --> 01:34:56.460 align:start position:0%
commission uh what do we do when we
 
01:34:58.490 --> 01:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
think we want to repeal something
 
01:35:00.410 --> 01:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
what are the steps what are the six
 
01:35:02.570 --> 01:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
steps we go through in order to appeal
 
01:35:06.169 --> 01:35:06.179 align:start position:0%
uh getting information getting
 
01:35:08.709 --> 01:35:08.719 align:start position:0%
current members to testify
 
01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
uh so and the other thing to think about
 
01:35:15.530 --> 01:35:15.540 align:start position:0%
is when our assistants bring us back
 
01:35:15.540 --> 01:35:16.790 align:start position:0%
is when our assistants bring us back
that

01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
that spreadsheet was that has all the
 
01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:20.930 align:start position:0%
that spreadsheet was that has all the
mapping

01:35:20.930 --> 01:35:20.940 align:start position:0%
mapping
 
01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
in it what do we want to do next do we
 
01:35:24.770 --> 01:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:35:26.810 --> 01:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
bring those committee chairs in to talk
 
01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
to them one at a time or two or three at
 
01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
a time or uh
 
01:35:35.030 --> 01:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
or what you know what do we do with the
 
01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
information that we're about to get so
 
01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
we don't have to wait a meeting to
 
01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:38.870 align:start position:0%
we don't have to wait a meeting to
decide

01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
decide
 
01:35:41.689 --> 01:35:41.699 align:start position:0%
to think about it so I would say come to
 
01:35:44.090 --> 01:35:44.100 align:start position:0%
the the uh the meeting in the first
 
01:35:47.629 --> 01:35:47.639 align:start position:0%
meeting in May with those thoughts uh
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
matured a little bit uh say well I think
 
01:35:51.709 --> 01:35:51.719 align:start position:0%
we ought to do this this and this and
 
01:35:53.510 --> 01:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
then we then we can talk about it and we
 
01:35:55.189 --> 01:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
can make some decisions as opposed to
 
01:35:58.729 --> 01:35:58.739 align:start position:0%
just uh initiating discussion
 
01:36:02.570 --> 01:36:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
it almost sounds like for our thinking
 
01:36:07.129 --> 01:36:07.139 align:start position:0%
purposes having like a float if I I
 
01:36:08.209 --> 01:36:08.219 align:start position:0%
might try to play around with it like
 
01:36:10.729 --> 01:36:10.739 align:start position:0%
coming up with a rough flow chart you
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
know for those sorts of questions any of
 
01:36:18.430 --> 01:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:21.169 --> 01:36:21.179 align:start position:0%
process issues
 
01:36:27.290 --> 01:36:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:29.810 --> 01:36:29.820 align:start position:0%
and it has the
 
01:36:32.390 --> 01:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
has the commission been
 
01:36:34.729 --> 01:36:34.739 align:start position:0%
sponsored by the
 
01:36:38.450 --> 01:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
Senate yes I know if it's if it answers
 
01:36:40.850 --> 01:36:40.860 align:start position:0%
yes you know who sponsored it and then
 
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
we get a Target if we're gonna go
 
01:36:45.410 --> 01:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
uh kill
 
01:36:47.450 --> 01:36:47.460 align:start position:0%
uh repeal
 
01:36:50.090 --> 01:36:50.100 align:start position:0%
Tom Sherman's committee we better go
 
01:36:52.250 --> 01:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
talk to him first and that ought to be
 
01:36:53.870 --> 01:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
in the list of things to do in the
 
01:36:55.669 --> 01:36:55.679 align:start position:0%
decision tree have you spoken to the
 
01:36:58.970 --> 01:36:58.980 align:start position:0%
sponsor or whatever because we don't
 
01:37:00.229 --> 01:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
want to go through all that effort and
 
01:37:03.770 --> 01:37:03.780 align:start position:0%
have him uh talk to his his comrades in
 
01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
the Senate and say we want to kill this
 
01:37:07.729 --> 01:37:07.739 align:start position:0%
thing coming over from the house oh our
 
01:37:10.010 --> 01:37:10.020 align:start position:0%
time will be wasted I'd rather spend it
 
01:37:11.870 --> 01:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
on something that
 
01:37:14.149 --> 01:37:14.159 align:start position:0%
more likely to pass than something we
 
01:37:16.010 --> 01:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
know is going to get killed
 
01:37:20.149 --> 01:37:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:23.930 --> 01:37:23.940 align:start position:0%
yes John uh also uh I agree with you
 
01:37:25.550 --> 01:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
that you should read through this which
 
01:37:27.890 --> 01:37:27.900 align:start position:0%
I did that's why I was wandering through
 
01:37:30.229 --> 01:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
it and things that were of interest to
 
01:37:31.850 --> 01:37:31.860 align:start position:0%
you know each of us you know pick out
 
01:37:34.970 --> 01:37:34.980 align:start position:0%
okay legislative youth advisory Council
 
01:37:37.370 --> 01:37:37.380 align:start position:0%
take a look at what it is and see who's
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
on it and it says keep amend appointing
 
01:37:44.209 --> 01:37:44.219 align:start position:0%
languages and see if there's
 
01:37:46.189 --> 01:37:46.199 align:start position:0%
places in there where it can be amended
 
01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
that's where uh represented evil is
 
01:37:49.669 --> 01:37:49.679 align:start position:0%
going to be able to help us because
 
01:37:51.830 --> 01:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
she's probably got a whole
 
01:37:54.110 --> 01:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
list well what's what our researchers
 
01:37:55.729 --> 01:37:55.739 align:start position:0%
are going to help us
 
01:37:58.550 --> 01:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
that that's all potentially old data
 
01:38:01.129 --> 01:38:01.139 align:start position:0%
yeah uh there's a another spreadsheet
 
01:38:02.810 --> 01:38:02.820 align:start position:0%
well I got I got you know I got I got
 
01:38:04.669 --> 01:38:04.679 align:start position:0%
both of everybody because on that
 
01:38:04.679 --> 01:38:06.350 align:start position:0%
both of everybody because on that
spreadsheet

01:38:06.350 --> 01:38:06.360 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet
 
01:38:08.689 --> 01:38:08.699 align:start position:0%
this position may have already been made
 
01:38:10.669 --> 01:38:10.679 align:start position:0%
yes something may have been and it
 
01:38:12.649 --> 01:38:12.659 align:start position:0%
decided to be kept or decided to be
 
01:38:14.629 --> 01:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
repealed and they would if it's been
 
01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
repealed it would have should have
 
01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
fallen off this spreadsheet a couple of
 
01:38:20.990 --> 01:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
tabs down so we don't want to spend a
 
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
lot of time on something that's already
 
01:38:24.490 --> 01:38:24.500 align:start position:0%
been repealed
 
01:38:30.050 --> 01:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
agree but see if if it says uh
 
01:38:32.209 --> 01:38:32.219 align:start position:0%
amend to designate one of the house
 
01:38:35.330 --> 01:38:35.340 align:start position:0%
members from Public Works assistant 2016
 
01:38:38.030 --> 01:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
and see you know just go in and see was
 
01:38:39.470 --> 01:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
it done
 
01:38:41.090 --> 01:38:41.100 align:start position:0%
you know and if it wasn't make you can
 
01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
make a little list
 
01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
yeah with Cameron's with Cameron uh
 
01:38:48.229 --> 01:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
expertise on this
 
01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
I agree
 
01:38:52.010 --> 01:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
but like I said I sit there nothing
 
01:38:54.050 --> 01:38:54.060 align:start position:0%
better to do and just go in and look at
 
01:38:58.490 --> 01:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am
 
01:39:04.070 --> 01:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you I think too some of those um
 
01:39:05.450 --> 01:39:05.460 align:start position:0%
things that you're talking about those
 
01:39:07.850 --> 01:39:07.860 align:start position:0%
amendments in repeal I think we'll find
 
01:39:09.850 --> 01:39:09.860 align:start position:0%
in um
 
01:39:13.850 --> 01:39:13.860 align:start position:0%
1269 that's right behind those reports I
 
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
think instead of instead of doing all
 
01:39:17.629 --> 01:39:17.639 align:start position:0%
that in separate bills it looks like
 
01:39:19.910 --> 01:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
they've tried to do a lot of it in the
 
01:39:21.770 --> 01:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
same bill
 
01:39:21.780 --> 01:39:23.149 align:start position:0%
same bill
so

01:39:23.149 --> 01:39:23.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:25.669 --> 01:39:25.679 align:start position:0%
we can probably even cross-reference for
 
01:39:25.679 --> 01:39:27.530 align:start position:0%
we can probably even cross-reference for
ourselves

01:39:27.530 --> 01:39:27.540 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
01:39:27.540 --> 01:39:28.189 align:start position:0%
ourselves
um

01:39:28.189 --> 01:39:28.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:30.110 --> 01:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
you know like
 
01:39:31.790 --> 01:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
there's stuff about the public water
 
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
access Advisory Board the legislative
 
01:39:36.470 --> 01:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
oversight committee on delivery of Life
 
01:39:38.510 --> 01:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
Services they tried to kind of put all
 
01:39:41.209 --> 01:39:41.219 align:start position:0%
that stuff into 1269.
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
so that would be a helpful way to see
 
01:39:45.590 --> 01:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
that they
 
01:39:47.629 --> 01:39:47.639 align:start position:0%
went through and tried to make the
 
01:39:50.090 --> 01:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
changes that were recommended in that
 
01:39:53.270 --> 01:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
previous report too right and what Karen
 
01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
can help us with is I try to do just
 
01:39:59.209 --> 01:39:59.219 align:start position:0%
that on this particular bill it didn't
 
01:40:00.830 --> 01:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
work because of
 
01:40:03.410 --> 01:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
I ran into a stone wall with this
 
01:40:05.209 --> 01:40:05.219 align:start position:0%
particular commit you know those types
 
01:40:07.850 --> 01:40:07.860 align:start position:0%
of insights that will be very valuable
 
01:40:12.290 --> 01:40:12.300 align:start position:0%
to us to help us be guided as to how
 
01:40:13.790 --> 01:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to attack an issue because
 
01:40:15.890 --> 01:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
if those stone walls are still present
 
01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's going to be my advice to the
 
01:40:19.910 --> 01:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
committee as we walk around the stone
 
01:40:22.689 --> 01:40:22.699 align:start position:0%
wall and work on something else
 
01:40:25.430 --> 01:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
right but I don't want to I don't think
 
01:40:27.530 --> 01:40:27.540 align:start position:0%
we should spend our time banging our
 
01:40:30.110 --> 01:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
head on this stuff on the wall
 
01:40:32.689 --> 01:40:32.699 align:start position:0%
that's why I said I think yet last week
 
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
if there are
 
01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
what I called sacred cows probably a bad
 
01:40:39.110 --> 01:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
term there are those types of things
 
01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:40.189 align:start position:0%
term there are those types of things
that

01:40:40.189 --> 01:40:40.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
one caucus versus the other decides this
 
01:40:45.110 --> 01:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
is really important to our caucus that
 
01:40:46.610 --> 01:40:46.620 align:start position:0%
we just leave it alone and let it stay
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
and not to fight it then
 
01:40:50.810 --> 01:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
there's enough
 
01:40:53.649 --> 01:40:53.659 align:start position:0%
for us to work on without
 
01:40:55.550 --> 01:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
getting into a fight with each other
 
01:40:57.410 --> 01:40:57.420 align:start position:0%
they'll be curious to the neighboring to
 
01:40:59.209 --> 01:40:59.219 align:start position:0%
see and I'm not as knowledgeable yet
 
01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
about what which of those commit which
 
01:41:03.530 --> 01:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
committees those may be but also if they
 
01:41:05.209 --> 01:41:05.219 align:start position:0%
actually have been meeting or have had
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
enough memory you know they're ideally
 
01:41:08.810 --> 01:41:08.820 align:start position:0%
if they're important if they are those
 
01:41:10.070 --> 01:41:10.080 align:start position:0%
sorts of importance they have actually
 
01:41:12.290 --> 01:41:12.300 align:start position:0%
been getting towards those goals but
 
01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
we'll see I guess
 
01:41:16.189 --> 01:41:16.199 align:start position:0%
um from Karen's notes especially I know
 
01:41:18.649 --> 01:41:18.659 align:start position:0%
there was for as an example there was
 
01:41:22.129 --> 01:41:22.139 align:start position:0%
there was a one I'm on Matt and I are
 
01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
both on Edna as a second committee I
 
01:41:25.970 --> 01:41:25.980 align:start position:0%
don't know how many euros that's at
 
01:41:29.090 --> 01:41:29.100 align:start position:0%
least one additional one that we're on
 
01:41:32.510 --> 01:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
we came up uh an issue of a study
 
01:41:34.129 --> 01:41:34.139 align:start position:0%
Commission on
 
01:41:36.229 --> 01:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
um statistics
 
01:41:36.239 --> 01:41:37.729 align:start position:0%
um statistics
about

01:41:37.729 --> 01:41:37.739 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:41:39.649 --> 01:41:39.659 align:start position:0%
uh race
 
01:41:42.590 --> 01:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
background and all that stuff that it's
 
01:41:45.470 --> 01:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
a it's it's been around for a while but
 
01:41:48.410 --> 01:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
we also found that UNH does all this
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
work for us for free and I said let's
 
01:41:54.169 --> 01:41:54.179 align:start position:0%
let them do it and not employ a study
 
01:41:56.990 --> 01:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
commission to do that so that we we
 
01:41:59.930 --> 01:41:59.940 align:start position:0%
repealed that in the in committee that I
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
think I'm not sure the status I think
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
it's made it through
 
01:42:06.050 --> 01:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar I don't know
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh status with the Senate what they did
 
01:42:11.209 --> 01:42:11.219 align:start position:0%
with it if anything yet but those are
 
01:42:13.250 --> 01:42:13.260 align:start position:0%
the types of things that I think
 
01:42:16.010 --> 01:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
you know those are in my view
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
no-brainers but they may be emotional
 
01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
for somebody to say hey wait a minute
 
01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to get the data it's just
 
01:42:23.870 --> 01:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
going to come this in this case from the
 
01:42:27.290 --> 01:42:27.300 align:start position:0%
from UNH uh as opposed to uh
 
01:42:29.530 --> 01:42:29.540 align:start position:0%
a legislative committee
 
01:42:32.810 --> 01:42:32.820 align:start position:0%
I I just think the makeup of this
 
01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
committee given in the term that we're
 
01:42:37.550 --> 01:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
in and the you know the equal numbers of
 
01:42:39.410 --> 01:42:39.420 align:start position:0%
Republicans and Democrats is a really
 
01:42:41.450 --> 01:42:41.460 align:start position:0%
exciting opportunity for us to really
 
01:42:44.030 --> 01:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
zero in on the ones that need to be
 
01:42:47.149 --> 01:42:47.159 align:start position:0%
right right you know removed so if we do
 
01:42:48.770 --> 01:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
make that decision I'm confident that
 
01:42:51.890 --> 01:42:51.900 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to you know discern these
 
01:42:52.850 --> 01:42:52.860 align:start position:0%
are the ones that we shouldn't be
 
01:42:55.189 --> 01:42:55.199 align:start position:0%
touching because frankly
 
01:42:58.430 --> 01:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
you know it may it may result in an
 
01:43:01.250 --> 01:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
entire caucus deciding to oppose right
 
01:43:03.410 --> 01:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
what we put forward
 
01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
um and if there's something on the
 
01:43:06.229 --> 01:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
Democratic side that they've got a
 
01:43:07.430 --> 01:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
problem with and problem on the
 
01:43:08.930 --> 01:43:08.940 align:start position:0%
Republican side they have a problem with
 
01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
then all of our work is going to be for
 
01:43:12.890 --> 01:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
not right right it's going to
 
01:43:20.990 --> 01:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:25.010 --> 01:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
okay uh any final thoughts yes uh Jim
 
01:43:28.129 --> 01:43:28.139 align:start position:0%
you had something uh yeah but so so I
 
01:43:30.590 --> 01:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
want to add that
 
01:43:32.649 --> 01:43:32.659 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:43:36.169 --> 01:43:36.179 align:start position:0%
possibility of a commit of a of a
 
01:43:38.930 --> 01:43:38.940 align:start position:0%
committee or commission being repealed
 
01:43:41.570 --> 01:43:41.580 align:start position:0%
um may be enough to prompt
 
01:43:45.169 --> 01:43:45.179 align:start position:0%
some action to get it back in gear so I
 
01:43:48.109 --> 01:43:48.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate and agree with what you said
 
01:43:50.330 --> 01:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
um but I also think that we need to say
 
01:43:53.090 --> 01:43:53.100 align:start position:0%
that for those that are being maintained
 
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
going forward there's going to be an
 
01:43:58.370 --> 01:43:58.380 align:start position:0%
expectation that those those committees
 
01:44:02.750 --> 01:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:05.330 --> 01:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
anywhere if this processes are saying
 
01:44:07.189 --> 01:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
look it might be
 
01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
even happen and it triggers people to
 
01:44:11.810 --> 01:44:11.820 align:start position:0%
get back into action I mean that's right
 
01:44:13.850 --> 01:44:13.860 align:start position:0%
you know so I do really like the idea of
 
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
bringing in the statutory committee
 
01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
chairs in some way just because I mean I
 
01:44:19.430 --> 01:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
I can only speak to Transportation but I
 
01:44:20.689 --> 01:44:20.699 align:start position:0%
feel like when
 
01:44:23.629 --> 01:44:23.639 align:start position:0%
we have bills in front of us that seem
 
01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
stuck on it's like well let's maybe
 
01:44:27.290 --> 01:44:27.300 align:start position:0%
we'll make a study committee uh and and
 
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
I think our chair is pretty cognizant of
 
01:44:31.609 --> 01:44:31.619 align:start position:0%
trying to say let's not do a throwaway
 
01:44:33.530 --> 01:44:33.540 align:start position:0%
here but I think the more buy-in we have
 
01:44:34.970 --> 01:44:34.980 align:start position:0%
from Community chairs and I realized
 
01:44:37.609 --> 01:44:37.619 align:start position:0%
chairmanships change but
 
01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:39.719 align:start position:0%
um I think will benefit committee work
 
01:44:41.689 --> 01:44:41.699 align:start position:0%
too in terms of
 
01:44:43.250 --> 01:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
whether Community Health committees
 
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
really weigh is this worth do we need
 
01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
a study committee here um
 
01:44:49.850 --> 01:44:49.860 align:start position:0%
I just think having that communication
 
01:44:52.669 --> 01:44:52.679 align:start position:0%
would be productive right I I think that
 
01:44:55.790 --> 01:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh you're right I and I think that
 
01:44:58.790 --> 01:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
too often we use
 
01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:00.109 align:start position:0%
too often we use
study

01:45:00.109 --> 01:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh committees or commissions as a as a
 
01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:05.270 align:start position:0%
uh committees or commissions as a as a
disposition

01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
disposition
 
01:45:07.669 --> 01:45:07.679 align:start position:0%
that allows us to walk away from
 
01:45:10.129 --> 01:45:10.139 align:start position:0%
something with without much pain
 
01:45:12.530 --> 01:45:12.540 align:start position:0%
but yet that thing lingers on for us
 
01:45:16.669 --> 01:45:16.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes years uh and it's it's a it's
 
01:45:19.550 --> 01:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
a mindset and again if we if we get some
 
01:45:21.649 --> 01:45:21.659 align:start position:0%
accountability with the committee
 
01:45:24.229 --> 01:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
chairman that if if they're gonna elect
 
01:45:26.330 --> 01:45:26.340 align:start position:0%
something in their committee go into a
 
01:45:28.430 --> 01:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
study and they're going to have to
 
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
manage it that may be less likely to do
 
01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:32.870 align:start position:0%
manage it that may be less likely to do
it

01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:45:34.430 --> 01:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
gives them
 
01:45:36.410 --> 01:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
I want to see cover but it gives them a
 
01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
basis just just
 
01:45:39.709 --> 01:45:39.719 align:start position:0%
set those expectations in committee and
 
01:45:41.450 --> 01:45:41.460 align:start position:0%
say look I you know
 
01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
if I'm going to support those or want us
 
01:45:45.590 --> 01:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
to move forward with this these are the
 
01:45:47.330 --> 01:45:47.340 align:start position:0%
standards we're gonna have to meet their
 
01:45:49.490 --> 01:45:49.500 align:start position:0%
accountability standards now you know
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
maybe there were different than they
 
01:45:53.830 --> 01:45:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:55.550 align:start position:0%
 
exactly

01:45:55.550 --> 01:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
01:45:59.090 --> 01:45:59.100 align:start position:0%
John you anything you want to add
 
01:46:02.930 --> 01:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
I always have something I was I was I
 
01:46:04.669 --> 01:46:04.679 align:start position:0%
was thinking
 
01:46:08.330 --> 01:46:08.340 align:start position:0%
it's now on some of the Committees that
 
01:46:11.330 --> 01:46:11.340 align:start position:0%
you know are a little sketchy
 
01:46:13.550 --> 01:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
you know don't come you know invite him
 
01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:14.750 align:start position:0%
you know don't come you know invite him
in

01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:16.370 align:start position:0%
in
and

01:46:16.370 --> 01:46:16.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:18.530 --> 01:46:18.540 align:start position:0%
ask the chairman
 
01:46:20.149 --> 01:46:20.159 align:start position:0%
how are things going
 
01:46:22.129 --> 01:46:22.139 align:start position:0%
do you guys need any help
 
01:46:24.350 --> 01:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
do you need us to do something to help
 
01:46:26.450 --> 01:46:26.460 align:start position:0%
you be successful
 
01:46:28.609 --> 01:46:28.619 align:start position:0%
you know don't point a finger you know
 
01:46:31.790 --> 01:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
give them a hand give them a handout
 
01:46:34.609 --> 01:46:34.619 align:start position:0%
to see and maybe they'll go yeah we you
 
01:46:37.010 --> 01:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
know the members don't come uh you know
 
01:46:38.570 --> 01:46:38.580 align:start position:0%
we have an agenda that we'd like to
 
01:46:41.090 --> 01:46:41.100 align:start position:0%
accomplish but nobody comes to the
 
01:46:44.870 --> 01:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
meetings and how and how can we help you
 
01:46:46.970 --> 01:46:46.980 align:start position:0%
become more successful now they had the
 
01:46:48.530 --> 01:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
guy might the chair might be really
 
01:46:51.709 --> 01:46:51.719 align:start position:0%
driven but nobody wants to work nobody
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
wants to do stuff so let's help them
 
01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:55.679 align:start position:0%
become successful
 
01:46:58.430 --> 01:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
instead of you know no they're not doing
 
01:47:00.410 --> 01:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
anything so let's kill them Let's help
 
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
them be successful say okay we're gonna
 
01:47:04.129 --> 01:47:04.139 align:start position:0%
we're gonna help you and you know you
 
01:47:06.229 --> 01:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
got two years to to
 
01:47:09.649 --> 01:47:09.659 align:start position:0%
you'll get in and I think you'd be
 
01:47:10.970 --> 01:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
surprised some of these some of these
 
01:47:12.530 --> 01:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
guys are going to be
 
01:47:12.540 --> 01:47:13.550 align:start position:0%
guys are going to be
quote

01:47:13.550 --> 01:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
quote
 
01:47:15.950 --> 01:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
in response to that
 
01:47:19.070 --> 01:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
um sometimes it's helpful to
 
01:47:21.470 --> 01:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
put a commission to rest and
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
re-establish something else and go in
 
01:47:25.430 --> 01:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
another Direction that's more productive
 
01:47:28.370 --> 01:47:28.380 align:start position:0%
to help these groups along and help them
 
01:47:30.109 --> 01:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
be as productive as they need and want
 
01:47:31.870 --> 01:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
to be thank you
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
do we really want a 15-person commission
 
01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
across many state agencies or with a
 
01:47:39.950 --> 01:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
three-person legislative
 
01:47:44.030 --> 01:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
study group accomplished the same and
 
01:47:47.270 --> 01:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
much faster and less a lot less cost to
 
01:47:48.950 --> 01:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
the government
 
01:47:51.830 --> 01:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
we've got a lot of options
 
01:47:53.930 --> 01:47:53.940 align:start position:0%
you do I mean I'd rather help getting
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
the handout to to help them resistant
 
01:48:00.370 --> 01:48:00.380 align:start position:0%
it's just you're such a nice guy
 
01:48:02.870 --> 01:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
last Republicans training all these
 
01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:05.530 align:start position:0%
last Republicans training all these
handouts

01:48:05.530 --> 01:48:05.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:09.229 --> 01:48:09.239 align:start position:0%
but we're not taxing them all right all
 
01:48:12.709 --> 01:48:12.719 align:start position:0%
right let's let's let's uh let's call it
 
01:48:16.430 --> 01:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
and uh appreciate uh your time let's
 
01:48:19.129 --> 01:48:19.139 align:start position:0%
plan on a longer meeting the next time
 
01:48:21.229 --> 01:48:21.239 align:start position:0%
we get together in two weeks so yeah
 
01:48:24.410 --> 01:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
from ten to two all right
 
01:48:24.420 --> 01:48:25.510 align:start position:0%
from ten to two all right
first

01:48:25.510 --> 01:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
