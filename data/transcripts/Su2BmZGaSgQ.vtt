quoka you know June 19th is referred to
 
00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 align:start position:0%
as juneth it has a deep andrich history
 
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
in our nation it's the Day celebrated
 
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
annually by a vast number of people to
 
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
commemorate the official end of slavery
 
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 align:start position:0%
in the United States in 2019 New
 
00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire took a step forward in
 
00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
acknowledging juneth as a day of
 
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
observance this bill will change that
 
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
into making it a state holiday um to
 
00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 align:start position:0%
let's see the state has already a
 
00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
long-standing president and there seems
 
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 align:start position:0%
little rationale for not formally
 
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 align:start position:0%
recognizing this day through
 
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
legislation um in the Years following
 
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
our state's lead many others have
 
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
followed suit by enshrining the holiday
 
00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 align:start position:0%
in their own constitutions and most
 
00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 align:start position:0%
notably it was recently elevated to the
 
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
federal level being established
 
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
officially as a Federal holiday in 2021
 
00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
sill 481 acknowledges the his of our
 
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 align:start position:0%
country's past and it's time for juneth
 
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 align:start position:0%
to be recognized with the same legal
 
00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
stat as Martin Luther King Day Martin
 
00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 align:start position:0%
Luther King Jr Day Washington's birthday
 
00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
Labor day and many other holidays so
 
00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 align:start position:0%
Senator Perkins quoka is grateful
 
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
representative pelli did reach out to
 
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
her to provide um amendment that I
 
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
believe the representative is bringing
 
00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 align:start position:0%
forward um Senator perin Koka certainly
 
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
appreciates that and understands the
 
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 align:start position:0%
attent of the representative which I'm
 
00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 align:start position:0%
sure she'll speak to that herself um she
 
00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
supports the Senate's position this came
 
00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 align:start position:0%
out of the committee and the Senate with
 
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 align:start position:0%
full bipartisan support and not to get
 
00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 align:start position:0%
in too much to I don't want to take away
 
00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
from the representative introduction of
 
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
the her Amendment but the senator does
 
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
believe that um local control is very
 
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
important and and that would be her Pion
 
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
would be to remain with the Senate
 
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 align:start position:0%
position on the bill so I'm happy to
 
00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
take any questions down back to the
 
00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 align:start position:0%
senator and I think that concludes my
 
00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:27.159 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you are there any
 
00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.429 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you are there any
questions

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:30.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
uh do you expect this to result in a
 
00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:36.159 align:start position:0%
cost to local municipalities if it
 
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
becomes a
 
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 align:start position:0%
holiday so I know that the question in
 
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
committee came up often it was something
 
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
that the committee discussed at Great
 
00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:45.319 align:start position:0%
length whether or not this would affect
 
00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 align:start position:0%
the union and whether or not taking the
 
00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
holidays off for that um our
 
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
understanding is that there are two
 
00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 align:start position:0%
separate sections in the statutes one on
 
00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
the collective bargaining agreement and
 
00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
one on this issue um so we are our
 
00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 align:start position:0%
understanding is that it would not
 
00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
impact collective bargaining agreement
 
00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 align:start position:0%
in terms of local we have not heard from
 
00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 align:start position:0%
anyone that says that this would impact
 
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 align:start position:0%
a cost that I'm aware of but I'm
 
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
certainly happy to check back in with
 
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
the senator and report back to the
 
00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
committee if she has heard any
 
00:04:14.429 --> 00:04:14.439 align:start position:0%
information to that extent thank you
 
00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:17.789 align:start position:0%
information to that extent thank you

addressed oh uh this amendment just
 
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
really says whatever the holiday
 
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
designation is on our official statute
 
00:06:59.909 --> 00:06:59.919 align:start position:0%
that's what schools and municipalities
 
00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
and um need to use on their official
 
00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:05.319 align:start position:0%
communication so it's a little
 
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
tangential to the June 13th Bill thank
 
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
you I have a question representative
 
00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
parelli would this require a towns to

refer to the second Monday in October as
 
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
Columbus Day that's our official name um
 
00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:25.759 align:start position:0%
in the statute so yes it would the same
 
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
thing that Christmas day is in the
 
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
statute so we would refer to Christmas
 
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
day as Christmas
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
day thank
 
00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:39.160 align:start position:0%

00:07:45.309 --> 00:07:45.319 align:start position:0%
question I I don't know if it's a
 
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
question or a statement Madam chair but
 
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
um schools start to close about June
 
00:07:56.029 --> 00:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
13th and you give them a day off at a
 
00:07:58.309 --> 00:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
time when there's exams going on it's a
 
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
bad time of the year
 
00:08:06.029 --> 00:08:06.039 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'm not for the holiday uh to
 
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
interfere with another with the school
 
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
year and there I think representative
 
00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:14.360 align:start position:0%
Smith that's a valid point but unless
 
00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:16.280 align:start position:0%
there's a question that's probably
 
00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:18.639 align:start position:0%
something for our executive session okay
 
00:08:21.869 --> 00:08:21.879 align:start position:0%
thank you is there a
 
00:08:21.879 --> 00:08:23.510 align:start position:0%
thank you is there a
question

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:38.200 align:start position:0%
question but you when you answered it
 
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
you talked about the amendment correct
 
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
let's talk about the main I'm sorry I'm
 
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
not here to just I we I could but I'm
 
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
primarily representing the amendment oh
 
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you madam chair anyone else
 
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
gold so I want to make sure I'm
 
00:08:59.949 --> 00:08:59.959 align:start position:0%
understanding the amendment um fully
 
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
does this amendment in any way um
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
promote the closing of schools on June
 
00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:08.519 align:start position:0%
19th or any other day no the amendment
 
00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:12.200 align:start position:0%
simply adds another section to the bill
 
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
to say call the use the official title
 
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:19.240 align:start position:0%
of our holidays in statute on official
 
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:22.240 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair thanks for taking
 
00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:31.160 align:start position:0%
my questions
 
00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
so is it accurate to say that that is
 
00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:35.720 align:start position:0%
happening around the nation and maybe in
 
00:09:37.949 --> 00:09:37.959 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that uh different
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
institutions are renaming holidays to
 
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
benefit maybe their own
 
00:09:45.509 --> 00:09:45.519 align:start position:0%
agenda that was the reason for the
 
00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
amendment to just remind our schools and
 
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities that this is part of our
 
00:09:53.389 --> 00:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
shared experience and if everyone names
 
00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
holiday is something different that
 
00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:57.560 align:start position:0%
really diminishes the whole purpose of
 
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
having a holiday right thank you thank
 
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:03.240 align:start position:0%

00:10:05.949 --> 00:10:05.959 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
 
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you is there anyone else who
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:18.320 align:start position:0%
481 seeing none I'll close the public
 
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:21.160 align:start position:0%
hearing all right and we will go into
 
00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.310 align:start position:0%
hearing all right and we will go into
executive

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:23.320 align:start position:0%
executive
 
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
session does someone have have any
 
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:29.670 align:start position:0%
session does someone have have any
motion

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:32.200 align:start position:0%
Madame chair I'll move itl on Senate
 
00:10:36.829 --> 00:10:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
second okay do you wish to speak to your
 
00:10:38.959 --> 00:10:41.230 align:start position:0%
second okay do you wish to speak to your
motion

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:41.240 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:10:46.629 --> 00:10:46.639 align:start position:0%
sure I think that um when this committee
 
00:10:50.829 --> 00:10:50.839 align:start position:0%
made juneth something that would be
 
00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:54.040 align:start position:0%
celebrated in New Hampshire it was it
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
was a big step um in the normal practice
 
00:10:59.040 --> 00:10:59.870 align:start position:0%
was a big step um in the normal practice
of

00:10:59.870 --> 00:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
this committee not supporting the naming
 
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.350 align:start position:0%
this committee not supporting the naming
of

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:09.519 align:start position:0%
days and I don't
 
00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
um I don't support the amendment first
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
of all that was presented but I
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
certainly and the bill itself is not
 
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
something that I'm willing to if if for
 
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
example someone wants to close on juneth
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
that's their
 
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
prerogative if somebody wants to
 
00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
um uh not open their shop on that day
 
00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:32.600 align:start position:0%
that's their prerogative but I don't
 
00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
believe that we should make it a
 
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
mandatory holiday for the State of New
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire until
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
um it comes a time when that's something
 
00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
is uh supported on a larger extent that
 
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
everyone representative I'd like after
 
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
uh i' I'd like to agree with everything
 
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:03.560 align:start position:0%
representative broa said and also
 
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
mention that the history of juneth is
 
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
much more intense in other places than
 
00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:15.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it didn't have a lot a lot
 
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
of effect on on our state at the time
 
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
but it
 
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh representative gold thank you madam
 
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
chair uh I'm I really appreciate
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
represent pres ative Gro his remarks too
 
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
that um that this committee worked very
 
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:37.720 align:start position:0%
hard to make it a uh a thing that New
 
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire celebrates and with all due
 
00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:43.639 align:start position:0%
respect Madam chair I I read a lot I
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
read a lot of New Hampshire history I've
 
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
spend I'm very absorbed in it and I
 
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:51.160 align:start position:0%
think there was more freedom happening
 
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire than the general than
 
00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:57.160 align:start position:0%
is generally perceived however I'm very
 
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
respectful of this committee's position
 
00:13:04.629 --> 00:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
and consistent record on um on not
 
00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:06.920 align:start position:0%
continuing to proliferate mandated
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
holidays and and again going back to
 
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
both Madam chair and uh representative
 
00:13:15.629 --> 00:13:15.639 align:start position:0%
grod's comments that anybody's free to
 
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
choose a holiday if they want and and as
 
00:13:22.189 --> 00:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
I understand it even at like the school
 
00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
level or state level there's some um
 
00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
kind of floating holidays that school
 
00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:29.720 align:start position:0%
that PE that
 
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
and and that certainly happens from time
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
to time I've been aware of when I was on
 
00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:33.880 align:start position:0%
the school board they were floating
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
holidays so I think that there can be
 
00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.230 align:start position:0%
holidays so I think that there can be
some

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:37.240 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
flexibility already as it exists in
 
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
practice and in in uh
 
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
rules represent M thank you Madame chair
 
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
sorry to come in late uh but my two
 
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
cents is I think juneth holiday how many
 
00:13:58.509 --> 00:13:58.519 align:start position:0%
other states at the school level and I
 
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
know in Massachusetts it's a holiday uh
 
00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
and if it moves the last day of school
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
by one day because I know my spouse
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
Works in that so but that is one of the
 
00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
things that they've acknowledged just
 
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
like New Hampshire was the last to adopt
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
civil liberty day or Martin Luther King
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
day as a holiday at least I'm glad that
 
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
we acknowledge juneth as a day of
 
00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
recognizing the contribution the
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
African-American or black uh Community
 
00:14:38.829 --> 00:14:38.839 align:start position:0%
have done in the history and this is
 
00:14:41.470 --> 00:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
something to look at down the line I
 
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
respect the committee's due diligence on
 
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
how it's done but it's to be coming down
 
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
this line I just would like to see how
 
00:14:53.949 --> 00:14:53.959 align:start position:0%
many other states acknowledge it already
 
00:14:55.749 --> 00:14:55.759 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative Dolan
 
00:14:59.870 --> 00:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
and then sh thank you madam chair um
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
I I am becoming increasingly concerned
 
00:15:05.949 --> 00:15:05.959 align:start position:0%
about the quality of our education in
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
terms of our as ident as represented by
 
00:15:11.069 --> 00:15:11.079 align:start position:0%
our test scores we seem to be dropping
 
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
in this state lower and lower in with
 
00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:17.240 align:start position:0%
comparison to other countries in the
 
00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
world so if this gets translated into
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
another day off from school and I'm not
 
00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:27.519 align:start position:0%
not saying that it would but if it does
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
then it's going to continue to hurt I
 
00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:33.160 align:start position:0%
think our kids ability to demonstrate uh
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
their educational uh uh prowers so what
 
00:15:40.509 --> 00:15:40.519 align:start position:0%
I would feedback I would give back to
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
the Senate uh on this is that if
 
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the legislation should be I
 
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
would recommend it be acknowledged that
 
00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:54.680 align:start position:0%
if this results in a in a day off from
 
00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
school that the School departments
 
00:15:58.949 --> 00:15:58.959 align:start position:0%
around the state ought to consider
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
swapping some other day so maybe they
 
00:16:03.309 --> 00:16:03.319 align:start position:0%
take a day from the April vacation week
 
00:16:06.509 --> 00:16:06.519 align:start position:0%
or the February vacation week so that in
 
00:16:09.629 --> 00:16:09.639 align:start position:0%
total the students don't lose a day it
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
just gets swapped out and that way our
 
00:16:15.389 --> 00:16:15.399 align:start position:0%
education may be preserved uh in the
 
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
total number of hours uh in front of
 
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
their teachers so I I would I would
 
00:16:23.189 --> 00:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
offer that that that this this pool of
 
00:16:26.269 --> 00:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
days that potentially are off is not
 
00:16:28.749 --> 00:16:28.759 align:start position:0%
endless and uh we we I think we need to
 
00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
take take a stand and say that the
 
00:16:34.269 --> 00:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
children's education comes first and the
 
00:16:38.309 --> 00:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
memory of of whatever we're celebrating
 
00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
uh whatever holiday it might be is is
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
come second and that uh so I would
 
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
encourage the sponsors of this bill to
 
00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:49.480 align:start position:0%
give that some thought to to how they
 
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
would want to implement something like
 
00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
this thank you represent I'm sh it thank
 
00:16:58.430 --> 00:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um mindful of what
 
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
represent ative Dolan was just saying uh
 
00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
I'm also aware that by putting into that
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
part of the statute uh we would create
 
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
the conundrum as to whether state
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
employees should have that day off and
 
00:17:13.789 --> 00:17:13.799 align:start position:0%
whether they'd have to swap that out for
 
00:17:16.669 --> 00:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
another day uh because that the number
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
of days they are allowed has been
 
00:17:21.549 --> 00:17:21.559 align:start position:0%
limited uh and due to the fact that the
 
00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
state did already chapter this as an
 
00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:26.909 align:start position:0%
state did already chapter this as an
annual

00:17:26.909 --> 00:17:26.919 align:start position:0%
annual
 
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
celebration uh I think I I'm not quite
 
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
ready to take this step so I will be
 
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
voting for itl also thank you
 
00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.510 align:start position:0%
voting for itl also thank you
representative

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:42.200 align:start position:0%
Smith um Madam chair thank you um I I
 
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
think that some of the holidays that we
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
have could be like St Patrick's Day a
 
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
great celebration for whatever the
 
00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
holiday is but it does not close
 
00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.110 align:start position:0%
holiday is but it does not close
municipal

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
municipal
 
00:17:56.149 --> 00:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
offices schools are not closed
 
00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
everything is open it's just those that
 
00:17:59.830 --> 00:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
want to celebrate celebrate can
 
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
celebrate and I think maybe this is
 
00:18:06.029 --> 00:18:06.039 align:start position:0%
another example of the same type of
 
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
holiday acknowledge it certainly and uh
 
00:18:12.029 --> 00:18:12.039 align:start position:0%
even talk about it in schools and
 
00:18:15.789 --> 00:18:15.799 align:start position:0%
newspapers articles or whatever but not
 
00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:20.039 align:start position:0%
close the municipal offices schools
 
00:18:22.909 --> 00:18:22.919 align:start position:0%
whatever that's my two cents all right
 
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Simon thank you
 
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
madam chair Just One Last angle on this
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
uh conversation um because I do think
 
00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:32.039 align:start position:0%
that the point of contention is just on
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
the closing down of municipal offices
 
00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:36.120 align:start position:0%
State offices and things of that nature
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
um the more that we do that I I think we
 
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
underappreciate sometimes the effect
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
that that has on on the working public
 
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:45.400 align:start position:0%
um and businesses that usually have to
 
00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:47.039 align:start position:0%
continue working those holidays because
 
00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
they can't afford to close down uh and
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
they're the ones actually paying the
 
00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
taxes that pay for the people who are
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
now getting another paid day off to
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
celebrate a holiday that they're not
 
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
able to and uh you know in the retail
 
00:18:59.630 --> 00:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
world that uh that weighs on you a
 
00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
little bit after a while um and so I
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
agree I think that the the celebration
 
00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
being in the public eye people
 
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
appreciating the day for what it is and
 
00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
celebrating the day for what it is uh
 
00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
but not not furthering the disparity
 
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
really between um the government's
 
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
ability to take another day off uh when
 
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
the rest of the public pretty much has
 
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
to continue working because they can't
 
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
afford to close another day of business
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
so uh for that reason I'll also be
 
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
voting itl anyone else represent Brown
 
00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:31.039 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair just kind of
 
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
following up on representative groda uh
 
00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:36.919 align:start position:0%
as so as a former state employee you're
 
00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
probably sick of me saying that but I
 
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
would guess that if if the union
 
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
discovered there was another official
 
00:19:44.029 --> 00:19:44.039 align:start position:0%
holiday they would try to add that to
 
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
the list of the 10,000 state employees
 
00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
days off I don't know if there's a limit
 
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
on on the number of those they can
 
00:19:54.909 --> 00:19:54.919 align:start position:0%
actually have but I I would okay I would
 
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
agree with representative Simon that we
 
00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
want to minimize the closure of our
 
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
state offices and Town Offices as much
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
as we can there's enough uh federal
 
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
holidays that we we notice only because
 
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
we don't get mail delivered that day
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
yeah right and followup follow up on on
 
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
the history so looking at at the law now
 
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing you're talking about 2019
 
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:20.200 align:start position:0%
the government chist
 
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
Proclamation calling for the proper
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
observance does there do we know what
 
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
that means I'm sure some of you know
 
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
what proper observance means or am I
 
00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919 align:start position:0%
thinking too
 
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:33.400 align:start position:0%
uh well it it was the day juneth was the
 
00:20:37.549 --> 00:20:37.559 align:start position:0%
day the Emancipation Proclamation and
 
00:20:37.559 --> 00:20:40.470 align:start position:0%
day the Emancipation Proclamation and
was

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
dist spread out and people were notified
 
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
of it so it's a day of
 
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
emancipation and so um we'll see how the
 
00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:53.720 align:start position:0%
schools and other people will be able to
 
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
celebrate if they're still on
 
00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
session represent Nolan thank you madam
 
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
chair for recognizing for an additional
 
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
comment uh if I could amend amend to the
 
00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
comment I made earlier about the days
 
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
off of school and the impact to our
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
students uh when if this does result in
 
00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
a day off from school then there are
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
endless number of parents that're going
 
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
to say I need to take the day off also
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
because I don't want my students home
 
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
alone and therefore there is a there is
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
a somewhat hidden economic impact act uh
 
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.240 align:start position:0%
across the state with parents not going
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
to work or having to take the day off to
 
00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
uh to supervise their their their
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
children that have the day up so I just
 
00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
want to add that thank you gold just
 
00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
briefly at the risk of my colleague
 
00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:50.230 align:start position:0%
briefly at the risk of my colleague
beside

00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
me getting
 
00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
upset anyway I want to follow up on what
 
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
representative Simon said and I will say
 
00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:01.640 align:start position:0%
that uh though I've had some brief
 
00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
employment opportunities in kind of
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
official offices my husband and I have
 
00:22:08.909 --> 00:22:08.919 align:start position:0%
always been self-employed and um so when
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
you're a farmer when you're a country
 
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
person when you're a logger when you're
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
just out not a part of the whole
 
00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
holidays Monday through Friday work day
 
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
um you have a day you have business you
 
00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
have to do you think oh I I need to get
 
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
to the post office or I need to get to
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
the bank or I need to get here it really
 
00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
is disruptive to to have offices closed
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
and you don't know what the schedule is
 
00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
and what these things are although I
 
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
have we have neighbors who um we love
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
dearly that have come here from India
 
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
and they throw do fireworks what for the
 
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
holidays in India and it's been just
 
00:22:49.029 --> 00:22:49.039 align:start position:0%
delightful to learn what the holidays in
 
00:22:51.269 --> 00:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
India are so maybe if we get something
 
00:22:54.029 --> 00:22:54.039 align:start position:0%
where in the United States we all do
 
00:22:56.669 --> 00:22:56.679 align:start position:0%
fireworks for every holiday People Like
 
00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
Us who aren't tuned in we'll have a way
 
00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:01.720 align:start position:0%
to find out I thought i' end with a
 
00:23:03.669 --> 00:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
little humor well there are there are
 
00:23:06.029 --> 00:23:06.039 align:start position:0%
people in my district that apparently
 
00:23:09.870 --> 00:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
use fireworks to celebrate Friday
 
00:23:14.909 --> 00:23:14.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
neighbors anyone else
 
00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
comments all right the motion is in
 
00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate by representative

I'm just introducing it in lie of anyone
 
00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:14.120 align:start position:0%
else here and I'm not prepared to answer
 
00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.029 align:start position:0%
else here and I'm not prepared to answer
any

00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:51.519 align:start position:0%
okay uh good morning Madam chair and
 
00:31:52.669 --> 00:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
00:31:54.269 --> 00:31:54.279 align:start position:0%
Daley fette and I'm the Senate majority
 
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:56.120 align:start position:0%
caucus director uh Senator avard was
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
unable to be here to introduce his bill
 
00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
so he asked me to do it on his behalf
 
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 373 is amended proposes a
 
00:32:04.509 --> 00:32:04.519 align:start position:0%
modification to the State Building Code
 
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:06.200 align:start position:0%
specifically adjusting the maximum air
 
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
exchange rate in new homes from the
 
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
current threshold of three air exchanges
 
00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
per hour to no more than five air
 
00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:13.559 align:start position:0%
exchanges per hour it wasn't that long
 
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
ago that the air exchange rate was set
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
to seven per hour and was adjusted to
 
00:32:18.909 --> 00:32:18.919 align:start position:0%
three as an experiment on Home
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
Efficiency the experiment has been a
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
failure and has caused a lot of
 
00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences in particular
 
00:32:26.789 --> 00:32:26.799 align:start position:0%
when it comes to health air exchange is
 
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
a critical component in maintaining the
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
health comfort and safety of Home
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
environments home homes accumulate
 
00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
various po pollutants including dust pet
 
00:32:38.669 --> 00:32:38.679 align:start position:0%
dander pollen and a multitude of organic
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
and chemical compounds coming from
 
00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:42.679 align:start position:0%
cleaning products Furnishings paints and
 
00:32:44.029 --> 00:32:44.039 align:start position:0%
other household
 
00:32:46.509 --> 00:32:46.519 align:start position:0%
items even routine activities such as
 
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
cooking bathing and indoor drying of
 
00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:50.120 align:start position:0%
clothes can significantly increase
 
00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
indoor moisture levels without adequate
 
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
air exchange this moisture can
 
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
contribute to mold growth and structural
 
00:32:58.870 --> 00:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
damage over time numerous health
 
00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:01.480 align:start position:0%
organizations such as the CDC the EPA
 
00:33:03.149 --> 00:33:03.159 align:start position:0%
and the American Lung Association have
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
indicated that an air exchange rate of
 
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
three times per hour is very restrictive
 
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
and limits at home's ability to breathe
 
00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
adequately also the current threshold of
 
00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.519 align:start position:0%
three air exchanges per hour presents
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
considerable challenges for home
 
00:33:17.629 --> 00:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
builders this standard is so difficult
 
00:33:19.509 --> 00:33:19.519 align:start position:0%
to achieve that new homes are routinely
 
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
failing their exchange tests meaning
 
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
that structural modifications may be
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
needed or more insulation which which
 
00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
increases the cost of home construction
 
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
and creates more Del is sb373 will help
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
make homes safer and healthier as well
 
00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
as more affordable to our constituents
 
00:33:36.669 --> 00:33:36.679 align:start position:0%
um Senator avar asked me to do this on
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
his behalf but I believe there is some
 
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
folks here from the Home Builders
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
Association who would be able to better
 
00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you may have
 
00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
thank you will not ask any
 
00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very
 
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
good morning member Madam chair and
 
00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:07.240 align:start position:0%
allowing me to speak before you today so
 
00:34:09.149 --> 00:34:09.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire building officials I'm
 
00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
bill mckenny president of New Hampshire
 
00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:13.240 align:start position:0%
building officials Association so the
 
00:34:14.869 --> 00:34:14.879 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire building officials uh did
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
not support the original version of
 
00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:19.960 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 373 uh nor do we support the
 
00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
amended language that we have before us
 
00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
now Senate B Senate Bill 373 proposes to
 
00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919 align:start position:0%
amend the international conservation uh
 
00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
energy conservation code 2018 Edition
 
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
for only one specific section pertaining
 
00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
to residential dwellings this bill is an
 
00:34:39.069 --> 00:34:39.079 align:start position:0%
attempt to amend the State Building Code
 
00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:41.240 align:start position:0%
and also circumventing the New Hampshire
 
00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
building code review board that is
 
00:34:45.069 --> 00:34:45.079 align:start position:0%
established by the state legislature and
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
charge with providing a single package
 
00:34:48.829 --> 00:34:48.839 align:start position:0%
of codes with mutually agreed upon
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
amendments to be ratified the
 
00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
requirement for three air changes per
 
00:34:54.990 --> 00:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
hour has been in effect in the state of
 
00:34:58.950 --> 00:34:58.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire since March 15th of 202 22
 
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
under the 2015 editions of the codes
 
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
training of code officials and
 
00:35:06.349 --> 00:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
contractors to this requirement began at
 
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
least six months prior to the effective
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
date and continues to be part of our
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
regular training
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
programs why go backwards now and and
 
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
add create and create more
 
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839 align:start position:0%
confusion an amendment can be proposed
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
to the building code review board next
 
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
session they can do it annually now we
 
00:35:25.950 --> 00:35:25.960 align:start position:0%
have a we have the processes in place to
 
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
do that and follow the appropriate
 
00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:30.680 align:start position:0%
process through the New Hampshire
 
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
building code review board there has
 
00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
been there has been no significant

reduction in residential dwellings being
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
built because of three air changes per
 
00:35:42.069 --> 00:35:42.079 align:start position:0%
hour in fact many communities continue
 
00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
to see increased residential
 
00:35:46.109 --> 00:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
construction to meet the demand for
 
00:35:48.349 --> 00:35:48.359 align:start position:0%
housing amending individual code
 
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
sections through legislation is not wise
 
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:53.560 align:start position:0%
this ties the hands of the New Hampshire
 
00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:55.160 align:start position:0%
building code review board the
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
amendments are often much more difficult
 
00:35:58.349 --> 00:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
to locate
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
and as as industry standards and codes
 
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:03.640 align:start position:0%
evolve conflicts can often arise between
 
00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:05.720 align:start position:0%
what is permitted by the adopted code
 
00:36:08.309 --> 00:36:08.319 align:start position:0%
and what is permitted by Statute New
 
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire building officials Association
 
00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:12.440 align:start position:0%
does not support individual amendments
 
00:36:14.109 --> 00:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
to codes through
 
00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:15.960 align:start position:0%

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
1059 thank you and I will welcome any
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
questions thank you represent man py
 
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question um how does this
 
00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
compare to the time when we had pandemic
 
00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:23.560 align:start position:0%
and the a exchange became a very
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
critical part of keeping the communities
 
00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
healthy the parts per unit uh exchange
 
00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:39.190 align:start position:0%
 
sting

00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
sting
 
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
I I think it improves on the energy code
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
side of it and you know um giving better
 
00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:47.800 align:start position:0%
benefits to the to the building owners
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
the homeowners um again you know uh less
 
00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
air exchanges um an
 
00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:55.630 align:start position:0%
air exchanges um an
hour

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:55.640 align:start position:0%
hour
 
00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
could result in
 
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:01.960 align:start position:0%
unhealthier air if you don't have proper
 
00:38:04.589 --> 00:38:04.599 align:start position:0%
filtration thank
 
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
you I have a question this five is this
 
00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:11.240 align:start position:0%
five air
 
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
changes per
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
hour yes is what they're proposing and
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
okay and that is with whatever
 
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
ventilation is established in the in the
 
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
building correct so that if you have
 
00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
um air air air vents or fans or um air
 
00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:40.280 align:start position:0%
heat recovery U air exchangers you would
 
00:38:42.790 --> 00:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
that is part of the Baseline that you
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
use when you're testing to see if you
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
meet three correct okay thank you
 
00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.510 align:start position:0%
meet three correct okay thank you
representative

00:38:50.510 --> 00:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:53.589 --> 00:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair morning
 
00:38:57.829 --> 00:38:57.839 align:start position:0%
Bill so the I I've gotten a number of
 
00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
communications from Builders and so
 
00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
forth and so on talking about the
 
00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
science that too many uh to buildings
 
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
that are too tight are unhealthy uh that
 
00:39:13.069 --> 00:39:13.079 align:start position:0%
you it promotes the the the development
 
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
of of mold and and and so forth and so
 
00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:20.240 align:start position:0%
on now obviously every exch Exchange in
 
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
the wintertime is mixed pickles right uh
 
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
win some lose some because because you
 
00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:31.480 align:start position:0%
get better air you're also paying for
 
00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:33.640 align:start position:0%
heating the outside instead of the
 
00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
inside of your house so the question I
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
have is where's the science on this
 
00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
because obviously in the summertime you
 
00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:42.839 align:start position:0%
can open all your windows and you got
 
00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
permanent regular uh constant air
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
exchange right uh and and then you want
 
00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:52.760 align:start position:0%
to have your windows closed potentially
 
00:39:55.589 --> 00:39:55.599 align:start position:0%
because it's too damned hot outside
 
00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
right so it's a bad attle against you
 
00:40:02.589 --> 00:40:02.599 align:start position:0%
know two different factors uh constantly
 
00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
so where's the science on this in terms
 
00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
of what would be optimal without being
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
too expensive either in the summer or
 
00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:14.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:18.109 --> 00:40:18.119 align:start position:0%
matter very very good question uh and I
 
00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
first would like to say that the
 
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire building officials Association
 
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
is not opposed to the five air changes
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
per hour what we're opposed to is the
 
00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
process that's being taken right now to
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
circumvent the building code review
 
00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
board to answer your question
 
00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt uh the science is
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
again I guess it depends on which side
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
of the argument you're on um you can do
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
heal um healthy homes with the air
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
exchange hour at three but again it be
 
00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
comes down to a balance of humidity in
 
00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:50.720 align:start position:0%
the home um if you if you ow if you
 
00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
allow too much humidity in your home you
 
00:40:54.589 --> 00:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
use your humidifier too much you bring
 
00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
that level up you we're going to start
 
00:40:58.349 --> 00:40:58.359 align:start position:0%
to have M and mold home because at three
 
00:41:00.630 --> 00:41:00.640 align:start position:0%
air air exchanges per hour if you're
 
00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
keeping your your humid humidity at the
 
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
correct levels so that your air exchange
 
00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
and humidity levels are balancing out
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
then you have less risk of
 
00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you representative Brown
 
00:41:14.349 --> 00:41:14.359 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair thanks for
 
00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question so
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
um I you noted in early on that this
 
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
change to three air exchanges was due to
 
00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
the change in the conservation code um
 
00:41:30.829 --> 00:41:30.839 align:start position:0%
do you remember the history of what was
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to be the benefit to
 
00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:35.000 align:start position:0%
conservation by going to three times a
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
exchange versus
 
00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
5 it would be mostly on the energy
 
00:41:43.069 --> 00:41:43.079 align:start position:0%
conservation okay so um if you recall on
 
00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:45.400 align:start position:0%
the prior codes prior to 2015 it was
 
00:41:49.309 --> 00:41:49.319 align:start position:0%
seven air changes per hour in the 2015
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
codes um we had it called for three air
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
changes for hour which was a drastic
 
00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
jump and and at the time we did a phased
 
00:42:02.069 --> 00:42:02.079 align:start position:0%
in process with a Sunset date of um
 
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
March 15 of 2022 to kind of phase in
 
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
that drop uh as I understand it the 2021
 
00:42:12.109 --> 00:42:12.119 align:start position:0%
energy codes now reverts that air
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
exchange back to five um but as you see
 
00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
we are not adopting the 2021 energy code
 
00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
we're adopting we're we're staying with
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
the 2018 so again because this comes in
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
kind of late in the process it didn't go
 
00:42:28.549 --> 00:42:28.559 align:start position:0%
through building code review board the
 
00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
way it should have or if it did I
 
00:42:33.069 --> 00:42:33.079 align:start position:0%
believe it was it was not approved um
 
00:42:35.349 --> 00:42:35.359 align:start position:0%
they had a majority vote not to approve
 
00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment to the building code
 
00:42:38.349 --> 00:42:38.359 align:start position:0%
review board and leave it as written in
 
00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
the 2018 codes thank you representative
 
00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um so your
 
00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
testimony is that your major concern is
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
the process that it's going through not
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily the outcome of the process
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
is am I understanding you correctly that
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
is correct follow up followup um so my
 
00:42:59.150 --> 00:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
question and maybe you can clarify this
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
for me the way that the system is set up
 
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
presently was it not put in place that
 
00:43:06.150 --> 00:43:06.160 align:start position:0%
way to assist the legislature and doing
 
00:43:08.549 --> 00:43:08.559 align:start position:0%
the job of adopting code and that even
 
00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:09.839 align:start position:0%
though the building code review board
 
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
goes through their process every single
 
00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:14.440 align:start position:0%
time that code still has to come to us
 
00:43:16.589 --> 00:43:16.599 align:start position:0%
for our ultimate review and adoption and
 
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
at that time we could change whatever we
 
00:43:22.829 --> 00:43:22.839 align:start position:0%
wanted to um at that point um that's my
 
00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
understanding of it so how would be how
 
00:43:30.069 --> 00:43:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
that that's a very good question too um
 
00:43:35.349 --> 00:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
but you're correct the process you know
 
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
in my view from the building officials
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
the process should always begin with the
 
00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:41.240 align:start position:0%
building code review board and are
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
amendments proposed as the process goes
 
00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
through the legislature absolutely but
 
00:43:48.309 --> 00:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
that is the process that we all have to
 
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
work with and uh again I just believe
 
00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:55.640 align:start position:0%
that when we start putting language such
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
as five air changes hour in specifically
 
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
in legislation rather than in an
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
amendment through the building code
 
00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:05.480 align:start position:0%
review board it's much more difficult to
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
amend later on whereas a bu a an
 
00:44:10.470 --> 00:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
amendment can go right back through the
 
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
building code review board at any time
 
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
you represent man thank you madam chair
 
00:44:23.549 --> 00:44:23.559 align:start position:0%
just another quick follow up so 1056
 
00:44:26.549 --> 00:44:26.559 align:start position:0%
pass the building code through house HB
 
00:44:31.109 --> 00:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
105 6 would it be possible to amend that
 
00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
and add this amendment to that adopting
 
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
the new building code uh 2018 building
 
00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:41.440 align:start position:0%
code or 2021 whichever one we are going
 
00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
to adopt is that a
 
00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:46.150 align:start position:0%
to adopt is that a
possible

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:44:48.349 --> 00:44:48.359 align:start position:0%
solution yes if the building codes that
 
00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
are proposed are adopted in this session
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's absolutely possible for an
 
00:44:56.109 --> 00:44:56.119 align:start position:0%
amendment to be proposed for next
 
00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
session through follow the process
 
00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
through the building code review board
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
as it
 
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
should Mr mckenley do you know if this
 
00:45:09.069 --> 00:45:09.079 align:start position:0%
specific amendment was brought to the
 
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
building code review
 
00:45:16.030 --> 00:45:16.040 align:start position:0%
board was it I mean was was this issue
 
00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:17.960 align:start position:0%
rejected by the building code review
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
board or simply
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
overlooked as I recall this was
 
00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
discussed with the building code review
 
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
board um and and it the vote for the
 
00:45:31.309 --> 00:45:31.319 align:start position:0%
building code review board was uh uh 12
 
00:45:32.990 --> 00:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
against one
 
00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
for um ah so that the building code
 
00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:39.640 align:start position:0%
review board looked at this amendment
 
00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
and voted one to 12 against
 
00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:44.839 align:start position:0%
correct I just don't believe there was
 
00:45:46.589 --> 00:45:46.599 align:start position:0%
if I may I just don't believe there was
 
00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
a a strong enough argument made um
 
00:45:52.109 --> 00:45:52.119 align:start position:0%
between all parties to convince the
 
00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
building code review board the need for
 
00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:55.069 align:start position:0%
building code review board the need for
the

00:45:55.069 --> 00:45:55.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
change okay thank you very much much any
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Schmidt
 
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair well I I I I'm
 
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
fully in favor of the building code
 
00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:07.960 align:start position:0%
rward having a major role to play
 
00:46:10.829 --> 00:46:10.839 align:start position:0%
because you guys are the most expert
 
00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:13.720 align:start position:0%
group that we have to to get at the
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
nitty-gritty and make good decisions for
 
00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
us to then ratify um I I I I am troubled
 
00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:24.040 align:start position:0%
by the idea that possibly we have a good
 
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
result but a bad process in this
 
00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:27.829 align:start position:0%
result but a bad process in this
instance

00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
instance
 
00:46:33.069 --> 00:46:33.079 align:start position:0%
so uh so but the thing is I also agree
 
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
with you that locking some things into
 
00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
statute is not a good idea because it's
 
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
as you stated more difficult to undo a
 
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
bad decision uh if it's in statute and
 
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
you have to do it because the statute
 
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
says you can't do it any other way or
 
00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
whatever so uh so you're coming before
 
00:46:54.109 --> 00:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
us and saying that you want this
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
rejected based on science and process as
 
00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
well I
 
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
would yes we we would like this not
 
00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
supported by the committee um primarily
 
00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
because of process you know and New
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire building officials Association
 
00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:13.839 align:start position:0%
is absolutely willing to work with the
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
sponsor um to help them and and work
 
00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
with them through the process with the
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
building code review board and actually
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
get our support for this in the next
 
00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
session okay thank you represent Simon
 
00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
question of the chair just to give Mr
 
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:27.640 align:start position:0%
mckin a break
 
00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
I said some hard questions um ultimately
 
00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
all code goes into statute because
 
00:47:35.549 --> 00:47:35.559 align:start position:0%
that's what we do when we adopt the code
 
00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
so it all ends up in statute this would
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
also end up in statute so my question
 
00:47:41.309 --> 00:47:41.319 align:start position:0%
would be the next time uh that Mr
 
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
Sherman or somebody else brings us uh
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
the updated code and we and we vote on
 
00:47:48.829 --> 00:47:48.839 align:start position:0%
that code would that make this law
 
00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
obsolete or would it be outside of the
 
00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:55.960 align:start position:0%
code um what what we do statute is to
 
00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
say we adopt adopt the Amendments
 
00:47:59.950 --> 00:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
approved by the building code review
 
00:48:04.109 --> 00:48:04.119 align:start position:0%
board up through a point in
 
00:48:07.069 --> 00:48:07.079 align:start position:0%
time so if that code addressed this
 
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
issue it would override this piece of
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
legislation and Implement that um that's
 
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
a very good question because if it did
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
then it would be the same exact process
 
00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:19.400 align:start position:0%
that we're doing right now right okay
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
anyone else thank you thank you Mr
 
00:48:24.390 --> 00:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
mckenley Matt Mayberry thank you very
 
00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:46.030 align:start position:0%
mckenley Matt Mayberry thank you very
much

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:49.789 --> 00:48:49.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
still there we go start
 
00:48:54.750 --> 00:48:54.760 align:start position:0%
again good morning my name is Matt
 
00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
Mayberry I'm the Executive Vice
 
00:48:58.829 --> 00:48:58.839 align:start position:0%
President of New Hampshire homebuilders
 
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
Association and we're very much in
 
00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
favor of increasing the air exchanges
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
from 3 to five and we'll talk a little
 
00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:07.720 align:start position:0%
bit about
 
00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
that we represent or I represent our 500
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
members which in turn reflects the
 
00:49:16.109 --> 00:49:16.119 align:start position:0%
36,000 men and women in New Hampshire
 
00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:17.960 align:start position:0%
who work in the Residential Building
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
Trades you've heard from some of them um
 
00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:25.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
blanks representative s and I'm going to
 
00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
start right off the bat by saying I
 
00:49:31.109 --> 00:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
agree with
 
00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:33.400 align:start position:0%
you outside committees can make
 
00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations they can review but you
 
00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:38.440 align:start position:0%
folks are the policy
 
00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
deciders you set the policy no outside
 
00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
board does that you folks
 
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
do and we're in disagreement with the
 
00:49:50.430 --> 00:49:50.440 align:start position:0%
building code review board
 
00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
because I won't let you see all the
 
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
sausage being made but the air exchanges
 
00:49:57.630 --> 00:49:57.640 align:start position:0%
was part of a little Poli
 
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
football that tied back to the energy
 
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
codes and they were mad at
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
us so that's a little little Insider
 
00:50:10.789 --> 00:50:10.799 align:start position:0%
game for you but when achang is and what
 
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
they do is they'll go into a
 
00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
home close up the home open up a door
 
00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
and put a
 
00:50:23.069 --> 00:50:23.079 align:start position:0%
large kind of almost like a tarp over a
 
00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:26.160 align:start position:0%
the door with a fan that will pull all
 
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
of the a a out of the
 
00:50:31.549 --> 00:50:31.559 align:start position:0%
house then a calculation is done how
 
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
many times per hour is that air replaced
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
in the home that has been
 
00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
removed currently it's
 
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:43.720 align:start position:0%
three it's extremely
 
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
hard to do that and I have two stories
 
00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
for you regarding
 
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
that my Builders are telling me that
 
00:50:53.549 --> 00:50:53.559 align:start position:0%
when this first started out a few years
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
ago it was seven air exchanges per hour
 
00:50:59.470 --> 00:50:59.480 align:start position:0%
the legislature and the state and the
 
00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:01.960 align:start position:0%
building code review board said let's
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
try three let's see if this will work
 
00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:06.880 align:start position:0%
let's see if it helps with Energy
 
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
Efficiency let's see if it works for
 
00:51:14.470 --> 00:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
working there's a question about some of
 
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
the science behind
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
this the CDC the EPA the American Lung
 
00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
Association Harvard Public Health
 
00:51:29.109 --> 00:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
and the World Health
 
00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:31.480 align:start position:0%
Organization along with the friendly
 
00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
neighborhood home builder Association
 
00:51:37.870 --> 00:51:37.880 align:start position:0%
say it's not working at
 
00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:39.640 align:start position:0%
all I
 
00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559 align:start position:0%
approached a a matter of fact
 
00:51:42.559 --> 00:51:44.270 align:start position:0%
approached a a matter of fact
the

00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
um the American Society of heating
 
00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
refrigerating and air conditioning
 
00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:54.750 --> 00:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
1959 in their findings they found that
 
00:51:58.349 --> 00:51:58.359 align:start position:0%
only 8% of us homes are able to achieve
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
three air exchanges per
 
00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:03.640 align:start position:0%
hour that number goes up to
 
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
23% when you do
 
00:52:10.470 --> 00:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
five let's not forget that the five that
 
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
we're requesting is
 
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
still lower than what it was originally
 
00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
at seven it still produces a tight home
 
00:52:21.309 --> 00:52:21.319 align:start position:0%
an energy efficient home but also an
 
00:52:25.069 --> 00:52:25.079 align:start position:0%
affordable home my Builders can do
 
00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:27.640 align:start position:0%
that I push my Builders about coming and
 
00:52:29.549 --> 00:52:29.559 align:start position:0%
testifying before you today so you
 
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
didn't hear from
 
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
me uh two of them I've renamed them
 
00:52:35.549 --> 00:52:35.559 align:start position:0%
Patrick and
 
00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:37.480 align:start position:0%
Brett they didn't want to come before
 
00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:38.309 align:start position:0%
Brett they didn't want to come before
you

00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
folks because they would talked about
 
00:52:42.910 --> 00:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
how the sausage was really made out in
 
00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:45.230 align:start position:0%
how the sausage was really made out in
the

00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
field one of the builders built his own
 
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
home has an asmatic son here's a
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
doctor's note he worked with the
 
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.109 align:start position:0%
doctor's note he worked with the
building

00:52:55.109 --> 00:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
official in the town when he built his
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
home and he said if I make this three
 
00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
air exchanges per
 
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
hour my son is going to have a hard time
 
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
breathing all the reports are showing
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
increase of respiratory issues mold
 
00:53:15.870 --> 00:53:15.880 align:start position:0%
milde moisture in the home homes need to
 
00:53:18.069 --> 00:53:18.079 align:start position:0%
breathe a little
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
bit he worked with the building
 
00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
official and said what do I what can I
 
00:53:24.789 --> 00:53:24.799 align:start position:0%
do about
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
this the building off told
 
00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
him you have a
 
00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:32.920 align:start position:0%
choice we can work together just kind of
 
00:53:36.349 --> 00:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
shake hands go forward build your
 
00:53:40.829 --> 00:53:40.839 align:start position:0%
house or create three exchanges in your
 
00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
home whatever it takes to get
 
00:53:46.789 --> 00:53:46.799 align:start position:0%
that when you get your certificate of
 
00:53:50.069 --> 00:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
occupancy his quote not mine go put a
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
hole in the side of the building and put
 
00:53:52.319 --> 00:53:53.589 align:start position:0%
hole in the side of the building and put
a

00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:53:57.270 --> 00:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
vent so you increase those air exchanges
 
00:53:58.589 --> 00:53:58.599 align:start position:0%
what they're not telling you is that
 
00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
with the three air exchanges you have a
 
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
hard time in an issue with propane
 
00:54:07.829 --> 00:54:07.839 align:start position:0%
heating natural gas heating and wood
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
stoves Patrick told me a story of that
 
00:54:13.309 --> 00:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
when he built his home to the three air
 
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
exchanges put in a wood
 
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
stove it was releasing carbon monoxide
 
00:54:19.950 --> 00:54:19.960 align:start position:0%
into the home because not enough fresh
 
00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
air was coming in he had to spend an
 
00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:23.870 align:start position:0%
air was coming in he had to spend an
extra

00:54:23.870 --> 00:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
extra
 
00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:26.680 align:start position:0%
$5,000 to put in a fresh air system
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
system so his wood stove could ventilate
 
00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
and operate
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
properly again more added costs coming
 
00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:42.069 align:start position:0%
properly again more added costs coming
across

00:54:42.069 --> 00:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:44.200 align:start position:0%
the I hate want to lose my train of
 
00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:46.109 align:start position:0%
the I hate want to lose my train of
thought

00:54:46.109 --> 00:54:46.119 align:start position:0%
thought
 
00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
sorry but ladies and gentlemen what
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
we're asking you to do is please
 
00:54:52.829 --> 00:54:52.839 align:start position:0%
compromise on five air exchanges per
 
00:54:57.390 --> 00:54:57.400 align:start position:0%
hour the 2021 energy codes that many in
 
00:54:58.510 --> 00:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
this room are
 
00:54:58.520 --> 00:55:00.150 align:start position:0%
this room are
advocating

00:55:00.150 --> 00:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
advocating
 
00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:03.880 align:start position:0%
support and bring forward five air
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
exchanges even the iecc said that three
 
00:55:09.309 --> 00:55:09.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:12.510 --> 00:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
tight so this does have an impact we're
 
00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
willing to work with everyone
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
representative you are very correct that
 
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
when it goes into statute it gets looped
 
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
into the next time we change the codes
 
00:55:22.750 --> 00:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
it just gets picked up within there you
 
00:55:25.390 --> 00:55:25.400 align:start position:0%
folks are the policy deciders not a
 
00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
and I'll take any questions thank you
 
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
are there
 
00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:35.480 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
 thank you madam chair thank you for
 
00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:40.029 align:start position:0%
 thank you madam chair thank you for
taking

00:55:40.029 --> 00:55:40.039 align:start position:0%
taking
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
questions can you tell me
 
00:55:47.069 --> 00:55:47.079 align:start position:0%
when this issue was brought before the
 
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
building code review
 
00:55:52.029 --> 00:55:52.039 align:start position:0%
board about a year ago maybe a year and
 
00:55:58.589 --> 00:55:58.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:01.640 align:start position:0%
and it hasn't been brought forward in
 
00:56:03.870 --> 00:56:03.880 align:start position:0%
between that time frame a year and a
 
00:56:06.950 --> 00:56:06.960 align:start position:0%
half ago when now I think it first came
 
00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:08.430 align:start position:0%
half ago when now I think it first came
forward

00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:08.440 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:56:11.829 --> 00:56:11.839 align:start position:0%
as the home builders Express concern
 
00:56:13.589 --> 00:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
that they can't meet these three air
 
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
exchanges and asked us to bring it
 
00:56:17.789 --> 00:56:17.799 align:start position:0%
forward through the building code Review
 
00:56:20.029 --> 00:56:20.039 align:start position:0%
Board in this latest
 
00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:24.280 align:start position:0%
update to the what is possibly
 
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
potentially the 2021 building code
 
00:56:29.069 --> 00:56:29.079 align:start position:0%
uh so it was brought to my attention
 
00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
about a year maybe a year and a half ago
 
00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
representative then we did an amendment
 
00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
that was brought forward to the building
 
00:56:38.029 --> 00:56:38.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:38.039 --> 00:56:41.109 align:start position:0%
 
board

00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
H all right because I'm I'm just have an
 
00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:46.150 align:start position:0%
H all right because I'm I'm just have an
issue

00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:46.160 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:56:50.109 --> 00:56:50.119 align:start position:0%
with bypassing process we've set here in
 
00:56:51.910 --> 00:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
the state and going before the building
 
00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:54.200 align:start position:0%
code review board and
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
I understand
 
00:56:59.230 --> 00:56:59.240 align:start position:0%
the issues you're having and I feel for
 
00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
that because I think three exchanges
 
00:57:04.789 --> 00:57:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:09.069 --> 00:57:09.079 align:start position:0%
but since a time frame of the
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
three and understanding that five is in
 
00:57:13.789 --> 00:57:13.799 align:start position:0%
the 2021 I would
 
00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
hope that you folks can get this settled
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
within the next year through the correct
 
00:57:23.549 --> 00:57:23.559 align:start position:0%
process that we have set instead of
 
00:57:24.990 --> 00:57:25.000 align:start position:0%
coming here to the legislature for
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
something like this um because I I I I
 
00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:30.200 align:start position:0%
and the question
 
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
is would you be willing to do
 
00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:36.440 align:start position:0%
that of course the New Hampshire
 
00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
homebuilder Association brought for to
 
00:57:40.750 --> 00:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
the building code review board I think
 
00:57:42.349 --> 00:57:42.359 align:start position:0%
it was five or six amendments that we
 
00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
would like to see within the building
 
00:57:49.349 --> 00:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
code when the home builders came out and
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
I will just be
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
direct when the home builders came out
 
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
against the 2021 energy code
 
00:57:58.029 --> 00:57:58.039 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of folks on the
 
00:57:59.670 --> 00:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
building code review board who are
 
00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:01.640 align:start position:0%
pretty cranky about
 
00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
that and so the
 
00:58:07.589 --> 00:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
12:1 the one was the home builder member
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
because we get one seat on there The
 
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
Architects the engineers and all the
 
00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:15.480 align:start position:0%
others who really wanted the 21 energy
 
00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
codes they were pretty mad at me so I
 
00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
won't say it's
 
00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
retribution it's kind of coincidental we
 
00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
come out against the 21 energy code and
 
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
every sing single idea the home builders
 
00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:29.480 align:start position:0%
brought forward was
 
00:58:32.029 --> 00:58:32.039 align:start position:0%
denied thank you for explaining the
 
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
sausage representative
 
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
Brown uh thank you madam chair and
 
00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question so if only
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
8% Across the Nation can achieve this
 
00:58:45.309 --> 00:58:45.319 align:start position:0%
what happens to the builders in New
 
00:58:47.029 --> 00:58:47.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what happens if you don't
 
00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
achieve this if you can't achieve three
 
00:58:51.870 --> 00:58:51.880 align:start position:0%
then what happens to the home the the
 
00:58:54.549 --> 00:58:54.559 align:start position:0%
buyer the Builder and and the
 
00:58:57.789 --> 00:58:57.799 align:start position:0%
owner they spend more money closing up
 
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
the house again and again and again
 
00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
until they can get two
 
00:59:08.829 --> 00:59:08.839 align:start position:0%
three this was a a nationwide survey but
 
00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire where I've heard from
 
00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
my Builders is they're doing things such
 
00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
as before the blower door test they're
 
00:59:20.069 --> 00:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
not installing carpet because as you
 
00:59:22.270 --> 00:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
know in a four side air system just the
 
00:59:24.910 --> 00:59:24.920 align:start position:0%
the pile of the the carpet pushes up the
 
00:59:28.029 --> 00:59:28.039 align:start position:0%
vent so air can come back
 
00:59:32.029 --> 00:59:32.039 align:start position:0%
in so they're not putting it in the
 
00:59:35.549 --> 00:59:35.559 align:start position:0%
carpet going on to subfloor doing their
 
00:59:38.829 --> 00:59:38.839 align:start position:0%
blower drawer test okay now we can go go
 
00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:41.720 align:start position:0%
put the carpet in what's happening
 
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:44.280 align:start position:0%
representative is you're
 
00:59:47.470 --> 00:59:47.480 align:start position:0%
having from what I've been
 
00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:49.839 align:start position:0%
told they're doing what they need to do
 
00:59:51.390 --> 00:59:51.400 align:start position:0%
to get to number
 
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
three when they get their
 
00:59:55.589 --> 00:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
certificate then they do what they need
 
00:59:59.069 --> 00:59:59.079 align:start position:0%
to do to finish the home thank you
 
01:00:04.990 --> 01:00:05.000 align:start position:0%
followup I me one followup yes thank you
 
01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
um how much does it cost so every time
 
01:00:11.069 --> 01:00:11.079 align:start position:0%
they rework the house they have to pay
 
01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
for a test again or did the contractors
 
01:00:14.549 --> 01:00:14.559 align:start position:0%
do that themselves or hire that out and
 
01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
what does that cost um they're saying
 
01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
it's adding about $3,000 for every
 
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.710 align:start position:0%
it's adding about $3,000 for every
missed

01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
missed
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
test representative Mani thank you madam
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
chair I'm just having a hard time
 
01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:29.640 align:start position:0%
wrapping my head
 
01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:32.440 align:start position:0%
around on one hand it's the safety
 
01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
well-being health of the individuals
 
01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
living or working in a building that is
 
01:00:43.109 --> 01:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
why the code is to help a healthy living
 
01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
condition on the other hand you're
 
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
telling me that the home builders are
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
versus Home Builders Association or
 
01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
building code Association there's a
 
01:00:59.150 --> 01:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
friction so who's suffering at the end
 
01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
of the day is the granite Staters who
 
01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:03.789 align:start position:0%
of the day is the granite Staters who
are

01:01:03.789 --> 01:01:03.799 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:01:03.799 --> 01:01:05.510 align:start position:0%
are
building

01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:01:11.109 --> 01:01:11.119 align:start position:0%
and so how is the Builders
 
01:01:14.589 --> 01:01:14.599 align:start position:0%
Association doing what they're doing to
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
help their customers to say your Healthy
 
01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:21.640 align:start position:0%
Living is important and how can we work
 
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
isn't that the part of the Builder and
 
01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
you know there's a code and isn't that
 
01:01:31.549 --> 01:01:31.559 align:start position:0%
part of the role that you play yes ma'am
 
01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
and that's why I'm
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
here we're representing those home
 
01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
buyers who are having potentially
 
01:01:42.349 --> 01:01:42.359 align:start position:0%
respiratory issues who have children who
 
01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
are asthmatic who having issues with
 
01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
heating the home how they choose
 
01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
to be it propane natural gas or wood or
 
01:01:57.870 --> 01:01:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:01.870 --> 01:02:01.880 align:start position:0%
so you're correct we're here at because
 
01:02:05.109 --> 01:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
we will build the homes to code and if
 
01:02:07.150 --> 01:02:07.160 align:start position:0%
we have to get to three air exchanges
 
01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:10.079 align:start position:0%
per hour then they
 
01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:13.720 align:start position:0%
will but then they could be telling the
 
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
consumer when you go in the
 
01:02:18.349 --> 01:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
house kind like your mom did all those
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
years ago she was correct open up a
 
01:02:24.349 --> 01:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
window so any Energy savings is
 
01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
literally going out the window now
 
01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
because you're trying to get some air in
 
01:02:30.109 --> 01:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
there there was a project in which
 
01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:31.960 align:start position:0%
federal money was involved it was for
 
01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:33.789 align:start position:0%
federal money was involved it was for
low-income

01:02:33.789 --> 01:02:33.799 align:start position:0%
low-income
 
01:02:37.309 --> 01:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
housing the Builder went in built to
 
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
three air exchanges got the
 
01:02:42.069 --> 01:02:42.079 align:start position:0%
approvals then had to go back into each
 
01:02:45.789 --> 01:02:45.799 align:start position:0%
of the units and put in a small about
 
01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
almost a baseball size
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
vent with a little lever that the tenant
 
01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
could open it up to let some fresh air
 
01:02:59.630 --> 01:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
tight thank you representative BR has a
 
01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:07.960 align:start position:0%
question so the um five exchange is part
 
01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
of the 2021 energy code yes follow up
 
01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:13.640 align:start position:0%
follow up and is there any other part of
 
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
the code that you want were willing to
 
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
adopt we have to look at it more ma'am I
 
01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
don't have it I wasn't prepared to
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
answer that question today but when we
 
01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
talked about the 2018 versus 21 energy
 
01:03:29.710 --> 01:03:29.720 align:start position:0%
codes the home builder Association had
 
01:03:33.069 --> 01:03:33.079 align:start position:0%
asked we're willing to
 
01:03:36.789 --> 01:03:36.799 align:start position:0%
compromise on that 21 energy code and we
 
01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
were informed three times All or
 
01:03:44.829 --> 01:03:44.839 align:start position:0%
nothing I asked there are some things we
 
01:03:47.789 --> 01:03:47.799 align:start position:0%
like like the air exchange and that's
 
01:03:49.269 --> 01:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
why we kind of waited that's what we
 
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
went outside the
 
01:03:53.950 --> 01:03:53.960 align:start position:0%
process there are things we like in the
 
01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
21 codes but when you given all or
 
01:04:00.349 --> 01:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
nothing that's what we're instructed
 
01:04:04.190 --> 01:04:04.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you other questions represent
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
baay thank
 
01:04:10.230 --> 01:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
you am I to understand that the this
 
01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
international code originally said three
 
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
and that the new code will be
 
01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:18.760 align:start position:0%
five why have they decided to move from
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
five CDC EPA Harvard Public Health
 
01:04:28.510 --> 01:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
Health W World Health Organization
 
01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
they're all saying we have to go to
 
01:04:34.109 --> 01:04:34.119 align:start position:0%
five thank
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much Mr you have
 
01:04:39.430 --> 01:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
another question
 
01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.549 align:start position:0%
another question
fromy

01:04:41.549 --> 01:04:41.559 align:start position:0%
fromy
 
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
one thank you madam chair for your
 
01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
Indulgence thank you for taking my
 
01:04:49.230 --> 01:04:49.240 align:start position:0%
question in terms of
 
01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:53.480 align:start position:0%
2021 building code which in know
 
01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
building builders association totally
 
01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:00.760 align:start position:0%
opposed the energy code wasn't part of
 
01:05:03.430 --> 01:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
the climate change the world Health all
 
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
those supported that too in terms of
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
energy code so how is that different now
 
01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
just one piece of
 
01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
it anywhere between $20,000 and
 
01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
$94,000 made the difference in that
 
01:05:25.269 --> 01:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
because yes we liked aspects of the 21
 
01:05:25.279 --> 01:05:26.589 align:start position:0%
because yes we liked aspects of the 21
energy

01:05:26.589 --> 01:05:26.599 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
codes but not things that would cost the
 
01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
consumer and place Consumer Debt onto
 
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
the backs of home buyers between 20,000
 
01:05:38.109 --> 01:05:38.119 align:start position:0%
and $94,000 depending if appendix a was
 
01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
adopted by the state or municipalities
 
01:05:43.870 --> 01:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
or not so agree with you we found things
 
01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
we liked we found things we wanted to do
 
01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
but we were
 
01:05:50.549 --> 01:05:50.559 align:start position:0%
instructed as in order to get the
 
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
federal money that some people have
 
01:05:57.990 --> 01:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
wanted it was all or nothing nothing no
 
01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
changes thank you
 
01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you for your testimony thank
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:20.190 --> 01:06:20.200 align:start position:0%
Sherman thank you madam chair members of
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
the committee I had hoped to sit on my
 
01:06:24.029 --> 01:06:24.039 align:start position:0%
hands today
 
01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
but if I can go back through a couple of
 
01:06:28.589 --> 01:06:28.599 align:start position:0%
questions and points that have been
 
01:06:31.549 --> 01:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
raised um I'll start with the last one
 
01:06:33.150 --> 01:06:33.160 align:start position:0%
that there were no changes there are in
 
01:06:36.549 --> 01:06:36.559 align:start position:0%
fact changes to the 2018 energy code are
 
01:06:39.069 --> 01:06:39.079 align:start position:0%
amendments that are still in effect so
 
01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
we've already mucked with that code a
 
01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
little bit we simply proposed to stay
 
01:06:47.269 --> 01:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
with the code the way it was um the vote
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
as Mr Mayberry indicated was was 12 to
 
01:06:53.589 --> 01:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
one um and I think the general sense was
 
01:06:55.829 --> 01:06:55.839 align:start position:0%
that much of the public testimony from
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
the American Institute of Architects uh
 
01:07:01.269 --> 01:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
this organization NE which is a national
 
01:07:03.269 --> 01:07:03.279 align:start position:0%
Energy Group that I I forget the name of
 
01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
it uh was if you're gonna if you're GNA
 
01:07:08.910 --> 01:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
give up on the 2021 code don't
 
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
cherry-pick the nice stuff that's in
 
01:07:13.549 --> 01:07:13.559 align:start position:0%
there stay with the 18 code the way you
 
01:07:16.589 --> 01:07:16.599 align:start position:0%
have it basically so I I don't think it
 
01:07:18.829 --> 01:07:18.839 align:start position:0%
was the sense of the board as much as
 
01:07:21.950 --> 01:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
the sense of the uh testimony which then
 
01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:23.720 align:start position:0%
led to the vote of the
 
01:07:27.269 --> 01:07:27.279 align:start position:0%
board um I want to rewind back to a
 
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
question that or more a comment that was
 
01:07:32.309 --> 01:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
made I don't believe of the 17 members
 
01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
on the building code review board
 
01:07:36.069 --> 01:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
there's anybody that questions the
 
01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
authority of the general court we are
 
01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:40.599 align:start position:0%
fully aware and we remind each other
 
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
frequently of the hierarchy that that we
 
01:07:45.870 --> 01:07:45.880 align:start position:0%
live within uh and I'm per speaking for
 
01:07:47.829 --> 01:07:47.839 align:start position:0%
myself I'm not at all uncomfortable with
 
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
that I don't
 
01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
need bureaucrats call it writing rules
 
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
without the Public's representative is
 
01:07:58.430 --> 01:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
having a having a a very loud say so
 
01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:00.109 align:start position:0%
having a having a a very loud say so
however

01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
um if I can put words in my own mouth I
 
01:08:06.109 --> 01:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
would hope that the general Court's view
 
01:08:08.589 --> 01:08:08.599 align:start position:0%
of what we do is to sort of reserve the
 
01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:11.480 align:start position:0%
right for a veto rather than to write
 
01:08:13.710 --> 01:08:13.720 align:start position:0%
the stuff themselves this does come
 
01:08:16.590 --> 01:08:16.600 align:start position:0%
through a model code process and then
 
01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
massaged by the people on the building
 
01:08:21.030 --> 01:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
code review board with the expertise to
 
01:08:23.309 --> 01:08:23.319 align:start position:0%
deal with this and then to the general
 
01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
court just to make sure that we're not
 
01:08:31.269 --> 01:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
now let me get to one other point and
 
01:08:36.510 --> 01:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
then I'll focus on the problem and maybe
 
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
offer a
 
01:08:40.189 --> 01:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
solution uh the other question was
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
whether this amends the 2018 code and
 
01:08:44.669 --> 01:08:44.679 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes the way this is
 
01:08:47.229 --> 01:08:47.239 align:start position:0%
written we're required to write an
 
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
amendment to the 2018 ICC so if in some
 
01:08:54.269 --> 01:08:54.279 align:start position:0%
point in the future the 28 code is not
 
01:08:56.149 --> 01:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
the state energy code anymore we'll
 
01:08:57.910 --> 01:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
still be writing amendments to some code
 
01:09:00.149 --> 01:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
that doesn't matter and this bill would
 
01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
need to be relooked at and and fiddled
 
01:09:06.030 --> 01:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
with at that point now my proposed
 
01:09:07.870 --> 01:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
solution and I don't know if it fits in
 
01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
with the general court schedule we have
 
01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
a meeting coming up in may we have
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
another meeting coming up on June
 
01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
14th um we would have the ability if the
 
01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
home builder so chose uh for them to
 
01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
resubmit that Amendment at our May
 
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
meeting we could have the public hearing
 
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
vote on the 14th of June it would
 
01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
require once again changing the date in
 
01:09:30.319 --> 01:09:31.630 align:start position:0%
require once again changing the date in
HB

01:09:31.630 --> 01:09:31.640 align:start position:0%
HB
 
01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
1059 uh it's 1059 not
 
01:09:37.309 --> 01:09:37.319 align:start position:0%
1056 um to June
 
01:09:39.630 --> 01:09:39.640 align:start position:0%
14th we're already in need of changing
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
it to May anyway so the only question is
 
01:09:45.590 --> 01:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
whether that leaves uh you all and our
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
all the other people that come into the
 
01:09:51.309 --> 01:09:51.319 align:start position:0%
mix enough time to to deal with that um
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
and at that point I guess somebody could
 
01:09:55.870 --> 01:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
decide to just pass this bill Bill if we
 
01:09:59.149 --> 01:09:59.159 align:start position:0%
deny it again or get rid of the bill if
 
01:10:02.830 --> 01:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
we approve that amendment I do think I
 
01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
have a copy of the amendment that was
 
01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
submitted and the justification
 
01:10:10.030 --> 01:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
consisted of three words reduction in
 
01:10:12.550 --> 01:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
requirements um the testimony at the
 
01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:14.679 align:start position:0%
public hearing was heavily in favor of
 
01:10:18.149 --> 01:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
staying with the 2018 code given what Mr
 
01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
Mayberry testified this morning they may
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
want to add more to that or bring in
 
01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
others uh to to inform the board more
 
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
than we were informed the first
 
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
time so I don't know if that works but
 
01:10:33.790 --> 01:10:33.800 align:start position:0%
that would be one way to get out of this
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
Jam thank you are there any questions
 
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative leus and then go over
 
01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you um so I I'm trying to I'd like
 
01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
to know what the justification is for
 
01:10:47.070 --> 01:10:47.080 align:start position:0%
just deciding that you're not going to
 
01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
cherry pick it it's not clear what the
 
01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
reason is I thought the the purpose of
 
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
the board was to make judgment calls and
 
01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
it would seem like if there are good
 
01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
things in the new code why wouldn't the
 
01:10:58.270 --> 01:10:58.280 align:start position:0%
board consider accepting them it sounds
 
01:11:01.350 --> 01:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
like they was just rejected for offand
 
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
case we as you as everybody else are are
 
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
trying to find a balance between one
 
01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
part of society that thinks the more
 
01:11:17.470 --> 01:11:17.480 align:start position:0%
regulations on energy the better and
 
01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
other parts that are saying it costs too
 
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
much it impacts housing and all the
 
01:11:25.390 --> 01:11:25.400 align:start position:0%
other things that go into the mix um so
 
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
don't believe that it was a a shoot from
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
the hip decision at all but this was
 
01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
worked out over many many sessions and
 
01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
the and the the premise started with
 
01:11:39.430 --> 01:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
writing lots of amendments to the 2021
 
01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
code in order to make it sort of equal
 
01:11:45.629 --> 01:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
to 2018 code that resulted I think in 54
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
additional amendments that were needed
 
01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
to our process it was going to just
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
break the back of the process so the
 
01:11:54.030 --> 01:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
decision was to just stay with the 2018
 
01:11:57.870 --> 01:11:57.880 align:start position:0%
code uh but at that
 
01:12:00.990 --> 01:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
point that that side of the argument if
 
01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
you will had already gotten the majority
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
of what they wanted so I think there
 
01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
were people on the board that just said
 
01:12:10.270 --> 01:12:10.280 align:start position:0%
you know you you've got that much we're
 
01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
still trying to find some kind of a it's
 
01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
never going to be a consensus but at
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
least some meeting in the middle here uh
 
01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
there was another amendment and that is
 
01:12:22.189 --> 01:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
that the that the 2021 code changes
 
01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
marac County to a less restricted
 
01:12:28.990 --> 01:12:29.000 align:start position:0%
climate zone because it's getting warmer
 
01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
um and that also was turned down but it
 
01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
wasn't submitted back as a bill here um
 
01:12:37.709 --> 01:12:37.719 align:start position:0%
so yeah we could write our own energy
 
01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
code and sort of start from scratch but
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
that's not how new hure is done it to
 
01:12:44.430 --> 01:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
this point all right thank
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
you I'm shocked to hear that the
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
building C review board is a political
 
01:12:52.350 --> 01:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
body representative
 
01:12:56.350 --> 01:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
Goldie thank you madam chair and
 
01:12:57.870 --> 01:12:57.880 align:start position:0%
just a quick because I saw you know on
 
01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
your head when I asked about the change
 
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
from the seven exchanges to the three
 
01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
when that was made and if you could just
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
go over that time frame and how long the
 
01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
three exchanges has been in place so I
 
01:13:11.790 --> 01:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
looked that up this morning before I
 
01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
came just so I had it with me uh the
 
01:13:17.669 --> 01:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
2009 series of international codes came
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
into effect in April of
 
01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
2010 in New Hampshire uh that set the
 
01:13:25.709 --> 01:13:25.719 align:start position:0%
seven air changes I don't I didn't look
 
01:13:29.709 --> 01:13:29.719 align:start position:0%
at what happened before that uh 2015 for
 
01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
those of you who are around remember was
 
01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
a bit of a tussle getting those codes
 
01:13:35.189 --> 01:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
accepted is that putting it politely
 
01:13:38.709 --> 01:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
enough um and that resulted in a series
 
01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
of amendments that were deferred and
 
01:13:43.550 --> 01:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
they triggered on March of
 
01:13:46.149 --> 01:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
2022 so on March of
 
01:13:50.030 --> 01:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
2022 we're on the 15 code still was
 
01:13:52.590 --> 01:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
amended to seven and then it reverted to
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
the base code in March of 22 to three
 
01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
then when we came to the 18 code in July
 
01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
of 2022 it still was three so this this
 
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
threee change requirement has been in
 
01:14:08.669 --> 01:14:08.679 align:start position:0%
effect in New Hampshire since March of
 
01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
2022 four year or two years um the model
 
01:14:15.550 --> 01:14:15.560 align:start position:0%
code has reverted it went from seven
 
01:14:17.070 --> 01:14:17.080 align:start position:0%
then it went to three for a couple of
 
01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
additions now it's going to five so
 
01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
somebody out there thinks that there's a
 
01:14:24.149 --> 01:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
problem with the three I'm not here to
 
01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
speak about the sign sence everybody
 
01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
seems to have their own science on these
 
01:14:31.470 --> 01:14:31.480 align:start position:0%
things but uh somebody at the model code
 
01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
level thinks that five is a better
 
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
number than
 
01:14:37.830 --> 01:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
three um so as with Bill McKenna I'm
 
01:14:39.950 --> 01:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
here more talking about the
 
01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
process I think representative Schmidt
 
01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
put it well it's it's perhaps a good
 
01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
answer with a bad process um or or a
 
01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
less desirable process let's put it that
 
01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
way thank you any other other
 
01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
questions repres
 
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
time thank you madam chair um I'm in
 
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
agreement and and that I want to be
 
01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:04.760 align:start position:0%
careful how we proceed with process
 
01:15:07.149 --> 01:15:07.159 align:start position:0%
because what we don't want is 25
 
01:15:09.830 --> 01:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
amendments coming to this committee um
 
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
all asking to override the decision of
 
01:15:16.270 --> 01:15:16.280 align:start position:0%
the the review board um how and we'll
 
01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
have two already this year uh the 21
 
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
energy code and then this this request
 
01:15:23.550 --> 01:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
here however I want to be able to
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
balance that with not just becoming a
 
01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
rubber stamp for the building code
 
01:15:28.709 --> 01:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
review board where we don't take up
 
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
anything uh that's contradictory to the
 
01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
board's findings because that's not our
 
01:15:34.430 --> 01:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
job our job is to actually review what
 
01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
you've done and make a sound decision on
 
01:15:38.149 --> 01:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
it so I am still struggling and there's
 
01:15:39.629 --> 01:15:39.639 align:start position:0%
a question I promise I am still
 
01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
struggling to find that that balance in
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
this situation where somebody didn't
 
01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
like it and we've been asked to pick it
 
01:15:45.199 --> 01:15:46.750 align:start position:0%
like it and we've been asked to pick it
up

01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:15:49.229 --> 01:15:49.239 align:start position:0%
um you have mentioned potentially going
 
01:15:50.990 --> 01:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
back to the building code review board
 
01:15:54.629 --> 01:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
with an amendment to address this issue
 
01:15:54.639 --> 01:15:56.350 align:start position:0%
with an amendment to address this issue
um

01:15:56.350 --> 01:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:58.590 --> 01:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
but but where does it where in that
 
01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
process would we would fit the idea that
 
01:16:04.310 --> 01:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
well this is just what the legislative
 
01:16:05.750 --> 01:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
body wants to do whether the building
 
01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
code review board wants it done that way
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
or not so if you go back and you have
 
01:16:12.149 --> 01:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
the conversation and the building code
 
01:16:13.270 --> 01:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
review board decides that they don't
 
01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
want to do this but the legislative body
 
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
decides that it does or vice versa um
 
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
what's what's the benefit then at that
 
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
point of going back to you for the
 
01:16:25.149 --> 01:16:25.159 align:start position:0%
process I'm I'm trying to balance bance
 
01:16:26.910 --> 01:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
those things and figure that out the
 
01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
benefit would only be the Cho the chance
 
01:16:30.390 --> 01:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
that the building code review board
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
would change their mind and and approve
 
01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment it would be a resubmittal
 
01:16:38.189 --> 01:16:38.199 align:start position:0%
of the amendment that was previously
 
01:16:43.229 --> 01:16:43.239 align:start position:0%
submitted in August of last year um with
 
01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:45.400 align:start position:0%
better backup
 
01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
justification one quick followup follow
 
01:16:50.590 --> 01:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
um because as I'm listening to testimony
 
01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:53.480 align:start position:0%
I I feel like what I'm hearing is
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes we get a little bit p ized in
 
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
our understanding of issues and we get
 
01:16:59.870 --> 01:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
locked into our way of thinking um
 
01:17:01.669 --> 01:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
thinking that one way is a solution when
 
01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
it's really not a total solution so on
 
01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
the one side we can locked into the idea
 
01:17:07.950 --> 01:17:07.960 align:start position:0%
that um by lowering the code standards
 
01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
and having seven or eight they we
 
01:17:11.709 --> 01:17:11.719 align:start position:0%
actually saving people money because
 
01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
then you're literally just blowing heat
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
out the door and expenses actually going
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
up over time um so that's not
 
01:17:18.310 --> 01:17:18.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily the case or the other
 
01:17:19.629 --> 01:17:19.639 align:start position:0%
direction just tightening and tightening
 
01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
and tightening is good um so would it be
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
safe to characterize the conversation
 
01:17:25.709 --> 01:17:25.719 align:start position:0%
with when it comes to these things it's
 
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
a bell curve we're looking for The Sweet
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
Spot in between the tightness of the
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
home and the affordability and that at
 
01:17:33.550 --> 01:17:33.560 align:start position:0%
some point we're going to fall off the
 
01:17:35.310 --> 01:17:35.320 align:start position:0%
horse on either on either side would
 
01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
that be a that be a way of illustrating
 
01:17:39.310 --> 01:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
it from your perspective I'm just trying
 
01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
to understand that a little
 
01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
bit I don't know okay this is a this is
 
01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
a societal discussion that's going on
 
01:17:52.149 --> 01:17:52.159 align:start position:0%
way out here and we're a little piece of
 
01:17:54.189 --> 01:17:54.199 align:start position:0%
it uh we're not going to resolve
 
01:17:54.199 --> 01:17:55.910 align:start position:0%
it uh we're not going to resolve
society's

01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
society's
 
01:17:57.669 --> 01:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
discussion thank you appreciate that
 
01:17:59.430 --> 01:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
answer other
 
01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
questions representative gold thank you
 
01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:03.560 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
question and please forgive my dyslexic
 
01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
mind trying to Grapple with
 
01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
this I keep flopping back and
 
01:18:15.790 --> 01:18:15.800 align:start position:0%
forth can you just keep it simple for
 
01:18:19.470 --> 01:18:19.480 align:start position:0%
the stupid and explain
 
01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
how what is the difference between 3
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
five and seven like is this about money
 
01:18:26.830 --> 01:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
is this about health is this like what
 
01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
is the why would we go I I'm confused
 
01:18:33.430 --> 01:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
the answer to the first part of your
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
question I don't know if I can keep it
 
01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
simple but I'll try uh this is a leakage
 
01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:41.560 align:start position:0%
test it's like blowing up a balloon they
 
01:18:42.910 --> 01:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
put a fan in the door and they
 
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
pressurize the building and they see how
 
01:18:46.590 --> 01:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
much air leaks out and I understood that
 
01:18:49.709 --> 01:18:49.719 align:start position:0%
part so more air leaking out means you
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
can have more cracks for instance let's
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
just call it that more leaks less air
 
01:18:57.229 --> 01:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
means you've got to construct it tighter
 
01:18:59.709 --> 01:18:59.719 align:start position:0%
so all of that goes into the I don't
 
01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:01.880 align:start position:0%
know how many different pieces there are
 
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
in a typical house but it's got to be
 
01:19:07.189 --> 01:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
seven figures by nails and 2x4s and this
 
01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
all these things have to come together
 
01:19:11.070 --> 01:19:11.080 align:start position:0%
old windows cracks where the walls more
 
01:19:14.189 --> 01:19:14.199 align:start position:0%
seiling and as Mr Mayberry indicated
 
01:19:16.910 --> 01:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
that the the mechanics of actually doing
 
01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:20.320 align:start position:0%
the test uh I keep hearing about the the
 
01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh HVAC the air conditioning vents under
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
the kitchen cabinet or the bathroom
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
cabin cabinet now those are a problem um
 
01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
it it increases the amount of detail
 
01:19:34.629 --> 01:19:34.639 align:start position:0%
work that a contractor has to do to seal
 
01:19:36.629 --> 01:19:36.639 align:start position:0%
up this
 
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
house not to be rud but Madam can I
 
01:19:41.709 --> 01:19:41.719 align:start position:0%
follow up to help clarify what I'm
 
01:19:44.229 --> 01:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
trying to understand is the numbers my
 
01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
dyslexia is with
 
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
numbers three five and seven what's
 
01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
better what's worse why is there a
 
01:19:55.070 --> 01:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
difference what your criteria is the
 
01:19:58.430 --> 01:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
tighter the house is the less energy you
 
01:20:01.950 --> 01:20:01.960 align:start position:0%
will need to heat or cool it so that so
 
01:20:03.990 --> 01:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
that you want to have as little air
 
01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
leakage as possible to minimize the
 
01:20:08.990 --> 01:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
amount of energy so they went if you if
 
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
you go with more leakage it also
 
01:20:17.790 --> 01:20:17.800 align:start position:0%
produces more fresh air and it doesn't
 
01:20:21.229 --> 01:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
seal in the contaminants so that's what
 
01:20:23.950 --> 01:20:23.960 align:start position:0%
the the issue is lower is a better
 
01:20:26.110 --> 01:20:26.120 align:start position:0%
number is it tighter number if it was
 
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
Zero there would be no leakage at all so
 
01:20:32.910 --> 01:20:32.920 align:start position:0%
can I just state to try to understand
 
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
clearly so we had seven which meant
 
01:20:39.870 --> 01:20:39.880 align:start position:0%
fresher air but more energy leakage and
 
01:20:41.229 --> 01:20:41.239 align:start position:0%
that's where we're getting into the
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
political bigger and then we went down
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
to five and then we went down to three
 
01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
but now at three though it's doing the
 
01:20:50.510 --> 01:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
energy thing maybe that some purists
 
01:20:53.229 --> 01:20:53.239 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to say like it's
 
01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
causing some health issues issues so
 
01:20:57.110 --> 01:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
that's bringing in some and you're all
 
01:20:58.990 --> 01:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
caught in the middle of all that
 
01:21:00.590 --> 01:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
controversy and that's why we're being
 
01:21:03.629 --> 01:21:03.639 align:start position:0%
asked to look at this we we went from
 
01:21:06.189 --> 01:21:06.199 align:start position:0%
seven to three and then the model codes
 
01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
and this proposed bill go back to
 
01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
five um okay I don't know why the model
 
01:21:14.070 --> 01:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
code changed that some of it may have
 
01:21:16.510 --> 01:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
been Health arguments the CDC weighs in
 
01:21:19.070 --> 01:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
there somewhere uh and some of it may be
 
01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:21.030 align:start position:0%
there somewhere uh and some of it may be
constructibility

01:21:21.030 --> 01:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
constructibility
 
01:21:22.990 --> 01:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
arguments representative Schmid you have
 
01:21:25.350 --> 01:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
a question thank you m
 
01:21:29.149 --> 01:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
here so I empathize with everybody here
 
01:21:32.669 --> 01:21:32.679 align:start position:0%
because life is a confusing series of
 
01:21:35.070 --> 01:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
successive approximations as we used to
 
01:21:39.390 --> 01:21:39.400 align:start position:0%
say in in music we're going to sing an
 
01:21:43.149 --> 01:21:43.159 align:start position:0%
approximat um but how about older
 
01:21:46.950 --> 01:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
buildings because most of the most of
 
01:21:48.590 --> 01:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
the housing and buildings have been
 
01:21:50.709 --> 01:21:50.719 align:start position:0%
there for a long time my home my
 
01:21:52.189 --> 01:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
building has been there for over a
 
01:21:56.669 --> 01:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
hundred years and uh so to the degree
 
01:21:57.750 --> 01:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:00.760 align:start position:0%
are you can thank all of us we're here
 
01:22:04.149 --> 01:22:04.159 align:start position:0%
heating the outdoors in the winter time
 
01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
and uh we're cooling the outdoors in the
 
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
summer time but uh where are they are
 
01:22:15.910 --> 01:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
older buildings inherently more friendly
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
to the health of the occupant but more
 
01:22:21.030 --> 01:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
unfriendly to their
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
pocketbook uh so because we have to
 
01:22:26.229 --> 01:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
think about them too
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
I guess I would just ask some of us are
 
01:22:30.790 --> 01:22:30.800 align:start position:0%
of a certain age is how many people with
 
01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
asthma did we know when we were children
 
01:22:38.189 --> 01:22:38.199 align:start position:0%
not that many um in terms of existing
 
01:22:39.990 --> 01:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
buildings though again the energy code
 
01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't come into play at all until you
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
do a project till you alter it change
 
01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
the occupancy or whatever and at that
 
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
point basically what you do you do by
 
01:22:53.870 --> 01:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
the new code so I replace a window or
 
01:22:56.510 --> 01:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
whatever it is is and there are some
 
01:22:58.910 --> 01:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
significant exceptions in the energy
 
01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
code for work in existing buildings I
 
01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
open up a wall I only have to put in how
 
01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
much insulation will fit for instance
 
01:23:09.870 --> 01:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
and other exceptions to that ilk and New
 
01:23:12.390 --> 01:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire expanded those exceptions
 
01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
which were designed for alterations to
 
01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
what we refer to as changes of occupancy
 
01:23:19.390 --> 01:23:19.400 align:start position:0%
so somebody wants to change that office
 
01:23:21.990 --> 01:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
building back to a residence those
 
01:23:24.189 --> 01:23:24.199 align:start position:0%
exceptions would now now work we got
 
01:23:27.149 --> 01:23:27.159 align:start position:0%
that done last year so there are
 
01:23:29.430 --> 01:23:29.440 align:start position:0%
significant Provisions that relax this
 
01:23:32.110 --> 01:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
stuff for uh existing buildings
 
01:23:34.590 --> 01:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
represent follow just to followup so but
 
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:38.320 align:start position:0%
you're still coming before us e echoing
 
01:23:41.229 --> 01:23:41.239 align:start position:0%
Mr McKenna's recommendation to vote no
 
01:23:43.950 --> 01:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
on this Bill yes thank you that's
 
01:23:47.149 --> 01:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
correct all right any other
 
01:23:50.830 --> 01:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
01:23:53.149 --> 01:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
does anyone else wish to testify on
 
01:23:56.110 --> 01:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 37
 
01:23:59.629 --> 01:23:59.639 align:start position:0%
3 all right I will close the
 
01:24:03.669 --> 01:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
hearing and we have another hearing

Senate Bill 440 and I call the prime
 
02:18:01.709 --> 02:18:01.719 align:start position:0%

District 8 and I'm here today with the
 
02:18:15.870 --> 02:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:19.669 --> 02:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
440 doctors of automaty in New Hampshire
 
02:18:22.589 --> 02:18:22.599 align:start position:0%
concurrently practice only what the
 
02:18:24.790 --> 02:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
statute specifically
 
02:18:27.709 --> 02:18:27.719 align:start position:0%
allows this puts the legislator in the
 
02:18:30.110 --> 02:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
position of making clinical
 
02:18:32.509 --> 02:18:32.519 align:start position:0%
decisions I believe the time has come
 
02:18:35.030 --> 02:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
for doctors of automet to be treated in
 
02:18:40.070 --> 02:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
the Statue like other doctor level care
 
02:18:44.349 --> 02:18:44.359 align:start position:0%
providers s sp44 does just that in a
 
02:18:47.030 --> 02:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
nutshell it authorizes the board of
 
02:18:49.709 --> 02:18:49.719 align:start position:0%
Optometry to regulate the practice of
 
02:18:51.709 --> 02:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
Optometry by determining the
 
02:18:54.589 --> 02:18:54.599 align:start position:0%
qualifications of certain procedures and
 
02:18:57.629 --> 02:18:57.639 align:start position:0%
provides a list of procedures excluded
 
02:19:00.190 --> 02:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
from the practice of
 
02:19:02.509 --> 02:19:02.519 align:start position:0%
Optometry based upon curricula from
 
02:19:04.709 --> 02:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
schools of Optometry these doctors
 
02:19:07.190 --> 02:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
attend and based upon many years of
 
02:19:09.589 --> 02:19:09.599 align:start position:0%
Performing Advanced procedures in other
 
02:19:12.190 --> 02:19:12.200 align:start position:0%
states the Senate believes that
 
02:19:13.990 --> 02:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
experience and evidence clearly
 
02:19:16.509 --> 02:19:16.519 align:start position:0%
demonstrates doctors of autometer are
 
02:19:19.070 --> 02:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
fully capable of Performing Advanced
 
02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:21.110 align:start position:0%
fully capable of Performing Advanced
procedures

02:19:21.110 --> 02:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
02:19:23.870 --> 02:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
the Senate Edna committee unanimously
 
02:19:26.429 --> 02:19:26.439 align:start position:0%
recommend passage with an amendment and
 
02:19:28.509 --> 02:19:28.519 align:start position:0%
the bill passed the full Senate on a
 
02:19:28.519 --> 02:19:29.790 align:start position:0%
the bill passed the full Senate on a
Voice

02:19:29.790 --> 02:19:29.800 align:start position:0%
Voice
 
02:19:33.469 --> 02:19:33.479 align:start position:0%
vote s440 will eliminate the need for
 
02:19:35.709 --> 02:19:35.719 align:start position:0%
new legislation each time there is a
 
02:19:38.790 --> 02:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
change in curriculum this is important
 
02:19:41.150 --> 02:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
to the citizens of our state as our
 
02:19:43.870 --> 02:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
aging population and eye health issues
 
02:19:45.870 --> 02:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
are outpacing
 
02:19:49.230 --> 02:19:49.240 align:start position:0%
providers s SP 440 makes other updates
 
02:19:51.910 --> 02:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
to the opom statute that will be
 
02:19:54.510 --> 02:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
described in subsequent
 
02:19:56.790 --> 02:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
testimony the map of authorized
 
02:19:58.790 --> 02:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
procedures across the country makes no
 
02:20:01.950 --> 02:20:01.960 align:start position:0%
sense Doctors of Optometry do not lose
 
02:20:04.110 --> 02:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
or gain a capability when they cross
 
02:20:07.230 --> 02:20:07.240 align:start position:0%
state lines it's time the regulatory
 
02:20:09.389 --> 02:20:09.399 align:start position:0%
board of this profession like other
 
02:20:11.950 --> 02:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
health care professions is allowed to
 
02:20:13.910 --> 02:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
make these decisions based upon
 
02:20:17.070 --> 02:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
Education and Training not
 
02:20:19.150 --> 02:20:19.160 align:start position:0%
politics there are ample people
 
02:20:21.710 --> 02:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
presenting testimony in FA of
 
02:20:24.710 --> 02:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
h440 they can speak in more detail and
 
02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
answer questions
 
02:20:29.990 --> 02:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
fully on a personal note this issue
 
02:20:32.469 --> 02:20:32.479 align:start position:0%
between Opthomologist and Optometry is
 
02:20:34.790 --> 02:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
really nothing new that has existed
 
02:20:37.510 --> 02:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
across many professional lines I think
 
02:20:39.870 --> 02:20:39.880 align:start position:0%
of teachers and Par
 
02:20:39.880 --> 02:20:41.750 align:start position:0%
of teachers and Par
professionals

02:20:41.750 --> 02:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
02:20:45.389 --> 02:20:45.399 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologists and nurse and
 
02:20:48.150 --> 02:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
anesthetists there are a lot of areas
 
02:20:51.389 --> 02:20:51.399 align:start position:0%
where the professions are sort of
 
02:20:54.270 --> 02:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
overlapping but not quite and I think we
 
02:20:57.790 --> 02:20:57.800 align:start position:0%
all work very well together regardless
 
02:21:00.630 --> 02:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
what we do we work together for the best
 
02:21:02.590 --> 02:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
for our patients that we are taking care
 
02:21:05.150 --> 02:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
of thank you very
 
02:21:11.190 --> 02:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:13.030 --> 02:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
Senator Senator if there are any
 
02:21:14.270 --> 02:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
questions I think there are people
 
02:21:16.870 --> 02:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
behind me that could better answer them
 
02:21:18.870 --> 02:21:18.880 align:start position:0%

Susi thank you thank you very much Madam
 
02:21:36.630 --> 02:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee for
 
02:21:38.590 --> 02:21:38.600 align:start position:0%
the record I'm Donna Susi I represent
 
02:21:40.630 --> 02:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
Senate District 18 which is the town of
 
02:21:44.150 --> 02:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
Lichfield and five Wards in the city of
 
02:21:46.910 --> 02:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
Manchester and I'm here testifying today
 
02:21:50.190 --> 02:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
in support of Senate Bill 440 um a bill
 
02:21:52.630 --> 02:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
that received uh a great deal of
 
02:21:55.590 --> 02:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
attention in the Senate and a lot of
 
02:21:58.389 --> 02:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
consideration um I'm appearing here for
 
02:22:00.270 --> 02:22:00.280 align:start position:0%
two specific reasons and I know there
 
02:22:03.510 --> 02:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
are a ton of experts that will get into
 
02:22:06.550 --> 02:22:06.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of the more technical issues that
 
02:22:09.670 --> 02:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
this bill contemplates but I think that
 
02:22:12.230 --> 02:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
legislation is necessary and I do think
 
02:22:14.910 --> 02:22:14.920 align:start position:0%
it's long overdue
 
02:22:19.830 --> 02:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
um the medical profession typically
 
02:22:22.870 --> 02:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
governs itself self through rules um
 
02:22:26.830 --> 02:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
regarding scope of practice and in this
 
02:22:29.750 --> 02:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
instance Optometry is almost totally
 
02:22:32.830 --> 02:22:32.840 align:start position:0%
defined in statute making it a lot
 
02:22:35.429 --> 02:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
harder to keep up with advances in
 
02:22:38.790 --> 02:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
science medicine and even changes in
 
02:22:41.950 --> 02:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
curriculum um that it provided at the
 
02:22:45.469 --> 02:22:45.479 align:start position:0%
university college level um when these
 
02:22:47.230 --> 02:22:47.240 align:start position:0%
practitioners are pursuing their
 
02:22:49.630 --> 02:22:49.640 align:start position:0%
education there have been a number of
 
02:22:53.110 --> 02:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
things that have been added to their
 
02:22:55.590 --> 02:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
curriculum um that are procedures not
 
02:22:57.870 --> 02:22:57.880 align:start position:0%
currently contemplated within the scope
 
02:23:00.550 --> 02:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
of practice by the statute but I think
 
02:23:02.270 --> 02:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
the other issue for me that is of
 
02:23:05.590 --> 02:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
particular importance is access and
 
02:23:07.110 --> 02:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
access to healthc care I think it's
 
02:23:09.750 --> 02:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
something that we are all cognizant of
 
02:23:13.790 --> 02:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
and that we all um strive to ensure our
 
02:23:17.469 --> 02:23:17.479 align:start position:0%
constituents have proper access and in
 
02:23:21.910 --> 02:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
this case um given the rati IO of the
 
02:23:24.990 --> 02:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
two professions that we're talking about
 
02:23:28.190 --> 02:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
I think there are many examples and some
 
02:23:30.590 --> 02:23:30.600 align:start position:0%
of them you will hear today where people
 
02:23:35.670 --> 02:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
have had to wait months for referrals to
 
02:23:38.750 --> 02:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
another practitioner um and they have
 
02:23:41.190 --> 02:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
been you know suffering with whatever
 
02:23:43.349 --> 02:23:43.359 align:start position:0%
the condition is for a longer period of
 
02:23:45.190 --> 02:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
time and they issues that could have
 
02:23:49.309 --> 02:23:49.319 align:start position:0%
been treated by the optometrist at the
 
02:23:50.950 --> 02:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
point that the patient
 
02:23:53.830 --> 02:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
presents um particularly in rural areas
 
02:23:56.389 --> 02:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
of our state that is increasingly a
 
02:23:59.349 --> 02:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
problem um it's also a problem in places
 
02:24:01.670 --> 02:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
like where I live in Manchester a large
 
02:24:03.150 --> 02:24:03.160 align:start position:0%
city that has many
 
02:24:06.510 --> 02:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
practitioners um specializing in this
 
02:24:09.670 --> 02:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
field um there are people that are not
 
02:24:13.150 --> 02:24:13.160 align:start position:0%
able to access this critical health care
 
02:24:16.910 --> 02:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
and um your vision is something that is
 
02:24:19.590 --> 02:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
so so critically important I mean I look
 
02:24:21.309 --> 02:24:21.319 align:start position:0%
around this room how many folks are
 
02:24:23.550 --> 02:24:23.560 align:start position:0%
wearing glasses uh I myself am wearing
 
02:24:26.269 --> 02:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
contact lenses th this is truly
 
02:24:30.070 --> 02:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
important and the procedures beyond that
 
02:24:34.510 --> 02:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
that could easily be treated sooner and
 
02:24:37.830 --> 02:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
closer to someone's home um are really
 
02:24:39.990 --> 02:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
really important uh as I said you're
 
02:24:41.510 --> 02:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
going to hear a lot more specific
 
02:24:44.150 --> 02:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
examples so I don't want to go on but
 
02:24:47.110 --> 02:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
the two key issues I think for for all
 
02:24:48.950 --> 02:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
of us to consider is one that we treat
 
02:24:51.190 --> 02:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
this profession a little differently
 
02:24:55.150 --> 02:24:55.160 align:start position:0%
um and also that um early treatment in
 
02:24:57.710 --> 02:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
many times for patients will save them
 
02:25:02.150 --> 02:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
both time money um will also save them
 
02:25:05.630 --> 02:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
from potential discomfort will also uh
 
02:25:08.110 --> 02:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
ensure that they have the access to care
 
02:25:10.150 --> 02:25:10.160 align:start position:0%
that we've come to expect and that we
 
02:25:11.830 --> 02:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
hope we can provide in the state of New
 
02:25:13.630 --> 02:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so with that I'll conclude my
 
02:25:15.790 --> 02:25:15.800 align:start position:0%
testimony happy to answer any questions
 
02:25:17.190 --> 02:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
as I said you're you're going to get a
 
02:25:19.269 --> 02:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
lot more specificity following me so
 
02:25:21.550 --> 02:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank

I support SB 440 as an important step in
 
02:25:57.710 --> 02:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
expanding provider care for patients and
 
02:26:00.630 --> 02:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
reducing wait times for specific Eye

02:26:04.750 --> 02:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
procedures currently significant wait
 
02:26:06.870 --> 02:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
times for procedures that are only
 
02:26:10.030 --> 02:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
available with an optomologist impact
 
02:26:13.590 --> 02:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
Patient Care Doctors of Optometry are
 
02:26:15.750 --> 02:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
trained to perform many of these
 
02:26:19.429 --> 02:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
procedures in office all procedures
 
02:26:23.790 --> 02:26:23.800 align:start position:0%
permitted by SB 440 are minor in office

02:26:29.070 --> 02:26:29.080 align:start position:0%

02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:35.349 align:start position:0%
surgeries the current Optometry statute
is

02:26:35.349 --> 02:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:26:37.790 --> 02:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
outdated and the statutes should
 
02:26:40.830 --> 02:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
regulate Doctors of Optometry similar to
 
02:26:43.790 --> 02:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
the way other professions are regulated
 
02:26:48.750 --> 02:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
which s440 does all other independent
 
02:26:51.349 --> 02:26:51.359 align:start position:0%
doctorate level Medical professions in
 
02:26:54.110 --> 02:26:54.120 align:start position:0%

self-regulated these other doctorate
 
02:27:00.230 --> 02:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
level professional boards do not need to
 
02:27:02.429 --> 02:27:02.439 align:start position:0%
continue to return to the

legislature and this extensive process
 
02:27:09.510 --> 02:27:09.520 align:start position:0%

02:27:15.030 --> 02:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
occur doctors wishing to perform these
 
02:27:17.510 --> 02:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
procedures will need to display
 
02:27:20.190 --> 02:27:20.200 align:start position:0%
competency through a process defined by
 
02:27:23.110 --> 02:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
by the state regulatory board as is
 
02:27:25.710 --> 02:27:25.720 align:start position:0%
standard across all Health Care boards
 
02:27:29.190 --> 02:27:29.200 align:start position:0%

02:29:43.870 --> 02:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
there are a few cleanup items in the
 
02:29:46.150 --> 02:29:46.160 align:start position:0%
bill the first serves to dissolve The
 
02:29:48.230 --> 02:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
Joint credentialing committee this is a
 
02:29:50.190 --> 02:29:50.200 align:start position:0%
20-year-old committee that's been in
 
02:29:52.750 --> 02:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
active since about 2020 as it has been
 
02:29:55.269 --> 02:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and unneeded however should
 
02:29:57.750 --> 02:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
it any functions be needed in the future
 
02:30:00.110 --> 02:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
the Senate Bill 440 can transfer this
 
02:30:01.630 --> 02:30:01.640 align:start position:0%
role to the board of
 
02:30:04.590 --> 02:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
Optometry next decades ago Doctors of
 
02:30:06.150 --> 02:30:06.160 align:start position:0%
Optometry in New Hampshire were
 
02:30:08.469 --> 02:30:08.479 align:start position:0%
authorized to prescribe hi to codone
 
02:30:10.190 --> 02:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
however because of a federal change in
 
02:30:13.469 --> 02:30:13.479 align:start position:0%
classification systems our state statute
 
02:30:16.349 --> 02:30:16.359 align:start position:0%
prevents us from prescribing that the
 
02:30:18.389 --> 02:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
board supports maintaining its current
 
02:30:20.630 --> 02:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
restriction on schedule to drve
 
02:30:22.710 --> 02:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
however adding an exception for only a
 
02:30:25.510 --> 02:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
72-hour with no refill supply of
 
02:30:28.710 --> 02:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
hydrocodone the last cleanup item is the
 
02:30:31.309 --> 02:30:31.319 align:start position:0%
continuing education requirements Senate
 
02:30:34.790 --> 02:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
Bill 440 maintains the current 20 hours
 
02:30:37.550 --> 02:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
of live classes every year and does
 
02:30:39.910 --> 02:30:39.920 align:start position:0%
assign 10 of those hours specific to
 
02:30:42.710 --> 02:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
ocular disease and pharmacology topics
 
02:30:44.830 --> 02:30:44.840 align:start position:0%
the change only removes the independent
 
02:30:46.990 --> 02:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
study requirements including the reading
 
02:30:49.269 --> 02:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
of journals that are impossible to track
 
02:30:50.469 --> 02:30:50.479 align:start position:0%
and verify
 
02:30:52.150 --> 02:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
this change is in alignment with other
 
02:30:53.750 --> 02:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
medical professionals including
 
02:30:55.429 --> 02:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
dentistry and Podiatry here in New
 
02:30:58.590 --> 02:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and consistent with Optometry
 
02:31:01.389 --> 02:31:01.399 align:start position:0%
continuing education in other states now
 
02:31:03.150 --> 02:31:03.160 align:start position:0%
I'd like to move on to some other
 
02:31:04.990 --> 02:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
aspects of Senate Bill
 
02:31:07.670 --> 02:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
440 most of what you'll be hearing about
 
02:31:10.550 --> 02:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
today although Optometry is defined
 
02:31:12.870 --> 02:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
nationally with a standard criteria for
 
02:31:15.070 --> 02:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
Education and Training as you've heard
 
02:31:17.110 --> 02:31:17.120 align:start position:0%
the scope of practice within each state
 
02:31:20.550 --> 02:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
is dictated within each individual state
 
02:31:22.590 --> 02:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
the current New Hampshire statute does
 
02:31:24.870 --> 02:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
not give the board of Optometry any
 
02:31:27.190 --> 02:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
autonomy to regulate what constitutes
 
02:31:29.750 --> 02:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
our profession or adapt to advances in
 
02:31:32.150 --> 02:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
it because of this our statute has
 
02:31:34.190 --> 02:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
fallen well behind that of National
 
02:31:36.510 --> 02:31:36.520 align:start position:0%
Training the main goal of Senate Bill
 
02:31:39.510 --> 02:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
440 is regulatory to correct this
 
02:31:41.670 --> 02:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
discrepancy and ensure that the citizens
 
02:31:43.670 --> 02:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire have access to
 
02:31:46.750 --> 02:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
upto-date Eye Care both now and in the
 
02:31:49.309 --> 02:31:49.319 align:start position:0%
future this bill will not allow the
 
02:31:52.910 --> 02:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
board or its licenses to operate outside
 
02:31:55.550 --> 02:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
the National Standard of Optometry the
 
02:31:58.070 --> 02:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
autonomy that Senate Bill 440 would
 
02:32:00.950 --> 02:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
allow the board of Optometry is well
 
02:32:02.990 --> 02:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
established in New Hampshire as you've
 
02:32:05.750 --> 02:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
heard from the wonderful um legislators
 
02:32:08.830 --> 02:32:08.840 align:start position:0%
before me it's actually now the norm in
 
02:32:10.590 --> 02:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for doctoral Level Health
 
02:32:13.070 --> 02:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
Care professions including Dentistry
 
02:32:15.950 --> 02:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
Podiatry Pharmacy and physical therapy
 
02:32:17.950 --> 02:32:17.960 align:start position:0%
all of these similar professions have
 
02:32:19.950 --> 02:32:19.960 align:start position:0%
this Authority and we are asking to be
 
02:32:22.230 --> 02:32:22.240 align:start position:0%
commensurate with them our board does
 
02:32:24.230 --> 02:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
have a spotless record in regulation of
 
02:32:26.190 --> 02:32:26.200 align:start position:0%
our profession demonstrating our
 
02:32:28.590 --> 02:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
commitment to public health and safety
 
02:32:32.030 --> 02:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
for over 113 years with passage of
 
02:32:34.550 --> 02:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 440 the board of Optometry
 
02:32:36.630 --> 02:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
will use this National Standard to guide
 
02:32:38.389 --> 02:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
optometry in New Hampshire through the
 
02:32:41.870 --> 02:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
rul making process for example Doctors
 
02:32:44.150 --> 02:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
of Optometry who have graduated recently
 
02:32:45.870 --> 02:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
and have completed coursework lab
 
02:32:48.230 --> 02:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
practice and clinical training required
 
02:32:50.670 --> 02:32:50.680 align:start position:0%
will be granted certification
 
02:32:52.230 --> 02:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
doctors who have practiced in states
 
02:32:54.110 --> 02:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
where they performing the procedures
 
02:32:55.790 --> 02:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
that you'll hear about today can be
 
02:32:58.750 --> 02:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
granted certification other optometrists
 
02:33:00.990 --> 02:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
who seek certification will take the
 
02:33:02.830 --> 02:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
continuing education requirements
 
02:33:04.910 --> 02:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
required by the board laid out through
 
02:33:07.670 --> 02:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
rul making to demonstrate competency
 
02:33:09.269 --> 02:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
before being granted
 
02:33:11.389 --> 02:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
certification continuing education
 
02:33:12.910 --> 02:33:12.920 align:start position:0%
process is used by healthc Care
 
02:33:14.710 --> 02:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
Professionals we do not go back to
 
02:33:16.790 --> 02:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
school or complete residency for
 
02:33:19.870 --> 02:33:19.880 align:start position:0%
advancements within our own professions
 
02:33:22.110 --> 02:33:22.120 align:start position:0%
fortunately some colleagues in organized
 
02:33:24.389 --> 02:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
medicine including Opthalmology have
 
02:33:26.389 --> 02:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
prioritized a national movement that
 
02:33:29.550 --> 02:33:29.560 align:start position:0%
they call stop scope creep whose mission
 
02:33:32.030 --> 02:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
is to block any legislation which would
 
02:33:34.269 --> 02:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
Advance non-md Health Care Professionals
 
02:33:36.429 --> 02:33:36.439 align:start position:0%
including not only Optometry but
 
02:33:39.030 --> 02:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
psychology Pharmacy Podiatry and nurse
 
02:33:42.230 --> 02:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
practitioners to name a few therefore
 
02:33:44.990 --> 02:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
the our opposition will try to paint the
 
02:33:46.910 --> 02:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
picture that this is not a regulatory
 
02:33:50.030 --> 02:33:50.040 align:start position:0%
bill but rather sweeping scope bill
 
02:33:52.110 --> 02:33:52.120 align:start position:0%
according to our opposition if you
 
02:33:54.830 --> 02:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
approve this bill it will automatically
 
02:33:57.750 --> 02:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
allow Doctors of Optometry to perform
 
02:34:00.110 --> 02:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology published but inaccurate
 
02:34:04.030 --> 02:34:04.040 align:start position:0%
list of 258 surgical codes this is not
 
02:34:07.150 --> 02:34:07.160 align:start position:0%
true approximately 200 of their
 
02:34:10.030 --> 02:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
presented codes will not be authorized
 
02:34:13.269 --> 02:34:13.279 align:start position:0%
by Senate Bill 440 I have spent hours
 
02:34:15.870 --> 02:34:15.880 align:start position:0%
pouring over this document and I was
 
02:34:17.910 --> 02:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
shocked to see that it was distributed
 
02:34:20.990 --> 02:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
to the legislature and to the public
 
02:34:23.710 --> 02:34:23.720 align:start position:0%
that it is fact I can assure you it is
 
02:34:26.710 --> 02:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
not fact our bill outlines a robust list
 
02:34:30.590 --> 02:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
of excluded categories despite this the
 
02:34:32.710 --> 02:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
document in question includes dozens of
 
02:34:35.230 --> 02:34:35.240 align:start position:0%
these additional inaccuracies are codes
 
02:34:37.590 --> 02:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
related to Breaking the nose removing
 
02:34:39.830 --> 02:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
tumors from the scalp performing lipos
 
02:34:42.110 --> 02:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
suction and numerous surgeries to remove
 
02:34:44.150 --> 02:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
tissue from one part of the body place
 
02:34:46.830 --> 02:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
it on another there are over 30 codes
 
02:34:49.750 --> 02:34:49.760 align:start position:0%
for lesions larger than the larger the
 
02:34:52.070 --> 02:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
the eyelid some larger than the entire
 
02:34:55.790 --> 02:34:55.800 align:start position:0%
face lesions up to 40 in in size we know
 
02:34:57.950 --> 02:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
this is impossible they know it's
 
02:35:00.950 --> 02:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
impossible that they portray it as truth
 
02:35:04.030 --> 02:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
we did attempt negotiations we presented
 
02:35:07.550 --> 02:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
44 codes off their list asking if any
 
02:35:10.950 --> 02:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
could go on a post their answer four
 
02:35:13.469 --> 02:35:13.479 align:start position:0%
codes all of which are extensions of
 
02:35:15.910 --> 02:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
current statute and do not offer any
 
02:35:17.990 --> 02:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
compromise or ability to come even
 
02:35:21.630 --> 02:35:21.640 align:start position:0%
remotely close to current opt School
 
02:35:25.190 --> 02:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
curriculum we did however receive a 41
 
02:35:28.510 --> 02:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
page response with pictures that you may
 
02:35:29.910 --> 02:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
see here
 
02:35:32.389 --> 02:35:32.399 align:start position:0%
today some of these pictures are for
 
02:35:36.150 --> 02:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
procedures that are excluded further
 
02:35:37.950 --> 02:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
some pictures have been left out of the
 
02:35:37.960 --> 02:35:39.630 align:start position:0%
some pictures have been left out of the
document

02:35:39.630 --> 02:35:39.640 align:start position:0%
document
 
02:35:42.309 --> 02:35:42.319 align:start position:0%
including some surgical procedures that
 
02:35:44.630 --> 02:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
Doctors of Optometry have performed in
 
02:35:46.670 --> 02:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
every state in the country including New
 
02:35:49.269 --> 02:35:49.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for decades these procedures
 
02:35:51.070 --> 02:35:51.080 align:start position:0%
do involve the use of some sharp
 
02:35:53.309 --> 02:35:53.319 align:start position:0%
instruments on and around the eye
 
02:35:55.870 --> 02:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
including needles and Opthalmic drills
 
02:35:58.030 --> 02:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
surgical procedures they likely do not
 
02:36:00.349 --> 02:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
want you to realize that we routinely
 
02:36:03.150 --> 02:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
perform safely and
 
02:36:05.309 --> 02:36:05.319 align:start position:0%
effectively perhaps this list is a
 
02:36:07.389 --> 02:36:07.399 align:start position:0%
misunder understanding as they did not
 
02:36:09.469 --> 02:36:09.479 align:start position:0%
go to optometry school and do not have
 
02:36:12.469 --> 02:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
our training or perhaps the list are
 
02:36:14.389 --> 02:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
calculated effort to scare the public
 
02:36:16.670 --> 02:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
and the legislature a tactic that has
 
02:36:18.870 --> 02:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
been repeated over the past 40 years
 
02:36:20.670 --> 02:36:20.680 align:start position:0%
when they have AOS every single Bill we
 
02:36:23.590 --> 02:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
have put forth not surprisingly here we
 
02:36:25.309 --> 02:36:25.319 align:start position:0%
are again in
 
02:36:28.230 --> 02:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
2024 them saying the same thing despite
 
02:36:30.910 --> 02:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
optometry's Decades of exemplary care to
 
02:36:34.110 --> 02:36:34.120 align:start position:0%
the citizens of New Hampshire Optometry
 
02:36:36.790 --> 02:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
asks you as the legislature to see
 
02:36:38.910 --> 02:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
please see through these Scare Tactics
 
02:36:41.990 --> 02:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
and support Senate Bill 440 Doctors of
 
02:36:44.630 --> 02:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
Optometry know what Optometry is our
 
02:36:47.230 --> 02:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
board knows what Optometry is and the
 
02:36:48.950 --> 02:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
board will regulate our profession
 
02:36:51.990 --> 02:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
logically methodically and safely for
 
02:36:54.030 --> 02:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
the citizens of New Hampshire as we have
 
02:36:57.750 --> 02:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
done successfully for over 113 Years
 
02:36:57.760 --> 02:37:00.510 align:start position:0%
done successfully for over 113 Years
thank

02:37:00.510 --> 02:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:03.870 --> 02:37:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:07.269 --> 02:37:07.279 align:start position:0%
you yes represent angle thank you madam
 
02:37:09.070 --> 02:37:09.080 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question you
 
02:37:12.950 --> 02:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned there's 58 codes now that 20
 
02:37:15.950 --> 02:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
258 but you said that excluded like 200
 
02:37:19.269 --> 02:37:19.279 align:start position:0%
or something yes and of those 58 what
 
02:37:20.670 --> 02:37:20.680 align:start position:0%
number number of those can you do right
 
02:37:24.030 --> 02:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
now in New Hampshire about 20 off of
 
02:37:26.790 --> 02:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
this procedural code list that they have
 
02:37:29.910 --> 02:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
presented leaves approximately 40 up for
 
02:37:32.389 --> 02:37:32.399 align:start position:0%
discussion I ask one more follow and do
 
02:37:35.309 --> 02:37:35.319 align:start position:0%
you have a list of those for us we we do
 
02:37:38.510 --> 02:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
have a list that we can provide to you
 
02:37:39.790 --> 02:37:39.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:37:43.309 --> 02:37:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:45.550 --> 02:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:37:48.389 --> 02:37:48.399 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair so I think
 
02:37:51.870 --> 02:37:51.880 align:start position:0%
we need to have the these lists papers
 
02:37:53.990 --> 02:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
and documents and so forth as quickly as
 
02:37:57.870 --> 02:37:57.880 align:start position:0%
possible so we who are not practitioners
 
02:38:00.550 --> 02:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
of at least not to my knowledge of
 
02:38:03.269 --> 02:38:03.279 align:start position:0%
either one of the the Arts that are
 
02:38:05.950 --> 02:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
under discussion here can kind of check
 
02:38:08.750 --> 02:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
off and because I think we're going to
 
02:38:11.830 --> 02:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
have battling documentation so we have
 
02:38:14.710 --> 02:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
to have uh some way of kind of keeping
 
02:38:17.710 --> 02:38:17.720 align:start position:0%
score of things that we've been led to
 
02:38:19.870 --> 02:38:19.880 align:start position:0%
believe are going to happen or not going
 
02:38:23.070 --> 02:38:23.080 align:start position:0%
to happen or whatever and uh so we can
 
02:38:23.080 --> 02:38:24.429 align:start position:0%
to happen or whatever and uh so we can
keep

02:38:24.429 --> 02:38:24.439 align:start position:0%
keep
 
02:38:26.830 --> 02:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
track that sounds great we can certainly
 
02:38:28.590 --> 02:38:28.600 align:start position:0%
get that to if we don't have it in there
 
02:38:30.750 --> 02:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
for you already thank you thank you I
 
02:38:32.750 --> 02:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
will mention this bill is going to be
 
02:38:36.110 --> 02:38:36.120 align:start position:0%
going to subcommittee to evaluate the
 
02:38:39.670 --> 02:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
details representative uh thank you
 
02:38:42.510 --> 02:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
madam chairman um I'll I'll tell you out
 
02:38:44.510 --> 02:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
of fun I'm not I have no medical
 
02:38:47.750 --> 02:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
background uh and um I'm I'm chairman of
 
02:38:49.110 --> 02:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
the Health and Human Services committee
 
02:38:51.510 --> 02:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
so I I do get involved with these bills
 
02:38:52.910 --> 02:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
and at one point we weren't sure if this
 
02:38:54.910 --> 02:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
bill was coming to our committee prior
 
02:38:56.429 --> 02:38:56.439 align:start position:0%
to coming to this committee and you
 
02:38:58.429 --> 02:38:58.439 align:start position:0%
probably followed that whole drama I
 
02:39:02.349 --> 02:39:02.359 align:start position:0%
don't know yes I did but uh it's been a
 
02:39:04.230 --> 02:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
been quite a topic of conversation over
 
02:39:07.190 --> 02:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
the last several weeks um so looking at
 
02:39:09.710 --> 02:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
the bill and there I'll fully admit this
 
02:39:11.750 --> 02:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
a lot I don't understand of course yeah
 
02:39:13.590 --> 02:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh but one issue that's been raised by
 
02:39:16.590 --> 02:39:16.600 align:start position:0%
some of my constituents and others is uh
 
02:39:18.830 --> 02:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
there's a certain training certain
 
02:39:21.030 --> 02:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
residen you need to complete to do some
 
02:39:22.790 --> 02:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
of the procedures that it's my
 
02:39:23.950 --> 02:39:23.960 align:start position:0%
understanding you're requesting to be
 
02:39:26.030 --> 02:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
able to do and I was wondering if you
 
02:39:27.510 --> 02:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
could address that because that's I
 
02:39:28.750 --> 02:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
think that's one of the sticking points
 
02:39:31.670 --> 02:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
in this whole this whole situation sure
 
02:39:34.070 --> 02:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
there are going to be speakers coming on
 
02:39:36.910 --> 02:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
after me that do address in detail the
 
02:39:39.269 --> 02:39:39.279 align:start position:0%
education that's required to become an
 
02:39:42.190 --> 02:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
optometrist and the education that is
 
02:39:44.269 --> 02:39:44.279 align:start position:0%
involved in some of these procedures
 
02:39:47.710 --> 02:39:47.720 align:start position:0%
that the board may be looking at um with
 
02:39:50.950 --> 02:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
um once we gain the authority to do that
 
02:39:54.269 --> 02:39:54.279 align:start position:0%
um but we do have two experts on
 
02:39:57.630 --> 02:39:57.640 align:start position:0%
education from the from two current
 
02:40:01.230 --> 02:40:01.240 align:start position:0%
Optometry programs that can discuss um
 
02:40:03.469 --> 02:40:03.479 align:start position:0%
maybe in more detail than you'd like to
 
02:40:07.710 --> 02:40:07.720 align:start position:0%
hear the um uh the uh educational
 
02:40:13.790 --> 02:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:16.469 --> 02:40:16.479 align:start position:0%
you just a quick technical Point Madam
 
02:40:18.910 --> 02:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
chair there are several Representatives
 
02:40:21.429 --> 02:40:21.439 align:start position:0%
uh joining us today if you if you're
 
02:40:23.389 --> 02:40:23.399 align:start position:0%
sitting behind a name plate that is not
 
02:40:25.710 --> 02:40:25.720 align:start position:0%
yours you need to turn it over so you're
 
02:40:27.790 --> 02:40:27.800 align:start position:0%
not going to be
 
02:40:30.269 --> 02:40:30.279 align:start position:0%
misidentified thank you that's fair
 
02:40:33.190 --> 02:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
enough represent goalie just the
 
02:40:35.389 --> 02:40:35.399 align:start position:0%
question of the chair if this is going
 
02:40:37.630 --> 02:40:37.640 align:start position:0%
to subcommittee I'm assuming Health and
 
02:40:39.030 --> 02:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
Human Services committee is going to be
 
02:40:40.950 --> 02:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
participating in that subcommittee I
 
02:40:43.870 --> 02:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
will take all the help we can get yes
 
02:40:48.070 --> 02:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:51.150 --> 02:40:51.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh I was expecting it to go
 
02:40:53.230 --> 02:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
to the licensing committee unless some
 
02:40:56.389 --> 02:40:56.399 align:start position:0%
subcommittee unless someone else
 
02:41:00.870 --> 02:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
volunteers was that yes we you will you
 
02:41:02.750 --> 02:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
will get a great deal of help on this
 
02:41:07.309 --> 02:41:07.319 align:start position:0%
one not that we need it all
 
02:41:17.269 --> 02:41:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:19.910 --> 02:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
Morse good afternoon madam chair and
 
02:41:21.950 --> 02:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
02:41:23.830 --> 02:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
Christy moris I'm a pediatric
 
02:41:26.349 --> 02:41:26.359 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist here in conquer and I'm
 
02:41:28.349 --> 02:41:28.359 align:start position:0%
vice president of the New Hampshire
 
02:41:30.429 --> 02:41:30.439 align:start position:0%
Society of ey Physicians and
 
02:41:32.309 --> 02:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
surgeons in New Hampshire
 
02:41:34.590 --> 02:41:34.600 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists have a long tradition of
 
02:41:36.190 --> 02:41:36.200 align:start position:0%
collaborating closely with our
 
02:41:38.830 --> 02:41:38.840 align:start position:0%
Optometric colleagues Who We Believe are
 
02:41:41.349 --> 02:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
an integral part of larger private
 
02:41:44.269 --> 02:41:44.279 align:start position:0%
practices for routine eye exams and to
 
02:41:46.630 --> 02:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
help medically manage eye conditions
 
02:41:47.830 --> 02:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
such as
 
02:41:51.630 --> 02:41:51.640 align:start position:0%
glaucoma s SP 440 includes an exclusion
 
02:41:54.750 --> 02:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
list that dramatically expands optometer
 
02:41:57.389 --> 02:41:57.399 align:start position:0%
scope of practice potentially granting
 
02:41:59.670 --> 02:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire optometrist one of the
 
02:42:02.469 --> 02:42:02.479 align:start position:0%
broadest scope of practice in the US if
 
02:42:03.670 --> 02:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:42:06.030 --> 02:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
enacted the information you heard
 
02:42:09.309 --> 02:42:09.319 align:start position:0%
earlier regarding access to Eye Care
 
02:42:11.110 --> 02:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
from opthalmologists is actually
 
02:42:14.790 --> 02:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
different from our live experience 90%
 
02:42:17.190 --> 02:42:17.200 align:start position:0%
of patients in New Hampshire live within
 
02:42:19.150 --> 02:42:19.160 align:start position:0%
a 30 minute drive of an opthomology
 
02:42:22.349 --> 02:42:22.359 align:start position:0%
ologist a survey of opthalmologist in
 
02:42:25.110 --> 02:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
our state showed that 94% of
 
02:42:27.910 --> 02:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists can accommodate surgical
 
02:42:31.710 --> 02:42:31.720 align:start position:0%
laser patients within a onewe time frame
 
02:42:34.469 --> 02:42:34.479 align:start position:0%
we do same day procedures and make sure
 
02:42:37.349 --> 02:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
there is appropriate care afterwards but
 
02:42:39.110 --> 02:42:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that these
 
02:42:41.269 --> 02:42:41.279 align:start position:0%
surgeries we are talking about are
 
02:42:44.830 --> 02:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
elective non-urgent surgeries we can do
 
02:42:47.070 --> 02:42:47.080 align:start position:0%
them quickly for patient convenience but
 
02:42:49.269 --> 02:42:49.279 align:start position:0%
the majority of our patients choose to
 
02:42:53.150 --> 02:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
schedule them 2 to 4 weeks out testimony
 
02:42:55.630 --> 02:42:55.640 align:start position:0%
from two states that allow optometrist
 
02:42:58.630 --> 02:42:58.640 align:start position:0%
to perform laser surgery in Oklahoma and
 
02:43:02.269 --> 02:43:02.279 align:start position:0%
Kentucky show that there has been no
 
02:43:06.389 --> 02:43:06.399 align:start position:0%
improved access to care for patients in
 
02:43:06.399 --> 02:43:07.630 align:start position:0%
improved access to care for patients in
those

02:43:07.630 --> 02:43:07.640 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:43:10.429 --> 02:43:10.439 align:start position:0%
States the optometrist are specifically
 
02:43:13.309 --> 02:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
looking to perform 44 surgeries
 
02:43:16.469 --> 02:43:16.479 align:start position:0%
including eyelid surgery and three laser
 
02:43:18.389 --> 02:43:18.399 align:start position:0%
surgeries which are performed by
 
02:43:20.590 --> 02:43:20.600 align:start position:0%
comprehensive opthalmologist a
 
02:43:23.070 --> 02:43:23.080 align:start position:0%
postcataract surgery laser and two
 
02:43:26.429 --> 02:43:26.439 align:start position:0%
glaucoma surgeries all usually performed
 
02:43:29.230 --> 02:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
once in a lifetime you will hear about
 
02:43:31.070 --> 02:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
these procedures in more depth from my
 
02:43:34.830 --> 02:43:34.840 align:start position:0%
colleagues today in addition SB 440
 
02:43:36.950 --> 02:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
would be one of the largest expansions
 
02:43:39.230 --> 02:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
of Optometric scope of practice in the
 
02:43:43.590 --> 02:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
continental United States 41 States Plus
 
02:43:46.510 --> 02:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
Puerto Rico and the District of Colombia
 
02:43:50.150 --> 02:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
prohibit optometrist from performing eye
 
02:43:54.070 --> 02:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
surgery since 2011 over a 100 bills have
 
02:43:57.870 --> 02:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
been introduced in 36 States regarding
 
02:44:00.429 --> 02:44:00.439 align:start position:0%
Optometric expansion of surgical
 
02:44:02.190 --> 02:44:02.200 align:start position:0%
privileges in
 
02:44:05.870 --> 02:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
2023 11 States considered Optometric
 
02:44:08.630 --> 02:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
legislation none of which passed
 
02:44:10.190 --> 02:44:10.200 align:start position:0%
including our neighboring state of
 
02:44:12.710 --> 02:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
Vermont which voted down similar
 
02:44:16.429 --> 02:44:16.439 align:start position:0%
legislation to S SP 440 and they cited
 
02:44:18.750 --> 02:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
inadequate training and insufficient
 
02:44:22.309 --> 02:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
evidence to Su to suggest an access
 
02:44:25.429 --> 02:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
issue we would be the only such state in
 
02:44:28.309 --> 02:44:28.319 align:start position:0%
New England if this bill were to pass
 
02:44:30.230 --> 02:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
the proposed legislation would also
 
02:44:33.349 --> 02:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
allow for a completely self-regulating
 
02:44:36.030 --> 02:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
Optometry board unprecedented in the
 
02:44:38.309 --> 02:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and be the only
 
02:44:40.550 --> 02:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
such board to exist in the continental
 
02:44:43.110 --> 02:44:43.120 align:start position:0%
US the medical providers that have
 
02:44:45.349 --> 02:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
independent boards such as Dentistry
 
02:44:48.550 --> 02:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
Podiatry and physical therapy operate
 
02:44:51.269 --> 02:44:51.279 align:start position:0%
under a opes of the opl and require
 
02:44:54.030 --> 02:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
legislative approval before allowing any
 
02:44:57.110 --> 02:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
expansion of practice by creating an
 
02:44:59.830 --> 02:44:59.840 align:start position:0%
exclusion list to Define their scope of
 
02:45:04.070 --> 02:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
practice the new Optometry board created
 
02:45:06.110 --> 02:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
through this legislation would have the
 
02:45:08.990 --> 02:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
sole authority to Grant optometrist
 
02:45:11.469 --> 02:45:11.479 align:start position:0%
privileges to perform these surgical
 
02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
procedures and to use any new
 
02:45:16.230 --> 02:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
technologies that will arise and
 
02:45:18.190 --> 02:45:18.200 align:start position:0%
determine the standards no matter how
 
02:45:20.870 --> 02:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
minimal to perform highly complex
 
02:45:24.670 --> 02:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
surgery s sp44 uses exclusionary
 
02:45:26.670 --> 02:45:26.680 align:start position:0%
language it would authorize the
 
02:45:28.950 --> 02:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
Optometry board to have sole authority
 
02:45:31.990 --> 02:45:32.000 align:start position:0%
to Grant surgical privileges it does not
 
02:45:34.349 --> 02:45:34.359 align:start position:0%
specify the criteria the board would use
 
02:45:37.110 --> 02:45:37.120 align:start position:0%
to Grant these privileges states that
 
02:45:39.150 --> 02:45:39.160 align:start position:0%
have passed similar legislation like
 
02:45:41.550 --> 02:45:41.560 align:start position:0%
Louisiana and Mississippi require
 
02:45:43.750 --> 02:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
optometrist to show laser Surgical

completed a 32-hour week course both of
 
02:45:52.990 --> 02:45:53.000 align:start position:0%
which we find inadequate for complex
 
02:45:56.269 --> 02:45:56.279 align:start position:0%
surgical training given that the board
 
02:45:58.469 --> 02:45:58.479 align:start position:0%
of Optometry would consist of four
 
02:46:01.389 --> 02:46:01.399 align:start position:0%
optometrist and only one public member
 
02:46:04.790 --> 02:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
governing 333 licensed New Hampshire
 
02:46:06.950 --> 02:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
optometrist we have concerns about
 
02:46:09.150 --> 02:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
potential bias if a patient complaint
 
02:46:11.790 --> 02:46:11.800 align:start position:0%
arises from a surgery performed by an
 
02:46:13.790 --> 02:46:13.800 align:start position:0%
optometrist in
 
02:46:16.469 --> 02:46:16.479 align:start position:0%
contrast the Board of Medicine includes
 
02:46:20.469 --> 02:46:20.479 align:start position:0%

complaints that are brought to the Board

assessed without an unintended bias it
 
02:46:42.469 --> 02:46:42.479 align:start position:0%
would be difficult to create a similar
 
02:46:44.190 --> 02:46:44.200 align:start position:0%
model with so few
 
02:46:46.590 --> 02:46:46.600 align:start position:0%
optometrist opthalmologists are opposed
 
02:46:49.429 --> 02:46:49.439 align:start position:0%
to S SP 440 because we are concerned
 
02:46:52.950 --> 02:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
about patient safety in 2021 an
 
02:46:55.309 --> 02:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
optometrist in a New Hampshire practice
 
02:46:57.750 --> 02:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
felt that the existing law on glaucoma
 
02:46:59.830 --> 02:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
management was too restricted
 
02:47:02.349 --> 02:47:02.359 align:start position:0%
prohibiting optometrist from prescribing
 
02:47:04.950 --> 02:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
some treatments imposed unnecessary
 
02:47:07.110 --> 02:47:07.120 align:start position:0%

certification collaboratively we worked
 
02:47:13.190 --> 02:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
in good faith with the New Hampshire
 
02:47:16.670 --> 02:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
Optometric Society to broaden this law
 
02:47:20.230 --> 02:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
in contrast SB 440 proposes an optometry
 
02:47:22.710 --> 02:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
scope of practice expansion for which
 
02:47:25.630 --> 02:47:25.640 align:start position:0%
they lack sufficient training education
 
02:47:25.640 --> 02:47:26.590 align:start position:0%
they lack sufficient training education
and

02:47:26.590 --> 02:47:26.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:47:29.070 --> 02:47:29.080 align:start position:0%
experience the bill would also offer
 
02:47:31.710 --> 02:47:31.720 align:start position:0%
dangerous dangerously broad power to the
 
02:47:34.349 --> 02:47:34.359 align:start position:0%
Optometry board and would permit
 
02:47:36.550 --> 02:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
optometrist to perform surgical
 
02:47:38.990 --> 02:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
procedures and use technologies that
 
02:47:41.830 --> 02:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
have not even been invented yet all of
 
02:47:43.750 --> 02:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
this without allowing review and
 
02:47:46.269 --> 02:47:46.279 align:start position:0%
oversight by the legislature or other
 
02:47:48.190 --> 02:47:48.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate governing bodies within the
 
02:47:50.790 --> 02:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
fields of medicine and surgery where
 
02:47:52.910 --> 02:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
Decades of experience and proper
 
02:47:56.630 --> 02:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
training assure the safety success and
 
02:47:58.670 --> 02:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
outcomes that the patients of New
 
02:48:01.510 --> 02:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire expect I respectfully ask that
 
02:48:04.750 --> 02:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
you oppose s SP 440 thank
 
02:48:09.070 --> 02:48:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:12.309 --> 02:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam chair so were you
 
02:48:14.590 --> 02:48:14.600 align:start position:0%
involved with the negotiations of with
 
02:48:18.349 --> 02:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
the um optometrist on the possible um
 
02:48:20.710 --> 02:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
agreement ment between these procedures
 
02:48:23.230 --> 02:48:23.240 align:start position:0%
no but one of our later speakers was
 
02:48:26.510 --> 02:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
involved so you can explain to us why
 
02:48:31.429 --> 02:48:31.439 align:start position:0%
you were unwilling to compromise oh no
 
02:48:33.429 --> 02:48:33.439 align:start position:0%
we did meet with the optometrist and we
 
02:48:35.269 --> 02:48:35.279 align:start position:0%
willing to compromise but our efforts
 
02:48:38.070 --> 02:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
were rejected by the
 
02:48:40.630 --> 02:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
optometrist okay well I'll wait to I'll
 
02:48:42.269 --> 02:48:42.279 align:start position:0%
I'll wait for that question later thank
 
02:48:42.279 --> 02:48:45.910 align:start position:0%
I'll wait for that question later thank
you

02:48:45.910 --> 02:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:50.150 --> 02:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
okay yes I'm afraid I don't he your now
 
02:48:52.190 --> 02:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman um my name is
 
02:48:54.269 --> 02:48:54.279 align:start position:0%
Jim Murphy I'm one of The Interlopers
 
02:48:56.349 --> 02:48:56.359 align:start position:0%
from the HHS committee so I'm sorry if I
 
02:48:57.910 --> 02:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
don't have a name plag in front of me
 
02:49:00.429 --> 02:49:00.439 align:start position:0%
that's it's okay um my question Dr
 
02:49:02.389 --> 02:49:02.399 align:start position:0%
Morris is you know could you detail to
 
02:49:05.950 --> 02:49:05.960 align:start position:0%
us your your training and the number of
 
02:49:07.790 --> 02:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
potential surgeries that you have done
 
02:49:09.510 --> 02:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the not only the course of
 
02:49:12.309 --> 02:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
your training which I mean was fairly
 
02:49:15.230 --> 02:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
extensive but also subsequently on live
 
02:49:17.790 --> 02:49:17.800 align:start position:0%
patients yes and um one of our speakers
 
02:49:19.870 --> 02:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
has those exact numbers and we'll speak
 
02:49:22.030 --> 02:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
to that but I can tell you that in
 
02:49:25.950 --> 02:49:25.960 align:start position:0%
training I performed over 400 cataract
 
02:49:29.070 --> 02:49:29.080 align:start position:0%
surgeries um equal number of lasers I've
 
02:49:30.510 --> 02:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
been in practice now here in New
 
02:49:33.510 --> 02:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for 30 years I do at least six
 
02:49:37.510 --> 02:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
surgical procedures a week um I mean I
 
02:49:41.030 --> 02:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
do a lot of surgery and that training
 
02:49:43.630 --> 02:49:43.640 align:start position:0%
though learning when I was in in
 
02:49:46.590 --> 02:49:46.600 align:start position:0%
residency was really one-on-one
 
02:49:50.110 --> 02:49:50.120 align:start position:0%
mentorship um it was on live patients um
 
02:49:51.830 --> 02:49:51.840 align:start position:0%
after working in wet
 
02:49:55.269 --> 02:49:55.279 align:start position:0%
Labs just follow up quick followup and
 
02:49:57.349 --> 02:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
how many years of residency and training
 
02:49:59.110 --> 02:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
did you have number one and number two
 
02:50:00.710 --> 02:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
over the past 30 years have you had to
 
02:50:02.150 --> 02:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
prescribe any hydrocodone to your
 
02:50:04.309 --> 02:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
patients um I'll take the last question
 
02:50:08.630 --> 02:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
first no I have never prescribed
 
02:50:11.510 --> 02:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
hydrocodone and that my feeling is that
 
02:50:14.349 --> 02:50:14.359 align:start position:0%
if a patient of mine needs hydrocodone I
 
02:50:15.670 --> 02:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
better see that patient because
 
02:50:19.510 --> 02:50:19.520 align:start position:0%
something is not right um so and as far
 
02:50:22.110 --> 02:50:22.120 align:start position:0%
as education after Co after four years
 
02:50:25.269 --> 02:50:25.279 align:start position:0%
of college four years of medical school
 
02:50:28.870 --> 02:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
um a year of surgical internship three
 
02:50:31.670 --> 02:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
years of residency and then a fellowship
 
02:50:34.950 --> 02:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
in pediatric Opthalmology and adult
 
02:50:38.309 --> 02:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
strabismus thank you represent laus
 
02:50:40.790 --> 02:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um so if I understood
 
02:50:42.590 --> 02:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
correctly you said the uh the board of
 
02:50:45.630 --> 02:50:45.640 align:start position:0%
Optometry would be able to you know
 
02:50:47.229 --> 02:50:47.239 align:start position:0%
change the rules or make up rules
 
02:50:49.110 --> 02:50:49.120 align:start position:0%
without any oversight of the legis ISL
 
02:50:51.030 --> 02:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
but un but correct me if I'm wrong but
 
02:50:53.349 --> 02:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
it looks like uh it says they shall
 
02:50:56.190 --> 02:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
adopt rules under RSA 541a to carry out
 
02:50:58.389 --> 02:50:58.399 align:start position:0%
the provisions of the section and to
 
02:51:00.910 --> 02:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
ensure safety of the public and that
 
02:51:02.830 --> 02:51:02.840 align:start position:0%
involves among a lot of other things
 
02:51:04.670 --> 02:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
that process uh reviewed by the
 
02:51:06.590 --> 02:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
legislature is there something else here
 
02:51:08.830 --> 02:51:08.840 align:start position:0%
that I'm missing well the board the this
 
02:51:11.110 --> 02:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
newly created Board of Optometry would
 
02:51:13.750 --> 02:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
be self-regulating unlike the Board of
 
02:51:17.349 --> 02:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
Medicine that um has multiple different
 
02:51:20.429 --> 02:51:20.439 align:start position:0%
medical and Surgical sub specialty
 
02:51:22.630 --> 02:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
representation the board of Optometry
 
02:51:24.990 --> 02:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
would include four optometrist and one
 
02:51:28.229 --> 02:51:28.239 align:start position:0%
public member follow up follow yeah I
 
02:51:30.990 --> 02:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
understand that but uh I just question
 
02:51:32.670 --> 02:51:32.680 align:start position:0%
the the you know whether I'm missing
 
02:51:33.870 --> 02:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
something about the statement that no
 
02:51:35.429 --> 02:51:35.439 align:start position:0%
overview of the legislature because that
 
02:51:37.309 --> 02:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
is part of the process unless I'm
 
02:51:41.309 --> 02:51:41.319 align:start position:0%
missing something here
 
02:51:46.190 --> 02:51:46.200 align:start position:0%
okay was I I was just wondering if if uh
 
02:51:48.950 --> 02:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
but but this um that board of optom
 
02:51:51.110 --> 02:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
would be created through this
 
02:51:56.469 --> 02:51:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:58.510 --> 02:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:52:01.190 --> 02:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
Pera thank you I believe that M that
 
02:52:03.190 --> 02:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
representative leus is referring to jail
 
02:52:04.550 --> 02:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
car because all of room making goes
 
02:52:06.269 --> 02:52:06.279 align:start position:0%
through the authority of the joint
 
02:52:08.070 --> 02:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
legislative committee on administrative
 
02:52:11.110 --> 02:52:11.120 align:start position:0%
rules U my question to you is there are
 
02:52:13.389 --> 02:52:13.399 align:start position:0%
other professions who have their own
 
02:52:15.510 --> 02:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
boards that govern themselves so what's
 
02:52:17.630 --> 02:52:17.640 align:start position:0%
the issue with with the optim the
 
02:52:19.030 --> 02:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
optometrist having having their own
 
02:52:32.110 --> 02:52:32.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:32.120 --> 02:52:34.710 align:start position:0%
 
39,18401

02:52:34.710 --> 02:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
39,18401
 
02:52:40.710 --> 02:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:44.710 --> 02:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
licenses there are 100 podiatrists
 
02:52:48.870 --> 02:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:48.880 --> 02:52:50.070 align:start position:0%
 
thank

02:52:50.070 --> 02:52:50.080 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:52:52.349 --> 02:52:52.359 align:start position:0%
you representative Schmidt you have a
 
02:52:54.630 --> 02:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
brief question thank you madam chairman
 
02:52:57.269 --> 02:52:57.279 align:start position:0%
so I I you've already announced that
 
02:52:59.469 --> 02:52:59.479 align:start position:0%
this is going to subcommittee and and I
 
02:53:02.590 --> 02:53:02.600 align:start position:0%
hoping I'm hoping you'll uh engage
 
02:53:05.870 --> 02:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
fairly quickly to explain that that we
 
02:53:09.550 --> 02:53:09.560 align:start position:0%
cannot get into a lot of specifics and
 
02:53:12.630 --> 02:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
help guide the testimony but my question
 
02:53:16.030 --> 02:53:16.040 align:start position:0%
is are there any states which have
 
02:53:19.190 --> 02:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
expanded um eye treatment or I eye
 
02:53:22.190 --> 02:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
treatment or care uh in this country
 
02:53:24.630 --> 02:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
that have done it right which we could
 
02:53:27.870 --> 02:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
you look to to compare with the document
 
02:53:30.110 --> 02:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
that we are potentially you will be
 
02:53:32.150 --> 02:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
hearing from another one of my
 
02:53:37.670 --> 02:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:39.790 --> 02:53:39.800 align:start position:0%
you all right thank you thank you for
 
02:53:50.950 --> 02:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:52.309 --> 02:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair
 
02:53:53.750 --> 02:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
representatives of the committee thank
 
02:53:56.229 --> 02:53:56.239 align:start position:0%
you for your time um my name is Dr Angel
 
02:53:58.830 --> 02:53:58.840 align:start position:0%
Le Sawyer I'm originally from nasua I'm
 
02:54:01.389 --> 02:54:01.399 align:start position:0%
now an optometrist and practice owner uh
 
02:54:03.630 --> 02:54:03.640 align:start position:0%
in rural Northern parts of our state
 
02:54:05.630 --> 02:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
having office locations in North Conway
 
02:54:07.269 --> 02:54:07.279 align:start position:0%
and Berlin where I've practiced for the
 
02:54:09.910 --> 02:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
last 10 years I am here today to ask for
 
02:54:12.229 --> 02:54:12.239 align:start position:0%
your support for Senate Bill 440 because
 
02:54:14.469 --> 02:54:14.479 align:start position:0%
it is what my patients and the citizens
 
02:54:16.510 --> 02:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire deserve in order to
 
02:54:18.990 --> 02:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
better meet their eye care needs before
 
02:54:20.790 --> 02:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
I get into the rest of my testimony
 
02:54:21.990 --> 02:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
which I know you have written and I'll
 
02:54:23.429 --> 02:54:23.439 align:start position:0%
try and shorten as much as possible I
 
02:54:24.870 --> 02:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
would like to respond to some of the
 
02:54:27.590 --> 02:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
questions if I may um first I would like
 
02:54:29.550 --> 02:54:29.560 align:start position:0%
to point out that there are 12 states
 
02:54:31.750 --> 02:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
that allow laser procedures that means
 
02:54:35.190 --> 02:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
that there are 38 that do not not 41 um
 
02:54:36.550 --> 02:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps they haven't been keeping up
 
02:54:37.950 --> 02:54:37.960 align:start position:0%
with the states that have already passed
 
02:54:41.229 --> 02:54:41.239 align:start position:0%
that Authority this year um Vermont did
 
02:54:43.429 --> 02:54:43.439 align:start position:0%
not pass that Authority however Mt did
 
02:54:45.229 --> 02:54:45.239 align:start position:0%
have the recommendations and very
 
02:54:47.229 --> 02:54:47.239 align:start position:0%
specific outlines um of the
 
02:54:48.710 --> 02:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
recommendations for the off office of
 
02:54:51.550 --> 02:54:51.560 align:start position:0%
professional relations that did not pass
 
02:54:52.830 --> 02:54:52.840 align:start position:0%
the other bills that were mentioned in
 
02:54:55.030 --> 02:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
other states that did not pass were for
 
02:54:57.190 --> 02:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
political reasons as was mentioned
 
02:54:59.750 --> 02:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
there's a national campaign labeled stop
 
02:55:02.190 --> 02:55:02.200 align:start position:0%
scope creep that their only purpose is
 
02:55:04.190 --> 02:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
to stop advancement from anybody who is
 
02:55:07.910 --> 02:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
not an MD that is why bills have failed
 
02:55:09.790 --> 02:55:09.800 align:start position:0%
and why this takes very long time for
 
02:55:11.950 --> 02:55:11.960 align:start position:0%
this to go through and happen but 12
 
02:55:13.990 --> 02:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
states have been successful we are
 
02:55:15.910 --> 02:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
picking up pace just as everything that
 
02:55:18.550 --> 02:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
has come before us eventually all 50
 
02:55:20.590 --> 02:55:20.600 align:start position:0%
states have passed that legislation the
 
02:55:23.110 --> 02:55:23.120 align:start position:0%
legislation to instill dilating drops to
 
02:55:25.229 --> 02:55:25.239 align:start position:0%
treat with prescription medications to
 
02:55:26.990 --> 02:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
provide oral medications to treat
 
02:55:29.469 --> 02:55:29.479 align:start position:0%
glaucoma all of those started one state
 
02:55:31.750 --> 02:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
at a time and eventually 12 States got
 
02:55:34.309 --> 02:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
there then 50 states got there all 50
 
02:55:36.790 --> 02:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
states allow those things I firmly
 
02:55:38.710 --> 02:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
believe that in my lifetime all 50
 
02:55:40.710 --> 02:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
states are going to have the ability to
 
02:55:42.910 --> 02:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
do these procedures because this is the
 
02:55:45.349 --> 02:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
current curriculum I was taught this in
 
02:55:48.309 --> 02:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
my schools 15 years ago it has been the
 
02:55:50.670 --> 02:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
standard in curriculum for years and
 
02:55:52.910 --> 02:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
will continue to be so I hope that I
 
02:55:54.670 --> 02:55:54.680 align:start position:0%
don't have to wait another 20 years
 
02:55:56.269 --> 02:55:56.279 align:start position:0%
before I'm seeing this happen in New
 
02:55:58.590 --> 02:55:58.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and for my
 
02:56:01.510 --> 02:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
patients um when we did sit down and I
 
02:56:03.349 --> 02:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
was in the negotiation meeting so I can
 
02:56:05.469 --> 02:56:05.479 align:start position:0%
answer any questions there when we did
 
02:56:08.870 --> 02:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
sit down um it was made clear by them
 
02:56:10.830 --> 02:56:10.840 align:start position:0%
and that was already made clear today
 
02:56:12.469 --> 02:56:12.479 align:start position:0%
that they believe we're creating a new
 
02:56:14.630 --> 02:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
board we are not creating a new board of
 
02:56:16.790 --> 02:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
Optometry as you know there is a board
 
02:56:18.870 --> 02:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
of Optometry already in place
 
02:56:20.710 --> 02:56:20.720 align:start position:0%
that consists of four optometrists and a
 
02:56:22.349 --> 02:56:22.359 align:start position:0%
public member and that has been there
 
02:56:25.469 --> 02:56:25.479 align:start position:0%
for 113 years as we have heard the only
 
02:56:26.870 --> 02:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
thing that is new is what we are
 
02:56:28.510 --> 02:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
permitting that board to do which puts
 
02:56:30.349 --> 02:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
them on par with other independent
 
02:56:32.590 --> 02:56:32.600 align:start position:0%
Professional Regulations uh professional
 
02:56:34.710 --> 02:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
health care providers in the state as we
 
02:56:36.710 --> 02:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
have mentioned Optometry is being
 
02:56:38.229 --> 02:56:38.239 align:start position:0%
treated differently than all of the
 
02:56:39.790 --> 02:56:39.800 align:start position:0%
others and there's no reason for that to
 
02:56:42.269 --> 02:56:42.279 align:start position:0%
be the case any longer we are not
 
02:56:44.830 --> 02:56:44.840 align:start position:0%
creating a new board when we sat down
 
02:56:46.870 --> 02:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
for that negotiation meeting the
 
02:56:49.469 --> 02:56:49.479 align:start position:0%
opposition asked what is oplc they do
 
02:56:51.950 --> 02:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
not even know what any of this is they
 
02:56:54.150 --> 02:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
do not know how we are regulated they
 
02:56:55.710 --> 02:56:55.720 align:start position:0%
think that we're creating a new board
 
02:56:56.990 --> 02:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
and that we're going to operate in a
 
02:56:59.190 --> 02:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
vacuum that is not the case the board
 
02:57:00.910 --> 02:57:00.920 align:start position:0%
will continue to be the board that it is
 
02:57:02.630 --> 02:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
it will continue to be subject to the
 
02:57:05.110 --> 02:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
other regulations of oplc and it will be
 
02:57:07.830 --> 02:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
bound by the legislature by the statute
 
02:57:09.990 --> 02:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
that is still in place there is a very
 
02:57:12.790 --> 02:57:12.800 align:start position:0%
broad range of exclusions that
 
02:57:14.670 --> 02:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
optometrists will not be able to do that
 
02:57:17.150 --> 02:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
are outside of the purview of Optometry
 
02:57:19.550 --> 02:57:19.560 align:start position:0%
that is outside of our metric education
 
02:57:21.429 --> 02:57:21.439 align:start position:0%
the board cannot subvert those
 
02:57:23.429 --> 02:57:23.439 align:start position:0%
exclusions there is still precautions
 
02:57:25.190 --> 02:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
that are in state and that are putting
 
02:57:28.510 --> 02:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
those parameters in place so for for
 
02:57:30.429 --> 02:57:30.439 align:start position:0%
that um the the last thing I want to say
 
02:57:33.750 --> 02:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
in response to what has come before um
 
02:57:35.309 --> 02:57:35.319 align:start position:0%
the four procedures that were brought
 
02:57:37.269 --> 02:57:37.279 align:start position:0%
forward were specifically told that
 
02:57:38.710 --> 02:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
those were being allowed because they
 
02:57:40.510 --> 02:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
did not consider those procedures to be
 
02:57:43.349 --> 02:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
surgery the 44 procedures that we were
 
02:57:45.429 --> 02:57:45.439 align:start position:0%
requesting that are within our training
 
02:57:47.229 --> 02:57:47.239 align:start position:0%
and education they considered to be
 
02:57:49.110 --> 02:57:49.120 align:start position:0%
surgery and they made it clear that
 
02:57:51.670 --> 02:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
there is a line in the sand they will
 
02:57:54.790 --> 02:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
not allow non-surgeons to do surgery
 
02:57:56.750 --> 02:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
even though there are nonsurgeons that
 
02:57:59.269 --> 02:57:59.279 align:start position:0%
are doing surgery in the state they will
 
02:58:01.590 --> 02:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
not allow non-surgeons to do surgery
 
02:58:03.550 --> 02:58:03.560 align:start position:0%
that if they're lying in the sand that
 
02:58:05.150 --> 02:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
comes from the American Medical
 
02:58:07.030 --> 02:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
Association that comes from the American
 
02:58:08.110 --> 02:58:08.120 align:start position:0%
Academy of
 
02:58:10.950 --> 02:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology so there was no room for
 
02:58:13.590 --> 02:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
negotiation Beyond those four codes
 
02:58:15.229 --> 02:58:15.239 align:start position:0%
because they consider those surgery and
 
02:58:16.389 --> 02:58:16.399 align:start position:0%
everything else as far as they're
 
02:58:18.630 --> 02:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
concerned is off the table are there
 
02:58:19.710 --> 02:58:19.720 align:start position:0%
other states that have done this
 
02:58:21.429 --> 02:58:21.439 align:start position:0%
successfully yes there are 12 states
 
02:58:23.670 --> 02:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
that have but to answer your question
 
02:58:25.070 --> 02:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
none of them will tell you that they are
 
02:58:27.190 --> 02:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
doing it successfully because as far as
 
02:58:28.550 --> 02:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
they're concerned every one of those
 
02:58:30.510 --> 02:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
States is wrong none of them should be
 
02:58:33.950 --> 02:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
allowing surgery that is what we're
 
02:58:38.309 --> 02:58:38.319 align:start position:0%
facing so I I won't go into all of my
 
02:58:40.349 --> 02:58:40.359 align:start position:0%
testimony here but I will ask you to
 
02:58:42.349 --> 02:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
please understand this this is an access
 
02:58:44.630 --> 02:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
issue that is really what my testimony
 
02:58:47.030 --> 02:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
was meant to focus on I practice in
 
02:58:49.190 --> 02:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
North Conway and in
 
02:58:51.830 --> 02:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
um in your uh information we've provided
 
02:58:54.150 --> 02:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
you a state access map they've said that
 
02:58:56.510 --> 02:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
90% are within 30 minutes I can tell you
 
02:58:59.030 --> 02:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
100% of my patients in my Berlin office
 
02:59:02.389 --> 02:59:02.399 align:start position:0%
are not within 90 within 30 miles within
 
02:59:04.870 --> 02:59:04.880 align:start position:0%
a 30- minute
 
02:59:08.550 --> 02:59:08.560 align:start position:0%
drive it is an access issue a 2022
 
02:59:10.349 --> 02:59:10.359 align:start position:0%
article by the American Academy of
 
02:59:12.190 --> 02:59:12.200 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology indicated that the number
 
02:59:13.830 --> 02:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
of opthalmologists in the US has
 
02:59:15.630 --> 02:59:15.640 align:start position:0%
remained stable since
 
02:59:18.630 --> 02:59:18.640 align:start position:0%
1990 meanwhile the patients over 60 is
 
02:59:18.640 --> 02:59:19.750 align:start position:0%
1990 meanwhile the patients over 60 is
sily

02:59:19.750 --> 02:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
sily
 
02:59:22.030 --> 02:59:22.040 align:start position:0%
increasing another article published in
 
02:59:24.150 --> 02:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
September of 2023 by the American
 
02:59:26.349 --> 02:59:26.359 align:start position:0%
Academy of Opthalmology found that from
 
02:59:29.030 --> 02:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
2020 to 2035 the total Opthalmology
 
02:59:33.790 --> 02:59:33.800 align:start position:0%
Supply is uh expected to decrease by 12%
 
02:59:35.710 --> 02:59:35.720 align:start position:0%
and the total demand is projected to
 
02:59:38.830 --> 02:59:38.840 align:start position:0%
increase by 24% resulting in a supply
 
02:59:41.830 --> 02:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
and demand mismatch of only 70%
 
02:59:44.550 --> 02:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
Workforce adequacy for Opthalmology that
 
02:59:46.910 --> 02:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
was the second worst among 38 medical
 
02:59:48.870 --> 02:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
and surgical specialties
 
02:59:50.950 --> 02:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
and that adequacy that Workforce
 
02:59:54.269 --> 02:59:54.279 align:start position:0%
inadequacy it plummets to only 29% when
 
02:59:56.389 --> 02:59:56.399 align:start position:0%
we are looking at Rural and non-metro
 
02:59:58.910 --> 02:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
geographies it is a real issue I can
 
03:00:01.150 --> 03:00:01.160 align:start position:0%
tell you that every
 
03:00:03.510 --> 03:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
day in my 10 years practicing in the
 
03:00:05.229 --> 03:00:05.239 align:start position:0%
North Country I've seen the only
 
03:00:06.429 --> 03:00:06.439 align:start position:0%
provider that was the only
 
03:00:08.469 --> 03:00:08.479 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist in Coos County retired
 
03:00:10.110 --> 03:00:10.120 align:start position:0%
just closed his
 
03:00:14.389 --> 03:00:14.399 align:start position:0%
doors in 2015 um that was in 2015 uh
 
03:00:16.070 --> 03:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
together with the local hospital Andrew
 
03:00:18.070 --> 03:00:18.080 align:start position:0%
scogan Valley Hospital I was able to
 
03:00:19.389 --> 03:00:19.399 align:start position:0%
recruit an opthalmologist from Southern
 
03:00:21.110 --> 03:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to come up and provide
 
03:00:23.309 --> 03:00:23.319 align:start position:0%
surgery in Berlin cataract surgeries to
 
03:00:26.510 --> 03:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
patients eight times in a year however
 
03:00:28.349 --> 03:00:28.359 align:start position:0%
that that travel became too burdensome
 
03:00:30.229 --> 03:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
and that was abruptly discontinued in
 
03:00:32.469 --> 03:00:32.479 align:start position:0%
2021 and we've been unable to find
 
03:00:34.110 --> 03:00:34.120 align:start position:0%
anybody else willing to travel up there
 
03:00:36.910 --> 03:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
to provide care to these
 
03:00:39.510 --> 03:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
patients the hospital has launched a
 
03:00:41.349 --> 03:00:41.359 align:start position:0%
nationwide search they're unable to find
 
03:00:43.630 --> 03:00:43.640 align:start position:0%
anybody to come they had one candidate
 
03:00:45.030 --> 03:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
come in interview for a full-time
 
03:00:47.269 --> 03:00:47.279 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology position in Berlin and that
 
03:00:51.349 --> 03:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:54.670 --> 03:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity um since I don't have
 
03:00:57.510 --> 03:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology in the Coos County area um
 
03:00:59.469 --> 03:00:59.479 align:start position:0%
for for several years now I've had to
 
03:01:02.469 --> 03:01:02.479 align:start position:0%
refer patients um a minimum of one hour
 
03:01:04.990 --> 03:01:05.000 align:start position:0%
from Berlin to get to an Opthomologist
 
03:01:07.030 --> 03:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
there are two options for a general
 
03:01:09.469 --> 03:01:09.479 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist within one hour of
 
03:01:12.150 --> 03:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
Berlin should those opthalmologists not
 
03:01:13.670 --> 03:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
be able to provide the specialty care
 
03:01:15.590 --> 03:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
that I need or should they not be on the
 
03:01:17.469 --> 03:01:17.479 align:start position:0%
insurance panels of my patients that is
 
03:01:20.429 --> 03:01:20.439 align:start position:0%
a real issue there is one of our Managed
 
03:01:22.229 --> 03:01:22.239 align:start position:0%
Care Medicaid plans that has one
 
03:01:24.710 --> 03:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist in the entire State
 
03:01:27.510 --> 03:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
available for us to refer to there are
 
03:01:29.229 --> 03:01:29.239 align:start position:0%
other opthalmologists that do not take
 
03:01:31.269 --> 03:01:31.279 align:start position:0%
the other medic manag Medicare plans
 
03:01:34.309 --> 03:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
Medicaid plans sorry so when I have
 
03:01:35.790 --> 03:01:35.800 align:start position:0%
access issues when I have insurance
 
03:01:37.950 --> 03:01:37.960 align:start position:0%
issues for many years I've had to have
 
03:01:39.349 --> 03:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
my patients from the North Country
 
03:01:41.910 --> 03:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
travel two and a half hours to Dartmouth
 
03:01:43.670 --> 03:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
but at least that used to be an option
 
03:01:45.150 --> 03:01:45.160 align:start position:0%
because guess what Dartmouth has closed
 
03:01:47.469 --> 03:01:47.479 align:start position:0%
to referrals I cannot refer a patient to
 
03:01:49.150 --> 03:01:49.160 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth and have not been able to for
 
03:01:51.550 --> 03:01:51.560 align:start position:0%
months they've not only closed to
 
03:01:53.070 --> 03:01:53.080 align:start position:0%
external referrals they at times have
 
03:01:54.790 --> 03:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
been closed to internal referrals where
 
03:01:57.070 --> 03:01:57.080 align:start position:0%
op optometrists within Dartmouth cannot
 
03:02:00.469 --> 03:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
refer to Opthalmology Specialties in
 
03:02:02.790 --> 03:02:02.800 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth if you look at the map you
 
03:02:04.870 --> 03:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
will see that there's two counties Coos
 
03:02:07.269 --> 03:02:07.279 align:start position:0%
and Sullivan that do not have a single
 
03:02:09.269 --> 03:02:09.279 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist there are two counties
 
03:02:11.630 --> 03:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
Grafton and Cheshire or sorry two more
 
03:02:13.630 --> 03:02:13.640 align:start position:0%
counties Carol and belnap that have only
 
03:02:16.550 --> 03:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
one opthalmologist for the entire County
 
03:02:18.150 --> 03:02:18.160 align:start position:0%
there are two more counties Gra and
 
03:02:20.389 --> 03:02:20.399 align:start position:0%
Chesire that are home to Dartmouth
 
03:02:21.830 --> 03:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
however when Dartmouth starts taking
 
03:02:23.469 --> 03:02:23.479 align:start position:0%
stops taking referrals and you exclude
 
03:02:25.469 --> 03:02:25.479 align:start position:0%
those Dartmouth providers we have a
 
03:02:28.229 --> 03:02:28.239 align:start position:0%
total of four opthalmologists covering
 
03:02:30.630 --> 03:02:30.640 align:start position:0%
six counties six of the 10 counties in
 
03:02:34.110 --> 03:02:34.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire this is an access issue
 
03:02:36.150 --> 03:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
now we can't avoid the need for
 
03:02:38.110 --> 03:02:38.120 align:start position:0%
opthomology there are so many procedures
 
03:02:39.990 --> 03:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
that are outside the scope of Optometry
 
03:02:41.710 --> 03:02:41.720 align:start position:0%
that are still Beyond those exclusions
 
03:02:43.870 --> 03:02:43.880 align:start position:0%
that we need to refer to them I can't
 
03:02:47.269 --> 03:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
avoid that but we can treat the things
 
03:02:48.870 --> 03:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
that we're able to treat that are within
 
03:02:51.150 --> 03:02:51.160 align:start position:0%
the training and education of
 
03:02:53.190 --> 03:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
optometrists when I was in optometry
 
03:02:55.389 --> 03:02:55.399 align:start position:0%
school more than 15 years ago I was
 
03:02:57.630 --> 03:02:57.640 align:start position:0%
trained on these procedures I was able
 
03:02:59.950 --> 03:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
to do them in Oklahoma where I did my
 
03:03:01.710 --> 03:03:01.720 align:start position:0%
training I've done these procedures on
 
03:03:04.269 --> 03:03:04.279 align:start position:0%
patients yet now 15 years later I need
 
03:03:04.279 --> 03:03:05.469 align:start position:0%
patients yet now 15 years later I need
to

03:03:05.469 --> 03:03:05.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:03:08.309 --> 03:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
refer just a week ago I had a patient
 
03:03:10.790 --> 03:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
who was in my office had a a skin tag or
 
03:03:13.190 --> 03:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
a papala on their eyelid that they asked
 
03:03:15.309 --> 03:03:15.319 align:start position:0%
me to remove for them I told them I have
 
03:03:17.030 --> 03:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
the training I have the knowledge I have
 
03:03:19.309 --> 03:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
the experience is doing this in Oklahoma
 
03:03:20.510 --> 03:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
but I can't do that for you in New
 
03:03:22.550 --> 03:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire oh but I do see that your
 
03:03:24.150 --> 03:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner that's your primary
 
03:03:26.750 --> 03:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
care provider who I also see as as a My
 
03:03:29.190 --> 03:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
Provider um she can remove that for you
 
03:03:31.190 --> 03:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioners they can remove skin
 
03:03:33.510 --> 03:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
tags the patient said to me but you are
 
03:03:35.750 --> 03:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
my eye doctor I said I know it doesn't
 
03:03:38.309 --> 03:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
make sense to me
 
03:03:40.469 --> 03:03:40.479 align:start position:0%
either there are so many reasons to
 
03:03:43.750 --> 03:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
support s440 it reduces patient cost
 
03:03:46.070 --> 03:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
travel weight times and increasing
 
03:03:48.990 --> 03:03:49.000 align:start position:0%
access issues to care
 
03:03:50.950 --> 03:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
it create it increases continuity of
 
03:03:52.790 --> 03:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
care it eliminates duplicative health
 
03:03:52.800 --> 03:03:54.469 align:start position:0%
care it eliminates duplicative health
care

03:03:54.469 --> 03:03:54.479 align:start position:0%
care
 
03:03:56.469 --> 03:03:56.479 align:start position:0%
services and also makes the granite
 
03:03:58.790 --> 03:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
state a more desirable place to live on
 
03:04:00.950 --> 03:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
the contrary you will hear only one
 
03:04:03.830 --> 03:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
argument in opposition to S SP 440 which
 
03:04:05.990 --> 03:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
is a false claim of threat to patient
 
03:04:08.710 --> 03:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
safety this is a false claim because in
 
03:04:11.269 --> 03:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
numerous other states and for more than
 
03:04:13.870 --> 03:04:13.880 align:start position:0%
30 years Doctors of Optometry have been
 
03:04:16.870 --> 03:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
performing these procedures safely this
 
03:04:18.590 --> 03:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
is a false claim because the opposition
 
03:04:20.110 --> 03:04:20.120 align:start position:0%
will say that we do not have their
 
03:04:22.590 --> 03:04:22.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate Education and Training what
 
03:04:24.150 --> 03:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
they actually mean is that we do not
 
03:04:26.590 --> 03:04:26.600 align:start position:0%
have their Education and Training which
 
03:04:28.790 --> 03:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
is true we know there are significant
 
03:04:30.510 --> 03:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
differences between the Education and
 
03:04:32.150 --> 03:04:32.160 align:start position:0%
Training of optometrists and
 
03:04:33.910 --> 03:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists however that does not
 
03:04:35.750 --> 03:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
make them the only ones capable of
 
03:04:38.710 --> 03:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
Performing the procedures um outlined in
 
03:04:41.150 --> 03:04:41.160 align:start position:0%
s SP 440 we do not want to be
 
03:04:43.870 --> 03:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists and s440 contains a long
 
03:04:46.750 --> 03:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
list of exclusions to make that clear we
 
03:04:48.550 --> 03:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
are simply asking to perform procedures
 
03:04:50.150 --> 03:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
that were are within our Education and
 
03:04:52.110 --> 03:04:52.120 align:start position:0%
Training that have been demonstrated to
 
03:04:54.389 --> 03:04:54.399 align:start position:0%
be safe in many other states and which
 
03:04:56.670 --> 03:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
are of benefit to our
 
03:04:59.229 --> 03:04:59.239 align:start position:0%
patients before I close I ask that you
 
03:05:00.950 --> 03:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
allow me to read a letter from a
 
03:05:02.469 --> 03:05:02.479 align:start position:0%
wolfboro resident who couldn't be here
 
03:05:04.550 --> 03:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
today but this is a patient of a dear
 
03:05:06.389 --> 03:05:06.399 align:start position:0%
Optometric colleague of mine at wolfboro
 
03:05:08.110 --> 03:05:08.120 align:start position:0%
Eye Associates and a copy of that I
 
03:05:10.349 --> 03:05:10.359 align:start position:0%
believe is is available to you it
 
03:05:12.429 --> 03:05:12.439 align:start position:0%
references one of the in office
 
03:05:14.349 --> 03:05:14.359 align:start position:0%
procedures that we would be permitted by
 
03:05:17.670 --> 03:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
s440 to perform called a capsulotomy
 
03:05:19.510 --> 03:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
which removes the cloudy vision limiting
 
03:05:21.469 --> 03:05:21.479 align:start position:0%
tissue that can develop after cataract
 
03:05:25.309 --> 03:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
surgery using a yag laser she writes
 
03:05:27.590 --> 03:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
after a very long and challenging wait
 
03:05:29.910 --> 03:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
to receive a yag capsulotomy here in New
 
03:05:32.229 --> 03:05:32.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I feel compelled to encourage
 
03:05:34.590 --> 03:05:34.600 align:start position:0%
legislation to allow the procedure to be
 
03:05:35.950 --> 03:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
performed by an
 
03:05:38.670 --> 03:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
optometrist when my vision became cloudy
 
03:05:39.870 --> 03:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
I made an appointment with the
 
03:05:41.950 --> 03:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist who performed my cataract
 
03:05:45.030 --> 03:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
surgery I was scheduled and examined but
 
03:05:46.910 --> 03:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
I couldn't be seen for the yag treatment
 
03:05:49.790 --> 03:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
for six weeks this was not waiting on a
 
03:05:51.429 --> 03:05:51.439 align:start position:0%
referral they saw their surgeon and they
 
03:05:53.229 --> 03:05:53.239 align:start position:0%
still had to wait six
 
03:05:55.590 --> 03:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
weeks during this period the condition
 
03:05:57.990 --> 03:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
grew worse what made this extremely
 
03:05:59.550 --> 03:05:59.560 align:start position:0%
difficult is that I am a retired
 
03:06:02.110 --> 03:06:02.120 align:start position:0%
77-year-old who lives alone in a rural
 
03:06:05.550 --> 03:06:05.560 align:start position:0%
area and has Vision in only one eye I
 
03:06:07.870 --> 03:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
was unable to drive and became dependent
 
03:06:09.550 --> 03:06:09.560 align:start position:0%
on others to complete the most basic
 
03:06:11.790 --> 03:06:11.800 align:start position:0%
errands like grocery shopping Banking
 
03:06:14.030 --> 03:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
and social activities such as traveling
 
03:06:17.190 --> 03:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
to visit family I was unable to read or
 
03:06:18.910 --> 03:06:18.920 align:start position:0%
pass the time with my usual activities
 
03:06:21.269 --> 03:06:21.279 align:start position:0%
such as writing painting sewing or even
 
03:06:23.309 --> 03:06:23.319 align:start position:0%
preparing meals and keeping my house
 
03:06:26.710 --> 03:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
clean I couldn't read emails or texts
 
03:06:28.349 --> 03:06:28.359 align:start position:0%
although others told me that the
 
03:06:30.070 --> 03:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
correction of this cloudy condition was
 
03:06:33.550 --> 03:06:33.560 align:start position:0%
quick painless and instantly effective I
 
03:06:35.429 --> 03:06:35.439 align:start position:0%
still experienced a prolonged sense of
 
03:06:37.710 --> 03:06:37.720 align:start position:0%
anxiety considering my eyesight was on
 
03:06:40.150 --> 03:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
the line eventually made it to the
 
03:06:42.429 --> 03:06:42.439 align:start position:0%
conquered eye center but I wondered why
 
03:06:44.910 --> 03:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
I had to EXT endure such a long
 
03:06:46.670 --> 03:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
frustrating stretch when such an
 
03:06:49.110 --> 03:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
impressively large facility exists
 
03:06:50.630 --> 03:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
whatever the reason the proposal to
 
03:06:52.870 --> 03:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
allow yag capsulotomy to be performed by
 
03:06:54.790 --> 03:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
local and well-trained optometrists
 
03:06:56.670 --> 03:06:56.680 align:start position:0%
would certainly alleviate the suffering
 
03:06:59.349 --> 03:06:59.359 align:start position:0%
of those quality of life uh of those
 
03:07:01.110 --> 03:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
whose quality of life is diminished by
 
03:07:02.870 --> 03:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
limited Vision thank you for your
 
03:07:05.110 --> 03:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
attention and concern Pamela Hansen
 
03:07:07.870 --> 03:07:07.880 align:start position:0%
wolfboro so I ask you to limit
 
03:07:09.870 --> 03:07:09.880 align:start position:0%
unnecessary hardships such as this for
 
03:07:11.830 --> 03:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
the citizens of New Hampshire for my
 
03:07:14.269 --> 03:07:14.279 align:start position:0%
patience and for your constituents I ask
 
03:07:16.469 --> 03:07:16.479 align:start position:0%
that you please vote in favor of Senate
 
03:07:20.550 --> 03:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:23.630 --> 03:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
time thank you sh
 
03:07:25.990 --> 03:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
it thank you madam chair thank you for
 
03:07:28.830 --> 03:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh you alluded to the
 
03:07:30.670 --> 03:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
number of
 
03:07:33.309 --> 03:07:33.319 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists likely to decrease going
 
03:07:36.630 --> 03:07:36.640 align:start position:0%
into the future do you have information
 
03:07:36.640 --> 03:07:37.670 align:start position:0%
into the future do you have information
on

03:07:37.670 --> 03:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:07:41.030 --> 03:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
the proposed or possible numbers of
 
03:07:43.830 --> 03:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
optometrists going forward I don't have
 
03:07:45.710 --> 03:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
that number in front of me but I I it is
 
03:07:47.630 --> 03:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
increasing there are more optomet
 
03:07:49.630 --> 03:07:49.640 align:start position:0%
schools that are that are opening um in
 
03:07:51.790 --> 03:07:51.800 align:start position:0%
the last 15 years I believe that there
 
03:07:53.750 --> 03:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
have been six or seven new Optometry
 
03:07:55.750 --> 03:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
schools that are opening and um the
 
03:07:57.349 --> 03:07:57.359 align:start position:0%
numbers in each class is growing each
 
03:07:59.110 --> 03:07:59.120 align:start position:0%
year so the numbers of optometrists are
 
03:08:04.349 --> 03:08:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:07.309 --> 03:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
increase thank you mad thank you madam
 
03:08:09.269 --> 03:08:09.279 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for saying my
 
03:08:12.910 --> 03:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
question I look here at a number of
 
03:08:14.910 --> 03:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
electives that you'll be able to do if
 
03:08:18.150 --> 03:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
this passes and can you tell me if
 
03:08:20.330 --> 03:08:20.340 align:start position:0%
all of these that are listed in this
 
03:08:20.340 --> 03:08:21.550 align:start position:0%
all of these that are listed in this
[Music]

03:08:21.550 --> 03:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:08:24.269 --> 03:08:24.279 align:start position:0%
legislation are the ones that same ones
 
03:08:26.269 --> 03:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
that are allowed in the other states
 
03:08:27.950 --> 03:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
that allow these procedures like
 
03:08:30.710 --> 03:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma the there are variations um
 
03:08:32.910 --> 03:08:32.920 align:start position:0%
everything that would be permitted by
 
03:08:35.429 --> 03:08:35.439 align:start position:0%
s440 in New Hampshire is permitted in
 
03:08:37.710 --> 03:08:37.720 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma um other states there are
 
03:08:39.950 --> 03:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
varying degrees there are 12 states that
 
03:08:42.670 --> 03:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
are permitting um laser procedures um
 
03:08:44.269 --> 03:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
there's specifically three laser
 
03:08:47.030 --> 03:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
procedures that um are are of
 
03:08:49.070 --> 03:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
consequence quence um that that we're
 
03:08:51.510 --> 03:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
discussing here that we're targeting um
 
03:08:53.950 --> 03:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
the lid procedures there is a a wider
 
03:08:56.030 --> 03:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
variation of what those lid procedures
 
03:08:58.630 --> 03:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
constitute that's where the majority of
 
03:09:01.110 --> 03:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
um the variation in those those
 
03:09:04.510 --> 03:09:04.520 align:start position:0%
procedures come up um and so I I can't
 
03:09:06.190 --> 03:09:06.200 align:start position:0%
say that every state that there there
 
03:09:07.670 --> 03:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
are more states that allow lid
 
03:09:09.670 --> 03:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
procedures um there are 12 that allow
 
03:09:12.070 --> 03:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
lasers there are 19 that allow lid
 
03:09:14.630 --> 03:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
procedures um and so within those 19
 
03:09:16.630 --> 03:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
states there may be varying degrees as
 
03:09:18.950 --> 03:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
to what specific Ally lid procedures are
 
03:09:21.950 --> 03:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
permitted follow thank you follow up
 
03:09:21.960 --> 03:09:23.269 align:start position:0%
permitted follow thank you follow up
follow

03:09:23.269 --> 03:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
follow
 
03:09:23.279 --> 03:09:25.510 align:start position:0%
follow
up

03:09:25.510 --> 03:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
up
 
03:09:29.349 --> 03:09:29.359 align:start position:0%
so out of all the states how many states
 
03:09:30.950 --> 03:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
include this whole list that you have
 
03:09:33.190 --> 03:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
here in this piece of legislation the
 
03:09:34.870 --> 03:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
only that I can know for sure as of
 
03:09:36.469 --> 03:09:36.479 align:start position:0%
right now is Oklahoma but I can get more
 
03:09:38.950 --> 03:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
specific information for that for you
 
03:09:41.349 --> 03:09:41.359 align:start position:0%

03:11:16.070 --> 03:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
Vermont are there opthalmologists
 
03:11:18.349 --> 03:11:18.359 align:start position:0%
available to Hampshire residents in
 
03:11:20.389 --> 03:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
either one of those two states thank you
 
03:11:22.750 --> 03:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
for asking that um in fact I'm right on
 
03:11:25.030 --> 03:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
the practicing on the border of Maine my
 
03:11:27.030 --> 03:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
my number one referral source for all of
 
03:11:28.790 --> 03:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
my glaucoma patients has been main ey
 
03:11:31.469 --> 03:11:31.479 align:start position:0%
Center in Portland for years I've sent
 
03:11:33.870 --> 03:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
them for the glaucoma lasers that I need
 
03:11:36.150 --> 03:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
treatment for um my patients have about
 
03:11:37.670 --> 03:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
an hour and 15 minutes to get to
 
03:11:40.429 --> 03:11:40.439 align:start position:0%
Portland from North Conway um when I
 
03:11:42.790 --> 03:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
referred last month I was told January
 
03:11:45.309 --> 03:11:45.319 align:start position:0%
is when my patient would be seen so they
 
03:11:48.590 --> 03:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
are also experiencing access issues as
 
03:11:52.349 --> 03:11:52.359 align:start position:0%
well and like Newport or Island followup
 
03:11:56.229 --> 03:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
pardon me followup followup uh Newport
 
03:11:58.550 --> 03:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
or Island Pond Vermont do they have any
 
03:12:01.710 --> 03:12:01.720 align:start position:0%
resources that you could into um on the
 
03:12:03.870 --> 03:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
Vermont border there is um the one
 
03:12:06.469 --> 03:12:06.479 align:start position:0%
provider that we do have um up in the uh
 
03:12:08.550 --> 03:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
Littleton region that's up close to
 
03:12:09.950 --> 03:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
Berlin that's one of the two options
 
03:12:11.990 --> 03:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
that I have he practices on both sides
 
03:12:14.990 --> 03:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
of the state so he is the Vermont option
 
03:12:16.469 --> 03:12:16.479 align:start position:0%
that I have available I have the
 
03:12:18.790 --> 03:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
Portland Main opt option available okay
 
03:12:20.590 --> 03:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
03:12:22.910 --> 03:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:12:25.309 --> 03:12:25.319 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you madam chairman Wayne
 
03:12:27.150 --> 03:12:27.160 align:start position:0%
McDonald chairman of Health and Human
 
03:12:28.510 --> 03:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
Services I think I was in that meeting
 
03:12:32.229 --> 03:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
you referred to earlier um and and again
 
03:12:35.429 --> 03:12:35.439 align:start position:0%
I as I as I told the previous individual
 
03:12:37.349 --> 03:12:37.359 align:start position:0%
I'm I have no medical background and
 
03:12:38.590 --> 03:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
it's a lot about this belill I don't
 
03:12:41.510 --> 03:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
pretend to understand um what one thing
 
03:12:43.590 --> 03:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
that's been brought to my attention and
 
03:12:44.710 --> 03:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
you know that's what the benefit of
 
03:12:46.389 --> 03:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
these hearings are so you can hear both
 
03:12:48.590 --> 03:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
sides and get a better understanding I
 
03:12:50.190 --> 03:12:50.200 align:start position:0%
won't be voting on this bill in this
 
03:12:51.990 --> 03:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
committee but as a member of the house I
 
03:12:53.750 --> 03:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
will be voting for it obviously when it
 
03:12:54.790 --> 03:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
gets to the
 
03:12:58.150 --> 03:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
floor uh boards are something that this
 
03:12:59.550 --> 03:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
the executive department the
 
03:13:01.910 --> 03:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
administration committee handles and we
 
03:13:04.349 --> 03:13:04.359 align:start position:0%
deal with public health issues uh there
 
03:13:06.190 --> 03:13:06.200 align:start position:0%
is a public health issue tangental
 
03:13:08.030 --> 03:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
related to this board however the the
 
03:13:10.269 --> 03:13:10.279 align:start position:0%
board of Optometry that you know and the
 
03:13:13.309 --> 03:13:13.319 align:start position:0%
revisions you'll be making here it's my
 
03:13:14.309 --> 03:13:14.319 align:start position:0%
understanding you said it's not going to
 
03:13:17.190 --> 03:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
change really there is a board now but
 
03:13:18.630 --> 03:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that this board
 
03:13:21.510 --> 03:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
will expand in terms of authority and
 
03:13:23.630 --> 03:13:23.640 align:start position:0%
only Alaska will have a comparable board
 
03:13:26.269 --> 03:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
in the entire country is that
 
03:13:28.590 --> 03:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
true the board of New Hampshire would
 
03:13:30.710 --> 03:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
expand Authority and they will be put on
 
03:13:32.510 --> 03:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
par with the other independent
 
03:13:34.510 --> 03:13:34.520 align:start position:0%
practicing doctorate level professions
 
03:13:35.790 --> 03:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire that are
 
03:13:38.190 --> 03:13:38.200 align:start position:0%
regulated in the same way follow up
 
03:13:41.110 --> 03:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
Madam follow so but but in terms of
 
03:13:43.750 --> 03:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
other states would would I mean is are
 
03:13:45.469 --> 03:13:45.479 align:start position:0%
other states comparable or only is
 
03:13:50.469 --> 03:13:50.479 align:start position:0%
Alaska comparable Alaska has a uh a
 
03:13:52.389 --> 03:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
statute where their board is able to
 
03:13:55.070 --> 03:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
regulate um to a greater extent I do not
 
03:13:57.750 --> 03:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
know of others at this point
 
03:14:01.389 --> 03:14:01.399 align:start position:0%
um I don't also know cannot speak to
 
03:14:03.990 --> 03:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
other states and their Podiatry or their
 
03:14:05.910 --> 03:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
pharmacology or their physical therapy
 
03:14:07.269 --> 03:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
statutes but I do know what those
 
03:14:08.870 --> 03:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
statutes are in New
 
03:14:11.150 --> 03:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire okay thank
 
03:14:14.269 --> 03:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much represent
 
03:14:17.550 --> 03:14:17.560 align:start position:0%
manrey thank you madam chair as
 
03:14:20.309 --> 03:14:20.319 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question as a
 
03:14:24.070 --> 03:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
podiatrist uh board you also regulate
 
03:14:28.469 --> 03:14:28.479 align:start position:0%
disciplinary actions and in the past 113
 
03:14:31.229 --> 03:14:31.239 align:start position:0%
years that You' have said uh what is
 
03:14:34.309 --> 03:14:34.319 align:start position:0%
your average disciplinary questions of
 
03:14:36.950 --> 03:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
referrals per
 
03:14:40.389 --> 03:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
year I I can have the board follow up
 
03:14:42.150 --> 03:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
with that I can tell you that there have
 
03:14:46.030 --> 03:14:46.040 align:start position:0%
been no disciplinary actions um I do not
 
03:14:47.950 --> 03:14:47.960 align:start position:0%
know the number of things that are
 
03:14:49.790 --> 03:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
brought before the board that do not
 
03:14:51.630 --> 03:14:51.640 align:start position:0%
rise to the level of disciplinary action
 
03:14:52.790 --> 03:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you that there have been
 
03:14:55.510 --> 03:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
zero actions T taken I can also tell you
 
03:14:58.950 --> 03:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
that in every scope practice um that
 
03:15:00.910 --> 03:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
across the country whether it's the
 
03:15:03.229 --> 03:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
dilating drops the therapeutic ey drops
 
03:15:04.630 --> 03:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
the oral medications the treatment of
 
03:15:06.870 --> 03:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
glaucoma or these surgical procedures
 
03:15:09.790 --> 03:15:09.800 align:start position:0%
there has never been a reeal or roll
 
03:15:12.349 --> 03:15:12.359 align:start position:0%
back of the Optometric statute that has
 
03:15:14.990 --> 03:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
been gone forward we proceed with
 
03:15:16.990 --> 03:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
caution with safety and with our best
 
03:15:19.910 --> 03:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
patient best interest in mind thank you
 
03:15:21.229 --> 03:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
03:15:32.309 --> 03:15:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:35.429 --> 03:15:35.439 align:start position:0%
fogal Madam chair would it be okay if we
 
03:15:38.670 --> 03:15:38.680 align:start position:0%
invite if I invite Dr Ben Harvey to join
 
03:15:41.389 --> 03:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
me um to expedite expedite the hearing
 
03:15:43.630 --> 03:15:43.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Expedition is
 
03:15:45.950 --> 03:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
good and don't overestimate our
 
03:15:49.510 --> 03:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:51.349 --> 03:15:51.359 align:start position:0%
Madam chair and representatives of the
 
03:15:52.990 --> 03:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for hearing me I'm
 
03:15:55.070 --> 03:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
from Oklahoma I am a board certified
 
03:15:57.910 --> 03:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist I did my residency in
 
03:15:59.950 --> 03:15:59.960 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology and fellowship training in
 
03:16:01.630 --> 03:16:01.640 align:start position:0%
glaucoma and I've been practicing for
 
03:16:04.710 --> 03:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
about 12 years in adult and pediatric
 
03:16:06.790 --> 03:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
glaucoma in Oklahoma City I've been
 
03:16:09.389 --> 03:16:09.399 align:start position:0%
tasked to talk about complications we
 
03:16:12.269 --> 03:16:12.279 align:start position:0%
see from optometrist performing laser
 
03:16:14.910 --> 03:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
surgeries since the uh passage of that
 
03:16:18.590 --> 03:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
scope expansion in Oklahoma many decades
 
03:16:21.910 --> 03:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
ago these affect my patients personally
 
03:16:24.269 --> 03:16:24.279 align:start position:0%
my practice and my uh colleagues we all
 
03:16:26.349 --> 03:16:26.359 align:start position:0%
deal with these complications that we
 
03:16:30.349 --> 03:16:30.359 align:start position:0%
see from uh referral sources uh due to
 
03:16:33.990 --> 03:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
these complications I have a patient
 
03:16:36.710 --> 03:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
with what we call neovascular glaucoma
 
03:16:38.309 --> 03:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
it's a glaucoma related related to
 
03:16:40.710 --> 03:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
diabetes who had sudden increase in eye
 
03:16:42.950 --> 03:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
pressure pain decreased Vision an
 
03:16:45.830 --> 03:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
optometrist called me asking me to do a
 
03:16:47.590 --> 03:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
laser he said he was was going to do it
 
03:16:49.469 --> 03:16:49.479 align:start position:0%
but he didn't have it at this satellite
 
03:16:51.910 --> 03:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
location I agreed to see the patient
 
03:16:54.150 --> 03:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
bring the patient in and the patient was
 
03:16:56.830 --> 03:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
misdiagnosed he had acute he did not
 
03:16:59.110 --> 03:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
have what the optometrist said he had
 
03:17:00.710 --> 03:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
the optometrist thought he had acute
 
03:17:02.469 --> 03:17:02.479 align:start position:0%
angle closure when in fact he did have
 
03:17:05.429 --> 03:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
the diabetes related glaucoma this
 
03:17:07.750 --> 03:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
glaucoma if that laser was performed for
 
03:17:10.150 --> 03:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
acute angle closure would have worsened
 
03:17:13.469 --> 03:17:13.479 align:start position:0%
the disease and led to a bad outcome so
 
03:17:16.429 --> 03:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
that's just a a prequel for me speaking
 
03:17:19.309 --> 03:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
about the essential necessity for
 
03:17:22.550 --> 03:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
patient safety we are dealing with uh
 
03:17:24.229 --> 03:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
complications from these procedures
 
03:17:26.750 --> 03:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
you'll hear from a patient of mine later
 
03:17:29.150 --> 03:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
on today not only are these lasers
 
03:17:30.710 --> 03:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
potentially dangerous and we do see
 
03:17:32.870 --> 03:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
complications of them in Oklahoma but we
 
03:17:36.030 --> 03:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
also see improper diagnosis of diseases
 
03:17:38.630 --> 03:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
and utilization of wrong lasers for
 
03:17:42.349 --> 03:17:42.359 align:start position:0%
wrong diseases frequently in
 
03:17:45.269 --> 03:17:45.279 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma there is a patient of mine I
 
03:17:48.349 --> 03:17:48.359 align:start position:0%
recently diagnosed with GL
 
03:17:50.110 --> 03:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
she had been going to the optometry
 
03:17:52.990 --> 03:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
school in North Oklahoma they had not
 
03:17:55.150 --> 03:17:55.160 align:start position:0%
diagnosed nor had they treated her gloma
 
03:17:57.269 --> 03:17:57.279 align:start position:0%
but they had been doing multiple lasers
 
03:17:59.910 --> 03:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
in her eyes to treat her floaters these
 
03:18:02.309 --> 03:18:02.319 align:start position:0%
lasers side effects include pressure
 
03:18:04.550 --> 03:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
spikes in her eyes pressure spikes in a
 
03:18:06.990 --> 03:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
patient with glaucoma leads to nerve
 
03:18:08.870 --> 03:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
death nerve death is irreversible leads
 
03:18:08.880 --> 03:18:10.349 align:start position:0%
death nerve death is irreversible leads
to

03:18:10.349 --> 03:18:10.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:18:14.750 --> 03:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
blindness we have a patient who was seen
 
03:18:17.429 --> 03:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
for months for a painful red eye by two
 
03:18:18.830 --> 03:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
different optometrists who were
 
03:18:21.750 --> 03:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
surgically trained uh the patient was
 
03:18:23.269 --> 03:18:23.279 align:start position:0%
eventually sent to the emergency room
 
03:18:25.510 --> 03:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
the emergency room doctor not the
 
03:18:28.070 --> 03:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
optometrist uh diagnosed the patient
 
03:18:30.750 --> 03:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
with acute angle closure and sent the
 
03:18:32.910 --> 03:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
patient to an opthalmologist for laser
 
03:18:35.510 --> 03:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
surgery unfortunately due to delay in
 
03:18:38.269 --> 03:18:38.279 align:start position:0%
diagnosis and treatment the patient
 
03:18:39.990 --> 03:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
could not have this laser surgery had to
 
03:18:42.429 --> 03:18:42.439 align:start position:0%
go to the operating room a lawsuit
 
03:18:45.910 --> 03:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
ensued it did not materialize because
 
03:18:47.830 --> 03:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
the patient passed away before it could
 
03:18:49.790 --> 03:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
go through the proper
 
03:18:52.590 --> 03:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
channels we have patients in the
 
03:18:55.189 --> 03:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
community who are veterans but treated
 
03:18:56.950 --> 03:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
by community opthalmologist and
 
03:18:59.790 --> 03:18:59.800 align:start position:0%
optometrist this particular patient went
 
03:19:03.750 --> 03:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
to an optometrist and had laser in both
 
03:19:06.990 --> 03:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
eyes for what we call narrow angles
 
03:19:10.309 --> 03:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
treating a angle closure glaucoma the
 
03:19:12.229 --> 03:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
lasers were not successful were not
 
03:19:14.550 --> 03:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
completed because in one eye the eye
 
03:19:16.510 --> 03:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
started bleeding filled up with blood
 
03:19:18.670 --> 03:19:18.680 align:start position:0%
the the optometrist proceeded to do the
 
03:19:21.070 --> 03:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
laser in the other eye unable to
 
03:19:22.910 --> 03:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
complete the eye filled up with blood
 
03:19:25.630 --> 03:19:25.640 align:start position:0%
the pressures elevated marketly this was
 
03:19:27.150 --> 03:19:27.160 align:start position:0%
treated conservatively by The
 
03:19:28.870 --> 03:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist Who finally got the
 
03:19:33.349 --> 03:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
patient and when they did uh evaluate
 
03:19:35.309 --> 03:19:35.319 align:start position:0%
the patient once the blood was gone and
 
03:19:37.150 --> 03:19:37.160 align:start position:0%
they could see all the structures in
 
03:19:38.830 --> 03:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
fact this patient did not need that
 
03:19:41.670 --> 03:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
laser this patient had open angles not
 
03:19:45.110 --> 03:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
closed angles that were the reasoning
 
03:19:48.349 --> 03:19:48.359 align:start position:0%
behind this laser done by the
 
03:19:51.950 --> 03:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
optometrist we've had patient go to one
 
03:19:55.510 --> 03:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
of our cornea Specialists seeking lasic
 
03:19:57.229 --> 03:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to do lasic on both eyes to
 
03:19:59.910 --> 03:19:59.920 align:start position:0%
improve their vision and and perhaps get
 
03:20:02.510 --> 03:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
independence from spectacles the cornea
 
03:20:04.269 --> 03:20:04.279 align:start position:0%
specialist and opthalmologist who does
 
03:20:06.750 --> 03:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
another year of training to deal
 
03:20:08.830 --> 03:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
specifically with the cornea see that
 
03:20:11.070 --> 03:20:11.080 align:start position:0%
that this patient is not a candidate for
 
03:20:13.269 --> 03:20:13.279 align:start position:0%
lasic surgery it would be detrimental to
 
03:20:16.269 --> 03:20:16.279 align:start position:0%
the patient to do this surgery the
 
03:20:16.279 --> 03:20:17.309 align:start position:0%
the patient to do this surgery the
patient

03:20:17.309 --> 03:20:17.319 align:start position:0%
patient
 
03:20:19.550 --> 03:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
uh was uh really motivated so got a
 
03:20:21.870 --> 03:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
second opinion from an optometrist who
 
03:20:23.990 --> 03:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
said you know currently we can't do the
 
03:20:25.830 --> 03:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
the procedure but I'll see if we can do
 
03:20:27.910 --> 03:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
it in the future two weeks later
 
03:20:30.269 --> 03:20:30.279 align:start position:0%
patient's contacted by the optometrist
 
03:20:33.790 --> 03:20:33.800 align:start position:0%
lasic is performed patient had worse
 
03:20:36.030 --> 03:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
Vision in the outcome compared to before
 
03:20:38.670 --> 03:20:38.680 align:start position:0%
the surgery went back to the cornea
 
03:20:40.750 --> 03:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
specialist couldn't fix it there's no
 
03:20:43.189 --> 03:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
way to fix that you'll be hearing a lot
 
03:20:46.150 --> 03:20:46.160 align:start position:0%
about lasers after cataract surgery
 
03:20:48.389 --> 03:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
we'll call them yag capsulotomies or we
 
03:20:49.990 --> 03:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
can call them yag lasers so we don't get
 
03:20:52.990 --> 03:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
too technical we see patients who have
 
03:20:55.670 --> 03:20:55.680 align:start position:0%
this laser done by optometrist when it
 
03:20:57.990 --> 03:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
was actually uncorrected a stigmatism
 
03:20:59.950 --> 03:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
causing the visual Distortion a simple
 
03:21:01.950 --> 03:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
glasses refraction would have fixed this
 
03:21:04.830 --> 03:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
rather than a laser we've had this laser
 
03:21:06.429 --> 03:21:06.439 align:start position:0%
performed when it was macular
 
03:21:09.189 --> 03:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
degeneration causing the vision decrease
 
03:21:12.349 --> 03:21:12.359 align:start position:0%
rather than a uh problem after cataract
 
03:21:14.189 --> 03:21:14.199 align:start position:0%
surgery requiring this laser done by
 
03:21:16.269 --> 03:21:16.279 align:start position:0%
optometrist we've had this surgery done
 
03:21:18.150 --> 03:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
in patients who've already had this the
 
03:21:20.189 --> 03:21:20.199 align:start position:0%
laser done by
 
03:21:22.950 --> 03:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
optometrist um all these would have been
 
03:21:26.150 --> 03:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
avoided if proper slit L examination and
 
03:21:28.910 --> 03:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
patient physical history were perfected
 
03:21:33.550 --> 03:21:33.560 align:start position:0%
in this scenario to do surgery okay
 
03:21:35.630 --> 03:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
again this is about patient
 
03:21:38.469 --> 03:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
safety it's about ensuring that they get
 
03:21:40.150 --> 03:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
the best care and the highest quality
 
03:21:43.349 --> 03:21:43.359 align:start position:0%
Care possible I thank you for allowing
 
03:21:46.790 --> 03:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
me to speak uh I have a question how do
 
03:21:50.670 --> 03:21:50.680 align:start position:0%
you uh excuse how do you
 
03:21:53.950 --> 03:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
bring reconcile that those comments with
 
03:21:56.870 --> 03:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
the report that there are have not been
 
03:21:59.670 --> 03:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
very many uh disciplinary issues in
 
03:22:02.550 --> 03:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma is that incorrect or did I
 
03:22:04.429 --> 03:22:04.439 align:start position:0%
misunderstand no there haven't been very
 
03:22:06.510 --> 03:22:06.520 align:start position:0%
disciplinary very many disciplinary
 
03:22:08.670 --> 03:22:08.680 align:start position:0%
actions why the board has not taken care
 
03:22:10.110 --> 03:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
of these does it not ever reach the
 
03:22:12.309 --> 03:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
board or does the board know about it
 
03:22:14.550 --> 03:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
and not do anything I couldn't tell you
 
03:22:18.150 --> 03:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
that did you did you report the cases
 
03:22:20.910 --> 03:22:20.920 align:start position:0%
that came to your attention to the board
 
03:22:23.189 --> 03:22:23.199 align:start position:0%
the ca one of the cases practice one of
 
03:22:26.950 --> 03:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
the cases has already been presented and
 
03:22:28.309 --> 03:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
there was a lawsuit and you'll hear
 
03:22:30.990 --> 03:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
about that later some of the other cases
 
03:22:33.229 --> 03:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
were from my colleagues some of the
 
03:22:33.239 --> 03:22:34.790 align:start position:0%
were from my colleagues some of the
cases

03:22:34.790 --> 03:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
cases
 
03:22:38.830 --> 03:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
had necessarily a improper uh procedure
 
03:22:41.590 --> 03:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
done for example doing a open angle
 
03:22:43.630 --> 03:22:43.640 align:start position:0%
glaucoma procedure on an angle closure
 
03:22:45.070 --> 03:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
patient and vice
 
03:22:48.710 --> 03:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
versa doing reporting that to the board
 
03:22:50.110 --> 03:22:50.120 align:start position:0%
I've reported things to the board in the
 
03:22:52.269 --> 03:22:52.279 align:start position:0%
past and had no traction so that's
 
03:22:55.670 --> 03:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
something I don't do regularly thank
 
03:22:59.710 --> 03:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
you repres represent
 
03:23:01.590 --> 03:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you madam chairman and
 
03:23:02.630 --> 03:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question it
 
03:23:04.630 --> 03:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
sounds as though you have a referral
 
03:23:06.950 --> 03:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
practice of the of sorts with multiple
 
03:23:09.349 --> 03:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
subsp Specialists what percentage of
 
03:23:12.070 --> 03:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
your uh referrals in that are
 
03:23:14.070 --> 03:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
complications do you think come from
 
03:23:18.550 --> 03:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:20.870 --> 03:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
referrals from opthalmologist versus
 
03:23:23.110 --> 03:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
optometrist it's it's not a large
 
03:23:26.590 --> 03:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
portion of my practice of either one so
 
03:23:28.750 --> 03:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
I I would say a very small percentage of
 
03:23:31.269 --> 03:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
my total practice are patients refer
 
03:23:33.269 --> 03:23:33.279 align:start position:0%
from complications from opthamologists
 
03:23:33.279 --> 03:23:34.950 align:start position:0%
from complications from opthamologists
or

03:23:34.950 --> 03:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:23:38.110 --> 03:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
optometrists thank you representative
 
03:23:40.150 --> 03:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
gold thank you madam chair and thank you
 
03:23:43.389 --> 03:23:43.399 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you gave us um
 
03:23:46.710 --> 03:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
examples of complications and problems
 
03:23:50.590 --> 03:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
from surgery from um
 
03:23:53.510 --> 03:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
optometrist do you have the number of
 
03:23:57.710 --> 03:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
the similar uh complications from AOL
 
03:23:59.870 --> 03:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say that wrong from your
 
03:24:01.990 --> 03:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
profession in the same time period in
 
03:24:04.710 --> 03:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma you know I do not that that can
 
03:24:06.110 --> 03:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
be made available and it's made
 
03:24:08.070 --> 03:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
available because we have an independent
 
03:24:10.870 --> 03:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh Medical Board that oversees that and
 
03:24:15.510 --> 03:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
P and these Physicians also have uh uh
 
03:24:18.229 --> 03:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
local state Medical Association not of
 
03:24:20.030 --> 03:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists that oversees that as
 
03:24:22.030 --> 03:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
well thank you that number would be
 
03:24:26.030 --> 03:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:26.040 --> 03:24:31.389 align:start position:0%
 
compare

03:24:31.389 --> 03:24:31.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:34.710 --> 03:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
Mone say your name again please my name
 
03:24:37.110 --> 03:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
is Aon Fogle thank you to the members of
 
03:24:38.790 --> 03:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
the committee and Madam chair for
 
03:24:41.110 --> 03:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
allowing us to give our testimony this
 
03:24:43.990 --> 03:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon before I do that I would like
 
03:24:46.790 --> 03:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
to address representative leus and um
 
03:24:48.870 --> 03:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald's question about
 
03:24:51.670 --> 03:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
board authority if you have a copy of
 
03:24:54.990 --> 03:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
the um SB 440 in front of you I would
 
03:25:04.229 --> 03:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:08.269 --> 03:25:08.279 align:start position:0%
two this is a new section in RSA
 
03:25:12.030 --> 03:25:12.040 align:start position:0%
3276 DD which reads unless otherwise
 
03:25:14.110 --> 03:25:14.120 align:start position:0%
specified in this chapter the board
 
03:25:16.110 --> 03:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
shall have the authority to determine
 
03:25:17.870 --> 03:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
what constitutes the practice of
 
03:25:20.830 --> 03:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
Optometry by persons licensed under this
 
03:25:22.750 --> 03:25:22.760 align:start position:0%
chapter and shall establish the

certified to perform optomic procedures
 
03:25:31.830 --> 03:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
for the practice of Optometry that
 
03:25:33.670 --> 03:25:33.680 align:start position:0%

statutes I do also want to address some
 
03:26:08.429 --> 03:26:08.439 align:start position:0%
other things after my testimony but I
 
03:26:09.830 --> 03:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
would like to start by introducing
 
03:26:11.469 --> 03:26:11.479 align:start position:0%
myself a little more thoroughly my name
 
03:26:13.469 --> 03:26:13.479 align:start position:0%
is Aaron Fogle I'm an opthalmologist
 
03:26:15.389 --> 03:26:15.399 align:start position:0%
specializing in cornea and cataract
 
03:26:17.670 --> 03:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
surgery and I'm president of conquered
 
03:26:20.309 --> 03:26:20.319 align:start position:0%
Eye Center I've practiced in conquered
 
03:26:22.790 --> 03:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
for 30 years I'm here to speak in
 
03:26:25.030 --> 03:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
opposition of Senate Bill
 
03:26:28.630 --> 03:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
440 so when I meet people outside of
 
03:26:31.710 --> 03:26:31.720 align:start position:0%
work uh and they ask me what I do I
 
03:26:34.590 --> 03:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
generally say I'm an eye surgeon because
 
03:26:37.269 --> 03:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
most people don't know the difference in
 
03:26:39.150 --> 03:26:39.160 align:start position:0%
the skill set or training between an
 
03:26:40.950 --> 03:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist and an
 
03:26:43.030 --> 03:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
optometrist and since we're here to talk
 
03:26:45.750 --> 03:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
about an eye surgery bill I want to tell
 
03:26:47.550 --> 03:26:47.560 align:start position:0%
you what goes was into becoming an eye
 
03:26:49.830 --> 03:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
surgeon and how that differs from the
 
03:26:51.710 --> 03:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
training of an
 
03:26:54.070 --> 03:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
optometrist following College an
 
03:26:55.590 --> 03:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist spends four years in
 
03:26:57.630 --> 03:26:57.640 align:start position:0%
medical school learning anatomy and
 
03:26:59.870 --> 03:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
physiology and the diseases that plague
 
03:27:02.790 --> 03:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
us in our third and fourth year we start
 
03:27:05.469 --> 03:27:05.479 align:start position:0%
doing uh procedures on patients like
 
03:27:08.189 --> 03:27:08.199 align:start position:0%
learning how to suit your skin uh I
 
03:27:11.110 --> 03:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
putting in IVs chest tubes NG tubes and
 
03:27:13.710 --> 03:27:13.720 align:start position:0%
Central lines and it's not because we
 
03:27:16.590 --> 03:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
need these specific skills to become ni
 
03:27:19.309 --> 03:27:19.319 align:start position:0%
surgeon it's that For the First Time We
 
03:27:23.469 --> 03:27:23.479 align:start position:0%
Touch real live patients they in turn
 
03:27:28.150 --> 03:27:28.160 align:start position:0%
bleed and vomit move shake and faint we
 
03:27:30.950 --> 03:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
learn that's what people do surgical
 
03:27:32.429 --> 03:27:32.439 align:start position:0%
training part
 
03:27:34.910 --> 03:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
one after graduating as real doctors we
 
03:27:37.030 --> 03:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
spent a year as interns in a teaching
 
03:27:38.710 --> 03:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
hospital with critically ill patients
 
03:27:41.229 --> 03:27:41.239 align:start position:0%
that we are charged with keeping alive
 
03:27:43.150 --> 03:27:43.160 align:start position:0%
we speak to them about their medical and
 
03:27:46.389 --> 03:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
surgical treatments the risks benefits
 
03:27:48.750 --> 03:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
and Alternatives and counsel them when
 
03:27:51.309 --> 03:27:51.319 align:start position:0%
they've run out of options surgical
 
03:27:54.030 --> 03:27:54.040 align:start position:0%
training part two our three-year
 
03:27:56.189 --> 03:27:56.199 align:start position:0%
Residency program in Opthalmology is the
 
03:27:57.670 --> 03:27:57.680 align:start position:0%
most formal and intense period of
 
03:28:01.150 --> 03:28:01.160 align:start position:0%
training we're heavily supervised tested
 
03:28:03.269 --> 03:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
and pushed to absorb the knowledge
 
03:28:05.750 --> 03:28:05.760 align:start position:0%

03:28:06.590 --> 03:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
eye
 
03:28:09.710 --> 03:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
disease we build our surgical skills not
 
03:28:11.830 --> 03:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
just by listening to lectures or
 
03:28:14.269 --> 03:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
practicing in the lab but by
 
03:28:15.550 --> 03:28:15.560 align:start position:0%
additionally watching our senior
 
03:28:17.870 --> 03:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
residents and and attending physicians
 
03:28:20.510 --> 03:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
we begin to do parts of surgical cases
 
03:28:23.110 --> 03:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
adding steps as we gain skills until
 
03:28:25.189 --> 03:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
we're deemed competent Enough by our
 
03:28:27.670 --> 03:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
attending phys physicians to do the
 
03:28:31.630 --> 03:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
entire case as the primary surgeon we
 
03:28:34.269 --> 03:28:34.279 align:start position:0%
then Mentor younger surgeons teaching
 
03:28:36.189 --> 03:28:36.199 align:start position:0%
them what we've learned because nothing
 
03:28:38.670 --> 03:28:38.680 align:start position:0%
solidifies your knowledge like
 
03:28:41.110 --> 03:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
teaching we meet patients in our clinics
 
03:28:42.590 --> 03:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
gaining their trust until they consider
 
03:28:44.469 --> 03:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
us their eye doctor and if needed we
 
03:28:46.750 --> 03:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
prepare them for surgery celebrate our
 
03:28:48.630 --> 03:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
successes with them and learn how to
 
03:28:50.389 --> 03:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
handle and talk to them about our
 
03:28:52.630 --> 03:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
complications this is surgical training
 
03:28:55.710 --> 03:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
part three for our programs to maintain
 
03:28:57.750 --> 03:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
accreditation we must graduate with a
 
03:28:59.950 --> 03:28:59.960 align:start position:0%
minimum minimum number of cases
 
03:29:02.229 --> 03:29:02.239 align:start position:0%
performed as the primary surgeon in a
 
03:29:04.710 --> 03:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
variety of areas at this point we spent
 
03:29:07.389 --> 03:29:07.399 align:start position:0%
8 to 10 years in post col training and
 
03:29:10.790 --> 03:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
more than 177,000 clinical hours this is
 
03:29:12.830 --> 03:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
what goes into making an eye
 
03:29:15.229 --> 03:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
surgeon in contrast an optometrist
 
03:29:17.429 --> 03:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
spends four years in optometry school
 
03:29:19.070 --> 03:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
learning how to measure and fit glasses
 
03:29:21.429 --> 03:29:21.439 align:start position:0%
and contact lenses they learn to screen
 
03:29:23.790 --> 03:29:23.800 align:start position:0%
for and diagnose eye problems they have
 
03:29:26.510 --> 03:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
lectures in surgical procedures but
 
03:29:28.990 --> 03:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
there are no opportunities for Hands-On
 
03:29:31.670 --> 03:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
surgical training with live patients as
 
03:29:33.710 --> 03:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
nearly every optometry school in this
 
03:29:36.429 --> 03:29:36.439 align:start position:0%
country is located in a state that does
 
03:29:38.309 --> 03:29:38.319 align:start position:0%
not give them surgical
 
03:29:40.349 --> 03:29:40.359 align:start position:0%
privileges in their course curriculum
 
03:29:42.429 --> 03:29:42.439 align:start position:0%
during optometry school less than 5% of
 
03:29:44.990 --> 03:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
their credit hours are devoted to laser
 
03:29:46.670 --> 03:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
and surgery
 
03:29:49.070 --> 03:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
in their supplementary weekend course
 
03:29:51.510 --> 03:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
only eight hours are devoted to Hands-On
 
03:29:54.469 --> 03:29:54.479 align:start position:0%
teaching of eight different procedures
 
03:29:57.229 --> 03:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
that's one hour per procedure on plastic
 
03:30:01.349 --> 03:30:01.359 align:start position:0%
eyes that don't move shake or faint and
 
03:30:03.389 --> 03:30:03.399 align:start position:0%
they don't have minimum standards or
 
03:30:05.830 --> 03:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
number of cases to become
 
03:30:08.269 --> 03:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
certified if you'd like I'd invite you
 
03:30:12.389 --> 03:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
to turn to page eight in your white
 
03:30:15.269 --> 03:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
booklet there you will see a picture of
 
03:30:17.150 --> 03:30:17.160 align:start position:0%
a photograph of an optometry student
 
03:30:18.710 --> 03:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
practicing suturing techniques on a
 
03:30:18.720 --> 03:30:19.630 align:start position:0%
practicing suturing techniques on a
chicken

03:30:19.630 --> 03:30:19.640 align:start position:0%
chicken
 
03:30:21.950 --> 03:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
breast while this may be a starting
 
03:30:23.110 --> 03:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
point to learn how to hold the
 
03:30:26.469 --> 03:30:26.479 align:start position:0%
instruments and tie a suture it can't be
 
03:30:28.309 --> 03:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
the beginning middle and end of training
 
03:30:30.469 --> 03:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
for suturing the eyelids or skin around
 
03:30:33.870 --> 03:30:33.880 align:start position:0%
the eye but it is if you never train on
 
03:30:36.550 --> 03:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
live patients first of all you don't
 
03:30:39.590 --> 03:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
have to anesthetize a chicken breast
 
03:30:41.550 --> 03:30:41.560 align:start position:0%
chicken breasts don't bleed so there's
 
03:30:44.030 --> 03:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
no opportunity to practice cautery
 
03:30:46.189 --> 03:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
skills a powerful tool that can melt
 
03:30:48.070 --> 03:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
tissue and cause permanent aery to
 
03:30:50.189 --> 03:30:50.199 align:start position:0%
anything it touches if it's not used
 
03:30:53.189 --> 03:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
properly there are no eyebrows nose or
 
03:30:55.429 --> 03:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
cheeks to get in the way of suturing a
 
03:30:57.630 --> 03:30:57.640 align:start position:0%
chicken breast so there's no real life
 
03:31:00.070 --> 03:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
experience developing ham postures
 
03:31:03.030 --> 03:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
needed to Su suture in the small tight
 
03:31:06.150 --> 03:31:06.160 align:start position:0%
space around the eye the chicken breast
 
03:31:08.429 --> 03:31:08.439 align:start position:0%
isn't going to move blink or ask if
 
03:31:11.630 --> 03:31:11.640 align:start position:0%
you're done yet finally I doubt anyone's
 
03:31:13.070 --> 03:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
hand is going to shake when they
 
03:31:15.189 --> 03:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
approach a chicken breast with a suture
 
03:31:17.229 --> 03:31:17.239 align:start position:0%
but the first time you do this on a live
 
03:31:20.189 --> 03:31:20.199 align:start position:0%
patient your hands will definitely shake
 
03:31:22.150 --> 03:31:22.160 align:start position:0%
and you want a mentor sitting next to
 
03:31:23.550 --> 03:31:23.560 align:start position:0%
you you don't want to be doing this in
 
03:31:25.269 --> 03:31:25.279 align:start position:0%
your office by
 
03:31:27.269 --> 03:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
yourself the second picture you see
 
03:31:28.830 --> 03:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
there is a plastic eye mounted in front
 
03:31:31.790 --> 03:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
of a laser some picture some patients
 
03:31:34.229 --> 03:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
ask if we take out the eyeball and do
 
03:31:36.030 --> 03:31:36.040 align:start position:0%
surgery on it and then replace it back
 
03:31:37.269 --> 03:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
all while they're
 
03:31:39.710 --> 03:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
asleep as ridiculous at that as that
 
03:31:42.269 --> 03:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
sounds it would make it easier just like
 
03:31:45.269 --> 03:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
lasering a plastic eyeball no movement
 
03:31:47.910 --> 03:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
blinking or pulling away to contend with
 
03:31:49.990 --> 03:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
plastic eyes have no variability in the
 
03:31:52.229 --> 03:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
way the laser react in the way the
 
03:31:53.950 --> 03:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
plastic reacts to the
 
03:31:56.389 --> 03:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
laser there's no need to change laser
 
03:31:59.269 --> 03:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
settings and no opacity cloudiness or
 
03:32:01.429 --> 03:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
atypical Anatomy to Cloud The
 
03:32:04.030 --> 03:32:04.040 align:start position:0%
View we have heard optometrists say they
 
03:32:05.870 --> 03:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
want to practice to the highest level of
 
03:32:09.469 --> 03:32:09.479 align:start position:0%
their training but in my opinion most of
 
03:32:12.590 --> 03:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
them have been given false expectations
 
03:32:14.830 --> 03:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
by their training programs who say this
 
03:32:17.189 --> 03:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
training this this training on chicken
 
03:32:19.630 --> 03:32:19.640 align:start position:0%
breasts and plastic eyeballs is good
 
03:32:23.590 --> 03:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
enough it simply is not optometrist call
 
03:32:25.389 --> 03:32:25.399 align:start position:0%
themselves primary eye care doctors not
 
03:32:27.870 --> 03:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
eye surgeons for good reason because
 
03:32:29.710 --> 03:32:29.720 align:start position:0%
they aren't but the average New
 
03:32:31.309 --> 03:32:31.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizen hasn't heard the
 
03:32:34.070 --> 03:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
lengthy description you've just heard
 
03:32:35.429 --> 03:32:35.439 align:start position:0%
they don't know the difference between
 
03:32:38.150 --> 03:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
the two Specialties they depend on the
 
03:32:40.750 --> 03:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
legislature to license appropriately so
 
03:32:42.950 --> 03:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
they are guaranteed competency when it
 
03:32:46.189 --> 03:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
comes to who performs their eye surgery
 
03:32:48.670 --> 03:32:48.680 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 440 proposes to bypass the
 
03:32:51.510 --> 03:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
training needed to perform safe
 
03:32:56.950 --> 03:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:01.150 --> 03:33:01.160 align:start position:0%
surgery if you'd like I would uh like to
 
03:33:04.670 --> 03:33:04.680 align:start position:0%
address a term that's been brought up in
 
03:33:09.429 --> 03:33:09.439 align:start position:0%
response to our um abil our our um our
 
03:33:12.150 --> 03:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
attempt to compromise I was in the
 
03:33:15.150 --> 03:33:15.160 align:start position:0%
hearing with um three of my Optometric
 
03:33:15.160 --> 03:33:16.309 align:start position:0%
hearing with um three of my Optometric
colleagues

03:33:16.309 --> 03:33:16.319 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
03:33:19.510 --> 03:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
and um the speaker of the house and we
 
03:33:22.670 --> 03:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
were able to listen to their requests
 
03:33:24.950 --> 03:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
and we stand ready to compromise on
 
03:33:28.070 --> 03:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
several items I think Dr Morris included
 
03:33:31.070 --> 03:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
in her presentation including allowing
 
03:33:34.830 --> 03:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
the Odes to prescribe hydrocodone
 
03:33:37.030 --> 03:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
reducing as they requested the CME
 
03:33:39.790 --> 03:33:39.800 align:start position:0%
requirement to 20 hours per year
 
03:33:42.630 --> 03:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
maintaining a self-regulating board and
 
03:33:44.309 --> 03:33:44.319 align:start position:0%
four procedures on their list that would
 
03:33:46.790 --> 03:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
expand their current scope by
 
03:33:49.550 --> 03:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
36% but the term Line in the Sand has
 
03:33:51.950 --> 03:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
gained momentum in our
 
03:33:54.389 --> 03:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
discussions we would like to continue
 
03:33:56.349 --> 03:33:56.359 align:start position:0%
working with our optimetric colleagues
 
03:33:58.550 --> 03:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
to deliver high quality of care to our
 
03:34:01.110 --> 03:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
patients we're not trying to be
 
03:34:03.389 --> 03:34:03.399 align:start position:0%
obstructionists we care about patient
 
03:34:06.030 --> 03:34:06.040 align:start position:0%
safety but we Define these privileges
 
03:34:08.469 --> 03:34:08.479 align:start position:0%
that they are requesting as surgery and
 
03:34:10.269 --> 03:34:10.279 align:start position:0%
we believe only doctors with surgical
 
03:34:12.110 --> 03:34:12.120 align:start position:0%
training should do
 
03:34:18.910 --> 03:34:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:21.150 --> 03:34:21.160 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair thank you
 
03:34:24.710 --> 03:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
for taking the question and I understand
 
03:34:28.150 --> 03:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
specifically that this is about patient
 
03:34:32.389 --> 03:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
safety access is important but
 
03:34:35.269 --> 03:34:35.279 align:start position:0%
access increasing access doesn't
 
03:34:38.630 --> 03:34:38.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily increase patient safety so
 
03:34:41.110 --> 03:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
my question is would you be able to
 
03:34:44.550 --> 03:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
provide this committee bless you with
 
03:34:47.510 --> 03:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
those topics that you discussed willing
 
03:34:49.710 --> 03:34:49.720 align:start position:0%
to compromise on so that we can look at
 
03:34:54.510 --> 03:34:54.520 align:start position:0%
them because I agree with you 100% that
 
03:34:56.070 --> 03:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
when you get into surgery and especially
 
03:34:57.630 --> 03:34:57.640 align:start position:0%
surgery around the eyes correct
 
03:34:59.510 --> 03:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
diagnosis and making sure you have a
 
03:35:01.950 --> 03:35:01.960 align:start position:0%
competent person doing that procedure is
 
03:35:03.990 --> 03:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
important so I would like to have if you
 
03:35:05.950 --> 03:35:05.960 align:start position:0%
could get us that information um correct
 
03:35:07.790 --> 03:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
me if I'm wrong Dr KY but I believe
 
03:35:09.510 --> 03:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
that's all in the blue book that you
 
03:35:13.469 --> 03:35:13.479 align:start position:0%
have the blue um informational materials
 
03:35:16.550 --> 03:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
oh yes it probably is
 
03:35:23.630 --> 03:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:27.349 --> 03:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
it ah yes who if whoever was giving out
 
03:35:29.389 --> 03:35:29.399 align:start position:0%
these handouts could make sure
 
03:35:31.469 --> 03:35:31.479 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt has a set we
 
03:35:34.830 --> 03:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
would appreciate it thank
 
03:35:34.840 --> 03:35:36.429 align:start position:0%
would appreciate it thank
you

03:35:36.429 --> 03:35:36.439 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:35:41.910 --> 03:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:50.710 --> 03:35:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:54.550 --> 03:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
yes oh okay well
 
03:35:57.189 --> 03:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
then good we'll save them for somebody
 
03:36:02.870 --> 03:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:06.870 --> 03:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
though thanks for finding me thank
 
03:36:09.269 --> 03:36:09.279 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam chair and the
 
03:36:10.750 --> 03:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for allowing me
 
03:36:12.910 --> 03:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
to uh participate in this
 
03:36:14.750 --> 03:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
hearing um and greetings from the
 
03:36:16.309 --> 03:36:16.319 align:start position:0%
Commonwealth of Kent
 
03:36:20.469 --> 03:36:20.479 align:start position:0%
I apologize if my accent is a problem uh
 
03:36:22.110 --> 03:36:22.120 align:start position:0%
with the proceedings today perhaps the
 
03:36:25.389 --> 03:36:25.399 align:start position:0%
translator would have been in order um
 
03:36:27.750 --> 03:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
my name is Cliff CLE I'm a practicing
 
03:36:30.229 --> 03:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
optometrist in the state of Kentucky I
 
03:36:34.510 --> 03:36:34.520 align:start position:0%
graduated in 1995 I did a residency in
 
03:36:37.309 --> 03:36:37.319 align:start position:0%
Primary Care Optometry at
 
03:36:40.510 --> 03:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma um several years after they
 
03:36:42.070 --> 03:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
received privileges to do these
 
03:36:44.469 --> 03:36:44.479 align:start position:0%
procedures and had been performing them
 
03:36:48.150 --> 03:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
on my fellow kentuckians um on and off
 
03:36:51.750 --> 03:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
for roughly that time since
 
03:36:55.030 --> 03:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
2015 uh I joined the Kentucky College of
 
03:36:57.710 --> 03:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
Optometry which is a new College of
 
03:37:00.590 --> 03:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
Optometry located in rural Eastern
 
03:37:02.910 --> 03:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
Kentucky and one of the reasons why I
 
03:37:04.910 --> 03:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
joined there was
 
03:37:08.030 --> 03:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
because our scope of practice included
 
03:37:10.429 --> 03:37:10.439 align:start position:0%
these procedures for our fellow
 
03:37:13.429 --> 03:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
kentuckians and I wanted to be a part of
 
03:37:17.070 --> 03:37:17.080 align:start position:0%
the training team that was responsible
 
03:37:19.950 --> 03:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
for making sure that my future
 
03:37:23.150 --> 03:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
colleagues would be competent in these
 
03:37:25.910 --> 03:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
procedures so I want to make sure that
 
03:37:28.670 --> 03:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
the committee understands that a lot of
 
03:37:28.680 --> 03:37:29.670 align:start position:0%
the committee understands that a lot of
the

03:37:29.670 --> 03:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:37:32.070 --> 03:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
foundational uh training that students
 
03:37:34.830 --> 03:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
receive in optometry school is in the
 
03:37:38.349 --> 03:37:38.359 align:start position:0%
areas of anatomy physiology pharmacology
 
03:37:41.830 --> 03:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
pathology okay and Optics and and other
 
03:37:43.910 --> 03:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
refractive issues those are the
 
03:37:46.469 --> 03:37:46.479 align:start position:0%
foundational things that any surgeon
 
03:37:49.750 --> 03:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
needs any uh healthc care provider needs
 
03:37:52.070 --> 03:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
and those things have been in optimetric
 
03:37:55.309 --> 03:37:55.319 align:start position:0%
education long before uh I became into
 
03:37:58.110 --> 03:37:58.120 align:start position:0%
this or came into this profession in the
 
03:38:01.469 --> 03:38:01.479 align:start position:0%
last probably 20 years or so the schools
 
03:38:04.990 --> 03:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
have started to add some of the
 
03:38:08.510 --> 03:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
curriculum necessary to be specific to
 
03:38:09.950 --> 03:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
Opthalmic procedures that we're
 
03:38:09.960 --> 03:38:11.070 align:start position:0%
Opthalmic procedures that we're
discussing

03:38:11.070 --> 03:38:11.080 align:start position:0%
discussing
 
03:38:14.510 --> 03:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
today these laser procedures especially
 
03:38:16.670 --> 03:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
are procedures that utilize what's known
 
03:38:20.429 --> 03:38:20.439 align:start position:0%
as a slit lamp which which is attached
 
03:38:23.670 --> 03:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
or or added to the laser uh components
 
03:38:26.269 --> 03:38:26.279 align:start position:0%
are and these students start using a
 
03:38:28.590 --> 03:38:28.600 align:start position:0%
slit lamp in their first year so they
 
03:38:31.870 --> 03:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
are learning how to examine how to focus
 
03:38:35.630 --> 03:38:35.640 align:start position:0%
how to um concentrate the energy the
 
03:38:38.590 --> 03:38:38.600 align:start position:0%
light the whatever on the specific part
 
03:38:41.469 --> 03:38:41.479 align:start position:0%
of the eye that they need to early early
 
03:38:43.670 --> 03:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
in their career a little bit later in
 
03:38:47.110 --> 03:38:47.120 align:start position:0%
their career then we inform them and
 
03:38:50.309 --> 03:38:50.319 align:start position:0%
guide them on the specifics necessary to
 
03:38:52.550 --> 03:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
be able to do that for laser
 
03:38:55.189 --> 03:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
procedures So currently I am the course
 
03:38:57.710 --> 03:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
director for two courses at the Kentucky
 
03:38:59.429 --> 03:38:59.439 align:start position:0%
College of Optometry one of them is
 
03:39:03.150 --> 03:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
Opthalmic surgery one that's lasers and
 
03:39:06.389 --> 03:39:06.399 align:start position:0%
Opthalmic surgery 2 that's injections
 
03:39:11.229 --> 03:39:11.239 align:start position:0%
and periocular procedures okay so what
 
03:39:14.189 --> 03:39:14.199 align:start position:0%
we do in those courses is build upon the
 
03:39:16.910 --> 03:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
foundational knowledge of anatomy etc
 
03:39:20.590 --> 03:39:20.600 align:start position:0%
etc right to make the curriculum
 
03:39:24.389 --> 03:39:24.399 align:start position:0%
specific for procedural care so yes we
 
03:39:27.870 --> 03:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
have dactic um uh or lecture uh
 
03:39:30.150 --> 03:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
classroom uh activities that are
 
03:39:34.309 --> 03:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
involved in the diagnosis the the um
 
03:39:36.110 --> 03:39:36.120 align:start position:0%
decision to perform the
 
03:39:39.349 --> 03:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
procedure um the correct management of
 
03:39:39.359 --> 03:39:40.710 align:start position:0%
procedure um the correct management of
of

03:39:40.710 --> 03:39:40.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:39:43.510 --> 03:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
complications uh Etc and then we have an
 
03:39:46.590 --> 03:39:46.600 align:start position:0%
extensive Hands-On Laboratory work that
 
03:39:49.389 --> 03:39:49.399 align:start position:0%
we do in order for the student to be
 
03:39:51.550 --> 03:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
provided with the foundational skills
 
03:39:54.309 --> 03:39:54.319 align:start position:0%
necessary to be able to again focus on
 
03:39:56.830 --> 03:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
the correct uh tissue to understand the
 
03:39:59.910 --> 03:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
laser settings and uh understand
 
03:40:02.910 --> 03:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
informed consent and the process uh of a
 
03:40:05.429 --> 03:40:05.439 align:start position:0%
surgical procedure for that
 
03:40:09.469 --> 03:40:09.479 align:start position:0%
day additionally in my state um I also
 
03:40:11.790 --> 03:40:11.800 align:start position:0%
supervise what's known as the expanded
 
03:40:13.710 --> 03:40:13.720 align:start position:0%
Therapeutics clinic in which we perform
 
03:40:15.990 --> 03:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
these procedures routinely L at the
 
03:40:18.670 --> 03:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
Kentucky College of Optometry and I want
 
03:40:21.150 --> 03:40:21.160 align:start position:0%
to step back just for a second and and
 
03:40:23.870 --> 03:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
address one thing that I heard as a
 
03:40:27.030 --> 03:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative of of Kentucky I'd like
 
03:40:28.910 --> 03:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
to go back a little bit to the access
 
03:40:31.429 --> 03:40:31.439 align:start position:0%
issue it was mentioned that there was no
 
03:40:33.349 --> 03:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
reports or little reports of access
 
03:40:35.910 --> 03:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
problems in Kentucky in Pike County
 
03:40:38.710 --> 03:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
where I um where I practice if you know
 
03:40:40.070 --> 03:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
what Kentucky looks like it's that
 
03:40:42.150 --> 03:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
little point on the very Eastern part
 
03:40:44.950 --> 03:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
all right um there's not much around
 
03:40:49.070 --> 03:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
there and currently the wait time for uh
 
03:40:51.870 --> 03:40:51.880 align:start position:0%
someone to see an opthalmologist for a
 
03:40:54.150 --> 03:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
procedure like we're discussing today is
 
03:40:57.229 --> 03:40:57.239 align:start position:0%
6 to n months all right now the patient
 
03:40:59.389 --> 03:40:59.399 align:start position:0%
can travel two to three hours to have
 
03:41:02.070 --> 03:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
this done yes but that's part of the
 
03:41:04.189 --> 03:41:04.199 align:start position:0%
axis that we're talking about here so in
 
03:41:07.389 --> 03:41:07.399 align:start position:0%
my state one of the reasons why this
 
03:41:09.830 --> 03:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
institution was developed and placed
 
03:41:12.070 --> 03:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
there was specifically because of the
 
03:41:14.510 --> 03:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
access our our bill was known as the
 
03:41:17.630 --> 03:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
better access to iare act right in
 
03:41:20.269 --> 03:41:20.279 align:start position:0%
Kentucky we passed that in 2011 and the
 
03:41:22.990 --> 03:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
school was uh graduated its first class
 
03:41:26.830 --> 03:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
in 2020 entered its first class in 2016
 
03:41:29.110 --> 03:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
again specifically in response to the
 
03:41:31.790 --> 03:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
access issue so we dropped the school
 
03:41:33.950 --> 03:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
right in the middle of where the access
 
03:41:36.429 --> 03:41:36.439 align:start position:0%
was a problem all right and just like
 
03:41:38.550 --> 03:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
our osteopathic colleagues at our at our
 
03:41:40.469 --> 03:41:40.479 align:start position:0%
College we were making a big difference
 
03:41:42.110 --> 03:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
in serving the underserved in Eastern
 
03:41:44.030 --> 03:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
Kentucky so I'd like to provide
 
03:41:47.110 --> 03:41:47.120 align:start position:0%
testimony about the AC ESS in our state
 
03:41:48.550 --> 03:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
there was also another question about
 
03:41:51.429 --> 03:41:51.439 align:start position:0%
board autonomy or board um
 
03:41:54.149 --> 03:41:54.159 align:start position:0%
self-regulation Kentucky is exactly that
 
03:41:56.429 --> 03:41:56.439 align:start position:0%
there was a question I I apologize from
 
03:41:59.030 --> 03:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
from this side over here about was there
 
03:42:01.550 --> 03:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
another state where a board had similar
 
03:42:03.630 --> 03:42:03.640 align:start position:0%
Authority and Kentucky has that
 
03:42:06.309 --> 03:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
Authority the Kentucky Board of
 
03:42:08.910 --> 03:42:08.920 align:start position:0%
Optometry has the authority I believe
 
03:42:11.030 --> 03:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
exactly what Verbatim what is written in
 
03:42:13.830 --> 03:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
this one in terms of uh it's the body
 
03:42:16.229 --> 03:42:16.239 align:start position:0%
that governs the practice of cometry I
 
03:42:17.469 --> 03:42:17.479 align:start position:0%
can't speak to all of them in the
 
03:42:19.950 --> 03:42:19.960 align:start position:0%
country but I can tell you that there is
 
03:42:22.990 --> 03:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
there is Kentucky right and that's been
 
03:42:23.000 --> 03:42:24.870 align:start position:0%
there is Kentucky right and that's been
since

03:42:24.870 --> 03:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
since
 
03:42:28.149 --> 03:42:28.159 align:start position:0%
2011 so in addition to the didactic work
 
03:42:30.149 --> 03:42:30.159 align:start position:0%
that we do we do these procedures in
 
03:42:33.910 --> 03:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
clinic um at least weekly uh the clinic
 
03:42:35.790 --> 03:42:35.800 align:start position:0%
that I supervise and they also do it at
 
03:42:38.110 --> 03:42:38.120 align:start position:0%
a regional hospital which is uh
 
03:42:40.790 --> 03:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
virtually across the street uh where the
 
03:42:42.790 --> 03:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
single practicing opthalmologist in Pike
 
03:42:46.149 --> 03:42:46.159 align:start position:0%
County um is employed so the procedures
 
03:42:48.349 --> 03:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
are performed at the hospital as well as
 
03:42:51.389 --> 03:42:51.399 align:start position:0%
well as in our oncampus clinic right and
 
03:42:54.710 --> 03:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
the process that we go through is the
 
03:42:58.349 --> 03:42:58.359 align:start position:0%
old Mantra of see one do one teach one
 
03:43:01.309 --> 03:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
right so our students often come into my
 
03:43:03.590 --> 03:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
clinic and they watch me do one of these
 
03:43:07.710 --> 03:43:07.720 align:start position:0%
procedures okay the next one then I am
 
03:43:09.510 --> 03:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
right there with them like an angel on
 
03:43:11.510 --> 03:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
their shoulder watching them punch that
 
03:43:12.950 --> 03:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
button for the first time to do these
 
03:43:15.870 --> 03:43:15.880 align:start position:0%
laser procedures or do an injection
 
03:43:18.990 --> 03:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
and I will say with certainty because
 
03:43:21.750 --> 03:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
I'm the one who does it that these folks
 
03:43:24.469 --> 03:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
do it correctly they do it safely and
 
03:43:27.269 --> 03:43:27.279 align:start position:0%
they do it under my ospice all right if
 
03:43:31.110 --> 03:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
they're not then they're they they're
 
03:43:33.870 --> 03:43:33.880 align:start position:0%
they're asked in a way as to not alarm a
 
03:43:35.910 --> 03:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
patient and we say well let me let me
 
03:43:37.710 --> 03:43:37.720 align:start position:0%
take over for that for you for just a
 
03:43:39.229 --> 03:43:39.239 align:start position:0%
second or let me take a look for a
 
03:43:42.189 --> 03:43:42.199 align:start position:0%
second but I'm the one responsible for
 
03:43:44.389 --> 03:43:44.399 align:start position:0%
providing the care to those to those
 
03:43:46.870 --> 03:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
patients but I'm also responsible for
 
03:43:49.030 --> 03:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
providing the care necessary to be able
 
03:43:51.189 --> 03:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
to train these students to do it and I
 
03:43:53.910 --> 03:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
take it very very seriously and so do my
 
03:43:56.349 --> 03:43:56.359 align:start position:0%
colleagues in the other schools and I
 
03:43:59.030 --> 03:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
want you to understand that this is not
 
03:44:00.870 --> 03:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
from our standpoint this is not a
 
03:44:02.990 --> 03:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
political issue we are training these
 
03:44:05.070 --> 03:44:05.080 align:start position:0%
students to do these procedures in
 
03:44:07.630 --> 03:44:07.640 align:start position:0%
preparation to get them to go out and
 
03:44:10.429 --> 03:44:10.439 align:start position:0%
provide the care and provide care in
 
03:44:13.670 --> 03:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
areas where they need this access right
 
03:44:15.349 --> 03:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
getting in the way of this is is going
 
03:44:18.149 --> 03:44:18.159 align:start position:0%
to slow down the ability for optometrist
 
03:44:19.750 --> 03:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
to be able to do this in the state of
 
03:44:21.750 --> 03:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire just like it did in the
 
03:44:23.950 --> 03:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
state of Kentucky I don't think there's
 
03:44:27.349 --> 03:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
any um any coincidence to the fact that
 
03:44:29.189 --> 03:44:29.199 align:start position:0%
though there are more schools that have
 
03:44:32.070 --> 03:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
opened all right in the last few years
 
03:44:34.469 --> 03:44:34.479 align:start position:0%
and they include this type of curriculum
 
03:44:37.189 --> 03:44:37.199 align:start position:0%
right because this is becoming the norm
 
03:44:40.590 --> 03:44:40.600 align:start position:0%
for optometry in other states and New
 
03:44:43.790 --> 03:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in my opinion should uh get on
 
03:44:46.550 --> 03:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
board in terms of of understanding that
 
03:44:48.710 --> 03:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
other states have been doing this often
 
03:44:50.469 --> 03:44:50.479 align:start position:0%
times for years and years and years and
 
03:44:54.590 --> 03:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
years uh with an excellent uh safety
 
03:44:56.870 --> 03:44:56.880 align:start position:0%
track record you have documentation in
 
03:44:59.070 --> 03:44:59.080 align:start position:0%
there uh some of the specifics about the
 
03:45:01.269 --> 03:45:01.279 align:start position:0%
curriculum in the schools you have my
 
03:45:03.149 --> 03:45:03.159 align:start position:0%
testimony um about some of the
 
03:45:06.269 --> 03:45:06.279 align:start position:0%
curriculum in the schools um you have
 
03:45:08.269 --> 03:45:08.279 align:start position:0%
you have documents in there about the uh
 
03:45:10.149 --> 03:45:10.159 align:start position:0%
number of procedures that have per been
 
03:45:12.349 --> 03:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
performed in several States in Kentucky
 
03:45:15.070 --> 03:45:15.080 align:start position:0%
the estimate is about 60,000 all right
 
03:45:17.550 --> 03:45:17.560 align:start position:0%
which with no uh Adverse Events uh
 
03:45:21.189 --> 03:45:21.199 align:start position:0%
reported to the board right surgery
 
03:45:23.309 --> 03:45:23.319 align:start position:0%
results in Adverse Events and
 
03:45:25.630 --> 03:45:25.640 align:start position:0%
complications irrespective of who
 
03:45:28.590 --> 03:45:28.600 align:start position:0%
performs it right but Adverse Events and
 
03:45:32.389 --> 03:45:32.399 align:start position:0%
complications are not an admonishment of
 
03:45:34.790 --> 03:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
incompetency right and I think that's
 
03:45:37.030 --> 03:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
important to understand so are my
 
03:45:39.269 --> 03:45:39.279 align:start position:0%
students trained to be able to handle
 
03:45:40.950 --> 03:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
the complications as well as the
 
03:45:43.630 --> 03:45:43.640 align:start position:0%
interoperative or the procedural things
 
03:45:45.870 --> 03:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
yes they are and I think that's one
 
03:45:49.110 --> 03:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
reason why I wanted to to visit uh
 
03:45:52.269 --> 03:45:52.279 align:start position:0%
conquered did I did I say it right okay
 
03:45:54.870 --> 03:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
all right out of here it's Concord sorry
 
03:45:58.429 --> 03:45:58.439 align:start position:0%
so Concord and uh and and and and bring
 
03:46:01.349 --> 03:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
this information to you um I'll wrap up
 
03:46:02.830 --> 03:46:02.840 align:start position:0%
because again you've got you've got my
 
03:46:05.429 --> 03:46:05.439 align:start position:0%
written testimony in here but um there
 
03:46:07.149 --> 03:46:07.159 align:start position:0%
are a couple of different standards that
 
03:46:10.110 --> 03:46:10.120 align:start position:0%
are now starting to be adopted uh
 
03:46:12.110 --> 03:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
nationally by the Association of schools
 
03:46:14.070 --> 03:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
and colleges of Optometry which is
 
03:46:17.269 --> 03:46:17.279 align:start position:0%
obviously the assoc assciation um that
 
03:46:18.950 --> 03:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
um governs schools and colleges of
 
03:46:20.950 --> 03:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
Optometry and makes recommendations
 
03:46:24.469 --> 03:46:24.479 align:start position:0%
about curricula and in a recent outline
 
03:46:26.870 --> 03:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
a detail outline of the three pillars
 
03:46:28.630 --> 03:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
excuse me the three pillars of core
 
03:46:30.590 --> 03:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
competency and surgery that was
 
03:46:32.750 --> 03:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
professional value and ethics knowledge
 
03:46:35.389 --> 03:46:35.399 align:start position:0%
and skill and that first one is the one
 
03:46:37.309 --> 03:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
that I would really like to to to focus
 
03:46:40.110 --> 03:46:40.120 align:start position:0%
on that professional values and ethics
 
03:46:42.389 --> 03:46:42.399 align:start position:0%
our colleagues our Optometric colleagues
 
03:46:44.110 --> 03:46:44.120 align:start position:0%
are not going to perform these
 
03:46:48.149 --> 03:46:48.159 align:start position:0%
procedures if they have not uh received
 
03:46:50.670 --> 03:46:50.680 align:start position:0%
enough training for them to be
 
03:46:52.870 --> 03:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
comfortable to perform these by
 
03:46:54.910 --> 03:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
licensure our medical colleagues you
 
03:46:57.830 --> 03:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
know can do virtually any procedure but
 
03:47:00.189 --> 03:47:00.199 align:start position:0%
you know a uh primary care physician for
 
03:47:02.510 --> 03:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
example is not going to undergo a
 
03:47:05.269 --> 03:47:05.279 align:start position:0%
Neurosurgical procedure in a hospital
 
03:47:07.510 --> 03:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
right because he she has not received
 
03:47:08.990 --> 03:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
the appropriate training to do that
 
03:47:11.429 --> 03:47:11.439 align:start position:0%
although by lure he she can do that
 
03:47:13.950 --> 03:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
right and our colleagues are going to be
 
03:47:15.429 --> 03:47:15.439 align:start position:0%
very similar if they don't have an
 
03:47:17.950 --> 03:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
interest in this if they don't have a
 
03:47:20.510 --> 03:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
Acumen for it or whatever our colleagues
 
03:47:22.710 --> 03:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
are not going to do that and our board
 
03:47:25.110 --> 03:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
is going to ensure that that happens so
 
03:47:29.349 --> 03:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
I I want to try to give you some some um
 
03:47:31.510 --> 03:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
some Solace here that this is going to
 
03:47:33.590 --> 03:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
be uh this is going to be handled
 
03:47:35.990 --> 03:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
professionally and that uh our
 
03:47:38.149 --> 03:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
colleagues are are certainly have the
 
03:47:40.229 --> 03:47:40.239 align:start position:0%
same uh professional values and ethics
 
03:47:42.550 --> 03:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
that uh healthc care providers uh have
 
03:47:44.510 --> 03:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
across this country and lastly the
 
03:47:46.830 --> 03:47:46.840 align:start position:0%
accredit ation body that uh accredits
 
03:47:48.990 --> 03:47:49.000 align:start position:0%
all of our schools and colleges through
 
03:47:52.110 --> 03:47:52.120 align:start position:0%
the US Department of Education is uh
 
03:47:54.309 --> 03:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
coming up with uh some standards that
 
03:47:56.670 --> 03:47:56.680 align:start position:0%
will include these types of procedures
 
03:48:00.229 --> 03:48:00.239 align:start position:0%
as well so the schools will be um will
 
03:48:02.910 --> 03:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
be it will be incumbent upon the schools
 
03:48:04.910 --> 03:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure that this type of
 
03:48:08.189 --> 03:48:08.199 align:start position:0%
curriculum is involved um moving forward
 
03:48:09.590 --> 03:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
you know some of the older schools
 
03:48:11.510 --> 03:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
that's uh you know something that they
 
03:48:14.389 --> 03:48:14.399 align:start position:0%
have to you know uh change a little bit
 
03:48:16.950 --> 03:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
more than some of the newer schools but
 
03:48:19.790 --> 03:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
now all of this uh as a profession and
 
03:48:21.950 --> 03:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
as a group of schools and colleges we
 
03:48:24.349 --> 03:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
have a commitment to be able to provide
 
03:48:25.309 --> 03:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
this type of
 
03:48:28.030 --> 03:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
training and I thank you for your time
 
03:48:29.910 --> 03:48:29.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative groda thank you
 
03:48:33.030 --> 03:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you Dr CLE sure can
 
03:48:35.189 --> 03:48:35.199 align:start position:0%
you please tell me how many um students
 
03:48:37.070 --> 03:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
do you have graduating every year from
 
03:48:39.630 --> 03:48:39.640 align:start position:0%
your in from your school we matriculate
 
03:48:42.870 --> 03:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
about 60 and our graduating class is
 
03:48:45.550 --> 03:48:45.560 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 58 to 6 three just
 
03:48:47.550 --> 03:48:47.560 align:start position:0%
depending on how successful they are in
 
03:48:50.510 --> 03:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
the in the program followup follow up
 
03:48:52.510 --> 03:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
and how many years is the program it's
 
03:48:56.670 --> 03:48:56.680 align:start position:0%
four years last question follow um of
 
03:48:58.429 --> 03:48:58.439 align:start position:0%
these procedures that are in House
 
03:49:00.030 --> 03:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
03:49:02.950 --> 03:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
440 which how many of those procedures
 
03:49:05.590 --> 03:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
are taught in your school how many of
 
03:49:07.469 --> 03:49:07.479 align:start position:0%
the procedures are taught all of them
 
03:49:08.950 --> 03:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
all of them okay all three of the laser
 
03:49:11.429 --> 03:49:11.439 align:start position:0%
procedures and the lid procedures thank
 
03:49:15.389 --> 03:49:15.399 align:start position:0%
you representative Schmidt and then gold
 
03:49:17.790 --> 03:49:17.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so ordinarily I
 
03:49:19.070 --> 03:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
would save this question for the
 
03:49:21.229 --> 03:49:21.239 align:start position:0%
subcommittee but you may not be back
 
03:49:23.510 --> 03:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
because I I've actually been to Kentucky
 
03:49:26.189 --> 03:49:26.199 align:start position:0%
if you can believe it believe it I know
 
03:49:30.830 --> 03:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
Louisville quite well um so so the the
 
03:49:32.630 --> 03:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
the thing that was brought to our
 
03:49:35.910 --> 03:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
attention about suture training sure is
 
03:49:37.950 --> 03:49:37.960 align:start position:0%
this is this it as far as suture
 
03:49:40.070 --> 03:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
training is concerned or is this perhaps
 
03:49:43.149 --> 03:49:43.159 align:start position:0%
stage one or whatever that is definitely
 
03:49:46.030 --> 03:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
stage one and how many other stages of
 
03:49:48.790 --> 03:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
well in in our institution you know we
 
03:49:52.070 --> 03:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't use chicken all right
 
03:49:54.590 --> 03:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
um that's that's just that's just not
 
03:49:57.790 --> 03:49:57.800 align:start position:0%
what we use in our institution okay um
 
03:50:01.030 --> 03:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
we tend to use um some animal models but
 
03:50:03.910 --> 03:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
we use uh we use synthetic you know
 
03:50:06.389 --> 03:50:06.399 align:start position:0%
models to be able to do it right and
 
03:50:08.950 --> 03:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
they are more shaped like an eyelid or
 
03:50:10.910 --> 03:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
an eyebrow or something like that to
 
03:50:13.149 --> 03:50:13.159 align:start position:0%
give students some of that dexterity
 
03:50:15.149 --> 03:50:15.159 align:start position:0%
that they need to be able to do that
 
03:50:17.590 --> 03:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
but yes the stages are essentially you
 
03:50:20.149 --> 03:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
know models um you know I'm not going to
 
03:50:22.469 --> 03:50:22.479 align:start position:0%
provide you not factual information
 
03:50:25.469 --> 03:50:25.479 align:start position:0%
right but the next step to that is that
 
03:50:27.070 --> 03:50:27.080 align:start position:0%
when they become fourth years in and in
 
03:50:28.910 --> 03:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
their Clinic with me and we remove a
 
03:50:31.790 --> 03:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
lesion that requires a suture right then
 
03:50:33.469 --> 03:50:33.479 align:start position:0%
they perform that along with
 
03:50:35.750 --> 03:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
me and the other picture about the
 
03:50:39.790 --> 03:50:39.800 align:start position:0%
eyeball the synthe that that's also just
 
03:50:42.429 --> 03:50:42.439 align:start position:0%
initial stage it it is accurate and is
 
03:50:45.149 --> 03:50:45.159 align:start position:0%
an initial stage yes thank you
 
03:50:46.950 --> 03:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
M yes
 
03:50:48.950 --> 03:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
please thank you madam chair and thank
 
03:50:51.510 --> 03:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question course
 
03:50:55.229 --> 03:50:55.239 align:start position:0%
um the I I am looking up that uh one of
 
03:50:58.149 --> 03:50:58.159 align:start position:0%
the university colleges of Optometry has
 
03:51:00.630 --> 03:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
an ocular surgery
 
03:51:03.189 --> 03:51:03.199 align:start position:0%
Fellowship um where they get an
 
03:51:06.110 --> 03:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do a lot of procedures
 
03:51:09.990 --> 03:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
you know in a training uh mentored uh
 
03:51:12.670 --> 03:51:12.680 align:start position:0%
Apprentice uh setting is that something
 
03:51:15.229 --> 03:51:15.239 align:start position:0%
that is common or is that unusual and
 
03:51:17.429 --> 03:51:17.439 align:start position:0%
and and and would that be maybe an
 
03:51:20.630 --> 03:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
Avenue for um
 
03:51:24.269 --> 03:51:24.279 align:start position:0%
making this this this expanded scope
 
03:51:27.189 --> 03:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
acceptable to everyone right no thank
 
03:51:29.910 --> 03:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
you for the question uh it is not common
 
03:51:33.189 --> 03:51:33.199 align:start position:0%
um and it is not common yet because the
 
03:51:36.870 --> 03:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
need is not out there yet because of the
 
03:51:39.149 --> 03:51:39.159 align:start position:0%
reduced number of practices or excuse me
 
03:51:40.630 --> 03:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
the states that have that scope of
 
03:51:44.830 --> 03:51:44.840 align:start position:0%
practice so a year of specifically in
 
03:51:46.710 --> 03:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
these procedures that they already have
 
03:51:49.630 --> 03:51:49.640 align:start position:0%
so much foundational information on I
 
03:51:51.429 --> 03:51:51.439 align:start position:0%
don't believe is a requirement to be
 
03:51:55.550 --> 03:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:58.630 --> 03:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
these gold thank you madam chair and
 
03:52:00.269 --> 03:52:00.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question of
 
03:52:03.229 --> 03:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
course uh the two first two points I had
 
03:52:07.030 --> 03:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
you've covered which is that
 
03:52:10.710 --> 03:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
um that the scope of teaching the using
 
03:52:13.229 --> 03:52:13.239 align:start position:0%
of the models is a very early stage
 
03:52:15.149 --> 03:52:15.159 align:start position:0%
that's not the entire scope of training
 
03:52:17.389 --> 03:52:17.399 align:start position:0%
in your facility right and the second I
 
03:52:19.349 --> 03:52:19.359 align:start position:0%
think just got covered and that was that
 
03:52:21.469 --> 03:52:21.479 align:start position:0%
different schools have different levels
 
03:52:24.030 --> 03:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
of um just like I'm a social worker
 
03:52:25.590 --> 03:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
trained social worker I can go to one
 
03:52:27.149 --> 03:52:27.159 align:start position:0%
college and become a great social worker
 
03:52:29.309 --> 03:52:29.319 align:start position:0%
other colleges not so much sounds like
 
03:52:32.149 --> 03:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
the same would be true in this field but
 
03:52:34.550 --> 03:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
my last question that hasn't been yet
 
03:52:38.309 --> 03:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
covered how has has it gone since 2011
 
03:52:40.630 --> 03:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
have you seen a lot of malpractice suits
 
03:52:42.710 --> 03:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
are the boards having to cover a lot of
 
03:52:45.070 --> 03:52:45.080 align:start position:0%
problems in Kentucky right thank you for
 
03:52:47.870 --> 03:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
the question um there is a there is a
 
03:52:49.590 --> 03:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
letter I believe in your packet from the
 
03:52:51.750 --> 03:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
board uh outlining the number of
 
03:52:54.149 --> 03:52:54.159 align:start position:0%
procedures and the uh lack of any
 
03:52:56.550 --> 03:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
disciplinary disciplinary action or
 
03:52:59.950 --> 03:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
increase in malpractice rates um I can't
 
03:53:02.309 --> 03:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
specifically provide you that but it
 
03:53:04.910 --> 03:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
could be provided from the state board
 
03:53:06.309 --> 03:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
um if that would help in the
 
03:53:08.510 --> 03:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um uh discussions but I
 
03:53:11.269 --> 03:53:11.279 align:start position:0%
believe there is one uh letter in there
 
03:53:13.229 --> 03:53:13.239 align:start position:0%
talking about the number of procedures
 
03:53:15.630 --> 03:53:15.640 align:start position:0%
and the the lack of disciplinary action
 
03:53:18.590 --> 03:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
but if further uh you know action is or
 
03:53:20.469 --> 03:53:20.479 align:start position:0%
or further information is required I'm
 
03:53:22.870 --> 03:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
sure that the uh state board would be uh
 
03:53:25.429 --> 03:53:25.439 align:start position:0%
be helpful with that thank
 
03:53:27.870 --> 03:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:53:29.910 --> 03:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair thank you
 
03:53:32.110 --> 03:53:32.120 align:start position:0%
for thanking my
 
03:53:34.790 --> 03:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
question I had asked before a question
 
03:53:37.790 --> 03:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
as to how many other states have the
 
03:53:39.870 --> 03:53:39.880 align:start position:0%
same language as we have in this bill
 
03:53:42.710 --> 03:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
here was told only
 
03:53:45.349 --> 03:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma and in your test you asked for
 
03:53:47.389 --> 03:53:47.399 align:start position:0%
us to get on board the other states out
 
03:53:50.389 --> 03:53:50.399 align:start position:0%
there and going forward right and is it
 
03:53:51.870 --> 03:53:51.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding that the only state
 
03:53:54.950 --> 03:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
going forward with this is Oklahoma and
 
03:53:57.030 --> 03:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
if it is can you at least tell us what
 
03:53:59.750 --> 03:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
the difference is what Kentucky has
 
03:54:01.590 --> 03:54:01.600 align:start position:0%
compared to what this is before yeah I I
 
03:54:03.030 --> 03:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
don't believe that that statement is
 
03:54:05.229 --> 03:54:05.239 align:start position:0%
accurate that that's the only well the
 
03:54:07.990 --> 03:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
only law that's like that our law is
 
03:54:11.349 --> 03:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
almost verbatim What Oklahoma's is as is
 
03:54:15.030 --> 03:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
Louisiana's right um so I can speak to
 
03:54:17.670 --> 03:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
those because I have knowledge of those
 
03:54:21.469 --> 03:54:21.479 align:start position:0%
um but um they're not the only ones they
 
03:54:25.269 --> 03:54:25.279 align:start position:0%
were for a long time right um but after
 
03:54:28.670 --> 03:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
Kentucky went in 2011 Louisiana was very
 
03:54:31.790 --> 03:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
soon after that right and other states
 
03:54:34.550 --> 03:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
started uh seeing the wisdom of the
 
03:54:37.070 --> 03:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
addition of these procedures and those
 
03:54:39.550 --> 03:54:39.560 align:start position:0%
laws those regulations are extremely
 
03:54:44.790 --> 03:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:47.309 --> 03:54:47.319 align:start position:0%
briefly in follow up on this question is
 
03:54:50.870 --> 03:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
sure in your estimation how many states
 
03:54:53.229 --> 03:54:53.239 align:start position:0%
would include all of these procedures
 
03:54:54.229 --> 03:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
that are here in this piece of
 
03:54:57.429 --> 03:54:57.439 align:start position:0%
legislation uh of the 12 states that um
 
03:55:00.149 --> 03:55:00.159 align:start position:0%
allow laser procedures I would say 80%
 
03:55:03.189 --> 03:55:03.199 align:start position:0%
of them um allow all three of them and
 
03:55:05.469 --> 03:55:05.479 align:start position:0%
there are a couple that restrict them to
 
03:55:13.309 --> 03:55:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:15.189 --> 03:55:15.199 align:start position:0%
procedures thank you madam chairman
 
03:55:17.070 --> 03:55:17.080 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question I have a
 
03:55:19.389 --> 03:55:19.399 align:start position:0%
question in the training process is
 
03:55:21.269 --> 03:55:21.279 align:start position:0%
there any point when the training wheels
 
03:55:23.469 --> 03:55:23.479 align:start position:0%
come off and and your student is the
 
03:55:26.269 --> 03:55:26.279 align:start position:0%
primary surgeon before they graduate yes
 
03:55:29.269 --> 03:55:29.279 align:start position:0%
sir um so generally what happens is as I
 
03:55:31.510 --> 03:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned before I would do a procedure
 
03:55:34.389 --> 03:55:34.399 align:start position:0%
the student then does a procedure um or
 
03:55:36.590 --> 03:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
or starts a procedure or maybe finishes
 
03:55:39.269 --> 03:55:39.279 align:start position:0%
mine you know uh after I have started it
 
03:55:41.309 --> 03:55:41.319 align:start position:0%
and so that I can I can get an
 
03:55:43.429 --> 03:55:43.439 align:start position:0%
understanding of how they're performing
 
03:55:46.309 --> 03:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
and then the next one if you know if I
 
03:55:47.510 --> 03:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
feel like they're ready and that may
 
03:55:49.469 --> 03:55:49.479 align:start position:0%
take one or two of those but the next
 
03:55:51.550 --> 03:55:51.560 align:start position:0%
one then they do the procedure from
 
03:55:52.870 --> 03:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
start to
 
03:55:56.630 --> 03:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
finish follow how many would they do it
 
03:55:59.510 --> 03:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
varies uh it really does vary because it
 
03:56:01.229 --> 03:56:01.239 align:start position:0%
depends on whether not they do the on
 
03:56:03.870 --> 03:56:03.880 align:start position:0%
campus rotation with me if they do them
 
03:56:06.309 --> 03:56:06.319 align:start position:0%
in other uh locations they they may have
 
03:56:08.830 --> 03:56:08.840 align:start position:0%
different numbers uh than we have there
 
03:56:10.429 --> 03:56:10.439 align:start position:0%
can you give me like an approximate
 
03:56:13.750 --> 03:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
number uh no because I don't think that
 
03:56:15.630 --> 03:56:15.640 align:start position:0%
that would be I don't think it would be
 
03:56:18.189 --> 03:56:18.199 align:start position:0%
factual to give you a number that every
 
03:56:18.199 --> 03:56:22.590 align:start position:0%
factual to give you a number that every
student

03:56:22.590 --> 03:56:22.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:25.750 --> 03:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
receives there's an assignment could you
 
03:56:29.870 --> 03:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
give a minimum at least no sir no okay
 
03:56:31.389 --> 03:56:31.399 align:start position:0%
we don't have we don't have we don't
 
03:56:33.590 --> 03:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
have a minimum number okay thank
 
03:56:36.710 --> 03:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
you okay Ros Brown uh thank you madam
 
03:56:39.070 --> 03:56:39.080 align:start position:0%
chair real quickly as everyone comes up
 
03:56:40.550 --> 03:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
if you do happen to have something in
 
03:56:41.790 --> 03:56:41.800 align:start position:0%
one of these documents could you
 
03:56:44.349 --> 03:56:44.359 align:start position:0%
reference that before you start speaking
 
03:56:49.469 --> 03:56:49.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:51.710 --> 03:56:51.720 align:start position:0%
you all right thank you very much for
 
03:57:09.830 --> 03:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:12.110 --> 03:57:12.120 align:start position:0%
Kim good afternoon and thank you for
 
03:57:14.189 --> 03:57:14.199 align:start position:0%
taking the time to hear my testimony my
 
03:57:16.110 --> 03:57:16.120 align:start position:0%
my name is Dr Andrew Kim and I'm a board
 
03:57:18.110 --> 03:57:18.120 align:start position:0%
certified dermatologist with dartm
 
03:57:20.630 --> 03:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock I'm also a clinical
 
03:57:22.189 --> 03:57:22.199 align:start position:0%
assistant professor of Dermatology with
 
03:57:24.149 --> 03:57:24.159 align:start position:0%

the president of the New Hampshire
 
03:57:27.950 --> 03:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
Society of Dermatology I'm in my seventh
 
03:57:30.269 --> 03:57:30.279 align:start position:0%
year of practice as a dermatologist here
 
03:57:30.279 --> 03:57:31.189 align:start position:0%
year of practice as a dermatologist here
in

03:57:31.189 --> 03:57:31.199 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:57:33.030 --> 03:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
conquered many of you may be wondering
 
03:57:34.510 --> 03:57:34.520 align:start position:0%
why is a dermatologist here talking
 
03:57:38.149 --> 03:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
about SB 440 and I'm here as a concerned
 
03:57:40.229 --> 03:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
physician who relies heavily on the
 
03:57:42.269 --> 03:57:42.279 align:start position:0%
expertise of my Opthalmology colleagues
 
03:57:45.269 --> 03:57:45.279 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis as a dermatologist I
 
03:57:46.830 --> 03:57:46.840 align:start position:0%
routinely refer my patients to
 
03:57:49.269 --> 03:57:49.279 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists for second opinions as
 
03:57:51.110 --> 03:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
well as co-management of ocular
 
03:57:53.510 --> 03:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
conditions many of which require surgery
 
03:57:56.870 --> 03:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
in or around the eyes even as an expert
 
03:57:58.389 --> 03:57:58.399 align:start position:0%
of the skin who has had extensive
 
03:58:00.830 --> 03:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
training on surgery in or around the
 
03:58:03.630 --> 03:58:03.640 align:start position:0%
eyes and the eyelid itself I require the
 
03:58:05.349 --> 03:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
expert knowledge of my Opthalmology
 
03:58:07.510 --> 03:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
colleagues to help make tough clinical
 
03:58:09.229 --> 03:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
decisions as well as carry out surgical
 
03:58:11.990 --> 03:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
treatments on my patients when I refer
 
03:58:13.710 --> 03:58:13.720 align:start position:0%
my patients to an eye specialist I
 
03:58:15.950 --> 03:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
expect nothing less than medical expert
 
03:58:19.309 --> 03:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
in the diseases in and around the eyes
 
03:58:20.830 --> 03:58:20.840 align:start position:0%
when a patient sees their eye doctor for
 
03:58:22.950 --> 03:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
a skin lesion removal I want their
 
03:58:25.110 --> 03:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
clinician to know that is not a skin tag
 
03:58:26.950 --> 03:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
but rather a Pinkus tumor which is a
 
03:58:29.349 --> 03:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
form of Basil cell skin cancer that's a
 
03:58:31.309 --> 03:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
real world example of one of my patients
 
03:58:33.750 --> 03:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
who had an optomet perform out of state
 
03:58:35.790 --> 03:58:35.800 align:start position:0%
this kind of a removal calling it a skin
 
03:58:38.469 --> 03:58:38.479 align:start position:0%
tag this led to a delay in diagnosis
 
03:58:41.149 --> 03:58:41.159 align:start position:0%
tumor growth and a much more riskier and
 
03:58:43.030 --> 03:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
complex reconstruction than what would
 
03:58:45.510 --> 03:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
have been initially necessary
 
03:58:47.830 --> 03:58:47.840 align:start position:0%
patients may not and often do not make
 
03:58:49.030 --> 03:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
the distinction between an
 
03:58:52.070 --> 03:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist and an optometrist about
 
03:58:53.990 --> 03:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
10 to 15% of the time I recommend my
 
03:58:55.349 --> 03:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
patients follow up with an
 
03:58:57.590 --> 03:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist for further care I find
 
03:58:59.229 --> 03:58:59.239 align:start position:0%
out after the fact that they they have
 
03:59:02.349 --> 03:59:02.359 align:start position:0%
seen an abdist instead they do not know
 
03:59:04.070 --> 03:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
that a doctor of Optometry who
 
03:59:06.149 --> 03:59:06.159 align:start position:0%
rightfully calls themselves doctor is
 
03:59:07.790 --> 03:59:07.800 align:start position:0%
not a physician who has gone to medical
 
03:59:09.870 --> 03:59:09.880 align:start position:0%
school and the subsequent rigorous
 
03:59:12.189 --> 03:59:12.199 align:start position:0%
residency training I have personally
 
03:59:14.389 --> 03:59:14.399 align:start position:0%
seen harms from lapses and care due to
 
03:59:16.389 --> 03:59:16.399 align:start position:0%
fundamental knowledge gaps between these
 
03:59:19.309 --> 03:59:19.319 align:start position:0%
two very distinct but complimentary
 
03:59:21.429 --> 03:59:21.439 align:start position:0%
professions with so many of our patients
 
03:59:23.670 --> 03:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
none the wiser I fear that patients will
 
03:59:25.269 --> 03:59:25.279 align:start position:0%
unknown only allow someone with less
 
03:59:27.469 --> 03:59:27.479 align:start position:0%
training and expertise to operate on
 
03:59:29.550 --> 03:59:29.560 align:start position:0%
such a vital part of their body should
 
03:59:32.110 --> 03:59:32.120 align:start position:0%
such legislation come to pass an
 
03:59:33.990 --> 03:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
argument has been made that optometrist
 
03:59:35.590 --> 03:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
can perform certain procedures and that
 
03:59:36.870 --> 03:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
they have the training to perform
 
03:59:38.910 --> 03:59:38.920 align:start position:0%
certain procedures but that doesn't mean
 
03:59:41.349 --> 03:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
they should perform certain Pro
 
03:59:43.389 --> 03:59:43.399 align:start position:0%
procedures um just because you know how
 
03:59:45.189 --> 03:59:45.199 align:start position:0%
to drive a car car and went through
 
03:59:47.269 --> 03:59:47.279 align:start position:0%
driver's head doesn't make you skill to
 
03:59:49.030 --> 03:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
drive on black ice in the middle of a
 
03:59:51.349 --> 03:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
blizzard or the wisdom to know that that
 
03:59:52.710 --> 03:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
is a bad
 
03:59:55.070 --> 03:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
idea I have had training in blop
 
03:59:57.750 --> 03:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
plasties which is surgical eyelid lifts
 
04:00:00.790 --> 04:00:00.800 align:start position:0%
um in medical conditions and I've had
 
04:00:02.149 --> 04:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
only about six of these procedures in my
 
04:00:02.159 --> 04:00:03.149 align:start position:0%
only about six of these procedures in my
residency

04:00:03.149 --> 04:00:03.159 align:start position:0%
residency
 
04:00:05.510 --> 04:00:05.520 align:start position:0%
training it overlaps a lot with the type
 
04:00:06.990 --> 04:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
of training and surgical procedures that
 
04:00:09.309 --> 04:00:09.319 align:start position:0%
I do in routine Surgical excisions and
 
04:00:12.590 --> 04:00:12.600 align:start position:0%
suering that being said while 95% of my
 
04:00:14.269 --> 04:00:14.279 align:start position:0%
outcomes would probably be a good be
 
04:00:16.750 --> 04:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
good in the 5% of the chances that we
 
04:00:18.630 --> 04:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
have a negative outcome I know that I am
 
04:00:20.630 --> 04:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
ill equipped to manage and deal with
 
04:00:22.550 --> 04:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
these complications when I know I have
 
04:00:25.149 --> 04:00:25.159 align:start position:0%
far more expert surgical colleagues who
 
04:00:26.750 --> 04:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
can deal with this and that's why I
 
04:00:28.389 --> 04:00:28.399 align:start position:0%
don't do that in my practice even though
 
04:00:32.670 --> 04:00:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:35.149 --> 04:00:35.159 align:start position:0%
training many arguments have made in the
 
04:00:37.149 --> 04:00:37.159 align:start position:0%
sake of expanding scope of practice one
 
04:00:39.550 --> 04:00:39.560 align:start position:0%
has been access to care in my seven
 
04:00:40.990 --> 04:00:41.000 align:start position:0%
years of practice here in Conquer New
 
04:00:42.309 --> 04:00:42.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I have personally not
 
04:00:44.550 --> 04:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
experienced significant access issues
 
04:00:46.189 --> 04:00:46.199 align:start position:0%
with Opthalmology having referred
 
04:00:48.710 --> 04:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
hundreds of patients to them while I
 
04:00:51.590 --> 04:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
have seen wait times uh and in cases
 
04:00:53.309 --> 04:00:53.319 align:start position:0%
where it has been excessive in my
 
04:00:55.710 --> 04:00:55.720 align:start position:0%
opinion calling those offices and
 
04:00:57.110 --> 04:00:57.120 align:start position:0%
speaking to the opthalmologist has
 
04:00:59.110 --> 04:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
resulted in Faster access for my most
 
04:01:01.710 --> 04:01:01.720 align:start position:0%
critical patients I believe that this
 
04:01:04.229 --> 04:01:04.239 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation is a clear danger
 
04:01:05.710 --> 04:01:05.720 align:start position:0%
to our patients and which is why I've
 
04:01:07.389 --> 04:01:07.399 align:start position:0%
taken the time out of the busy in middle
 
04:01:09.389 --> 04:01:09.399 align:start position:0%
of my busy Clinic day to be here today
 
04:01:11.149 --> 04:01:11.159 align:start position:0%
and ask that this piece of legislation
 
04:01:11.159 --> 04:01:11.830 align:start position:0%
and ask that this piece of legislation
be

04:01:11.830 --> 04:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:01:14.030 --> 04:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
opposed I would also like to add that I
 
04:01:16.309 --> 04:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
would also not want to confuse access of
 
04:01:18.830 --> 04:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
care with quality of care the same way

Hampshire ey Associates I'm here today
 
04:02:16.630 --> 04:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
to ask for your support of Senate Bill
 
04:02:19.269 --> 04:02:19.279 align:start position:0%
440 a bill to modernize the regulation
 
04:02:21.670 --> 04:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
and the practice of Optometry in New
 
04:02:23.710 --> 04:02:23.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire like other doctoral Level

doctors of photometry practice
 
04:02:29.590 --> 04:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
independently we prescribe topical and
 
04:02:32.349 --> 04:02:32.359 align:start position:0%
oral medications order labs and imaging
 
04:02:34.229 --> 04:02:34.239 align:start position:0%

patients in these after hour calls calls
 
04:02:47.030 --> 04:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
in in the emergency appointments that we
 
04:02:50.110 --> 04:02:50.120 align:start position:0%
see either in our daily clinic or after
 
04:02:53.269 --> 04:02:53.279 align:start position:0%
hours we manage the complications of
 
04:02:55.670 --> 04:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
these procedures already we are trained
 
04:02:57.469 --> 04:02:57.479 align:start position:0%
for that in optometry school and we
 
04:03:00.469 --> 04:03:00.479 align:start position:0%
practice that in our clinics while there
 
04:03:02.149 --> 04:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
is overlap between the professions of
 
04:03:04.030 --> 04:03:04.040 align:start position:0%
Optometry and Opthalmology we remain
 
04:03:06.269 --> 04:03:06.279 align:start position:0%
independent of each other and each
 
04:03:08.389 --> 04:03:08.399 align:start position:0%
profession has its own regulatory
 
04:03:10.950 --> 04:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
board it is inappropriate for another
 
04:03:12.910 --> 04:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
profession to attempt to dictate which
 
04:03:15.349 --> 04:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
parts of our skill set we can and cannot
 
04:03:17.830 --> 04:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
use but unlike other independent doctor
 
04:03:19.309 --> 04:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
Level Health Care professions in New
 
04:03:21.149 --> 04:03:21.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire only Optometry does not have
 
04:03:23.630 --> 04:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
board autonomy and is required to pass
 
04:03:25.429 --> 04:03:25.439 align:start position:0%
legislation and to overcome opposition
 
04:03:27.269 --> 04:03:27.279 align:start position:0%
from a separate profession to be
 
04:03:29.630 --> 04:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
permitted to use our education and
 
04:03:33.110 --> 04:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
training which is why our opposition
 
04:03:35.870 --> 04:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
wants a lot in the statute so they can
 
04:03:38.189 --> 04:03:38.199 align:start position:0%
maintain their Monopoly on us in their
 
04:03:40.309 --> 04:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
control over our
 
04:03:42.790 --> 04:03:42.800 align:start position:0%

Progressive or not legislation
 
04:03:46.510 --> 04:03:46.520 align:start position:0%
optometrists have been performing the
 
04:03:47.950 --> 04:03:47.960 align:start position:0%
procedures permitted in this bill in
 
04:03:50.110 --> 04:03:50.120 align:start position:0%
dozens of states and for more than 40

years with safe and effective outcomes
 
04:03:54.510 --> 04:03:54.520 align:start position:0%
as you've heard 12 states have laser
 
04:03:56.590 --> 04:03:56.600 align:start position:0%
Authority 19 allow removal of eyelid
 
04:04:00.349 --> 04:04:00.359 align:start position:0%
lesions and 42 have injectable Authority
 
04:04:02.269 --> 04:04:02.279 align:start position:0%
Senate bill would allow only minor

Optometry must ensure that the

control markets and prevent competition

which ultimately drives health care
 
04:04:31.870 --> 04:04:31.880 align:start position:0%

in Senate Bill 440 yet Doctors of

Optometry in New Hampshire
 
04:05:30.269 --> 04:05:30.279 align:start position:0%
cannot iare access issues in this state
 
04:05:32.510 --> 04:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
are undeniable we live with them every
 
04:05:35.510 --> 04:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
day as eye doctors and as patients and
 
04:05:36.910 --> 04:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
how does it make sense for a doctor of
 
04:05:38.630 --> 04:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
Optometry who performed the procedures
 
04:05:40.630 --> 04:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
authorized by Senate Bill 440 in another
 
04:05:43.149 --> 04:05:43.159 align:start position:0%
state who then moved to New Hampshire
 
04:05:44.670 --> 04:05:44.680 align:start position:0%
should be prohibited from performing
 
04:05:47.229 --> 04:05:47.239 align:start position:0%
these same procedures here I recently
 
04:05:49.910 --> 04:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
saw a 104-year-old patient whose Vision
 
04:05:51.269 --> 04:05:51.279 align:start position:0%
was decreased from the haze that
 
04:05:52.950 --> 04:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
commonly developed after cataract
 
04:05:55.269 --> 04:05:55.279 align:start position:0%
surgery if I were still practicing in
 
04:05:57.030 --> 04:05:57.040 align:start position:0%
Colorado where I was for eight years I
 
04:05:58.990 --> 04:05:59.000 align:start position:0%
could have treated her that day within
 
04:06:01.229 --> 04:06:01.239 align:start position:0%
minutes however simply because I crossed
 
04:06:03.110 --> 04:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
a state border and returned home to New
 
04:06:05.550 --> 04:06:05.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I somehow became less educated
 
04:06:08.309 --> 04:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
and less qualified this patient and
 
04:06:09.990 --> 04:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
their family had to be inconvenienced
 
04:06:11.189 --> 04:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
had to schedule an additional
 
04:06:12.950 --> 04:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
appointment and had to see another
 
04:06:15.309 --> 04:06:15.319 align:start position:0%
provider that was in the very same
 
04:06:17.429 --> 04:06:17.439 align:start position:0%
practice the result was the increased
 
04:06:18.990 --> 04:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
cost to the patient the caretaker and
 
04:06:20.670 --> 04:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
ultimately increased cost to the Health
 
04:06:20.680 --> 04:06:21.710 align:start position:0%
ultimately increased cost to the Health
Care

04:06:21.710 --> 04:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
Care
 
04:06:24.030 --> 04:06:24.040 align:start position:0%
System All Eye Care Providers have a
 
04:06:25.870 --> 04:06:25.880 align:start position:0%
common purpose of providing safe Eye
 
04:06:27.630 --> 04:06:27.640 align:start position:0%
Care to the citizens of New Hampshire
 
04:06:29.149 --> 04:06:29.159 align:start position:0%
and for the right reasons with outcomes
 
04:06:32.030 --> 04:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
and access in mind safe quality ey care
 
04:06:33.990 --> 04:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
including in offers procedures is not
 
04:06:36.550 --> 04:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
exclusive to Opthalmology it is time to
 
04:06:38.149 --> 04:06:38.159 align:start position:0%
work together and allow the optimal use
 
04:06:40.550 --> 04:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
of all healthc care providers to address
 
04:06:43.790 --> 04:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
the needs of our patients
 
04:06:45.309 --> 04:06:45.319 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to say a
 
04:06:47.990 --> 04:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
couple more things
 
04:06:50.990 --> 04:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
about the scare scary pictures you'll
 
04:06:54.389 --> 04:06:54.399 align:start position:0%
see and the scare tactics because we all
 
04:06:57.070 --> 04:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
see complications from every provider
 
04:07:00.269 --> 04:07:00.279 align:start position:0%
that a patient sees no one is impervious
 
04:07:01.950 --> 04:07:01.960 align:start position:0%
to complications it happens we're not
 
04:07:05.469 --> 04:07:05.479 align:start position:0%
robots and we're not perfect nobody is
 
04:07:07.790 --> 04:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
and we also see complications in poor
 
04:07:10.269 --> 04:07:10.279 align:start position:0%
outcomes from opthalmologists but we
 
04:07:12.950 --> 04:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
don't come here and air it out to you
 
04:07:15.189 --> 04:07:15.199 align:start position:0%
but every practitioner experien these
 
04:07:16.950 --> 04:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
these things we wish we were robots that
 
04:07:19.870 --> 04:07:19.880 align:start position:0%
would be great but it's not our
 
04:07:22.790 --> 04:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
reality um I
 
04:07:25.109 --> 04:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
personally have seen many cases from
 
04:07:27.550 --> 04:07:27.560 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology with misdiagnoses and harm
 
04:07:30.109 --> 04:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
caused to patients so no one's
 
04:07:31.990 --> 04:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
impervious and that's what the board is
 
04:07:34.429 --> 04:07:34.439 align:start position:0%
for and that's what the board currently
 
04:07:36.349 --> 04:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
does and will continue to do to regulate
 
04:07:40.550 --> 04:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
our profession um speaking of the board
 
04:07:41.910 --> 04:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
the medical board Podiatry board
 
04:07:43.630 --> 04:07:43.640 align:start position:0%
Dentistry board they all have board
 
04:07:46.149 --> 04:07:46.159 align:start position:0%
autonomy and as you know are under the
 
04:07:48.429 --> 04:07:48.439 align:start position:0%
umbrella of the oplc and
 
04:07:51.269 --> 04:07:51.279 align:start position:0%
there are attorneys and people that that
 
04:07:52.750 --> 04:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
watch the boards and make sure that they
 
04:07:55.189 --> 04:07:55.199 align:start position:0%
behave so um and do things that they
 
04:07:57.990 --> 04:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
should be doing so um we are the only
 
04:07:59.950 --> 04:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
ones that are restricted in statute and
 
04:08:03.269 --> 04:08:03.279 align:start position:0%
cannot Advance with Health Care advances
 
04:08:05.510 --> 04:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
and in our profession and no profession
 
04:08:09.389 --> 04:08:09.399 align:start position:0%
should stand still that does not help
 
04:08:14.229 --> 04:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
anybody um as far as you know yesterday
 
04:08:17.030 --> 04:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
I had a patient faint on me and clinic
 
04:08:18.510 --> 04:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
and I have lots of patients that move
 
04:08:20.590 --> 04:08:20.600 align:start position:0%
around and squirm and they are very
 
04:08:23.189 --> 04:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
nervous and I and I empathize with them
 
04:08:25.149 --> 04:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
I would be too if I had someone removing
 
04:08:28.229 --> 04:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
a big piece of metal from my eye um or
 
04:08:31.109 --> 04:08:31.119 align:start position:0%
trying to to clean up their large cornal
 
04:08:34.590 --> 04:08:34.600 align:start position:0%
abrasion that they have um so we are
 
04:08:36.870 --> 04:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
trained and and we see patients that
 
04:08:39.429 --> 04:08:39.439 align:start position:0%
move a lot as well on a daily basis and
 
04:08:41.030 --> 04:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
we're seeing them in a microscope and
 
04:08:43.910 --> 04:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
this is the same microscope that is used
 
04:08:47.149 --> 04:08:47.159 align:start position:0%
um with the laser so we are thoroughly I
 
04:08:50.950 --> 04:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:53.070 --> 04:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
microscope thank you for hearing me
 
04:08:56.189 --> 04:08:56.199 align:start position:0%
today I have one question you keep
 
04:08:58.590 --> 04:08:58.600 align:start position:0%
talking about procedures authorized by
 
04:09:01.910 --> 04:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 440 when I look at it all I
 
04:09:04.149 --> 04:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
can see is a list of things that are not
 
04:09:07.670 --> 04:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
allowed where does it specify what is
 
04:09:10.429 --> 04:09:10.439 align:start position:0%
allowed well that would be for the board
 
04:09:13.630 --> 04:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
to decide like the other boards do for
 
04:09:16.269 --> 04:09:16.279 align:start position:0%
dentistry and Podiatry and for medicine
 
04:09:18.030 --> 04:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
well then you shouldn't say that they
 
04:09:22.349 --> 04:09:22.359 align:start position:0%
are authorized by Senate Bill 440
 
04:09:24.030 --> 04:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
because that's
 
04:09:26.389 --> 04:09:26.399 align:start position:0%
incorrect they wouldn't be excluded by
 
04:09:30.389 --> 04:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 440 thank you
 
04:09:32.269 --> 04:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
sure all right thank you for your
 
04:09:32.279 --> 04:09:35.389 align:start position:0%
sure all right thank you for your
testimony

04:09:35.389 --> 04:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:54.070 --> 04:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:55.469 --> 04:09:55.479 align:start position:0%
Madam chair committee thank you for
 
04:09:58.269 --> 04:09:58.279 align:start position:0%
allowing me to share my story my name is
 
04:10:01.469 --> 04:10:01.479 align:start position:0%
Vicki rage I am a CH tribal member from
 
04:10:05.950 --> 04:10:05.960 align:start position:0%
Southeastern Oklahoma um in 2018 I saw
 
04:10:08.750 --> 04:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
my private optometrist who performed
 
04:10:11.550 --> 04:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
routine Health Care such as uh
 
04:10:15.630 --> 04:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
contacts glasses annual visits two years
 
04:10:18.510 --> 04:10:18.520 align:start position:0%
previously he had referred me to RPG in
 
04:10:20.469 --> 04:10:20.479 align:start position:0%
Sherman Texas because I had a cataract
 
04:10:24.070 --> 04:10:24.080 align:start position:0%
on my right eye and at that time I knew
 
04:10:27.309 --> 04:10:27.319 align:start position:0%
I had one forming on my left but we
 
04:10:30.189 --> 04:10:30.199 align:start position:0%
decided to wait until it was necessary
 
04:10:32.910 --> 04:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
so when I went back in April of 2018 he
 
04:10:36.229 --> 04:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
said yes it's time to get your lens done
 
04:10:38.910 --> 04:10:38.920 align:start position:0%
in your left eye but in the meantime
 
04:10:40.910 --> 04:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
you've lost some clarity in your right
 
04:10:44.590 --> 04:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
eye so let's do a yag quick painless I
 
04:10:46.710 --> 04:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
can do it right here in the office I
 
04:10:49.429 --> 04:10:49.439 align:start position:0%
said you know I someone said that the
 
04:10:52.189 --> 04:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
tribe CH to nation is doing that through
 
04:10:55.590 --> 04:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
IHS and because I had so much outof
 
04:10:57.550 --> 04:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
pocket expenses with the first
 
04:10:59.750 --> 04:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
cataract let me check with them and if
 
04:11:02.790 --> 04:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
they're doing it I would save myself a
 
04:11:05.950 --> 04:11:05.960 align:start position:0%
ton of money and I said if they can't we
 
04:11:09.030 --> 04:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
we'll make arrangements so I called the
 
04:11:10.429 --> 04:11:10.439 align:start position:0%
clinic and they're like yes we can do
 
04:11:12.070 --> 04:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
cataract surgery have a surgeon coming
 
04:11:14.109 --> 04:11:14.119 align:start position:0%
in from Ada
 
04:11:15.790 --> 04:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
but we can do the yag in office our
 
04:11:17.950 --> 04:11:17.960 align:start position:0%
optometrist can do it so they made an
 
04:11:19.510 --> 04:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
appointment same day appointment for the
 
04:11:21.670 --> 04:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
surgeon and the optometrist the surgeon
 
04:11:23.670 --> 04:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
to measure for the lens and the
 
04:11:26.550 --> 04:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
optometrist to do the yag couldn't do
 
04:11:29.109 --> 04:11:29.119 align:start position:0%
the lens because the optometrist had
 
04:11:30.710 --> 04:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
forgotten to tell me to take my contact
 
04:11:33.510 --> 04:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
lens out so I had to there was like an
 
04:11:35.910 --> 04:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
additional seven days before he could do
 
04:11:37.950 --> 04:11:37.960 align:start position:0%
that and he said but she can go ahead
 
04:11:38.950 --> 04:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
and do your
 
04:11:42.429 --> 04:11:42.439 align:start position:0%
y so I had been told quick and painless
 
04:11:44.630 --> 04:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
that's the third person quick and
 
04:11:47.109 --> 04:11:47.119 align:start position:0%
painless I was so comfortable sitting
 
04:11:49.429 --> 04:11:49.439 align:start position:0%
there in that chair while she sat up I
 
04:11:52.830 --> 04:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
remember her polish was gray I commented
 
04:11:55.269 --> 04:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
on it and she said oh there Lee press on
 
04:11:56.550 --> 04:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
nails from
 
04:11:59.229 --> 04:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
Walmart and then she starts making
 
04:12:00.590 --> 04:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
noises like
 
04:12:03.910 --> 04:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
hm and then she said this is not working
 
04:12:06.389 --> 04:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
right and my internal dialogue I'm a
 
04:12:09.510 --> 04:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
pretty smart cookie my internal dialogue
 
04:12:12.189 --> 04:12:12.199 align:start position:0%
started with well why doesn't she stop
 
04:12:13.750 --> 04:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
and then it was completely overridden
 
04:12:16.070 --> 04:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
with well she's a doctor if it it's not
 
04:12:18.550 --> 04:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
working she'll know how to stop that
 
04:12:21.630 --> 04:12:21.640 align:start position:0%
went on and then we stopped she put a
 
04:12:24.030 --> 04:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
patch over it and she said okay you can
 
04:12:26.630 --> 04:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
wear it till tonight and you can um take
 
04:12:30.590 --> 04:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
it off tomorrow May the 9th 2019 my that
 
04:12:32.510 --> 04:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
was my grandson's birthday he turned
 
04:12:35.910 --> 04:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
nine that day I could still see to drive
 
04:12:38.349 --> 04:12:38.359 align:start position:0%
with my left eye I lived an hour from
 
04:12:42.229 --> 04:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
where I was drove home we had birthday
 
04:12:44.830 --> 04:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
had patch on my ey I took it off later
 
04:12:46.870 --> 04:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
that night and you know the Disney
 
04:12:49.670 --> 04:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
mirrors the old oval Disney mirrors with
 
04:12:52.469 --> 04:12:52.479 align:start position:0%
scratches out that's what it looked like
 
04:12:53.990 --> 04:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
and I thought well by morning it'll be
 
04:12:55.070 --> 04:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
it'll be
 
04:12:57.710 --> 04:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
better I got up and it was not better so
 
04:13:00.109 --> 04:13:00.119 align:start position:0%
I called the clinic and I'm like I can't
 
04:13:02.750 --> 04:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
see is this normal does it take time to
 
04:13:04.830 --> 04:13:04.840 align:start position:0%
heal and they said no you need to come
 
04:13:08.990 --> 04:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
on in so I drive an hour back to Durant
 
04:13:12.189 --> 04:13:12.199 align:start position:0%
and I saw a different optometrist and
 
04:13:13.830 --> 04:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
they did an OTC
 
04:13:18.790 --> 04:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
scan and she's like oh so she called um
 
04:13:21.269 --> 04:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
Dean McGee a surgeon from Dean McGee I
 
04:13:23.990 --> 04:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
institute sent him the scans she thought
 
04:13:25.229 --> 04:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
it was an active
 
04:13:27.910 --> 04:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
bleed he told her it was not an active
 
04:13:30.790 --> 04:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
bleed and he would see me in seven
 
04:13:34.670 --> 04:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
days that's all I knew so go home and
 
04:13:35.790 --> 04:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
I'm think it's going to get better it's
 
04:13:36.710 --> 04:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
going to get better it's going to get
 
04:13:39.469 --> 04:13:39.479 align:start position:0%
better so I he comes to Durant I travel
 
04:13:44.149 --> 04:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
back to see him weeks roll on
 
04:13:46.349 --> 04:13:46.359 align:start position:0%
before he says this is permanent this is
 
04:13:48.309 --> 04:13:48.319 align:start position:0%
not going to get any better she has
 
04:13:50.349 --> 04:13:50.359 align:start position:0%
burned through your central vision what
 
04:13:53.189 --> 04:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
you're seeing is all you're going to
 
04:13:56.229 --> 04:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
see so he gives me his cell phone
 
04:13:58.389 --> 04:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
number I don't know whose feelings were
 
04:14:01.429 --> 04:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
hurt more that day his or mine he gives
 
04:14:03.109 --> 04:14:03.119 align:start position:0%
me his cell phone number and he says if
 
04:14:07.149 --> 04:14:07.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:11.349 --> 04:14:11.359 align:start position:0%
me go in about two weeks later I think
 
04:14:16.070 --> 04:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
to get the will in September to get the
 
04:14:18.469 --> 04:14:18.479 align:start position:0%
Cataract done in the
 
04:14:18.479 --> 04:14:20.870 align:start position:0%
Cataract done in the
left

04:14:20.870 --> 04:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
left
 
04:14:23.750 --> 04:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
February I had a rental Detachment I
 
04:14:26.550 --> 04:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
called Dr Franson I was at a basketball
 
04:14:29.590 --> 04:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
game I called Dr Franson he said get to
 
04:14:33.750 --> 04:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
OU ER so I went there couldn't do
 
04:14:36.510 --> 04:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
surgery until Monday surgery was done
 
04:14:39.469 --> 04:14:39.479 align:start position:0%
the 17th of February for the rental
 
04:14:43.349 --> 04:14:43.359 align:start position:0%
Detachment cleared I could see again and
 
04:14:46.790 --> 04:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
by November Scar Tissue had formed over
 
04:14:48.830 --> 04:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
my eye still can't see out of this one
 
04:14:51.630 --> 04:14:51.640 align:start position:0%
because it's permanent right Scar Tissue
 
04:14:54.070 --> 04:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
had formed over my eye so we had to do
 
04:14:56.550 --> 04:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
another surgery to remove the scar
 
04:14:59.309 --> 04:14:59.319 align:start position:0%
tissue which set off an inflammation
 
04:15:01.550 --> 04:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
storm so we started with steroids
 
04:15:04.950 --> 04:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
prazone prelone did that for a year
 
04:15:07.910 --> 04:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
could not get rid of the inflammation so
 
04:15:10.070 --> 04:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
a uist got
 
04:15:13.550 --> 04:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
involved and then a glaucoma special
 
04:15:13.560 --> 04:15:14.269 align:start position:0%
involved and then a glaucoma special
got

04:15:14.269 --> 04:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
got
 
04:15:18.349 --> 04:15:18.359 align:start position:0%
involved I am considered legally blind
 
04:15:19.910 --> 04:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
you can look at me and see I now have
 
04:15:22.309 --> 04:15:22.319 align:start position:0%
tosis because this eye droops I've had
 
04:15:24.189 --> 04:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
two surgeries to try to reduce the
 
04:15:28.590 --> 04:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
glaucoma effects this eyelid droops due
 
04:15:31.269 --> 04:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
to toes this eyebrow raises it's
 
04:15:33.149 --> 04:15:33.159 align:start position:0%
permanent from trying to keep my eyelid
 
04:15:34.510 --> 04:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
up to
 
04:15:38.149 --> 04:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
see this eye other than
 
04:15:41.030 --> 04:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
being not being able to see completely
 
04:15:44.149 --> 04:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
healthy I don't have to see any
 
04:15:47.389 --> 04:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
body this was my dominant eye this is
 
04:15:49.790 --> 04:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
the eye I saw distance with I wore a
 
04:15:52.830 --> 04:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
contact in this eye to read before this
 
04:15:57.469 --> 04:15:57.479 align:start position:0%
storm I see colors I see
 
04:16:01.750 --> 04:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
patches um this eye is on a good day I
 
04:16:04.710 --> 04:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
can read my phone on a bad day I can't
 
04:16:04.720 --> 04:16:06.030 align:start position:0%
can read my phone on a bad day I can't
do

04:16:06.030 --> 04:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:16:08.590 --> 04:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
anything she was talking about a patient
 
04:16:10.950 --> 04:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
earlier who couldn't read her phone who
 
04:16:14.269 --> 04:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
was 78 I went from managing
 
04:16:16.510 --> 04:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollar compacts for the
 
04:16:19.309 --> 04:16:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:24.229 --> 04:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
state to drawing disability I'm a
 
04:16:28.269 --> 04:16:28.279 align:start position:0%
62 I played softball I played baseball
 
04:16:30.269 --> 04:16:30.279 align:start position:0%
with my
 
04:16:33.309 --> 04:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
grandson this is tragic but it's a
 
04:16:35.389 --> 04:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
byproduct of surgery we all know there
 
04:16:38.670 --> 04:16:38.680 align:start position:0%
are risk involved with surgery right I
 
04:16:41.710 --> 04:16:41.720 align:start position:0%
signed the paper I was aware of every
 
04:16:47.149 --> 04:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
step this quick and easy just a laser
 
04:16:49.349 --> 04:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
get you in get you out restore all of
 
04:16:51.910 --> 04:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
your Clarity this is
 
04:16:55.510 --> 04:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
gone I have no central vision so I
 
04:16:55.520 --> 04:16:56.510 align:start position:0%
gone I have no central vision so I
listen

04:16:56.510 --> 04:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
listen
 
04:16:59.389 --> 04:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
to what's right and what's wrong and
 
04:17:02.830 --> 04:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
who's right and who's wrong I filed suit
 
04:17:05.990 --> 04:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
after I worked for the tribe I prayed
 
04:17:08.750 --> 04:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
about it talked to my director about it
 
04:17:10.910 --> 04:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
didn't want to lose my job over
 
04:17:13.710 --> 04:17:13.720 align:start position:0%
it till it got to the point point where
 
04:17:15.670 --> 04:17:15.680 align:start position:0%
my director my executive director is
 
04:17:19.030 --> 04:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
like you file chart you file suit
 
04:17:23.030 --> 04:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:25.670 --> 04:17:25.680 align:start position:0%
attorney the optometrist that did this
 
04:17:27.910 --> 04:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
was under contract for
 
04:17:32.109 --> 04:17:32.119 align:start position:0%
IHS so it went through federal court we
 
04:17:35.389 --> 04:17:35.399 align:start position:0%
mediated she paid me over $600,000 and
 
04:17:38.910 --> 04:17:38.920 align:start position:0%
she had to admit negligence I don't know
 
04:17:40.910 --> 04:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
where it was reported I don't know if it
 
04:17:42.910 --> 04:17:42.920 align:start position:0%
was reported I know she's still doing
 
04:17:45.630 --> 04:17:45.640 align:start position:0%
them today in Oklahoma she's still doing
 
04:17:48.030 --> 04:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
them for IHS so I don't know what the
 
04:17:49.830 --> 04:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
reporting system
 
04:17:52.269 --> 04:17:52.279 align:start position:0%
is if one
 
04:17:54.710 --> 04:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
person is
 
04:17:57.109 --> 04:17:57.119 align:start position:0%
helped by learning all of the
 
04:18:00.510 --> 04:18:00.520 align:start position:0%
information it's not quick it's not easy
 
04:18:03.269 --> 04:18:03.279 align:start position:0%
it's there are it is not a it's a zero
 
04:18:06.950 --> 04:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
risk it's a that's not
 
04:18:10.389 --> 04:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
true just like that I went from she's
 
04:18:12.830 --> 04:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
wearing gray fingerna polish to I can't
 
04:18:12.840 --> 04:18:15.469 align:start position:0%
wearing gray fingerna polish to I can't
can't

04:18:15.469 --> 04:18:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:17.950 --> 04:18:17.960 align:start position:0%
see I don't have anything else to add
 
04:18:20.830 --> 04:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
except for I hope that when you when you
 
04:18:23.990 --> 04:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
make your decision and you vote you vote
 
04:18:26.030 --> 04:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
knowing there are risk and there are
 
04:18:27.830 --> 04:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
people behind
 
04:18:31.950 --> 04:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:34.950 --> 04:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
questions I don't see any thank you for
 
04:18:37.510 --> 04:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
sharing your story and I'm so sorry for
 
04:18:39.070 --> 04:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
what happened to you thank you I
 
04:18:46.630 --> 04:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:46.640 --> 04:18:57.429 align:start position:0%
 
Joseph

04:18:57.429 --> 04:18:57.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:02.269 --> 04:19:02.279 align:start position:0%
shutler greetings uh I am uh from
 
04:19:05.109 --> 04:19:05.119 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma but I don't consider myself an
 
04:19:07.750 --> 04:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma the reason for that is my
 
04:19:10.149 --> 04:19:10.159 align:start position:0%
private practice was in Nebraska and
 
04:19:12.750 --> 04:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
South Dakota where I practiced for about
 
04:19:16.710 --> 04:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
about uh 25 27 years before I took a
 
04:19:19.950 --> 04:19:19.960 align:start position:0%
position with North Eastern State uh
 
04:19:22.349 --> 04:19:22.359 align:start position:0%
College of Optometry in Oklahoma in
 
04:19:25.149 --> 04:19:25.159 align:start position:0%
talaa where I have been the last uh
 
04:19:28.429 --> 04:19:28.439 align:start position:0%
seven or eight years I teach didactic
 
04:19:30.790 --> 04:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
education to our students I teach our
 
04:19:34.229 --> 04:19:34.239 align:start position:0%
students in clinical education I also am
 
04:19:36.149 --> 04:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
involved in specialty care which is
 
04:19:39.109 --> 04:19:39.119 align:start position:0%
where we do lid procedures minor lid
 
04:19:41.750 --> 04:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
procedures we do uh some of the laser
 
04:19:44.870 --> 04:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
procedures that have talked about I'm
 
04:19:47.429 --> 04:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
also actively involved in providing
 
04:19:50.750 --> 04:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
postsecondary or continuing education in
 
04:19:52.950 --> 04:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
a variety of topics including these
 
04:19:55.590 --> 04:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
procedures throughout the United States
 
04:19:58.349 --> 04:19:58.359 align:start position:0%
and and in parts of Canada now I did
 
04:20:00.670 --> 04:20:00.680 align:start position:0%
delineate a lot of what I was to say
 
04:20:02.070 --> 04:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
because one of the instructions was
 
04:20:04.469 --> 04:20:04.479 align:start position:0%
don't duplicate and a lot of that has
 
04:20:06.790 --> 04:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
been well covered so I'm going to to
 
04:20:08.870 --> 04:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
proceed along but my practices
 
04:20:11.590 --> 04:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
previously in Nebraska and South Dakota
 
04:20:14.510 --> 04:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
were located in States at that time that
 
04:20:17.189 --> 04:20:17.199 align:start position:0%
could not provide these procedures that
 
04:20:20.229 --> 04:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
we are talking about so I was into the
 
04:20:22.510 --> 04:20:22.520 align:start position:0%
fourth cycle of my uh fourth quarter of
 
04:20:25.790 --> 04:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
my career before I begin to do these
 
04:20:28.910 --> 04:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
procedures now not only do I do them but
 
04:20:31.189 --> 04:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
I have the opportunity to teach students
 
04:20:33.510 --> 04:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
and I also have the opportunity to teach
 
04:20:36.269 --> 04:20:36.279 align:start position:0%
people in my similar situation who have
 
04:20:39.389 --> 04:20:39.399 align:start position:0%
been practicing for uh for many years as
 
04:20:41.710 --> 04:20:41.720 align:start position:0%
some of these legislations continue to
 
04:20:45.149 --> 04:20:45.159 align:start position:0%
happen I am very honored to say even
 
04:20:47.229 --> 04:20:47.239 align:start position:0%
though I no longer have a South Dakota
 
04:20:49.550 --> 04:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
license simply because I changed the
 
04:20:51.750 --> 04:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
state where I needed it I am honored to
 
04:20:54.149 --> 04:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
say that South Dakota became the 12th
 
04:20:56.710 --> 04:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
state to provide some of these laser
 
04:20:59.109 --> 04:20:59.119 align:start position:0%
experiences and better our patients
 
04:21:02.269 --> 04:21:02.279 align:start position:0%
within the last few months and so I'm
 
04:21:04.309 --> 04:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
excited for my partners or ex Partners I
 
04:21:07.790 --> 04:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
guess who still practiced there so in
 
04:21:10.189 --> 04:21:10.199 align:start position:0%
every state where we began to think
 
04:21:13.630 --> 04:21:13.640 align:start position:0%
about can Doctors of Optometry provide
 
04:21:13.640 --> 04:21:14.630 align:start position:0%
about can Doctors of Optometry provide
these

04:21:14.630 --> 04:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:21:17.389 --> 04:21:17.399 align:start position:0%
procedures a primary concern which has
 
04:21:20.229 --> 04:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
been emphasized over and over on on both
 
04:21:23.229 --> 04:21:23.239 align:start position:0%
sides today is we all want to take good
 
04:21:25.710 --> 04:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
care of our patients we want to provide
 
04:21:28.670 --> 04:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
competent health care and for more than
 
04:21:32.229 --> 04:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
30 years NSU which is nor Eastern State
 
04:21:35.229 --> 04:21:35.239 align:start position:0%
University Oklahoma College of Optometry
 
04:21:38.389 --> 04:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
has been providing secondary education
 
04:21:41.349 --> 04:21:41.359 align:start position:0%
including continuing education across
 
04:21:44.750 --> 04:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
the country to Doctors of Optometry not
 
04:21:47.429 --> 04:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
only to become competent but safe and
 
04:21:50.349 --> 04:21:50.359 align:start position:0%
effective in performing these
 
04:21:53.630 --> 04:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
procedures our opponents have taken and
 
04:21:56.429 --> 04:21:56.439 align:start position:0%
termed this continuing education the
 
04:21:56.439 --> 04:21:58.109 align:start position:0%
termed this continuing education the
32-hour

04:21:58.109 --> 04:21:58.119 align:start position:0%
32-hour
 
04:22:01.469 --> 04:22:01.479 align:start position:0%
course their claim is it's not possible
 
04:22:04.389 --> 04:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
to learn these procedures in 32
 
04:22:07.229 --> 04:22:07.239 align:start position:0%
hours on a weekend
 
04:22:10.550 --> 04:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
course I wholeheartedly agree with them
 
04:22:13.109 --> 04:22:13.119 align:start position:0%
it's not it wouldn't be POS possible for
 
04:22:16.149 --> 04:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
me to learn how to drive an 18-wheeler
 
04:22:19.030 --> 04:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
in 32 hours I can't hardly back up my
 
04:22:21.630 --> 04:22:21.640 align:start position:0%
boat to get it into the dock in
 
04:22:23.950 --> 04:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma and so what you have to
 
04:22:27.790 --> 04:22:27.800 align:start position:0%
remember is this course whichever course
 
04:22:30.149 --> 04:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
your board determines is most
 
04:22:34.030 --> 04:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate this course is not taken in
 
04:22:36.670 --> 04:22:36.680 align:start position:0%
isolation it is a multi-day rigorous
 
04:22:39.349 --> 04:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
course with Hands-On training but what
 
04:22:41.750 --> 04:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's doing is building on the four years
 
04:22:44.590 --> 04:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
of Bachelor degree and four years of
 
04:22:46.870 --> 04:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
doctorate degree that these candidates
 
04:22:50.550 --> 04:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
come in with and also as in my case and
 
04:22:52.590 --> 04:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
many of the doctors that have spoken to
 
04:22:56.349 --> 04:22:56.359 align:start position:0%
you already years of clinical experience
 
04:22:59.070 --> 04:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
years of clinical experience managing
 
04:23:00.429 --> 04:23:00.439 align:start position:0%
these cases
 
04:23:03.670 --> 04:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
preoperatively and post-operatively even
 
04:23:05.950 --> 04:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
though the legislation board whatever
 
04:23:08.469 --> 04:23:08.479 align:start position:0%
regulation of that particular state
 
04:23:11.149 --> 04:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
would not allow me to do those
 
04:23:13.550 --> 04:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
procedures when I began to manage
 
04:23:16.389 --> 04:23:16.399 align:start position:0%
cataract surgery post-operatively and
 
04:23:18.389 --> 04:23:18.399 align:start position:0%
pre-operatively with an excellent
 
04:23:21.790 --> 04:23:21.800 align:start position:0%
cataract surgeon 40 years ago which is
 
04:23:24.189 --> 04:23:24.199 align:start position:0%
about how long I've been practicing it
 
04:23:26.630 --> 04:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
was an entirely different
 
04:23:29.830 --> 04:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
procedure the eye was laid open from one
 
04:23:32.510 --> 04:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
side to the other the risk were
 
04:23:34.349 --> 04:23:34.359 align:start position:0%
astronomical astronomical is an
 
04:23:36.070 --> 04:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
inappropriate word but the risk were
 
04:23:38.550 --> 04:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
high much higher than they are today the
 
04:23:42.109 --> 04:23:42.119 align:start position:0%
patients were hospitalized routinely for
 
04:23:44.309 --> 04:23:44.319 align:start position:0%
post operative
 
04:23:48.309 --> 04:23:48.319 align:start position:0%
care cataract surgery today in the hands
 
04:23:50.070 --> 04:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
of a skilled
 
04:23:54.349 --> 04:23:54.359 align:start position:0%
surgeon a very short period of time to
 
04:23:55.830 --> 04:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
do the
 
04:23:58.790 --> 04:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
procedure low risk of
 
04:24:02.389 --> 04:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
complication today we can use a lens
 
04:24:04.229 --> 04:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
that will give you good distance and
 
04:24:06.630 --> 04:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
good near Vision sometimes without the
 
04:24:09.590 --> 04:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
use of glasses some of you reme can
 
04:24:11.750 --> 04:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
maybe remember those huge thick glasses
 
04:24:14.630 --> 04:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
we had to use after cataract surgery
 
04:24:18.229 --> 04:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
decades ago that's no longer done how
 
04:24:20.429 --> 04:24:20.439 align:start position:0%
did our colleagues learn to do that if
 
04:24:23.469 --> 04:24:23.479 align:start position:0%
they had been out 20 to 30 years they
 
04:24:25.309 --> 04:24:25.319 align:start position:0%
didn't go back and redo their
 
04:24:27.229 --> 04:24:27.239 align:start position:0%
residency they didn't take another
 
04:24:29.469 --> 04:24:29.479 align:start position:0%
semester of medical
 
04:24:31.950 --> 04:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
education they took the skill set that
 
04:24:33.630 --> 04:24:33.640 align:start position:0%
they already
 
04:24:36.950 --> 04:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
possessed and moved that forward well
 
04:24:38.790 --> 04:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
that's what we're proposing to do here
 
04:24:38.800 --> 04:24:39.630 align:start position:0%
that's what we're proposing to do here
is

04:24:39.630 --> 04:24:39.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:24:42.910 --> 04:24:42.920 align:start position:0%
optometrist not learn a brand new set of
 
04:24:46.269 --> 04:24:46.279 align:start position:0%
skills in 32 hours but to take a skill
 
04:24:49.510 --> 04:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
set that's already possessed an anatomy
 
04:24:53.149 --> 04:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
that's already welln and just mature
 
04:24:56.229 --> 04:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
that into the procedures that s Senate
 
04:24:59.429 --> 04:24:59.439 align:start position:0%
Bill 440 is requesting we're simply
 
04:25:02.149 --> 04:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
expanding the skill sets previously
 
04:25:05.389 --> 04:25:05.399 align:start position:0%
acquired from didactic education during
 
04:25:09.469 --> 04:25:09.479 align:start position:0%
Optometric training and years of
 
04:25:13.750 --> 04:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
experience MDS do not have a Monopoly on
 
04:25:17.349 --> 04:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
professional integrity and good clinical
 
04:25:20.429 --> 04:25:20.439 align:start position:0%
judgment in every state where
 
04:25:22.670 --> 04:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
optometrists are permitted by doctors
 
04:25:24.670 --> 04:25:24.680 align:start position:0%
where optometrists are permitted by
 
04:25:28.109 --> 04:25:28.119 align:start position:0%
legislation or board regulations to do
 
04:25:29.790 --> 04:25:29.800 align:start position:0%
many of these similar
 
04:25:32.710 --> 04:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
procedures there are optometrists still
 
04:25:35.590 --> 04:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
remaining who opt not to do them they
 
04:25:37.590 --> 04:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
recognize that's they're not not their
 
04:25:39.830 --> 04:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
career path they may specialize in
 
04:25:41.830 --> 04:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
fitting specialty contact lenses they
 
04:25:44.349 --> 04:25:44.359 align:start position:0%
may specialize in visual therapy a
 
04:25:47.429 --> 04:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
variety of things but there certainly
 
04:25:49.910 --> 04:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
are many that would move forward in
 
04:25:51.109 --> 04:25:51.119 align:start position:0%
doing these
 
04:25:53.950 --> 04:25:53.960 align:start position:0%
procedures Doctors of Optometry will
 
04:25:56.550 --> 04:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
apply their professional integrity and
 
04:25:59.269 --> 04:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
good clinical judgment when performing
 
04:26:02.149 --> 04:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
these procedures there are procedures in
 
04:26:04.950 --> 04:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma that I am authorized to do
 
04:26:06.269 --> 04:26:06.279 align:start position:0%
according to my
 
04:26:09.070 --> 04:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
lure but there are times when I make the
 
04:26:12.349 --> 04:26:12.359 align:start position:0%
decision that I need to make a referral
 
04:26:14.670 --> 04:26:14.680 align:start position:0%
for this case or I need to bring in one
 
04:26:18.269 --> 04:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
of my Optometric colleagues to do this
 
04:26:21.109 --> 04:26:21.119 align:start position:0%
procedure and so we have to remember
 
04:26:23.950 --> 04:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
that just when legislation and board
 
04:26:26.510 --> 04:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
regulations moves forward it doesn't set
 
04:26:29.630 --> 04:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
aside professional judgment it doesn't
 
04:26:32.149 --> 04:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
set aside professional integrity and
 
04:26:32.159 --> 04:26:33.389 align:start position:0%
set aside professional integrity and
clinical

04:26:33.389 --> 04:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
clinical
 
04:26:36.109 --> 04:26:36.119 align:start position:0%
judgment and I won't belabor this point
 
04:26:38.950 --> 04:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
because it's been said many many times
 
04:26:40.990 --> 04:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
but I am old enough and have practiced
 
04:26:43.469 --> 04:26:43.479 align:start position:0%
long enough to can remember when we were
 
04:26:46.030 --> 04:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
told in state house after state house
 
04:26:48.590 --> 04:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
that optometrist should not use dilating
 
04:26:51.189 --> 04:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
agents we should not look at the retinas
 
04:26:53.550 --> 04:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
we should not have the dilating agents
 
04:26:56.109 --> 04:26:56.119 align:start position:0%
necessary to test for
 
04:26:58.990 --> 04:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
glaucoma that's legal now in all 50
 
04:27:01.670 --> 04:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
states it's also an important part of
 
04:27:06.510 --> 04:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
what we now simply consider Primary Care
 
04:27:09.269 --> 04:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
Optometry and as was mentioned when oral
 
04:27:13.109 --> 04:27:13.119 align:start position:0%
medications the use of glaucoma a agents
 
04:27:16.349 --> 04:27:16.359 align:start position:0%
our ability to remove a corneal foreign
 
04:27:18.950 --> 04:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
body this is part of primary care
 
04:27:22.389 --> 04:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
optometry in all 50 states and not one
 
04:27:24.590 --> 04:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
of them has there been such an outcry
 
04:27:27.830 --> 04:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
that there's been a repeal or a change
 
04:27:30.109 --> 04:27:30.119 align:start position:0%
as those bills move
 
04:27:33.670 --> 04:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
forward time has proven that what
 
04:27:35.910 --> 04:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
optometrists came to their state houses
 
04:27:40.189 --> 04:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
to say over decades has been
 
04:27:44.429 --> 04:27:44.439 align:start position:0%
correct bills similar to SB 440 granting
 
04:27:46.590 --> 04:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
Doctors of Optometry the authority to
 
04:27:49.189 --> 04:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
perform these additional procedures has
 
04:27:51.870 --> 04:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
been passed in numerous States and by
 
04:27:54.870 --> 04:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
numerous I mean 12 at this stage and as
 
04:27:57.790 --> 04:27:57.800 align:start position:0%
you were uh others maybe involve simply
 
04:28:00.389 --> 04:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
injections but it's quickly becoming the
 
04:28:04.189 --> 04:28:04.199 align:start position:0%
norm It's Quickly becoming Primary Care
 
04:28:06.790 --> 04:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
Optometry so I would just encourage you
 
04:28:09.189 --> 04:28:09.199 align:start position:0%
to Grant my fellow colleagues who
 
04:28:11.149 --> 04:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
practice here in New Hampshire the
 
04:28:13.710 --> 04:28:13.720 align:start position:0%
ability to care for their patients in a
 
04:28:16.510 --> 04:28:16.520 align:start position:0%
competent safe effective And Timely
 
04:28:19.149 --> 04:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
fashion I certainly appreciate your time
 
04:28:22.229 --> 04:28:22.239 align:start position:0%
I have been PR practicing conquered I
 
04:28:23.830 --> 04:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
hope I said that right because when I
 
04:28:25.790 --> 04:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
started out they corrected me several
 
04:28:28.349 --> 04:28:28.359 align:start position:0%
times as to my pronunciation it is a
 
04:28:30.229 --> 04:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
pleasure to see you you have a beautiful
 
04:28:32.630 --> 04:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
community and if I can can answer any
 
04:28:35.630 --> 04:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
questions I would be happy to do so
 
04:28:36.910 --> 04:28:36.920 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony
 
04:28:38.550 --> 04:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps we should have taken the
 
04:28:39.950 --> 04:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
conquered pronunciation Bill a little
 
04:28:43.070 --> 04:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
bit more seriously um then we did
 
04:28:45.189 --> 04:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
representative Gro you have a question
 
04:28:47.830 --> 04:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Dr settler
 
04:28:49.229 --> 04:28:49.239 align:start position:0%
can you please tell me how long has
 
04:28:52.429 --> 04:28:52.439 align:start position:0%
laser has a laser um been used in
 
04:28:56.429 --> 04:28:56.439 align:start position:0%
surgery on the eye in by optometrist it
 
04:29:00.189 --> 04:29:00.199 align:start position:0%
was allowed in 1988 and by
 
04:29:05.070 --> 04:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
optomologist uh I I don't I don't know
 
04:29:11.030 --> 04:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
the 1976 thank you 1976 and 1988 was
 
04:29:13.429 --> 04:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
when Oklahoma was authorized as
 
04:29:15.670 --> 04:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
optometrist to perform the procedure yes
 
04:29:17.510 --> 04:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
and it's still not authorized here is
 
04:29:19.189 --> 04:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
that what you're saying that is correct
 
04:29:20.550 --> 04:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
04:29:22.750 --> 04:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
04:29:24.670 --> 04:29:24.680 align:start position:0%
questions sing on thank you very much
 
04:29:26.710 --> 04:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
for your
 
04:29:31.149 --> 04:29:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:33.550 --> 04:29:33.560 align:start position:0%
Blake oh I'm so sorry we did have a
 
04:29:35.349 --> 04:29:35.359 align:start position:0%
question I totally missed it
 
04:29:37.309 --> 04:29:37.319 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair and uh
 
04:29:38.790 --> 04:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I'd
 
04:29:41.550 --> 04:29:41.560 align:start position:0%
like to raise again a question I alluded
 
04:29:43.269 --> 04:29:43.279 align:start position:0%
to ear earlier as I'm looking at
 
04:29:45.269 --> 04:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
information about ocular surgery
 
04:29:48.990 --> 04:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
Fellowship which uh appears to prepare
 
04:29:52.149 --> 04:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
um optometrist to perform uh certain
 
04:29:54.750 --> 04:29:54.760 align:start position:0%
procedures and for example do at least
 
04:29:59.550 --> 04:29:59.560 align:start position:0%
50 uh SLT procedures at least 50 yags um
 
04:30:02.309 --> 04:30:02.319 align:start position:0%
at least seven cians right so like is
 
04:30:03.990 --> 04:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
there a sense of
 
04:30:06.950 --> 04:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
what um what is a
 
04:30:10.309 --> 04:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
uh a minimum adequate number of
 
04:30:14.149 --> 04:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:16.550 --> 04:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh people should have done to be able to
 
04:30:18.870 --> 04:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
prove competency because well we're all
 
04:30:20.670 --> 04:30:20.680 align:start position:0%
very familiar with C1 do and teach when
 
04:30:21.750 --> 04:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
there's a big difference between
 
04:30:24.109 --> 04:30:24.119 align:start position:0%
learning to put in an IV and doing
 
04:30:27.750 --> 04:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
surgery on the eye so um my question is
 
04:30:30.149 --> 04:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
about competency and numbers my I can
 
04:30:33.229 --> 04:30:33.239 align:start position:0%
only speak to uh Oklahoma where I
 
04:30:37.070 --> 04:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
practice with regards to uh our system
 
04:30:40.429 --> 04:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
uh our students that uh have a desire
 
04:30:43.309 --> 04:30:43.319 align:start position:0%
again there are some that uh may be
 
04:30:45.070 --> 04:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
going to a state where they don't want
 
04:30:48.670 --> 04:30:48.680 align:start position:0%
to perform this procedure or they are uh
 
04:30:50.590 --> 04:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
specializing in contact lenses or a
 
04:30:52.590 --> 04:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
variety of things but those have who
 
04:30:54.870 --> 04:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
have an interest we like to use the term
 
04:30:57.269 --> 04:30:57.279 align:start position:0%
enough I hesitate to give you an exact
 
04:30:59.389 --> 04:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
number because one could then hold that
 
04:31:02.149 --> 04:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
one accountable to that and maybe most
 
04:31:04.149 --> 04:31:04.159 align:start position:0%
of them would probably be well over that
 
04:31:07.109 --> 04:31:07.119 align:start position:0%
number residencies are also an important
 
04:31:09.950 --> 04:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
aspect that we have in Oklahoma uh we
 
04:31:11.910 --> 04:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
currently have four to five ocular
 
04:31:14.109 --> 04:31:14.119 align:start position:0%
disease residencies those are
 
04:31:16.950 --> 04:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
postgraduate optometrists who are those
 
04:31:18.510 --> 04:31:18.520 align:start position:0%
are op those who have graduated from
 
04:31:20.750 --> 04:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
optometry school been accepted into our
 
04:31:23.630 --> 04:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
program in ocular disease residency that
 
04:31:25.510 --> 04:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
gives them simply the opportunity again
 
04:31:27.389 --> 04:31:27.399 align:start position:0%
to take the foundational knowledge that
 
04:31:30.269 --> 04:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
they have gained in their Optometry
 
04:31:34.309 --> 04:31:34.319 align:start position:0%
schools and the dactic and the uh uh
 
04:31:35.950 --> 04:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
Labs that they have had gives them the
 
04:31:38.750 --> 04:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity then to enhance that with
 
04:31:40.469 --> 04:31:40.479 align:start position:0%
regards to seeing and doing more
 
04:31:44.590 --> 04:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:47.590 --> 04:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
followup so I want to use as an example
 
04:31:49.950 --> 04:31:49.960 align:start position:0%
obstetrics in Family Medicine Residency
 
04:31:51.910 --> 04:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
programs there's a generally accepted
 
04:31:54.510 --> 04:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
number or used to be 40 I don't know if
 
04:31:58.229 --> 04:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
it's still 40 or 60 um uh vaginal birth
 
04:32:01.030 --> 04:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
is pretty low risk and complication
 
04:32:03.710 --> 04:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
compared to eye surgery and people can
 
04:32:06.309 --> 04:32:06.319 align:start position:0%
tell you what that number is and so um
 
04:32:08.070 --> 04:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
it's not just that you will or won't be
 
04:32:09.990 --> 04:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
graduated it's also that a hospital
 
04:32:12.590 --> 04:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
won't accredit you to provide that
 
04:32:14.910 --> 04:32:14.920 align:start position:0%
procedure in their you know in their
 
04:32:17.269 --> 04:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
facility so is there any kind of number
 
04:32:19.870 --> 04:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
or standard or anything because nobody
 
04:32:23.149 --> 04:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
has been able to provide a number for uh
 
04:32:26.630 --> 04:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
what might be reasonable for
 
04:32:29.109 --> 04:32:29.119 align:start position:0%
competency I think that varies again
 
04:32:32.349 --> 04:32:32.359 align:start position:0%
from state to state uh with regards to
 
04:32:35.030 --> 04:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
how the regulatory board that you are
 
04:32:37.510 --> 04:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
anticipating uh with this bill setting
 
04:32:39.429 --> 04:32:39.439 align:start position:0%
forth because there is there is variance
 
04:32:42.630 --> 04:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
in situations there certainly are if you
 
04:32:45.070 --> 04:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
desire to do so there are certainly some
 
04:32:47.229 --> 04:32:47.239 align:start position:0%
board regulations Optometry board
 
04:32:50.070 --> 04:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
regulations where you can identify a
 
04:32:52.710 --> 04:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
number that they would have to have in
 
04:32:54.670 --> 04:32:54.680 align:start position:0%
order to move forward and their board
 
04:32:57.309 --> 04:32:57.319 align:start position:0%
sets that being from a state being from
 
04:33:00.109 --> 04:33:00.119 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma I it's not professional for me
 
04:33:02.750 --> 04:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
to suggest to other states what where
 
04:33:04.949 --> 04:33:04.959 align:start position:0%
their board should set that level in
 
04:33:08.470 --> 04:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma when I acquired my lure
 
04:33:10.551 --> 04:33:10.561 align:start position:0%
remember I came from a state where I had
 
04:33:12.670 --> 04:33:12.680 align:start position:0%
practiced for many years but did not
 
04:33:16.551 --> 04:33:16.561 align:start position:0%
have access to this uh to to being able
 
04:33:19.189 --> 04:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
to provide these procedures so what the
 
04:33:22.429 --> 04:33:22.439 align:start position:0%
state of Oklahoma required was that I as
 
04:33:23.910 --> 04:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
with anybody else coming from another
 
04:33:26.230 --> 04:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
state with no access to ability to do
 
04:33:28.590 --> 04:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
these procedures as far as formally for
 
04:33:31.590 --> 04:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
their lure they required me to attend
 
04:33:34.670 --> 04:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
dactic course they required me to do
 
04:33:38.029 --> 04:33:38.039 align:start position:0%
laboratory work they then tested me both
 
04:33:42.830 --> 04:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
written and uh tested me um in a lab
 
04:33:44.789 --> 04:33:44.799 align:start position:0%
situation as well before I was granted
 
04:33:47.789 --> 04:33:47.799 align:start position:0%
lenser so in Oklahoma that would be the
 
04:33:50.390 --> 04:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
requirement having to my knowledge not
 
04:33:52.109 --> 04:33:52.119 align:start position:0%
changed since it was originally set up
 
04:33:52.119 --> 04:33:56.029 align:start position:0%
changed since it was originally set up
in

04:33:56.029 --> 04:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:56.039 --> 04:34:00.590 align:start position:0%
 
1988

04:34:00.590 --> 04:34:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:03.150 --> 04:34:03.160 align:start position:0%
okay now that you got me going I have
 
04:34:06.109 --> 04:34:06.119 align:start position:0%
another question I mean when we practice
 
04:34:08.750 --> 04:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
in a hospital we have clear guidelines
 
04:34:10.789 --> 04:34:10.799 align:start position:0%
in terms of what we can and we can't do
 
04:34:12.390 --> 04:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
you're talking about out patient
 
04:34:14.390 --> 04:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
procedures what's the oversight what are
 
04:34:16.910 --> 04:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
the guidelines who establishes
 
04:34:19.070 --> 04:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
those the guidelines would be
 
04:34:21.310 --> 04:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
established by the board of Optometry in
 
04:34:22.990 --> 04:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
the states that I'm familiar with which
 
04:34:25.750 --> 04:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
include I have had licenses in Oklahoma
 
04:34:28.709 --> 04:34:28.719 align:start position:0%
Nebraska South Dakota and Alaska and so
 
04:34:31.189 --> 04:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
the board of of Optometry within the
 
04:34:34.551 --> 04:34:34.561 align:start position:0%
legislative limit just like in Oklahoma
 
04:34:36.990 --> 04:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
there are certainly some aspects that
 
04:34:39.070 --> 04:34:39.080 align:start position:0%
are excluded from our law that we are
 
04:34:40.750 --> 04:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
not permitted to do and that the board
 
04:34:42.510 --> 04:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
of examiners could not grant us the
 
04:34:44.789 --> 04:34:44.799 align:start position:0%
right to do without returning to a
 
04:34:48.429 --> 04:34:48.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:51.869 --> 04:34:51.879 align:start position:0%
that I think you answered my
 
04:34:53.990 --> 04:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
question if not I will leave you a card
 
04:34:56.789 --> 04:34:56.799 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to address it in all
 
04:35:18.109 --> 04:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:20.230 --> 04:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
good afternoon I'm Timothy Blake I'm an
 
04:35:23.230 --> 04:35:23.240 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist for 18 years at nashwa ey
 
04:35:25.109 --> 04:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
Associates I appreciate the committee's
 
04:35:25.119 --> 04:35:26.070 align:start position:0%
Associates I appreciate the committee's
attention

04:35:26.070 --> 04:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
attention
 
04:35:28.629 --> 04:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
today Nash I Associates is a
 
04:35:30.390 --> 04:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort of seven
 
04:35:33.230 --> 04:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists and seven
 
04:35:36.390 --> 04:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
optometrists uh I have been tasks with
 
04:35:38.349 --> 04:35:38.359 align:start position:0%
speaking about access I think a lot of
 
04:35:41.869 --> 04:35:41.879 align:start position:0%
the access points have been belabored uh
 
04:35:44.750 --> 04:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
so far in the testimony today uh and I
 
04:35:47.551 --> 04:35:47.561 align:start position:0%
was just going to follow up on a couple
 
04:35:50.470 --> 04:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
of the points made uh by the last couple
 
04:35:52.670 --> 04:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
speakers to start
 
04:35:57.910 --> 04:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
with um we were the question was how
 
04:36:00.349 --> 04:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
many patients to
 
04:36:04.029 --> 04:36:04.039 align:start position:0%
achieve uh clinical proficiency to do a
 
04:36:06.910 --> 04:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
procedure a surgery like an SLT glaucoma
 
04:36:09.551 --> 04:36:09.561 align:start position:0%
or uh a yag
 
04:36:12.551 --> 04:36:12.561 align:start position:0%
capsulotomy well it it is a little bit
 
04:36:16.189 --> 04:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
of a moot question because the uh
 
04:36:20.670 --> 04:36:20.680 align:start position:0%
optometrist in 22 of 24 schools can do
 
04:36:24.670 --> 04:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
zero they cannot do surgery on live
 
04:36:30.189 --> 04:36:30.199 align:start position:0%
patients so the uh the um the model the
 
04:36:33.830 --> 04:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
synthetic suturing and the the model I
 
04:36:37.990 --> 04:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
is what 95% of optometrists receive in
 
04:36:41.029 --> 04:36:41.039 align:start position:0%
optometry school we've heard this
 
04:36:44.109 --> 04:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
afternoon from representatives from
 
04:36:46.390 --> 04:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
Kentucky and
 
04:36:49.269 --> 04:36:49.279 align:start position:0%
from uh from Oklahoma and and these are
 
04:36:52.590 --> 04:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
the states where the Optometry
 
04:36:56.150 --> 04:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
schools uh have the scope to to allow uh
 
04:36:57.670 --> 04:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
to teach on live
 
04:36:59.830 --> 04:36:59.840 align:start position:0%
patients uh those are those are the
 
04:37:01.869 --> 04:37:01.879 align:start position:0%
exceptions the other 22 Optometry
 
04:37:06.310 --> 04:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
schools 95% of Optometry students uh do
 
04:37:08.470 --> 04:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
not have an opportunity to train on live
 
04:37:12.750 --> 04:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
patients before they enter practice
 
04:37:14.470 --> 04:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
the gentleman from
 
04:37:19.109 --> 04:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
Kentucky mentioned an accreditation body
 
04:37:22.070 --> 04:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps in the future with
 
04:37:26.709 --> 04:37:26.719 align:start position:0%
forthcoming guidelines on the these very
 
04:37:29.429 --> 04:37:29.439 align:start position:0%
questions it seems to me that we're
 
04:37:32.189 --> 04:37:32.199 align:start position:0%
putting the cart before the horse that
 
04:37:35.470 --> 04:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
we should have the guidelines in place
 
04:37:38.269 --> 04:37:38.279 align:start position:0%
what's necessary to achieve clinical
 
04:37:40.269 --> 04:37:40.279 align:start position:0%
proficiency before we allow the
 
04:37:40.279 --> 04:37:43.510 align:start position:0%
proficiency before we allow the
procedures

04:37:43.510 --> 04:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:46.070 --> 04:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
and then I I also just wanted to comment
 
04:37:51.551 --> 04:37:51.561 align:start position:0%
quickly on the there on the concept of
 
04:37:54.230 --> 04:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
of preventing competition uh
 
04:37:56.990 --> 04:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist the house of medicine uh
 
04:37:57.000 --> 04:37:58.590 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist the house of medicine uh
controlling

04:37:58.590 --> 04:37:58.600 align:start position:0%
controlling
 
04:38:01.910 --> 04:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
markets uh and as I'm sure many of you
 
04:38:06.070 --> 04:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
may know in as Physicians we're we are
 
04:38:08.109 --> 04:38:08.119 align:start position:0%
compensated by insur insurance companies
 
04:38:10.070 --> 04:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
we we have no control over
 
04:38:12.750 --> 04:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
pricing we're paid according to the
 
04:38:15.789 --> 04:38:15.799 align:start position:0%
Medicare allowable or commercials
 
04:38:18.029 --> 04:38:18.039 align:start position:0%
commercial insurers that use the
 
04:38:21.310 --> 04:38:21.320 align:start position:0%
Medicare allowable as a guid
 
04:38:24.990 --> 04:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
line so we we can't set our prices uh we
 
04:38:27.709 --> 04:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
cannot collude so to speak I think it's
 
04:38:29.670 --> 04:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
hard to to call that a
 
04:38:32.029 --> 04:38:32.039 align:start position:0%
monopoly as an extension of this idea
 
04:38:34.789 --> 04:38:34.799 align:start position:0%
were we to introduce optometrists into
 
04:38:36.869 --> 04:38:36.879 align:start position:0%
the surgical market so to
 
04:38:39.029 --> 04:38:39.039 align:start position:0%
speak this would not introduce
 
04:38:41.990 --> 04:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
competition to decrease prices the
 
04:38:43.629 --> 04:38:43.639 align:start position:0%
allowable would be the allowable that
 
04:38:46.551 --> 04:38:46.561 align:start position:0%
the cost would be the cost so that that
 
04:38:51.551 --> 04:38:51.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:55.310 --> 04:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
prices I'll take just a a couple minutes
 
04:38:58.551 --> 04:38:58.561 align:start position:0%
to maybe give a little different
 
04:39:02.869 --> 04:39:02.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:06.429 --> 04:39:06.439 align:start position:0%
access so laser machines and and
 
04:39:08.189 --> 04:39:08.199 align:start position:0%
maintenance on laser machines is
 
04:39:10.590 --> 04:39:10.600 align:start position:0%
expensive a yag laser costs in the range
 
04:39:12.670 --> 04:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
of $60,000
 
04:39:15.949 --> 04:39:15.959 align:start position:0%
maintenance on the order of $9,000 per
 
04:39:18.789 --> 04:39:18.799 align:start position:0%
year do the optometrists who serve our
 
04:39:20.910 --> 04:39:20.920 align:start position:0%
rural communities have the the number of
 
04:39:22.910 --> 04:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
patients needed to support P purchasing
 
04:39:22.920 --> 04:39:23.709 align:start position:0%
patients needed to support P purchasing
a

04:39:23.709 --> 04:39:23.719 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:39:27.551 --> 04:39:27.561 align:start position:0%
laser uh one model is to pull Capital
 
04:39:29.709 --> 04:39:29.719 align:start position:0%
among Optometry offices and disparate
 
04:39:32.349 --> 04:39:32.359 align:start position:0%
locations to purchase and maintain a
 
04:39:36.788 --> 04:39:36.798 align:start position:0%
laser uh this is not an access
 
04:39:39.550 --> 04:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
solution and then secondly does the
 
04:39:42.430 --> 04:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
number of patients in a rural location
 
04:39:44.788 --> 04:39:44.798 align:start position:0%
support the number needed to a treat uh
 
04:39:48.110 --> 04:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
to treat and and Achieve adequate skill
 
04:39:48.120 --> 04:39:49.708 align:start position:0%
to treat and and Achieve adequate skill
and

04:39:49.708 --> 04:39:49.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:39:52.868 --> 04:39:52.878 align:start position:0%
proficiency there is a whole body of of
 
04:39:58.310 --> 04:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
of studies uh body of knowledge uh on uh
 
04:40:00.150 --> 04:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
that demonstrates that one of the most
 
04:40:01.708 --> 04:40:01.718 align:start position:0%
important predictors of surgical
 
04:40:04.628 --> 04:40:04.638 align:start position:0%
complications is low surgical volume
 
04:40:06.948 --> 04:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
surgeons who do fewer surgeries than a
 
04:40:08.708 --> 04:40:08.718 align:start position:0%
critical threshold have more
 
04:40:08.718 --> 04:40:15.430 align:start position:0%
critical threshold have more
complications

04:40:15.430 --> 04:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:16.990 --> 04:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
that's all I have for you this this
 
04:40:20.670 --> 04:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:23.270 --> 04:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
questions and then
 
04:40:25.830 --> 04:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
Murphy yes thank you so the Board of
 
04:40:28.948 --> 04:40:28.958 align:start position:0%
Medicine does they do they require um op
 
04:40:31.910 --> 04:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists to perform their
 
04:40:35.470 --> 04:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
surgeries and training on life
 
04:40:39.868 --> 04:40:39.878 align:start position:0%
patients does the Board of Medicine uh
 
04:40:42.270 --> 04:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
yes uh
 
04:40:44.150 --> 04:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
there are there are a few guidelines
 
04:40:47.030 --> 04:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
that the Board of Medicine um and then
 
04:40:50.750 --> 04:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
residencies have specific accrediting
 
04:40:53.510 --> 04:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
bodies uh in the case of Opthalmology
 
04:40:55.270 --> 04:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
04:40:58.948 --> 04:40:58.958 align:start position:0%
acgme and we have required amounts of
 
04:41:03.310 --> 04:41:03.320 align:start position:0%
each surgery in order to um to be
 
04:41:06.628 --> 04:41:06.638 align:start position:0%
considered competent uh that is the
 
04:41:10.750 --> 04:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
first level of uh of training to
 
04:41:13.550 --> 04:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
competence and and doing those
 
04:41:16.628 --> 04:41:16.638 align:start position:0%
um that uh given number of procedures
 
04:41:22.590 --> 04:41:22.600 align:start position:0%
and then your your surgeon um the the uh
 
04:41:24.310 --> 04:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
the staff has to also sign out that
 
04:41:25.708 --> 04:41:25.718 align:start position:0%
you're not only competent but that
 
04:41:28.390 --> 04:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
you're ready to uh treat patients in the
 
04:41:31.430 --> 04:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
real world I have followup followup and
 
04:41:34.390 --> 04:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
what what did what has what how how has
 
04:41:37.390 --> 04:41:37.400 align:start position:0%
the Laser Technology improved since it
 
04:41:40.590 --> 04:41:40.600 align:start position:0%
was first initiated since it was first
 
04:41:40.600 --> 04:41:43.868 align:start position:0%
was first initiated since it was first
started

04:41:43.868 --> 04:41:43.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:46.150 --> 04:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
not sure I could speak to that there's a
 
04:41:47.628 --> 04:41:47.638 align:start position:0%
lot of different lasers for a lot of
 
04:41:49.470 --> 04:41:49.480 align:start position:0%
different applications I think that
 
04:41:51.628 --> 04:41:51.638 align:start position:0%
there's been uh certainly improvements
 
04:41:53.270 --> 04:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
over the
 
04:41:56.190 --> 04:41:56.200 align:start position:0%
decades thank representative
 
04:41:58.590 --> 04:41:58.600 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you madam chairman thank
 
04:42:00.350 --> 04:42:00.360 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
04:42:02.990 --> 04:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
question um first question my question
 
04:42:05.550 --> 04:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
is um you have an office that has both
 
04:42:07.230 --> 04:42:07.240 align:start position:0%
optometrist and Opthomologist is that
 
04:42:09.750 --> 04:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
correct correct how do the optometrist
 
04:42:12.350 --> 04:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
feel about this bill going going
 
04:42:16.070 --> 04:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
forward we haven't talked about it
 
04:42:18.910 --> 04:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
much thank you followup followup yeah I
 
04:42:20.750 --> 04:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
you know I I I think it's it's a good
 
04:42:25.430 --> 04:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
question in so far as in our office we
 
04:42:27.628 --> 04:42:27.638 align:start position:0%
have comprehensive opthalmologists we
 
04:42:30.230 --> 04:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
have glaucoma trained
 
04:42:35.150 --> 04:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists so there are um when I
 
04:42:36.990 --> 04:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
see a patient that has progressing
 
04:42:40.550 --> 04:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
glaucoma in our practice I'm I'm having
 
04:42:43.350 --> 04:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
that patient one of the glaucoma trained
 
04:42:45.868 --> 04:42:45.878 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists so uh
 
04:42:47.708 --> 04:42:47.718 align:start position:0%
there it would be hard to make an
 
04:42:49.030 --> 04:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
argument in our practice there's a
 
04:42:51.830 --> 04:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
demand for uh Optometry to be doing
 
04:42:51.840 --> 04:42:53.310 align:start position:0%
demand for uh Optometry to be doing
glaucoma

04:42:53.310 --> 04:42:53.320 align:start position:0%
glaucoma
 
04:42:56.868 --> 04:42:56.878 align:start position:0%
lasers followup follow thank you in in
 
04:42:58.910 --> 04:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
North Pedic my practice you know you
 
04:43:01.670 --> 04:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
would have to have at least 25 or 50
 
04:43:05.670 --> 04:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
joints per year in order to qualify for
 
04:43:08.070 --> 04:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
continuing to do those procedures for
 
04:43:10.190 --> 04:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
the reasons that you mentioned that
 
04:43:13.510 --> 04:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
there are increase risks with the few of
 
04:43:15.990 --> 04:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
the procedures that you do basically but
 
04:43:20.350 --> 04:43:20.360 align:start position:0%
my question really is one of the access
 
04:43:23.788 --> 04:43:23.798 align:start position:0%
versus the quality uh part of what we're
 
04:43:26.190 --> 04:43:26.200 align:start position:0%
talking about today I don't want to get
 
04:43:28.788 --> 04:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
into The Optimist versus the optometrist
 
04:43:30.788 --> 04:43:30.798 align:start position:0%
my focus has always been what is the
 
04:43:32.110 --> 04:43:32.120 align:start position:0%
best thing for the
 
04:43:34.708 --> 04:43:34.718 align:start position:0%
patient and from what I'm hearing from
 
04:43:38.550 --> 04:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
you can you speak to the the the
 
04:43:41.868 --> 04:43:41.878 align:start position:0%
question in my mind is for the patients
 
04:43:44.110 --> 04:43:44.120 align:start position:0%
from the patients perspective the
 
04:43:46.310 --> 04:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
quality of care versus the access of
 
04:43:48.830 --> 04:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
care which one did they prefer and where
 
04:43:50.510 --> 04:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
do you see the difference being between
 
04:43:50.520 --> 04:43:52.788 align:start position:0%
do you see the difference being between
the

04:43:52.788 --> 04:43:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:55.628 --> 04:43:55.638 align:start position:0%
two yeah it it's an important Point
 
04:43:58.628 --> 04:43:58.638 align:start position:0%
obviously we are uh as has been said
 
04:44:00.670 --> 04:44:00.680 align:start position:0%
many times here today our number one
 
04:44:04.310 --> 04:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
priority is patient care and and patient
 
04:44:08.550 --> 04:44:08.560 align:start position:0%
safety and uh access is not important if
 
04:44:11.430 --> 04:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
if we don't have quality of care
 
04:44:13.628 --> 04:44:13.638 align:start position:0%
I I think the point becomes even a
 
04:44:15.350 --> 04:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
little more important when you consider
 
04:44:20.190 --> 04:44:20.200 align:start position:0%
that in these states where uh Optometry
 
04:44:22.230 --> 04:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
scope has been expanded these are a lot
 
04:44:24.830 --> 04:44:24.840 align:start position:0%
of the big Square States out west and
 
04:44:29.190 --> 04:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
Midwest uh Alaska um Wyoming Alaska the
 
04:44:31.910 --> 04:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
two uh lowest densely populated uh
 
04:44:35.390 --> 04:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
states in the country um New Hampshire
 
04:44:37.470 --> 04:44:37.480 align:start position:0%
being a small state is actually in the
 
04:44:41.910 --> 04:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
upper half of uh population density so
 
04:44:45.910 --> 04:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
um a as a from a population density
 
04:44:48.750 --> 04:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
standpoint uh New Hampshire is in pretty
 
04:44:53.030 --> 04:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
good shape uh as far as access to an
 
04:44:54.830 --> 04:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist thank
 
04:44:58.310 --> 04:44:58.320 align:start position:0%
you Mani thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:45:02.070 --> 04:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and I know NASA I
 
04:45:04.910 --> 04:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
Associates very well I part of one of
 
04:45:07.190 --> 04:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
the patients there
 
04:45:11.430 --> 04:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
um are all opthalmologists
 
04:45:14.830 --> 04:45:14.840 align:start position:0%
right uh eye surgeons are
 
04:45:19.030 --> 04:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
all um eye surgeons I know all ey
 
04:45:21.390 --> 04:45:21.400 align:start position:0%
surgeons have to be opthalmologist but
 
04:45:23.110 --> 04:45:23.120 align:start position:0%
are all
 
04:45:27.670 --> 04:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:30.350 --> 04:45:30.360 align:start position:0%
surgeons uh there are opthalmologists
 
04:45:32.070 --> 04:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
that are are medical opthalmologists
 
04:45:33.750 --> 04:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
that are not eye
 
04:45:37.270 --> 04:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
surgeons um some subs Specialties such
 
04:45:38.670 --> 04:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
as neuro
 
04:45:41.830 --> 04:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology uh does not do surgery and
 
04:45:44.550 --> 04:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
um in some cases Retina
 
04:45:47.708 --> 04:45:47.718 align:start position:0%
Specialists uh don't do uh more involved
 
04:45:52.390 --> 04:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
retina surgeries thank one followup
 
04:45:55.830 --> 04:45:55.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so the scope of
 
04:45:58.230 --> 04:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
practice for opthalmologist is defined
 
04:46:01.510 --> 04:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
by a specialty similarly would that be
 
04:46:05.070 --> 04:46:05.080 align:start position:0%
something that optometrist are also
 
04:46:07.910 --> 04:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
saying not all optometrists are going to
 
04:46:12.030 --> 04:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
be practicing laser or doing surgery
 
04:46:16.110 --> 04:46:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:19.628 --> 04:46:19.638 align:start position:0%
statement well it's true it it to the
 
04:46:23.190 --> 04:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
extent in the in a world where
 
04:46:25.230 --> 04:46:25.240 align:start position:0%
optometrists were were being trained to
 
04:46:26.788 --> 04:46:26.798 align:start position:0%
do these
 
04:46:30.190 --> 04:46:30.200 align:start position:0%
procedures thank you represent
 
04:46:33.150 --> 04:46:33.160 align:start position:0%
Schmid thank you madam
 
04:46:36.190 --> 04:46:36.200 align:start position:0%
chairman so
 
04:46:39.070 --> 04:46:39.080 align:start position:0%
uh I my question is whether you think
 
04:46:43.110 --> 04:46:43.120 align:start position:0%
that the status quo is immutable that
 
04:46:45.750 --> 04:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
we're not going to see any uh expansion
 
04:46:45.760 --> 04:46:46.910 align:start position:0%
we're not going to see any uh expansion
of

04:46:46.910 --> 04:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:46:51.070 --> 04:46:51.080 align:start position:0%
optomet ability to practice so is that
 
04:46:55.470 --> 04:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
your view that that's the case or do you
 
04:46:58.670 --> 04:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
see that it is inevitable that the
 
04:47:01.948 --> 04:47:01.958 align:start position:0%
optometrist are going to get uh some
 
04:47:06.150 --> 04:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
additional procedures in any case uh and
 
04:47:08.030 --> 04:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
that uh that we have to get it right if
 
04:47:09.750 --> 04:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
we're going to be one of the states
 
04:47:13.910 --> 04:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's going to move forward in this
 
04:47:16.230 --> 04:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
direction what do I want or what do I
 
04:47:19.110 --> 04:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
think is going to happen um I think I
 
04:47:22.350 --> 04:47:22.360 align:start position:0%
can impute a certain desire on your part
 
04:47:25.590 --> 04:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
but I won't do that I want you to
 
04:47:28.510 --> 04:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
answer well um I I do think it's
 
04:47:31.070 --> 04:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
important that anybody doing surgery
 
04:47:34.990 --> 04:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
have the uh have have the training to do
 
04:47:41.470 --> 04:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
it and so um I I think we can um
 
04:47:43.990 --> 04:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
agree on some procedures that are are
 
04:47:46.548 --> 04:47:46.558 align:start position:0%
beyond the current scope of the
 
04:47:51.110 --> 04:47:51.120 align:start position:0%
optometrist but um without the the
 
04:47:53.990 --> 04:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate training it's hard to uh
 
04:47:56.430 --> 04:47:56.440 align:start position:0%
it's hard to agree to procedures or to
 
04:47:59.830 --> 04:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
support them doing procedures that um
 
04:48:03.030 --> 04:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
cut penetrate alter tissues inside the
 
04:48:03.040 --> 04:48:04.830 align:start position:0%
cut penetrate alter tissues inside the
eye

04:48:04.830 --> 04:48:04.840 align:start position:0%
eye
 
04:48:08.030 --> 04:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
followup follow up so we're going to
 
04:48:10.190 --> 04:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
have to uh you know there's going to be
 
04:48:12.430 --> 04:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee and we're going to have
 
04:48:15.310 --> 04:48:15.320 align:start position:0%
to have people participating who have a
 
04:48:19.190 --> 04:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
very strong background but also uh
 
04:48:22.430 --> 04:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
different positions on the spectrum of
 
04:48:24.708 --> 04:48:24.718 align:start position:0%
acceptance whatever I believe you said
 
04:48:27.590 --> 04:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
you're from Nashua uh and so it's
 
04:48:30.070 --> 04:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
relatively nearby a lot closer than
 
04:48:31.990 --> 04:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
Kentucky or
 
04:48:34.948 --> 04:48:34.958 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma um so would you be possibly one
 
04:48:37.430 --> 04:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
of those sub subcommittee participants
 
04:48:39.830 --> 04:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
so that we can have your expertise help
 
04:48:45.030 --> 04:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:49.190 --> 04:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony thank
 
04:48:51.190 --> 04:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
you David
 
04:48:54.868 --> 04:48:54.878 align:start position:0%
cabin Madam chair may I respectfully
 
04:48:58.070 --> 04:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
respectfully request that I with my
 
04:49:01.110 --> 04:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
colleague Dr Who has to get out
 
04:49:07.390 --> 04:49:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:10.150 --> 04:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
you hi there uh thank you so much for
 
04:49:11.590 --> 04:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
letting me go ahead head and speak and
 
04:49:13.030 --> 04:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
my apologies if I watch the clock a
 
04:49:14.990 --> 04:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
little I have to go pick up my son from
 
04:49:16.868 --> 04:49:16.878 align:start position:0%
daycare in a little bit um we're running
 
04:49:19.270 --> 04:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
into our time limit too we perfect so
 
04:49:21.750 --> 04:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna go fast uh first of all just
 
04:49:23.230 --> 04:49:23.240 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the opportunity to
 
04:49:26.070 --> 04:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
speak with you my name is Dr Jessica Eid
 
04:49:28.230 --> 04:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
I'm an optometrist and I practice in New
 
04:49:30.510 --> 04:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
London New Hampshire and I basically
 
04:49:32.628 --> 04:49:32.638 align:start position:0%
just wanted the chance to tell you a bit
 
04:49:34.788 --> 04:49:34.798 align:start position:0%
about my background before I practiced
 
04:49:37.350 --> 04:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire I'm not from here
 
04:49:40.470 --> 04:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
I'm originally from Texas and Kentucky I
 
04:49:42.030 --> 04:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
had attended optometry school at the
 
04:49:44.548 --> 04:49:44.558 align:start position:0%
University of Houston during my time in
 
04:49:47.510 --> 04:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
optometry school I spent years managing
 
04:49:50.590 --> 04:49:50.600 align:start position:0%
complex medical eye conditions during
 
04:49:53.750 --> 04:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
that time I treated patients in Texas
 
04:49:56.830 --> 04:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
but also in Louisiana and Oklahoma so
 
04:49:58.708 --> 04:49:58.718 align:start position:0%
even though I was in a state where I
 
04:50:01.190 --> 04:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to do lasers in Texas I
 
04:50:04.990 --> 04:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
still got many many live Human
 
04:50:07.030 --> 04:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
experiences of these
 
04:50:09.390 --> 04:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
procedures in other states where I could
 
04:50:12.390 --> 04:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
do it so
 
04:50:15.750 --> 04:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
as a student in a state without those
 
04:50:18.990 --> 04:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
same allowances it still can be done and
 
04:50:22.110 --> 04:50:22.120 align:start position:0%
is done that's how I got those live um
 
04:50:24.788 --> 04:50:24.798 align:start position:0%
experiences as a student was going to
 
04:50:26.948 --> 04:50:26.958 align:start position:0%
other states so after that I then
 
04:50:29.628 --> 04:50:29.638 align:start position:0%
completed a residency uh in Tulsa
 
04:50:32.230 --> 04:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma following my residency I then
 
04:50:34.868 --> 04:50:34.878 align:start position:0%
began practicing in Kentucky because
 
04:50:36.548 --> 04:50:36.558 align:start position:0%
that was a state where I could continue
 
04:50:39.110 --> 04:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
to practice to the full extent of my
 
04:50:41.110 --> 04:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
education now my husband husband and I
 
04:50:43.270 --> 04:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
moved here to New Hampshire for his job
 
04:50:45.590 --> 04:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
as a general surgery resident but if it
 
04:50:47.548 --> 04:50:47.558 align:start position:0%
were not for his job here New Hampshire
 
04:50:49.788 --> 04:50:49.798 align:start position:0%
would never have been on my radar as it
 
04:50:52.070 --> 04:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
is not a state where I can practice to
 
04:50:54.590 --> 04:50:54.600 align:start position:0%
the full extent of my training while I
 
04:50:56.590 --> 04:50:56.600 align:start position:0%
have grown to love New Hampshire with
 
04:50:58.670 --> 04:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
all of my heart and I hope to live here
 
04:51:01.990 --> 04:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
for good staying here is not the best
 
04:51:04.868 --> 04:51:04.878 align:start position:0%
decision for for my career as I am
 
04:51:07.030 --> 04:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
Limited in how I can care for my
 
04:51:10.150 --> 04:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
patients I cannot tell you how many
 
04:51:12.510 --> 04:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
times I have seen a patient that needed
 
04:51:14.270 --> 04:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
one of these procedures in order to
 
04:51:16.510 --> 04:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
preserve their vision and I've had to
 
04:51:19.910 --> 04:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
tell them I have done this procedure on
 
04:51:23.590 --> 04:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
live humans countless times I could do
 
04:51:25.910 --> 04:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
it for you here today however the state
 
04:51:28.390 --> 04:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire will not allow it so
 
04:51:30.150 --> 04:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
instead of being able to help them I
 
04:51:32.628 --> 04:51:32.638 align:start position:0%
have to refer them to an opthalmologist
 
04:51:34.830 --> 04:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
which in the best of cases results in
 
04:51:38.070 --> 04:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
delay of care which can threaten Vision
 
04:51:40.670 --> 04:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
in the worst of cases a patient does not
 
04:51:42.910 --> 04:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
have the transportation means to get to
 
04:51:45.910 --> 04:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
an opthalmologist especially in the in
 
04:51:48.030 --> 04:51:48.040 align:start position:0%
the rural given the rural nature of our
 
04:51:52.868 --> 04:51:52.878 align:start position:0%
state and where I practice so to hear
 
04:51:55.310 --> 04:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
anyone that practices in this state say
 
04:51:57.430 --> 04:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
that there is not an issue with access
 
04:52:01.350 --> 04:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
to care is just stunning to me because I
 
04:52:03.670 --> 04:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
see it every day in my practice please
 
04:52:05.868 --> 04:52:05.878 align:start position:0%
listen to me when I say there is a major
 
04:52:08.750 --> 04:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
issue with access to care for my
 
04:52:11.030 --> 04:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
patients and so this is becoming more
 
04:52:13.270 --> 04:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
and more of a problem as opthalmologists
 
04:52:15.350 --> 04:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
in our region are so busy that many will
 
04:52:17.150 --> 04:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
not accept new patients as we've
 
04:52:19.270 --> 04:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
discussed already causing us to have to
 
04:52:21.910 --> 04:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
refer them even further away the problem
 
04:52:24.750 --> 04:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
is only getting worse a solution is so
 
04:52:27.590 --> 04:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
obvious which is to allow us to practice
 
04:52:30.750 --> 04:52:30.760 align:start position:0%
the way that we were trained in my case
 
04:52:33.230 --> 04:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
allow me to practice in New Hampshire
 
04:52:35.230 --> 04:52:35.240 align:start position:0%
the same way that I have practiced in
 
04:52:38.910 --> 04:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
Louisiana Oklahoma and Kentucky if New
 
04:52:40.868 --> 04:52:40.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire wants to attract the best to
 
04:52:42.830 --> 04:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
the state and to take the best care of
 
04:52:45.110 --> 04:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
their residents it is imperative that we
 
04:52:46.708 --> 04:52:46.718 align:start position:0%
are allowed to treat our patients to the
 
04:52:48.948 --> 04:52:48.958 align:start position:0%
full extent of our education thank you
 
04:52:48.958 --> 04:52:49.750 align:start position:0%
full extent of our education thank you
so

04:52:49.750 --> 04:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:52:52.788 --> 04:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
much thank
 
04:53:05.030 --> 04:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:08.150 --> 04:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
gonzala hello afternoon Madam chair
 
04:53:09.510 --> 04:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
members of the board thank you so much
 
04:53:11.270 --> 04:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
for having me here and your patients
 
04:53:13.670 --> 04:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
with all of our testimony this afternoon
 
04:53:15.590 --> 04:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
um my name is Dr Laura gazala I'm a
 
04:53:17.910 --> 04:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
fellowship trained oculoplastic surgeon
 
04:53:21.510 --> 04:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
brand new Dartmouth and I'm happy to wax
 
04:53:23.670 --> 04:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
rodic on my training from aerospace
 
04:53:24.910 --> 04:53:24.920 align:start position:0%
engineering to medicine but in the
 
04:53:27.230 --> 04:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
interest of time I will uh suffice to
 
04:53:28.948 --> 04:53:28.958 align:start position:0%
say that I did indeed graduate from the
 
04:53:32.190 --> 04:53:32.200 align:start position:0%
26th grade it's my dad's favorite joke
 
04:53:34.750 --> 04:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
and I am here mostly to talk about
 
04:53:38.150 --> 04:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
access at Dartmouth uh I am one of four
 
04:53:40.430 --> 04:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
new opthalmologists starting this year
 
04:53:42.230 --> 04:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
at Dartmouth one of them will also be
 
04:53:43.990 --> 04:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
practicing at Mount Ascutney she'll be
 
04:53:46.030 --> 04:53:46.040 align:start position:0%
splitting her time two of us have
 
04:53:48.750 --> 04:53:48.760 align:start position:0%
already started and as to the concerns
 
04:53:50.590 --> 04:53:50.600 align:start position:0%
about aging opthalmologists I am the
 
04:53:53.628 --> 04:53:53.638 align:start position:0%
oldest of the four new opthalmologists
 
04:53:56.470 --> 04:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
so we have some time um We additionally
 
04:53:57.990 --> 04:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
have started the first Opthalmic
 
04:54:00.590 --> 04:54:00.600 align:start position:0%
residency in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:54:02.190 --> 04:54:02.200 align:start position:0%
and we will be graduating our first
 
04:54:04.548 --> 04:54:04.558 align:start position:0%
class this year so we have eight
 
04:54:07.150 --> 04:54:07.160 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists in training at Dartmouth
 
04:54:09.830 --> 04:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
uh seeing patients at the hospital
 
04:54:11.470 --> 04:54:11.480 align:start position:0%
through the Good Neighbor Clinic in
 
04:54:14.430 --> 04:54:14.440 align:start position:0%
Lebanon and they also rotate at the VA
 
04:54:17.150 --> 04:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
and I will also be joining the VA uh
 
04:54:20.310 --> 04:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
later this year and uh as to that point
 
04:54:23.150 --> 04:54:23.160 align:start position:0%
I did want to clarify that the VHA I en
 
04:54:25.948 --> 04:54:25.958 align:start position:0%
Vision Care directive 1121 does not
 
04:54:28.548 --> 04:54:28.558 align:start position:0%
allow for optometrists to perform laser
 
04:54:30.510 --> 04:54:30.520 align:start position:0%
or incisional surgeries at any VA
 
04:54:33.110 --> 04:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
facility even in States like Oklahoma
 
04:54:35.030 --> 04:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
where by state law optometrists are
 
04:54:36.910 --> 04:54:36.920 align:start position:0%
allowed to perform those procedures
 
04:54:38.510 --> 04:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
they're not allowed to perform them at
 
04:54:41.070 --> 04:54:41.080 align:start position:0%
VA facilities that's just Federal
 
04:54:44.350 --> 04:54:44.360 align:start position:0%
policy as for myself I'm an oculoplastic
 
04:54:46.788 --> 04:54:46.798 align:start position:0%
specialist and I can and have been
 
04:54:48.830 --> 04:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
seeing patients referred for iions
 
04:54:51.030 --> 04:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
within a week and I talked with Dr
 
04:54:52.910 --> 04:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
michaelc yesterday she's our newest
 
04:54:54.708 --> 04:54:54.718 align:start position:0%
retina surgeon and she confirmed that if
 
04:54:56.150 --> 04:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
someone is referred for an urgent
 
04:54:57.990 --> 04:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
retinal concern she will see them within
 
04:55:00.948 --> 04:55:00.958 align:start position:0%
24 hours and Dr schy one of our
 
04:55:02.670 --> 04:55:02.680 align:start position:0%
residents that here is today somewhat
 
04:55:04.590 --> 04:55:04.600 align:start position:0%
wearily confirmed that because he was on
 
04:55:07.948 --> 04:55:07.958 align:start position:0%
call at the time uh in summary Dartmouth
 
04:55:10.628 --> 04:55:10.638 align:start position:0%
is growing we're dedicated to safe
 
04:55:13.470 --> 04:55:13.480 align:start position:0%
timely and effective patient care I do
 
04:55:16.390 --> 04:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
want to have one gentle rejoiner that
 
04:55:19.510 --> 04:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
50,000 cases with no reported
 
04:55:21.990 --> 04:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
complications is perhaps not something
 
04:55:24.670 --> 04:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
to celebrate given our colleagues notes
 
04:55:26.548 --> 04:55:26.558 align:start position:0%
that everybody has
 
04:55:28.788 --> 04:55:28.798 align:start position:0%
complications and not reporting them
 
04:55:30.750 --> 04:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
potentially suggests a fairly Cavalier
 
04:55:33.150 --> 04:55:33.160 align:start position:0%
attitude towards patient safety thank
 
04:55:34.430 --> 04:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
you so much for your
 
04:55:37.390 --> 04:55:37.400 align:start position:0%
time thank
 
04:55:41.390 --> 04:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
you yes
 
04:55:42.430 --> 04:55:42.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
04:55:45.708 --> 04:55:45.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question um for an elective
 
04:55:47.948 --> 04:55:47.958 align:start position:0%
procedure of many sorts of any sort
 
04:55:49.310 --> 04:55:49.320 align:start position:0%
whether it's a total joint or whatever
 
04:55:50.590 --> 04:55:50.600 align:start position:0%
it could be you know two months before
 
04:55:52.110 --> 04:55:52.120 align:start position:0%
you can get in to see somebody I
 
04:55:53.948 --> 04:55:53.958 align:start position:0%
understand that and that's an issue that
 
04:55:56.270 --> 04:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
is a potential access issue but my
 
04:55:58.590 --> 04:55:58.600 align:start position:0%
question specifically to you is that at
 
04:56:01.030 --> 04:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth have you ever or do you know
 
04:56:04.868 --> 04:56:04.878 align:start position:0%
of anytime an acute emergency or urgent
 
04:56:06.590 --> 04:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
patient was needed to be seen that could
 
04:56:08.830 --> 04:56:08.840 align:start position:0%
not be seen at Dartmouth no I do not
 
04:56:12.830 --> 04:56:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:12.840 --> 04:56:15.670 align:start position:0%
 
thank

04:56:15.670 --> 04:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:18.548 --> 04:56:18.558 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam chairman thanks for
 
04:56:20.070 --> 04:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
taking my it's a would you believe
 
04:56:21.948 --> 04:56:21.958 align:start position:0%
question because this access issue keeps
 
04:56:23.868 --> 04:56:23.878 align:start position:0%
coming over and over again but would you
 
04:56:26.590 --> 04:56:26.600 align:start position:0%
believe that access is hardly just a
 
04:56:29.310 --> 04:56:29.320 align:start position:0%
problem in this state for Opthalmology
 
04:56:31.150 --> 04:56:31.160 align:start position:0%
and would you believe that patients will
 
04:56:33.230 --> 04:56:33.240 align:start position:0%
drive from the North Country two hours
 
04:56:35.190 --> 04:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
to see a provider for virtually any type
 
04:56:36.750 --> 04:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
of care in the state and would you
 
04:56:39.230 --> 04:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
believe is that your experience I would
 
04:56:41.150 --> 04:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely believe that I'm coming here
 
04:56:44.670 --> 04:56:44.680 align:start position:0%
from Portland Oregon which is one city
 
04:56:47.110 --> 04:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
in a very large Square State that's
 
04:56:49.390 --> 04:56:49.400 align:start position:0%
responsible for approximately 75% of the
 
04:56:50.948 --> 04:56:50.958 align:start position:0%
population of that state so I routinely
 
04:56:53.350 --> 04:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
had patients drive six hours to see me I
 
04:56:55.430 --> 04:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
did my fellowship in West Virginia
 
04:56:57.708 --> 04:56:57.718 align:start position:0%
another rural care with a rural state
 
04:56:59.510 --> 04:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
with access issues and again I had
 
04:57:02.350 --> 04:57:02.360 align:start position:0%
patients coming from as far a field as
 
04:57:05.830 --> 04:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
Kentucky Ohio Western Virginia uh it's
 
04:57:08.670 --> 04:57:08.680 align:start position:0%
it's medicine in general I
 
04:57:11.948 --> 04:57:11.958 align:start position:0%
agree thank you
 
04:57:24.750 --> 04:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:27.788 --> 04:57:27.798 align:start position:0%
Cavin eight shows there we go thank you
 
04:57:29.948 --> 04:57:29.958 align:start position:0%
again for allowing me to address the
 
04:57:32.510 --> 04:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Dr David cin as
 
04:57:34.628 --> 04:57:34.638 align:start position:0%
I said I you can probably tell by my
 
04:57:36.430 --> 04:57:36.440 align:start position:0%
white hair that I've been here a long
 
04:57:39.110 --> 04:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
time I started practicing in
 
04:57:42.830 --> 04:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
1977 October and I recently retired in
 
04:57:42.840 --> 04:57:44.470 align:start position:0%
1977 October and I recently retired in
mid

04:57:44.470 --> 04:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
mid
 
04:57:47.590 --> 04:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
2021 um I want to say that this is at
 
04:57:49.830 --> 04:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
least the third time that I have been
 
04:57:52.910 --> 04:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
here in conquered to testify about a
 
04:57:56.230 --> 04:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
bill in support of an Optometric statute
 
04:57:58.390 --> 04:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
I will also say that three of the
 
04:58:00.990 --> 04:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
speakers who have spoken were in the
 
04:58:03.788 --> 04:58:03.798 align:start position:0%
same room with me opposing those bills
 
04:58:06.230 --> 04:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
but in spite of them you did in fact
 
04:58:09.590 --> 04:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
pass them all of them over time and the
 
04:58:12.830 --> 04:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
outcomes have been I think
 
04:58:15.070 --> 04:58:15.080 align:start position:0%
exemplary quick introduction and then
 
04:58:16.430 --> 04:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
I'll get to the point because I know
 
04:58:18.868 --> 04:58:18.878 align:start position:0%
it's running late during the final years
 
04:58:21.548 --> 04:58:21.558 align:start position:0%
of my Optometric career I thought it
 
04:58:22.868 --> 04:58:22.878 align:start position:0%
would be good to give back to the
 
04:58:24.788 --> 04:58:24.798 align:start position:0%
community I sold my practice and moved
 
04:58:27.990 --> 04:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
on so I had the honor and privilege to
 
04:58:30.110 --> 04:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
serve as the associate medical director
 
04:58:32.230 --> 04:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
of eye care services for the Amis geg
 
04:58:33.990 --> 04:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
Health Center in Manchester New
 
04:58:36.628 --> 04:58:36.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is a federally qualified
 
04:58:40.270 --> 04:58:40.280 align:start position:0%
Health Center it serves the most needy
 
04:58:42.470 --> 04:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
the most underserved population in the
 
04:58:45.670 --> 04:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
state and I want to address access
 
04:58:49.310 --> 04:58:49.320 align:start position:0%
because frankly I am quite upset about
 
04:58:51.788 --> 04:58:51.798 align:start position:0%
the testimony that we don't have access
 
04:58:55.390 --> 04:58:55.400 align:start position:0%
issues we do have severe access issues
 
04:58:57.510 --> 04:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to go up I'm going to stop
 
04:59:00.350 --> 04:59:00.360 align:start position:0%
talking about myself and I've been asked
 
04:59:03.910 --> 04:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
by the current director Dr Jillian PB
 
04:59:06.510 --> 04:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
PID who is now the director of the mseg
 
04:59:08.990 --> 04:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
ey Clinic who couldn't be here today
 
04:59:10.788 --> 04:59:10.798 align:start position:0%
because she's in a dentist office who's
 
04:59:12.750 --> 04:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
not an MD by the way but who's cutting
 
04:59:14.750 --> 04:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
her mouth open to take out wisdom teeth
 
04:59:17.628 --> 04:59:17.638 align:start position:0%
and so forth she's asked me to make a
 
04:59:19.628 --> 04:59:19.638 align:start position:0%
presentation and I will quickly do it
 
04:59:21.030 --> 04:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to cut out some of it but
 
04:59:22.430 --> 04:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
you have her written
 
04:59:24.670 --> 04:59:24.680 align:start position:0%
testimony she basically says that her
 
04:59:26.150 --> 04:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
father was a physician her mother
 
04:59:28.430 --> 04:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
retired nurse and that's why she decided
 
04:59:30.150 --> 04:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
to come back to New Hampshire to
 
04:59:30.160 --> 04:59:31.270 align:start position:0%
to come back to New Hampshire to
practice

04:59:31.270 --> 04:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
practice
 
04:59:34.190 --> 04:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
Optometry she asked for your support in
 
04:59:37.708 --> 04:59:37.718 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 4 440 she says I have
 
04:59:40.628 --> 04:59:40.638 align:start position:0%
experienced in Manchester a Time town a
 
04:59:44.310 --> 04:59:44.320 align:start position:0%
city of 100,000 people roughly I believe
 
04:59:46.150 --> 04:59:46.160 align:start position:0%
I have experienced significant
 
04:59:48.270 --> 04:59:48.280 align:start position:0%
difficulty in finding the Specialty Care
 
04:59:51.548 --> 04:59:51.558 align:start position:0%
my patients desperately need our current
 
04:59:53.430 --> 04:59:53.440 align:start position:0%
Optometry statute as you know and I
 
04:59:55.390 --> 04:59:55.400 align:start position:0%
won't belor it prohibits what's in
 
04:59:58.110 --> 04:59:58.120 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 440 so let me get right to
 
05:00:00.230 --> 05:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
her story she has two of
 
05:00:03.190 --> 05:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
them for example she says just last week
 
05:00:04.868 --> 05:00:04.878 align:start position:0%
now I got this a week ago so it was two
 
05:00:07.510 --> 05:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
weeks ago I had an uninsured patient
 
05:00:10.788 --> 05:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
with a month's old lump in his eyelid
 
05:00:12.548 --> 05:00:12.558 align:start position:0%
causing him
 
05:00:16.548 --> 05:00:16.558 align:start position:0%
discomfort he was um a simple injection
 
05:00:18.270 --> 05:00:18.280 align:start position:0%
into the lesion which would be allowed
 
05:00:20.948 --> 05:00:20.958 align:start position:0%
by Senate Bill 440 that she had been
 
05:00:22.510 --> 05:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
trained I'm going to say speaking this
 
05:00:24.310 --> 05:00:24.320 align:start position:0%
in the first person that I had been
 
05:00:26.868 --> 05:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
trained to do could have been completed
 
05:00:29.788 --> 05:00:29.798 align:start position:0%
the same day for this patient and it
 
05:00:32.670 --> 05:00:32.680 align:start position:0%
might have resolved the condition
 
05:00:35.548 --> 05:00:35.558 align:start position:0%
instead my patient had to refuse my
 
05:00:38.230 --> 05:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
suggested referral to a local
 
05:00:40.628 --> 05:00:40.638 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist because the Opthalmology
 
05:00:43.270 --> 05:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
consult and injection was cost
 
05:00:45.310 --> 05:00:45.320 align:start position:0%
prohibitive these are people with no
 
05:00:47.990 --> 05:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
money or little money as one of my
 
05:00:50.750 --> 05:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
patients has put it to me I can barely
 
05:00:54.150 --> 05:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
afford a loaf of bread let alone an
 
05:00:56.510 --> 05:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
outof pocket referral to an
 
05:00:59.510 --> 05:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist case number two and I'll
 
05:01:02.270 --> 05:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
be ending this okay I'll give you an
 
05:01:05.110 --> 05:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
example of a patient I regularly see and
 
05:01:07.750 --> 05:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
could treat safely treat with a
 
05:01:09.910 --> 05:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
procedure that I was per trained to per
 
05:01:12.708 --> 05:01:12.718 align:start position:0%
perform in optometry school but cannot
 
05:01:14.590 --> 05:01:14.600 align:start position:0%
perform due to the current Statute in
 
05:01:18.430 --> 05:01:18.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'll call the patient Sam
 
05:01:20.350 --> 05:01:20.360 align:start position:0%
Sam first saw me when I was a fourth
 
05:01:23.430 --> 05:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
year Optometry student intern at the um
 
05:01:24.708 --> 05:01:24.718 align:start position:0%
Community Health Center the manchest
 
05:01:26.150 --> 05:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
said she was my student intern when I
 
05:01:28.470 --> 05:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
was medical director Sam came in
 
05:01:31.590 --> 05:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
covering her left eye in tears this is
 
05:01:34.670 --> 05:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
the patient her husband had recently
 
05:01:38.708 --> 05:01:38.718 align:start position:0%
passed away and over the previous week
 
05:01:40.670 --> 05:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
she had developed a debilitating
 
05:01:44.628 --> 05:01:44.638 align:start position:0%
Headache nausea blurred vision in her
 
05:01:46.628 --> 05:01:46.638 align:start position:0%
left eye and severe eye
 
05:01:49.230 --> 05:01:49.240 align:start position:0%
pain our colleagues in Opthalmology have
 
05:01:50.708 --> 05:01:50.718 align:start position:0%
spoken about this and all the
 
05:01:53.390 --> 05:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
misdiagnoses that we've made but here's
 
05:01:56.270 --> 05:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
the story this patient had been
 
05:01:59.270 --> 05:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
misdiagnosed by the ER who told her that
 
05:02:01.230 --> 05:02:01.240 align:start position:0%
she was having migraines brought on by
 
05:02:04.510 --> 05:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
her husband's death she went then to her
 
05:02:07.230 --> 05:02:07.240 align:start position:0%
primary care physician an MD who told
 
05:02:09.910 --> 05:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
her oh you've got an eye infection and
 
05:02:12.350 --> 05:02:12.360 align:start position:0%
he prescribed Tylenol and an
 
05:02:15.270 --> 05:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
antibiotic and guess what she ended up
 
05:02:18.948 --> 05:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
in Dr pid's Clinic a day or two later
 
05:02:21.910 --> 05:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
who and Dr peid Who I'm testifying for
 
05:02:24.350 --> 05:02:24.360 align:start position:0%
immediately diagnosed her condition as
 
05:02:27.548 --> 05:02:27.558 align:start position:0%
acute angle closure glaucoma angle
 
05:02:29.788 --> 05:02:29.798 align:start position:0%
glosser glaucoma is a potentially
 
05:02:32.750 --> 05:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
blinding condition where the anatomical
 
05:02:35.150 --> 05:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
area in the front of the eye that
 
05:02:37.590 --> 05:02:37.600 align:start position:0%
normally drains fluid gets
 
05:02:40.390 --> 05:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
blocked and this can cause rapid rapid
 
05:02:43.150 --> 05:02:43.160 align:start position:0%
Rises and pressures and it is truly an
 
05:02:43.160 --> 05:02:44.708 align:start position:0%
Rises and pressures and it is truly an
ocular

05:02:44.708 --> 05:02:44.718 align:start position:0%
ocular
 
05:02:47.390 --> 05:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
emergency I immediately administered
 
05:02:50.830 --> 05:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
topical and oral medications that we had
 
05:02:53.430 --> 05:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
in the eye clinic and which I am
 
05:02:56.350 --> 05:02:56.360 align:start position:0%
authorized to prescribe by former
 
05:02:59.270 --> 05:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
legislation that we were opposed on 20
 
05:03:01.990 --> 05:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
plus years ago by the opthalmologist
 
05:03:03.708 --> 05:03:03.718 align:start position:0%
three of whom have already testified
 
05:03:07.628 --> 05:03:07.638 align:start position:0%
against this bill okay so she used those
 
05:03:10.708 --> 05:03:10.718 align:start position:0%
medications to just
 
05:03:13.910 --> 05:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
delay just delay the
 
05:03:18.910 --> 05:03:18.920 align:start position:0%
problem um I lost my place sorry so
 
05:03:22.310 --> 05:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
basically the definitive treatment Dr PB
 
05:03:24.628 --> 05:03:24.638 align:start position:0%
speaking the definitive treatment for
 
05:03:27.548 --> 05:03:27.558 align:start position:0%
this condition is an in office laser
 
05:03:31.310 --> 05:03:31.320 align:start position:0%
procedure that I was trained Dr peid to
 
05:03:33.990 --> 05:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
perform an optometry school you might
 
05:03:36.310 --> 05:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
think the story ends
 
05:03:38.788 --> 05:03:38.798 align:start position:0%
there that I performed the laser
 
05:03:42.190 --> 05:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
procedure and we saved Sam's
 
05:03:45.708 --> 05:03:45.718 align:start position:0%
Vision that is not the case our current
 
05:03:48.190 --> 05:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
law again prohibits this
 
05:03:51.670 --> 05:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
so Dr peid states only opthalmologist
 
05:03:53.590 --> 05:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
can perform the procedure but Sam a
 
05:03:56.230 --> 05:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
single working mother did not have
 
05:03:58.868 --> 05:03:58.878 align:start position:0%
insurance to cover such a procedure at a
 
05:04:01.070 --> 05:04:01.080 align:start position:0%
local opthalmologist office she couldn't
 
05:04:05.030 --> 05:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
afford it instead Sam had to drive over
 
05:04:07.830 --> 05:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
60 minutes I'm assuming and I don't know
 
05:04:11.868 --> 05:04:11.878 align:start position:0%
perhaps to Dartmouth a away to receive a
 
05:04:13.510 --> 05:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
laser treatment from an opthalmologist
 
05:04:16.788 --> 05:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
who re who agreed to do it at a reduced
 
05:04:19.590 --> 05:04:19.600 align:start position:0%
price this procedure saved the vision in
 
05:04:22.470 --> 05:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
the left eye of the patient but with
 
05:04:24.510 --> 05:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
angled closure you need to treat the
 
05:04:27.390 --> 05:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
other eye relatively quickly because
 
05:04:31.350 --> 05:04:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:34.150 --> 05:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
eye faced with the and so it was
 
05:04:36.030 --> 05:04:36.040 align:start position:0%
recommended to the patient but faced
 
05:04:40.830 --> 05:04:40.840 align:start position:0%
with a $1,000 bill plus and and a over
 
05:04:40.840 --> 05:04:42.190 align:start position:0%
with a $1,000 bill plus and and a over
60-minute

05:04:42.190 --> 05:04:42.200 align:start position:0%
60-minute
 
05:04:47.390 --> 05:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
drive Sam told me Dr P that she had to
 
05:04:50.070 --> 05:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
refuse the second procedure because she
 
05:04:53.150 --> 05:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
couldn't afford the cost this is
 
05:04:56.430 --> 05:04:56.440 align:start position:0%
happening in Manchester New Hampshire in
 
05:04:58.510 --> 05:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
a clinic that serves
 
05:05:03.270 --> 05:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
16,000 uninsured or underinsured people
 
05:05:05.750 --> 05:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
so it's not an issue of access just in
 
05:05:09.110 --> 05:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
those counties that Dr uh Sawyer
 
05:05:11.470 --> 05:05:11.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned it's
 
05:05:14.350 --> 05:05:14.360 align:start position:0%
everywhere and to final to make it final
 
05:05:15.708 --> 05:05:15.718 align:start position:0%
I've have been trained to perform this
 
05:05:18.670 --> 05:05:18.680 align:start position:0%
laser procedure if Senate Bill 440
 
05:05:21.430 --> 05:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
passes our health center could procure
 
05:05:23.990 --> 05:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
funding through a grant of a private
 
05:05:27.350 --> 05:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
Foundation as medical director of iare I
 
05:05:29.270 --> 05:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
can tell you that is exactly true we
 
05:05:31.510 --> 05:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
have many foundations Cogswell and
 
05:05:35.270 --> 05:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
others that would immediately pay for a
 
05:05:38.150 --> 05:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
laser and we could have offered it to
 
05:05:39.868 --> 05:05:39.878 align:start position:0%
not only this patient but to our
 
05:05:39.878 --> 05:05:42.948 align:start position:0%
not only this patient but to our
patients

05:05:42.948 --> 05:05:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:45.390 --> 05:05:45.400 align:start position:0%
immediately I have countless stues of
 
05:05:47.390 --> 05:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
other patients who require the same
 
05:05:49.430 --> 05:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
services that I'm not trained that I'm
 
05:05:52.390 --> 05:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
trained to do but prohibited from
 
05:05:54.750 --> 05:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
doing and that's I chose to come back to
 
05:05:56.470 --> 05:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it would make sense if I
 
05:05:58.868 --> 05:05:58.878 align:start position:0%
could do them and then she just goes on
 
05:06:01.868 --> 05:06:01.878 align:start position:0%
to ask your support for Senate Bill 440
 
05:06:03.390 --> 05:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
my experience is just one to many
 
05:06:05.990 --> 05:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
reasons why I respectively ask that
 
05:06:08.670 --> 05:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 440 be passed into law thank
 
05:06:11.868 --> 05:06:11.878 align:start position:0%
you for your time Dr Jillian P any
 
05:06:11.878 --> 05:06:13.990 align:start position:0%
you for your time Dr Jillian P any
questions

05:06:13.990 --> 05:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:06:16.910 --> 05:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
please yes sir thank you madam chairman
 
05:06:18.750 --> 05:06:18.760 align:start position:0%
I I just want to say in medical school I
 
05:06:20.628 --> 05:06:20.638 align:start position:0%
absolutely hated eyes every one of you
 
05:06:24.270 --> 05:06:24.280 align:start position:0%
guys walks on water both sides how hard
 
05:06:26.470 --> 05:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
is it to diagnose on narrow angle
 
05:06:29.470 --> 05:06:29.480 align:start position:0%
glaucoma how hard to diagnose yeah
 
05:06:30.750 --> 05:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
because it's been kind of brought up
 
05:06:34.670 --> 05:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
that yes um I would say that for a non-
 
05:06:37.910 --> 05:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
ey doctor I'd say for an optometrist and
 
05:06:39.590 --> 05:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist it should be a
 
05:06:42.230 --> 05:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
immediately diagnosed it's not at all
 
05:06:44.430 --> 05:06:44.440 align:start position:0%
difficult to diagnose I've diagnosed
 
05:06:46.830 --> 05:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
some cases myself I'm sure my colleagues
 
05:06:48.910 --> 05:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
diagnose them all the time we diagnose
 
05:06:53.030 --> 05:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
them all the time for a non ey care
 
05:06:53.040 --> 05:06:54.150 align:start position:0%
them all the time for a non ey care
medical

05:06:54.150 --> 05:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
medical
 
05:06:57.470 --> 05:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
doctor it could be a bit more difficult
 
05:07:00.230 --> 05:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
but an ER physician should certainly
 
05:07:04.110 --> 05:07:04.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:06.270 --> 05:07:06.280 align:start position:0%
not thank
 
05:07:08.430 --> 05:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you very much for allowing me
 
05:07:11.190 --> 05:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
to testify appreciate it thank
 
05:07:20.590 --> 05:07:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:22.628 --> 05:07:22.638 align:start position:0%
slint good afternoon and thank you for
 
05:07:24.270 --> 05:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
having me here today my name is danne
 
05:07:25.670 --> 05:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
slint I'm a board certified
 
05:07:27.150 --> 05:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist and and fellowship
 
05:07:29.470 --> 05:07:29.480 align:start position:0%
trained oculoplastic surgeon incate Bill
 
05:07:31.708 --> 05:07:31.718 align:start position:0%
440 is dangerous to patient safety and I
 
05:07:33.350 --> 05:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
will get into that with an example in a
 
05:07:35.070 --> 05:07:35.080 align:start position:0%
second of how the exclusionary language
 
05:07:37.190 --> 05:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
will actually harm a patient but before
 
05:07:38.788 --> 05:07:38.798 align:start position:0%
I do that um I just want to clarify a
 
05:07:40.070 --> 05:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
couple things as well
 
05:07:41.788 --> 05:07:41.798 align:start position:0%
a lot of was brought up earlier today
 
05:07:43.190 --> 05:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
was regarding the list of procedures
 
05:07:45.110 --> 05:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
that were performed and Madam chairman
 
05:07:46.628 --> 05:07:46.638 align:start position:0%
you were you hit the nail on the head
 
05:07:47.948 --> 05:07:47.958 align:start position:0%
when you talked about the exclusionary
 
05:07:49.390 --> 05:07:49.400 align:start position:0%
language because when you look at the
 
05:07:51.948 --> 05:07:51.958 align:start position:0%
eyelid section it doesn't say they can
 
05:07:53.788 --> 05:07:53.798 align:start position:0%
fix an outward turned eyelid it doesn't
 
05:07:55.788 --> 05:07:55.798 align:start position:0%
say they can fix an inward turned eyelid
 
05:07:57.788 --> 05:07:57.798 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say they can fix a sty it
 
05:07:59.868 --> 05:07:59.878 align:start position:0%
doesn't say they can fix a papala it
 
05:08:01.590 --> 05:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
says what they can't do and that's why
 
05:08:04.110 --> 05:08:04.120 align:start position:0%
that bill is dangerous and the initial
 
05:08:06.510 --> 05:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
list that was generated was when a group
 
05:08:08.708 --> 05:08:08.718 align:start position:0%
of opthalmologists and I all went over
 
05:08:10.430 --> 05:08:10.440 align:start position:0%
those possible procedures that we do as
 
05:08:13.030 --> 05:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
a collective specialty 250 something
 
05:08:14.830 --> 05:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
procedures were something within our our
 
05:08:16.670 --> 05:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
realm that can be done including
 
05:08:18.868 --> 05:08:18.878 align:start position:0%
liposuction including including breaking
 
05:08:20.510 --> 05:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
nose bones and such because that's in my
 
05:08:20.520 --> 05:08:21.590 align:start position:0%
nose bones and such because that's in my
my

05:08:21.590 --> 05:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
my
 
05:08:25.430 --> 05:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
purview um and the CP codes that were
 
05:08:26.708 --> 05:08:26.718 align:start position:0%
listed is what's published by the
 
05:08:28.990 --> 05:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
American um Medical Association and
 
05:08:31.350 --> 05:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
that's where that information was um was
 
05:08:33.548 --> 05:08:33.558 align:start position:0%
from the list that you see in the blue
 
05:08:35.990 --> 05:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
book what was uh which came about from
 
05:08:37.670 --> 05:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
negotiations that came from both sides
 
05:08:39.670 --> 05:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
which I was not a part of but I was uh
 
05:08:42.628 --> 05:08:42.638 align:start position:0%
part of making what is in that blue book
 
05:08:44.310 --> 05:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
and the procedure that you see in that
 
05:08:46.150 --> 05:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
blue book still still doesn't make sense
 
05:08:47.788 --> 05:08:47.798 align:start position:0%
in terms of what's in the language for
 
05:08:49.948 --> 05:08:49.958 align:start position:0%
example four of those CPT codes listed
 
05:08:52.830 --> 05:08:52.840 align:start position:0%
are actually in response to a biopsy but
 
05:08:54.948 --> 05:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
from the language in cabel 440
 
05:08:57.270 --> 05:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
optometrists don't want to uh operate on
 
05:08:58.830 --> 05:08:58.840 align:start position:0%
a lesion that they think is cancerous
 
05:09:01.270 --> 05:09:01.280 align:start position:0%
but you do a biopsy if you're suspicious
 
05:09:01.280 --> 05:09:02.270 align:start position:0%
but you do a biopsy if you're suspicious
of

05:09:02.270 --> 05:09:02.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:09:05.070 --> 05:09:05.080 align:start position:0%
cancer um we talked about earlier about
 
05:09:07.110 --> 05:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
the number of Optometry schools that
 
05:09:10.230 --> 05:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
were um um in state that can do lasers
 
05:09:12.830 --> 05:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
only two of I believe the 23 states are
 
05:09:15.350 --> 05:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
in those States so one of the questions
 
05:09:16.910 --> 05:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
that we have though is you know how can
 
05:09:18.788 --> 05:09:18.798 align:start position:0%
the majority of the um students get that
 
05:09:20.670 --> 05:09:20.680 align:start position:0%
laser training that they need if only
 
05:09:22.830 --> 05:09:22.840 align:start position:0%
two of those states are located in those
 
05:09:24.750 --> 05:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
schools are located in those States but
 
05:09:26.030 --> 05:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
more concerning it's more the
 
05:09:27.868 --> 05:09:27.878 align:start position:0%
complications how are you going to see
 
05:09:29.430 --> 05:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
those complications that arise and be
 
05:09:31.190 --> 05:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
able to manage them when you don't see
 
05:09:32.830 --> 05:09:32.840 align:start position:0%
them during that
 
05:09:34.590 --> 05:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
training um and then we've heard
 
05:09:37.110 --> 05:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
testimony from Miss rled today that her
 
05:09:38.788 --> 05:09:38.798 align:start position:0%
complication has occurred in one of
 
05:09:39.910 --> 05:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
these states
 
05:09:42.390 --> 05:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
however it's not reported to the board
 
05:09:47.190 --> 05:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
um on page 59 and 57 of the white book
 
05:09:49.590 --> 05:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
uh you'll see language uh that both says
 
05:09:51.948 --> 05:09:51.958 align:start position:0%
that they're not required to report
 
05:09:53.350 --> 05:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
these complications to the board and
 
05:09:55.750 --> 05:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
that's why often there there's oversight
 
05:09:58.270 --> 05:09:58.280 align:start position:0%
there so getting back to my original
 
05:10:00.110 --> 05:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
testimony um the first thing I want to
 
05:10:01.868 --> 05:10:01.878 align:start position:0%
discuss since ocul plastic is in my
 
05:10:02.868 --> 05:10:02.878 align:start position:0%
realm I'll be talking a lot about the
 
05:10:04.708 --> 05:10:04.718 align:start position:0%
eyelids the eye socket in the tear duct
 
05:10:07.270 --> 05:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
system today so diagnosing skin lesions
 
05:10:08.788 --> 05:10:08.798 align:start position:0%
is difficult and requires substantial
 
05:10:10.070 --> 05:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
medical training
 
05:10:12.390 --> 05:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 440 would allow non-med
 
05:10:14.470 --> 05:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
doctors to judge if a lesan is cancerous
 
05:10:16.990 --> 05:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
or not without ever seeing a physician
 
05:10:19.310 --> 05:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
and if they don't think it's cancerous
 
05:10:21.110 --> 05:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
they could operate on it and I'll pass
 
05:10:23.030 --> 05:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
these around here in a little bit too um
 
05:10:24.788 --> 05:10:24.798 align:start position:0%
but what you can see here and really
 
05:10:26.670 --> 05:10:26.680 align:start position:0%
what I want you to pay attention to is
 
05:10:29.390 --> 05:10:29.400 align:start position:0%
how similar the top and the bottom look
 
05:10:32.830 --> 05:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
the top is benign the bottom is a Cancer
 
05:10:36.110 --> 05:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:39.390 --> 05:10:39.400 align:start position:0%
similar the top is a sty which has been
 
05:10:42.590 --> 05:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
n in the bottom is cancer and I followed
 
05:10:43.990 --> 05:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
up with this patient a couple weeks ago
 
05:10:45.430 --> 05:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
and he's likely going to lose his eye
 
05:10:48.190 --> 05:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:51.910 --> 05:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
this top picture is a sty it's benign
 
05:10:54.390 --> 05:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
the bottom picture is an orbital tumor
 
05:10:56.430 --> 05:10:56.440 align:start position:0%
they both look
 
05:10:59.590 --> 05:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
similar in Tennessee an optometrist
 
05:11:01.868 --> 05:11:01.878 align:start position:0%
actually operated on this top Legion up
 
05:11:03.948 --> 05:11:03.958 align:start position:0%
here which he thought was a sty and when
 
05:11:05.788 --> 05:11:05.798 align:start position:0%
it didn't resolve he finally sent the
 
05:11:07.788 --> 05:11:07.798 align:start position:0%
patient to an opthalmologist the
 
05:11:09.510 --> 05:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist diagnos it as a basil
 
05:11:11.948 --> 05:11:11.958 align:start position:0%
cell cancer through a biopsy and what
 
05:11:13.990 --> 05:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
you see on the bottom is the defect that
 
05:11:15.910 --> 05:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
resulted from having to have that cancer
 
05:11:19.590 --> 05:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
removed it was subst reconstructed by an
 
05:11:21.510 --> 05:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist misdiagnosis of a
 
05:11:23.350 --> 05:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
cancerous lesion can lead to blindness
 
05:11:25.230 --> 05:11:25.240 align:start position:0%
or death and this is especially true
 
05:11:27.788 --> 05:11:27.798 align:start position:0%
with melanoma similar cases can happen
 
05:11:29.548 --> 05:11:29.558 align:start position:0%
in new New Hampshire as a result of
 
05:11:32.430 --> 05:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:35.948 --> 05:11:35.958 align:start position:0%
bill this is sty surgery look how close
 
05:11:37.548 --> 05:11:37.558 align:start position:0%
that needle and the scalp will come to
 
05:11:40.590 --> 05:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
the eyeball the eyelid is only 2 mm
 
05:11:42.230 --> 05:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
thick that's the same thickness as a
 
05:11:44.190 --> 05:11:44.200 align:start position:0%
nickel it's of no surprise that
 
05:11:46.110 --> 05:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
dermatologists and plastic surgeon refer
 
05:11:48.350 --> 05:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
eyelid surgeries Optimist due to fear to
 
05:11:51.708 --> 05:11:51.718 align:start position:0%
injuring the eye and sadly in Kentucky
 
05:11:53.510 --> 05:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
an an optometrist stuck a needle into a
 
05:11:55.868 --> 05:11:55.878 align:start position:0%
patient's eye during an eyelid surgery
 
05:11:57.430 --> 05:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
this serious complication may lead to an
 
05:11:59.310 --> 05:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
infection blindness or the need to
 
05:12:01.868 --> 05:12:01.878 align:start position:0%
remove the S the eye um and their letter
 
05:12:03.430 --> 05:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
um is documented in the back of your
 
05:12:06.030 --> 05:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
white booklet as well approximately one
 
05:12:07.788 --> 05:12:07.798 align:start position:0%
in 20 of the eyelid procedures that I
 
05:12:09.670 --> 05:12:09.680 align:start position:0%
perform in clinic involve a patient
 
05:12:11.270 --> 05:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
passing out and sometimes that looks
 
05:12:13.390 --> 05:12:13.400 align:start position:0%
like a seizure opthalmologists undergo
 
05:12:14.910 --> 05:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
extensive medical training including
 
05:12:17.430 --> 05:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
rotations in the Eds and the icus to be
 
05:12:19.070 --> 05:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
able to handle
 
05:12:21.708 --> 05:12:21.718 align:start position:0%
emergencies speaking of emergencies the
 
05:12:24.310 --> 05:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
eyelids have a rich blood supply this is
 
05:12:26.628 --> 05:12:26.638 align:start position:0%
my patient on the left and she had
 
05:12:28.270 --> 05:12:28.280 align:start position:0%
severe bruising after minor eyelid
 
05:12:30.910 --> 05:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
surgery while she was okay what we fear
 
05:12:32.948 --> 05:12:32.958 align:start position:0%
is this patient on the right the patient
 
05:12:34.830 --> 05:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
I had on the right had bleeding behind
 
05:12:37.110 --> 05:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
the eye in the eye socket the eye socket
 
05:12:38.548 --> 05:12:38.558 align:start position:0%
is enclosed and this is called an
 
05:12:40.628 --> 05:12:40.638 align:start position:0%
orbital compart compartment syndrome and
 
05:12:42.430 --> 05:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
this requires urgent surgery within
 
05:12:44.270 --> 05:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
minutes to prevent uh blindness that's
 
05:12:46.150 --> 05:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
permanent to treat the compartment
 
05:12:48.270 --> 05:12:48.280 align:start position:0%
syndrome you need to enter the orbit to
 
05:12:50.230 --> 05:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
relieve that pressure opthalmologists
 
05:12:52.788 --> 05:12:52.798 align:start position:0%
are all trained to perform the surgery
 
05:12:55.910 --> 05:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 440 specifically excludes
 
05:12:58.708 --> 05:12:58.718 align:start position:0%
orbital surgery therefore passage of
 
05:13:00.628 --> 05:13:00.638 align:start position:0%
this bill would Grant Optometry C
 
05:13:02.628 --> 05:13:02.638 align:start position:0%
certain procedures but leave them unable
 
05:13:04.110 --> 05:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
to manage a vision-threatening
 
05:13:06.270 --> 05:13:06.280 align:start position:0%
complication that needs to be handled
 
05:13:09.190 --> 05:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
urgently and as a result pass to this
 
05:13:10.750 --> 05:13:10.760 align:start position:0%
bill would uh potentially cause New
 
05:13:13.670 --> 05:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens to unnecessarily go
 
05:13:16.070 --> 05:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
blind likewise we see a similar
 
05:13:18.390 --> 05:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
situation with cosmetic injections
 
05:13:20.350 --> 05:13:20.360 align:start position:0%
cosmetic fillers can cause stroke
 
05:13:22.990 --> 05:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
blindness droopy Lids double vision and
 
05:13:25.190 --> 05:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
skin death with the most common type of
 
05:13:27.430 --> 05:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
filler treatment for filler Associated
 
05:13:29.510 --> 05:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
blindness in includes injecting
 
05:13:32.510 --> 05:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
medication into the orbit again if this
 
05:13:34.350 --> 05:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
bill was pass optometer could perform
 
05:13:36.590 --> 05:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
this procedure but be unable to manage a
 
05:13:36.600 --> 05:13:37.788 align:start position:0%
this procedure but be unable to manage a
vision-threatening

05:13:37.788 --> 05:13:37.798 align:start position:0%
vision-threatening
 
05:13:39.948 --> 05:13:39.958 align:start position:0%
complication m diagnosis and the
 
05:13:41.708 --> 05:13:41.718 align:start position:0%
inability to manage complications will
 
05:13:44.110 --> 05:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily harm or blind a patient
 
05:13:45.270 --> 05:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
please protect the citizens of New
 
05:13:46.548 --> 05:13:46.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from the substandard medical
 
05:13:48.230 --> 05:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
care that this legislation represents
 
05:13:51.868 --> 05:13:51.878 align:start position:0%
and v no on Senate Bill 440 thank you
 
05:13:51.878 --> 05:13:52.590 align:start position:0%
and v no on Senate Bill 440 thank you
thank

05:13:52.590 --> 05:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:13:52.600 --> 05:13:55.910 align:start position:0%
thank
you

05:13:55.910 --> 05:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:58.830 --> 05:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
repri okay so I get it this this bill
 
05:14:02.910 --> 05:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
has got some problems is it
 
05:14:05.030 --> 05:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
fixable because we're not going to vote
 
05:14:08.470 --> 05:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
on this bill okay representative Schmidt
 
05:14:11.548 --> 05:14:11.558 align:start position:0%
I think that's Beyond his scope okay you
 
05:14:13.510 --> 05:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
that's your opinion my opinion is
 
05:14:16.868 --> 05:14:16.878 align:start position:0%
different now the thing is
 
05:14:19.230 --> 05:14:19.240 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have a subcommittee
 
05:14:20.670 --> 05:14:20.680 align:start position:0%
and we're going to look at all these
 
05:14:23.030 --> 05:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
issues that have been raised and I bet
 
05:14:25.070 --> 05:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
you we're going to try and resolve the
 
05:14:28.150 --> 05:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
issues so that we can do what's right
 
05:14:31.628 --> 05:14:31.638 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire we need help from
 
05:14:33.510 --> 05:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
people like you who know what you're
 
05:14:36.670 --> 05:14:36.680 align:start position:0%
talking about so you're willing to come
 
05:14:39.350 --> 05:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
to the subcommittee and help us fix the
 
05:14:41.910 --> 05:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
if it needs it count me in but I think
 
05:14:43.350 --> 05:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
you you also said that right too you
 
05:14:45.150 --> 05:14:45.160 align:start position:0%
know part of the the differences and we
 
05:14:47.510 --> 05:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
heard from both um Kentucky and Oklahoma
 
05:14:49.868 --> 05:14:49.878 align:start position:0%
today is that there's a vast difference
 
05:14:51.708 --> 05:14:51.718 align:start position:0%
in the training in the states that
 
05:14:53.150 --> 05:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
optometrics can perform surgery there's
 
05:14:55.030 --> 05:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
no minimum there's no requirements need
 
05:14:56.788 --> 05:14:56.798 align:start position:0%
be met whereas a medical school and
 
05:14:58.868 --> 05:14:58.878 align:start position:0%
Opthalmology residency which is acgme
 
05:15:00.868 --> 05:15:00.878 align:start position:0%
approved you have to meet certain
 
05:15:02.110 --> 05:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
guidelines to be able to perform these
 
05:15:03.830 --> 05:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
surgeries safely and that's why we are
 
05:15:05.948 --> 05:15:05.958 align:start position:0%
all here
 
05:15:08.070 --> 05:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
today thank you see you at the
 
05:15:08.080 --> 05:15:10.150 align:start position:0%
today thank you see you at the
subcommittee

05:15:10.150 --> 05:15:10.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
05:15:10.160 --> 05:15:11.390 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
representative

05:15:11.390 --> 05:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:15:13.270 --> 05:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you madam chairman and
 
05:15:15.910 --> 05:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um the
 
05:15:18.270 --> 05:15:18.280 align:start position:0%
the language as you reference accurately
 
05:15:20.628 --> 05:15:20.638 align:start position:0%
in the bill is exclusionary to what can
 
05:15:22.910 --> 05:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
be done I don't know how many procedures
 
05:15:25.990 --> 05:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
are done in Opthalmology um but where
 
05:15:28.030 --> 05:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
would the where is the Delta between
 
05:15:30.788 --> 05:15:30.798 align:start position:0%
what would be potentially done could be
 
05:15:33.150 --> 05:15:33.160 align:start position:0%
done could be legislated to be done
 
05:15:36.150 --> 05:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
versus what is excluded right now sorry
 
05:15:37.910 --> 05:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
can you repeat that that first the
 
05:15:40.350 --> 05:15:40.360 align:start position:0%
question is how many procedures would be
 
05:15:42.948 --> 05:15:42.958 align:start position:0%
done could be done that are not listed
 
05:15:44.670 --> 05:15:44.680 align:start position:0%
here you know I'm just trying to get a m
 
05:15:48.070 --> 05:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
a sense fromet or from myself from the
 
05:15:51.030 --> 05:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
optometrist in general or just opom I
 
05:15:52.270 --> 05:15:52.280 align:start position:0%
believe you know the optometrist are
 
05:15:54.150 --> 05:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
able to do somewhere around the 10 or 12
 
05:15:55.548 --> 05:15:55.558 align:start position:0%
procedures that are listed in the back
 
05:15:56.670 --> 05:15:56.680 align:start position:0%
of that blue
 
05:15:59.788 --> 05:15:59.798 align:start position:0%
book right my my question though is the
 
05:16:02.070 --> 05:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
Delta between what is potentially that
 
05:16:05.030 --> 05:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
could be done I know how many versus how
 
05:16:07.430 --> 05:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
many you know are excluded here and then
 
05:16:09.390 --> 05:16:09.400 align:start position:0%
what are we left with how many we how
 
05:16:11.390 --> 05:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
many surgeries have we left with so you
 
05:16:13.510 --> 05:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
know I think the uh if I'm understanding
 
05:16:14.590 --> 05:16:14.600 align:start position:0%
correctly and please correct me if I'm
 
05:16:16.430 --> 05:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
wrong but you know the concessions we
 
05:16:18.030 --> 05:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
made would include four other procedures
 
05:16:19.548 --> 05:16:19.558 align:start position:0%
that they asked for I think would be
 
05:16:21.830 --> 05:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
reasonable because it' be extensions of
 
05:16:23.310 --> 05:16:23.320 align:start position:0%
what they're doing but not meeting the
 
05:16:25.670 --> 05:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
definition of surgery um because we do
 
05:16:27.070 --> 05:16:27.080 align:start position:0%
find out that it's harmless because we
 
05:16:28.470 --> 05:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
feel that they're not adequately trained
 
05:16:31.470 --> 05:16:31.480 align:start position:0%
for that um if if I'm answering your
 
05:16:34.990 --> 05:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
question I I don't think so but um my
 
05:16:36.868 --> 05:16:36.878 align:start position:0%
question I think we after we study the
 
05:16:39.070 --> 05:16:39.080 align:start position:0%
blue the list of procedures in the blue
 
05:16:40.670 --> 05:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
will have a better understanding of
 
05:16:43.670 --> 05:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
what's included because the bill itself
 
05:16:45.708 --> 05:16:45.718 align:start position:0%
does not specify exactly right that's my
 
05:16:48.150 --> 05:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
question is what it what would be
 
05:16:49.708 --> 05:16:49.718 align:start position:0%
allowable how many cases would be
 
05:16:51.270 --> 05:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
allowable what are we talking hundred
 
05:16:53.150 --> 05:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
yeah so from the initial um list that we
 
05:16:55.590 --> 05:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
created that 250 something list was
 
05:16:58.070 --> 05:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
based on the the exclusion criteria what
 
05:16:59.708 --> 05:16:59.718 align:start position:0%
they could do as a result of that based
 
05:17:01.788 --> 05:17:01.798 align:start position:0%
on how Opthomologist trained okay thank
 
05:17:03.150 --> 05:17:03.160 align:start position:0%
you that answer your question yes it
 
05:17:06.270 --> 05:17:06.280 align:start position:0%
does thank you
 
05:17:10.070 --> 05:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
okay very good
 
05:17:10.080 --> 05:17:18.548 align:start position:0%
okay very good

05:17:18.548 --> 05:17:18.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:21.030 --> 05:17:21.040 align:start position:0%
rice Madam chair and uh members of the
 
05:17:22.548 --> 05:17:22.558 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very much for the
 
05:17:24.830 --> 05:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
time today I'll try and keep it snappy
 
05:17:26.270 --> 05:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
I'm here to provide a student
 
05:17:29.510 --> 05:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
perspective uh for Optometry um my name
 
05:17:31.948 --> 05:17:31.958 align:start position:0%
is Maggie Rice and I'm a resident of
 
05:17:34.470 --> 05:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
keen and I'm a fourth year Optometry
 
05:17:35.990 --> 05:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
student studying at the Massachusetts
 
05:17:38.270 --> 05:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences
 
05:17:39.628 --> 05:17:39.638 align:start position:0%
in Worcester
 
05:17:41.708 --> 05:17:41.718 align:start position:0%
next week I start my clinical rotation
 
05:17:43.628 --> 05:17:43.638 align:start position:0%
and I'll be at the Northampton VA
 
05:17:45.750 --> 05:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
providing comprehensive primary eye care
 
05:17:49.030 --> 05:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
to Veterans which is very exciting after
 
05:17:51.708 --> 05:17:51.718 align:start position:0%
completion of my doctoral program I hope
 
05:17:53.910 --> 05:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
to return to the madok region to
 
05:17:56.310 --> 05:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
practice during my four years of
 
05:17:58.590 --> 05:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
rigorous postgraduate doctorate
 
05:18:01.230 --> 05:18:01.240 align:start position:0%
education it is my privilege to be
 
05:18:03.628 --> 05:18:03.638 align:start position:0%
trained in the most current health
 
05:18:05.350 --> 05:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
research and be able to use
 
05:18:06.948 --> 05:18:06.958 align:start position:0%
top-of-the-line technology and
 
05:18:10.948 --> 05:18:10.958 align:start position:0%
techniques in my clinical um experience
 
05:18:13.310 --> 05:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
we live in a time when medical
 
05:18:15.830 --> 05:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
advancements are happening very quickly
 
05:18:17.310 --> 05:18:17.320 align:start position:0%
every year we gain a better
 
05:18:18.910 --> 05:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
understanding of the physiology of the
 
05:18:21.350 --> 05:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
eye and body treatment options for
 
05:18:24.390 --> 05:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
ocular disease are expanding and the
 
05:18:27.030 --> 05:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
technology advancements allow for safer
 
05:18:29.470 --> 05:18:29.480 align:start position:0%
more effective and more accessible
 
05:18:29.480 --> 05:18:30.628 align:start position:0%
more effective and more accessible
in-office

05:18:30.628 --> 05:18:30.638 align:start position:0%
in-office
 
05:18:34.030 --> 05:18:34.040 align:start position:0%
procedures my optimetric Education and
 
05:18:36.270 --> 05:18:36.280 align:start position:0%
Training is preparing me to be able to
 
05:18:39.470 --> 05:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
utilize the most current technology
 
05:18:41.390 --> 05:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
and techniques and it's positioning me
 
05:18:45.430 --> 05:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to uh use the most current
 
05:18:47.628 --> 05:18:47.638 align:start position:0%
technology but also grow and advance in
 
05:18:49.948 --> 05:18:49.958 align:start position:0%
the future and our New Hampshire
 
05:18:52.350 --> 05:18:52.360 align:start position:0%
statutes should allow for our health
 
05:18:55.030 --> 05:18:55.040 align:start position:0%
care providers to do just that the
 
05:18:57.350 --> 05:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
passage of SB 440 is a Strategic
 
05:18:59.948 --> 05:18:59.958 align:start position:0%
investment in the future of iare for our
 
05:19:03.510 --> 05:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
state right now outdated regulations
 
05:19:05.430 --> 05:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
prohibit New Hampshire patients from
 
05:19:07.670 --> 05:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
receiving the full benefits of an
 
05:19:10.788 --> 05:19:10.798 align:start position:0%
optometrist many years of training and
 
05:19:13.030 --> 05:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
as a result of this optometrists who
 
05:19:15.030 --> 05:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
want to practice their fullest
 
05:19:17.628 --> 05:19:17.638 align:start position:0%
capabilities are encouraged to look
 
05:19:19.628 --> 05:19:19.638 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and I think Dr Eid spoke to
 
05:19:21.990 --> 05:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
this so I'll give you an example as well
 
05:19:25.310 --> 05:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
I am the only student in my class of 50
 
05:19:28.270 --> 05:19:28.280 align:start position:0%
in Worcester who is from New Hampshire
 
05:19:30.708 --> 05:19:30.718 align:start position:0%
and I'm only one of a few who is even
 
05:19:32.270 --> 05:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
considering New Hampshire as a place to
 
05:19:35.150 --> 05:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
move to to practice and raise a family
 
05:19:36.788 --> 05:19:36.798 align:start position:0%
so unless these regulations are
 
05:19:39.948 --> 05:19:39.958 align:start position:0%
corrected New Hampshire will continue to
 
05:19:41.990 --> 05:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
struggle to attract top Quality
 
05:19:44.628 --> 05:19:44.638 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Workforce that it needs and
 
05:19:47.990 --> 05:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
deserves the passage of s440 doesn't
 
05:19:49.670 --> 05:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
only mean that New Hampshire residents
 
05:19:52.390 --> 05:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
would have better access to care now and
 
05:19:55.510 --> 05:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
in the future but also that students
 
05:19:58.270 --> 05:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
like me would see the state as a place
 
05:20:00.590 --> 05:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
where we can be the absolute best future
 
05:20:02.310 --> 05:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
doctors for our patients and that would
 
05:20:04.628 --> 05:20:04.638 align:start position:0%
really be a wonderful thing so I
 
05:20:06.470 --> 05:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
encourage members of the committee to
 
05:20:09.470 --> 05:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
vote Yes on s440 because it corrects
 
05:20:12.350 --> 05:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
restrictive and outdated Healthcare laws
 
05:20:14.270 --> 05:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
it will draw the best and brightest
 
05:20:16.430 --> 05:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
Health Care Providers to the state and
 
05:20:20.310 --> 05:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
it also expands access to uh high
 
05:20:21.708 --> 05:20:21.718 align:start position:0%
quality health care for all of New
 
05:20:23.910 --> 05:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire right now but then also in the
 
05:20:26.070 --> 05:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
future so I thank you again for your
 
05:20:27.628 --> 05:20:27.638 align:start position:0%
time and considerations and I'm happy to
 
05:20:31.190 --> 05:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:34.390 --> 05:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
you I don't see s thank
 
05:20:48.510 --> 05:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:49.910 --> 05:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam speaker thank you
 
05:20:51.390 --> 05:20:51.400 align:start position:0%
representatives for your time I know
 
05:20:53.350 --> 05:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
it's been a long day and I really
 
05:20:54.990 --> 05:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate how seriously everyone is
 
05:20:57.150 --> 05:20:57.160 align:start position:0%
taking this um my name is Katherine
 
05:20:58.910 --> 05:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
mirando I'm an opthalmologist a
 
05:21:00.510 --> 05:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
physician surgeon here in town at
 
05:21:02.590 --> 05:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
conquered Eye Center I'm a glaucoma
 
05:21:04.750 --> 05:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
specialist I'm here in strong opposition
 
05:21:07.230 --> 05:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
to Senate Bill 440 out of concern for
 
05:21:09.030 --> 05:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
the safety of my patients I have a
 
05:21:10.270 --> 05:21:10.280 align:start position:0%
biomedical engineering degree in
 
05:21:11.948 --> 05:21:11.958 align:start position:0%
addition to my medical degree and I did
 
05:21:13.948 --> 05:21:13.958 align:start position:0%
my Opthalmology residency and fellowship
 
05:21:16.548 --> 05:21:16.558 align:start position:0%
down at masser in Boston I wanted to
 
05:21:18.150 --> 05:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
quickly touch on a couple things that
 
05:21:22.390 --> 05:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
were mentioned to maybe clarify a bit um
 
05:21:23.788 --> 05:21:23.798 align:start position:0%
there was mentioned that we're not going
 
05:21:26.390 --> 05:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
to attract good optometrist to the state
 
05:21:27.868 --> 05:21:27.878 align:start position:0%
because we're not offering the things
 
05:21:29.910 --> 05:21:29.920 align:start position:0%
that they want to do that's simply not
 
05:21:31.788 --> 05:21:31.798 align:start position:0%
the case based on the numbers if we look
 
05:21:33.750 --> 05:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
at all the optometrist who left New
 
05:21:36.270 --> 05:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire none of them have filed CPT
 
05:21:38.310 --> 05:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
codes or laser codes in States elsewhere
 
05:21:40.030 --> 05:21:40.040 align:start position:0%
mean meaning they're not leaving because
 
05:21:42.310 --> 05:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
they can't do laser surgery and the
 
05:21:44.030 --> 05:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
numbers of optometrists are continually
 
05:21:46.190 --> 05:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
growing in our state there's also a
 
05:21:47.910 --> 05:21:47.920 align:start position:0%
question about providing care to
 
05:21:51.070 --> 05:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
underinsured or lowincome patients we
 
05:21:52.948 --> 05:21:52.958 align:start position:0%
actually have I'm not sure if everyone's
 
05:21:54.910 --> 05:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
aware there are uh numerous programs
 
05:21:56.390 --> 05:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
there's I Care America through the
 
05:21:59.030 --> 05:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
American Academy of Opthalmology and my
 
05:22:01.070 --> 05:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
Society with glaucoma we have uh
 
05:22:02.830 --> 05:22:02.840 align:start position:0%
glaucoma Society cares where we
 
05:22:06.390 --> 05:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
volunteer to provide free eye surgery to
 
05:22:09.510 --> 05:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
underinsured and lowincome patients
 
05:22:13.470 --> 05:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
there is also a comment earlier about um
 
05:22:15.948 --> 05:22:15.958 align:start position:0%
that these surgeries are just a natural
 
05:22:18.868 --> 05:22:18.878 align:start position:0%
progression from the didactic training
 
05:22:19.830 --> 05:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
was the
 
05:22:23.070 --> 05:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
wording um I think that's sort of
 
05:22:25.390 --> 05:22:25.400 align:start position:0%
likening a pilot who maybe goes to
 
05:22:27.590 --> 05:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
flight school and sits in a classroom
 
05:22:30.070 --> 05:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
but has never flown a plane then saying
 
05:22:31.548 --> 05:22:31.558 align:start position:0%
it's a natural progression from the
 
05:22:34.110 --> 05:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
dactic level while never actually having
 
05:22:37.830 --> 05:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
Hands-On training in a plane I would
 
05:22:39.110 --> 05:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
like in
 
05:22:41.788 --> 05:22:41.798 align:start position:0%
the change in the surgical field over
 
05:22:43.350 --> 05:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
time and opthalmologists learning new
 
05:22:45.510 --> 05:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
procedures to maybe switching from not
 
05:22:47.548 --> 05:22:47.558 align:start position:0%
that I fly a helicopter to a plane you
 
05:22:49.910 --> 05:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
know you're already operating on living
 
05:22:52.590 --> 05:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
breathing humans in the same spaces and
 
05:22:55.230 --> 05:22:55.240 align:start position:0%
just transitioning to more upgraded
 
05:22:57.070 --> 05:22:57.080 align:start position:0%
procedures they also mentioned that
 
05:22:59.750 --> 05:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
they're already doing uh procedures with
 
05:23:03.030 --> 05:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
um sharp instruments here that includes
 
05:23:05.670 --> 05:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
removing eyelashes and removing uh
 
05:23:07.628 --> 05:23:07.638 align:start position:0%
debris from the surface of the eye and I
 
05:23:10.390 --> 05:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
don't think um I just don't think that
 
05:23:12.868 --> 05:23:12.878 align:start position:0%
is a translatable skill to what exactly
 
05:23:15.510 --> 05:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here so I'll just
 
05:23:19.788 --> 05:23:19.798 align:start position:0%
lead into my piece of this which is uh
 
05:23:21.750 --> 05:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
the laser surgery being addressed in
 
05:23:23.910 --> 05:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
this bill and what exactly we're talking
 
05:23:26.110 --> 05:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
about this bill has a lot of confusing
 
05:23:28.670 --> 05:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
language about what we don't want to do
 
05:23:30.310 --> 05:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
but let's just get down to breast tax
 
05:23:32.150 --> 05:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
and talk about what uh they are looking
 
05:23:35.670 --> 05:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
to do there are three laser surgeries
 
05:23:38.390 --> 05:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
the first is called selective laser
 
05:23:41.990 --> 05:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
laser tcul plasty or SLT this is a laser
 
05:23:44.788 --> 05:23:44.798 align:start position:0%
used to lower eye pressure electively in
 
05:23:47.070 --> 05:23:47.080 align:start position:0%
glaucoma it's not an emergency usually
 
05:23:49.750 --> 05:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
used for people who have Dementia or
 
05:23:50.868 --> 05:23:50.878 align:start position:0%
difficulty with arthritis in
 
05:23:53.390 --> 05:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
administering their drops in order to do
 
05:23:55.750 --> 05:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
this laser the laser beam is aimed at
 
05:23:57.510 --> 05:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
this structure that is half a millimeter
 
05:24:00.190 --> 05:24:00.200 align:start position:0%
thick this probably looks like nothing
 
05:24:02.110 --> 05:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
to you but there's a thin line here in
 
05:24:04.030 --> 05:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
the middle it's very tiny if you aim
 
05:24:05.708 --> 05:24:05.718 align:start position:0%
here or you aim here not only will it
 
05:24:07.708 --> 05:24:07.718 align:start position:0%
not work but you can cause damage in
 
05:24:10.430 --> 05:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
order to do this laser with one hand you
 
05:24:12.948 --> 05:24:12.958 align:start position:0%
hold a lens on the eye that has a mirror
 
05:24:14.910 --> 05:24:14.920 align:start position:0%
that flips and reverses your image with
 
05:24:17.310 --> 05:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
your other hand you aim the laser at the
 
05:24:19.548 --> 05:24:19.558 align:start position:0%
spot you're treating with your foot you
 
05:24:21.510 --> 05:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
are pressing a button to apply the laser
 
05:24:23.670 --> 05:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
and you do about 100 shots in between
 
05:24:26.350 --> 05:24:26.360 align:start position:0%
every few pulses I'm adjusting the power
 
05:24:28.230 --> 05:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
so that I don't cause damage or treat
 
05:24:31.150 --> 05:24:31.160 align:start position:0%
too little it's a very active process
 
05:24:32.788 --> 05:24:32.798 align:start position:0%
the second type of laser that they want
 
05:24:35.750 --> 05:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
to perform is called um a yag iridotomy
 
05:24:37.150 --> 05:24:37.160 align:start position:0%
or an
 
05:24:40.070 --> 05:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
LPI this this laser creates a permanent
 
05:24:42.350 --> 05:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
second hole in the iris like you can see
 
05:24:44.990 --> 05:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
here can't be undone it's permanent it's
 
05:24:47.390 --> 05:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
used to treat a certain type of glaucoma
 
05:24:49.150 --> 05:24:49.160 align:start position:0%
very frequently you can get bleeding at
 
05:24:50.628 --> 05:24:50.638 align:start position:0%
the time of this procedure because there
 
05:24:52.430 --> 05:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
are blood vessels on the iris and you
 
05:24:54.628 --> 05:24:54.638 align:start position:0%
have to actively treat that and modify
 
05:24:57.628 --> 05:24:57.638 align:start position:0%
how you're doing your procedure and I
 
05:25:00.070 --> 05:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
think being more recently out of
 
05:25:02.590 --> 05:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
training I can hear and sometimes feel
 
05:25:04.868 --> 05:25:04.878 align:start position:0%
my mentors guiding my hand as I'm doing
 
05:25:06.750 --> 05:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
things and I think what exactly did they
 
05:25:08.868 --> 05:25:08.878 align:start position:0%
do when we've seen this before to help
 
05:25:11.910 --> 05:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
me through um those difficult cases the
 
05:25:13.708 --> 05:25:13.718 align:start position:0%
last type of laser that they want to
 
05:25:16.030 --> 05:25:16.040 align:start position:0%
perform is called a yag capsulotomy or
 
05:25:18.190 --> 05:25:18.200 align:start position:0%
yag cat I'm sure some of you have had
 
05:25:20.868 --> 05:25:20.878 align:start position:0%
cataract surgery in this room so
 
05:25:23.310 --> 05:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
everyone's born with a lens in their eye
 
05:25:25.670 --> 05:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
this uh diagram here they already had
 
05:25:28.470 --> 05:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
cataract surgery I describe it to my
 
05:25:30.510 --> 05:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
patients kind of like a grape that has a
 
05:25:33.030 --> 05:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
grape skin and then the material inside
 
05:25:34.510 --> 05:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
cataract surgery we scoop out the
 
05:25:37.270 --> 05:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
material inside and leave a capsule so
 
05:25:38.948 --> 05:25:38.958 align:start position:0%
here that capsule is holding the new
 
05:25:41.190 --> 05:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
lens implant and about one in three
 
05:25:43.590 --> 05:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
people it gets cloudy over time it's
 
05:25:45.788 --> 05:25:45.798 align:start position:0%
elective it's usually slow yes it's
 
05:25:48.310 --> 05:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
inconvenient but it's not Vision
 
05:25:50.270 --> 05:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
threatening in a permanent way we get
 
05:25:52.430 --> 05:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
you to the right treatment and it and it
 
05:25:54.670 --> 05:25:54.680 align:start position:0%
improves so with this laser we direct
 
05:25:57.030 --> 05:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
the laser inside the eye and create a
 
05:25:59.868 --> 05:25:59.878 align:start position:0%
permanent hole in that capsule that
 
05:26:02.310 --> 05:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
capsule is four microns thick that's one
 
05:26:04.510 --> 05:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
20th the thickness of a piece of paper
 
05:26:06.868 --> 05:26:06.878 align:start position:0%
very tiny if you're a few microns too
 
05:26:08.628 --> 05:26:08.638 align:start position:0%
forward you crack the lens and that
 
05:26:10.470 --> 05:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
patient may need a complicated lens
 
05:26:13.190 --> 05:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
transplant too far back by a few microns
 
05:26:14.670 --> 05:26:14.680 align:start position:0%
you hit the jelly here in the back of
 
05:26:16.830 --> 05:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
the eye that jelly is touching your
 
05:26:19.190 --> 05:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
retina and can cause retinal tears
 
05:26:21.430 --> 05:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
retinal Burns retinal detachments and we
 
05:26:23.110 --> 05:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
heard the unfortunate story already from
 
05:26:23.120 --> 05:26:25.310 align:start position:0%
heard the unfortunate story already from
Miss

05:26:25.310 --> 05:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
Miss
 
05:26:28.430 --> 05:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
rutage I mentioned complications already
 
05:26:30.590 --> 05:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
you have a longer packet from me with
 
05:26:32.788 --> 05:26:32.798 align:start position:0%
good citations and more about these
 
05:26:34.868 --> 05:26:34.878 align:start position:0%
complications so I don't want to belabor
 
05:26:37.670 --> 05:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
the point I think from my experience the
 
05:26:40.230 --> 05:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
most serious complication is incorrect
 
05:26:42.868 --> 05:26:42.878 align:start position:0%
patient selection and I think some of my
 
05:26:44.590 --> 05:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
colleagues have actually come to similar
 
05:26:46.628 --> 05:26:46.638 align:start position:0%
conclusions and I say this because I've
 
05:26:48.390 --> 05:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
already seen this numerous times
 
05:26:51.390 --> 05:26:51.400 align:start position:0%
numerous furls for consider LPI consider
 
05:26:54.350 --> 05:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
SLT consider yag cap when that only
 
05:26:55.750 --> 05:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
would that have been the wrong procedure
 
05:26:57.430 --> 05:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
to perform but it would have been
 
05:26:59.548 --> 05:26:59.558 align:start position:0%
harmful to that patient to perform I
 
05:27:01.708 --> 05:27:01.718 align:start position:0%
have a few examples I don't if if that
 
05:27:03.510 --> 05:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
would be interesting to you or helpful I
 
05:27:06.470 --> 05:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
can get into it otherwise um I will move
 
05:27:08.310 --> 05:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
forward so I hope this gives you a
 
05:27:09.948 --> 05:27:09.958 align:start position:0%
better understanding of the laser
 
05:27:12.548 --> 05:27:12.558 align:start position:0%
surgery being discussed in this bill I
 
05:27:14.310 --> 05:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
know the Optometry Lobby is going to try
 
05:27:16.350 --> 05:27:16.360 align:start position:0%
to say how easy and safe these are to
 
05:27:18.788 --> 05:27:18.798 align:start position:0%
perform but it's surgery a laser is a
 
05:27:20.670 --> 05:27:20.680 align:start position:0%
tool used by a surgeon just like a
 
05:27:23.628 --> 05:27:23.638 align:start position:0%
scalpel to cut manipulate or alter
 
05:27:26.310 --> 05:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
tissues and the truth is that optometry
 
05:27:29.910 --> 05:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
school has no Hands-On laser training
 
05:27:32.150 --> 05:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
with patients required and in fact 22
 
05:27:35.948 --> 05:27:35.958 align:start position:0%
schools can't even have Hands-On patient
 
05:27:38.510 --> 05:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
training I really value my colleagues in
 
05:27:40.430 --> 05:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
Optometry we are constantly working
 
05:27:42.270 --> 05:27:42.280 align:start position:0%
together in the same office and I I
 
05:27:44.590 --> 05:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
value their referrals because they're on
 
05:27:46.350 --> 05:27:46.360 align:start position:0%
the front lines and and accurate
 
05:27:48.590 --> 05:27:48.600 align:start position:0%
referrals is is what drives our practice
 
05:27:50.670 --> 05:27:50.680 align:start position:0%
to get patients the right care so I hope
 
05:27:52.510 --> 05:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
we can keep working to the highest
 
05:27:54.788 --> 05:27:54.798 align:start position:0%
levels of our training but also
 
05:27:56.948 --> 05:27:56.958 align:start position:0%
recognize our limitations so we're not
 
05:27:59.868 --> 05:27:59.878 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of our less educated or
 
05:28:01.990 --> 05:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
poor elderly citizens who don't know the
 
05:28:03.470 --> 05:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
difference I mean this is a long hearing
 
05:28:04.830 --> 05:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
to understand the difference they're not
 
05:28:07.110 --> 05:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
going to know the level of
 
05:28:09.948 --> 05:28:09.958 align:start position:0%
training so I'll I'll just end with a
 
05:28:11.510 --> 05:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
question I guess for you that if you
 
05:28:13.628 --> 05:28:13.638 align:start position:0%
needed to have laser surgery done on
 
05:28:16.070 --> 05:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
your eye would you want it done by
 
05:28:18.470 --> 05:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
someone who's done 177,000 hours of
 
05:28:20.990 --> 05:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
Hands-On clinical training and has set
 
05:28:23.150 --> 05:28:23.160 align:start position:0%
minimums or would you be okay with
 
05:28:24.390 --> 05:28:24.400 align:start position:0%
having it done by someone who did a
 
05:28:27.070 --> 05:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
weekend course on a Model eye because
 
05:28:29.070 --> 05:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
someone has to be their first
 
05:28:32.830 --> 05:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:36.628 --> 05:28:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:47.708 --> 05:28:47.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:54.030 --> 05:28:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:57.868 --> 05:28:57.878 align:start position:0%
t excellent handwriting thank you a
 
05:28:57.878 --> 05:28:59.868 align:start position:0%
t excellent handwriting thank you a
doctor's

05:28:59.868 --> 05:28:59.878 align:start position:0%
doctor's
 
05:29:02.110 --> 05:29:02.120 align:start position:0%
handwriting uh Madam chair distinguished
 
05:29:03.548 --> 05:29:03.558 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you so
 
05:29:06.150 --> 05:29:06.160 align:start position:0%
much for the time today it's been a long
 
05:29:08.150 --> 05:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
day we've heard a lot of testimony so I
 
05:29:10.510 --> 05:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate you bearing with
 
05:29:14.470 --> 05:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
us you've heard a lot and hopefully by
 
05:29:16.270 --> 05:29:16.280 align:start position:0%
now you're ging an understanding of the
 
05:29:18.910 --> 05:29:18.920 align:start position:0%
differences between the opthalmologist
 
05:29:20.788 --> 05:29:20.798 align:start position:0%
and the optometrist whether you liked it
 
05:29:22.708 --> 05:29:22.718 align:start position:0%
or not you gained an education of it and
 
05:29:24.070 --> 05:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
you know that there are differences
 
05:29:27.750 --> 05:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
between the two you learned so much and
 
05:29:29.868 --> 05:29:29.878 align:start position:0%
about the procedures how intricate they
 
05:29:32.310 --> 05:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
are how detailed they are and you should
 
05:29:35.470 --> 05:29:35.480 align:start position:0%
have heard exactly how much more there
 
05:29:37.590 --> 05:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
is in the decision the medical decision-
 
05:29:39.750 --> 05:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
making proc process than there is in the
 
05:29:41.990 --> 05:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
actual treatment itself both of those
 
05:29:45.190 --> 05:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
are so important to the whole process
 
05:29:48.948 --> 05:29:48.958 align:start position:0%
we've talked significantly about access
 
05:29:52.270 --> 05:29:52.280 align:start position:0%
and I know my colleagues um in Optometry
 
05:29:55.110 --> 05:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
are very passionate about access as are
 
05:29:57.430 --> 05:29:57.440 align:start position:0%
we and we all recognize that New
 
05:29:59.510 --> 05:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a state where the
 
05:30:01.670 --> 05:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
population has put itself south of
 
05:30:05.310 --> 05:30:05.320 align:start position:0%
conquered 80% north of conquered 20%
 
05:30:07.270 --> 05:30:07.280 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists have put themselves in
 
05:30:09.670 --> 05:30:09.680 align:start position:0%
the state south of conquer similarly as
 
05:30:12.590 --> 05:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
have optometrists and so this problem of
 
05:30:15.390 --> 05:30:15.400 align:start position:0%
access that exists we agree there is
 
05:30:17.270 --> 05:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
this problem of access but not just for
 
05:30:19.910 --> 05:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
our Specialties this is for medicine
 
05:30:22.670 --> 05:30:22.680 align:start position:0%
Nationwide when we looked at the data to
 
05:30:25.350 --> 05:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
actually review and see what was the
 
05:30:28.190 --> 05:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
access issue for our patients we saw
 
05:30:30.430 --> 05:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
that you could get to a trained
 
05:30:33.230 --> 05:30:33.240 align:start position:0%
Opthalmic surgeon within 30 minutes 90%
 
05:30:35.230 --> 05:30:35.240 align:start position:0%
of the patients surely Dr Sawyer has
 
05:30:36.788 --> 05:30:36.798 align:start position:0%
patients that have more than an hour
 
05:30:38.670 --> 05:30:38.680 align:start position:0%
travel and surely there others who could
 
05:30:40.470 --> 05:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
give us similar examples but we're
 
05:30:42.510 --> 05:30:42.520 align:start position:0%
talking about the rule not the
 
05:30:44.310 --> 05:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
exceptions and that's why we're trying
 
05:30:46.390 --> 05:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
to base good policy to answer the
 
05:30:48.150 --> 05:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
problem right you wouldn't actually
 
05:30:50.070 --> 05:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
introduce legislation that doesn't
 
05:30:52.830 --> 05:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:55.990 --> 05:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
issue we talked a little bit about the
 
05:30:58.628 --> 05:30:58.638 align:start position:0%
safety uh of this procedure and when
 
05:31:02.310 --> 05:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
it's done by Optometry and they hear Dr
 
05:31:04.470 --> 05:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
alra sat and said we all have
 
05:31:06.310 --> 05:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
complications but if you look at the
 
05:31:08.750 --> 05:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
data that's posted they have zero zero
 
05:31:12.070 --> 05:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
it strains crul it's unbelievable we
 
05:31:14.230 --> 05:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
know looking at our own data many
 
05:31:16.230 --> 05:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
thousands of cases the rates are about
 
05:31:19.510 --> 05:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
133% complication we know that's why we
 
05:31:22.470 --> 05:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
spend three years training residents
 
05:31:25.110 --> 05:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
meticulously training residents watching
 
05:31:26.830 --> 05:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
them in observation watching them
 
05:31:28.990 --> 05:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
actually doing watching them teach their
 
05:31:31.110 --> 05:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
younger residents watching them not only
 
05:31:34.070 --> 05:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
as their chief resident as I did uh but
 
05:31:36.750 --> 05:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
also as their fellow again many years of
 
05:31:38.390 --> 05:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
just watching making sure that they're
 
05:31:40.830 --> 05:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time this doesn't happen
 
05:31:42.390 --> 05:31:42.400 align:start position:0%
with our Optometric colleagues the way
 
05:31:44.590 --> 05:31:44.600 align:start position:0%
their curricula and education stands
 
05:31:47.470 --> 05:31:47.480 align:start position:0%
today and I I have the utmost respect
 
05:31:49.310 --> 05:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
and have partnered with so many on my
 
05:31:51.948 --> 05:31:51.958 align:start position:0%
right to take care of all their patients
 
05:31:55.548 --> 05:31:55.558 align:start position:0%
emergently and uh on an as needed basis
 
05:31:58.390 --> 05:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
and I the my cell my cell phone number
 
05:32:01.110 --> 05:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
is in most of these Pockets here and so
 
05:32:04.030 --> 05:32:04.040 align:start position:0%
we partner with these guys all the time
 
05:32:06.750 --> 05:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
to take care of patients and I don't
 
05:32:09.150 --> 05:32:09.160 align:start position:0%
think that when they say when they make
 
05:32:12.150 --> 05:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
statements like zero complications it
 
05:32:14.910 --> 05:32:14.920 align:start position:0%
should raise antennas because we know
 
05:32:16.948 --> 05:32:16.958 align:start position:0%
that's that can't be the case we have
 
05:32:19.990 --> 05:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
Vicky rutage here from Oklahoma that
 
05:32:22.030 --> 05:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
just tests the veracity of any comments
 
05:32:25.230 --> 05:32:25.240 align:start position:0%
like that so it should give us all pause
 
05:32:28.670 --> 05:32:28.680 align:start position:0%
and the way it stands now Dr coddle told
 
05:32:31.390 --> 05:32:31.400 align:start position:0%
us here that some of his uh students
 
05:32:32.910 --> 05:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
were very interested some of them were
 
05:32:35.110 --> 05:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
not interested but yet they all graduate
 
05:32:36.470 --> 05:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
so how am I to know the difference
 
05:32:38.110 --> 05:32:38.120 align:start position:0%
between one who's very interested and
 
05:32:40.868 --> 05:32:40.878 align:start position:0%
not interested one who's very well uh
 
05:32:42.750 --> 05:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
you know capable at the procedure and
 
05:32:44.310 --> 05:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
not if there are no minimums I don't
 
05:32:47.590 --> 05:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
know the patients won't know and even
 
05:32:50.590 --> 05:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
one Vicky rled is too many there is no
 
05:32:52.990 --> 05:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
minimum number of complications that's
 
05:32:57.030 --> 05:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
okay to you know to S to sanction this
 
05:32:59.310 --> 05:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
kind of legislation for me that's why
 
05:33:02.350 --> 05:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
we're all here because remember
 
05:33:04.270 --> 05:33:04.280 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists and optometrists work
 
05:33:06.628 --> 05:33:06.638 align:start position:0%
together in the same clinics the owners
 
05:33:08.190 --> 05:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
of those practices of our
 
05:33:10.310 --> 05:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists would benefit from this
 
05:33:12.510 --> 05:33:12.520 align:start position:0%
legislation financially right more
 
05:33:14.430 --> 05:33:14.440 align:start position:0%
operators doing surgery but yet here we
 
05:33:17.830 --> 05:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
all are galvanized in opposition because
 
05:33:20.430 --> 05:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
nothing would Trump patient safety
 
05:33:22.110 --> 05:33:22.120 align:start position:0%
nothing there's no amount of money that
 
05:33:23.430 --> 05:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
would trump
 
05:33:27.548 --> 05:33:27.558 align:start position:0%
it the fiscal impact of this for us that
 
05:33:29.230 --> 05:33:29.240 align:start position:0%
some have uh some have
 
05:33:31.548 --> 05:33:31.558 align:start position:0%
said uh will be the reason we're
 
05:33:33.190 --> 05:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
protecting our market share and that's
 
05:33:35.510 --> 05:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
why we're our opposition of this bill
 
05:33:37.830 --> 05:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
that's where it's a foundation is the
 
05:33:40.708 --> 05:33:40.718 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact I've just shown you that
 
05:33:43.548 --> 05:33:43.558 align:start position:0%
it would be little to none for us this
 
05:33:46.548 --> 05:33:46.558 align:start position:0%
is particularly solely about safety for
 
05:33:49.948 --> 05:33:49.958 align:start position:0%
us we don't want to see any Vicky rutage
 
05:33:51.470 --> 05:33:51.480 align:start position:0%
like patients in our office we don't
 
05:33:54.270 --> 05:33:54.280 align:start position:0%
want to deal with those complications
 
05:33:56.948 --> 05:33:56.958 align:start position:0%
that will arise when you put operators
 
05:33:58.910 --> 05:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
in their present level of training and
 
05:34:01.030 --> 05:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
in their curricula when you put them out
 
05:34:02.910 --> 05:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
into practice for all of us to Bear
 
05:34:05.750 --> 05:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
witness to their learning curve we don't
 
05:34:07.030 --> 05:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
want to do that we don't want to do that
 
05:34:08.910 --> 05:34:08.920 align:start position:0%
in this state we
 
05:34:12.470 --> 05:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
think we're pretty sure that's why the
 
05:34:14.548 --> 05:34:14.558 align:start position:0%
last 13 states that where this
 
05:34:16.350 --> 05:34:16.360 align:start position:0%
legislation has come up it has been
 
05:34:16.360 --> 05:34:18.270 align:start position:0%
legislation has come up it has been
struck

05:34:18.270 --> 05:34:18.280 align:start position:0%
struck
 
05:34:20.830 --> 05:34:20.840 align:start position:0%
down we are sure that by the majority
 
05:34:23.350 --> 05:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
while they make it may make say this is
 
05:34:25.948 --> 05:34:25.958 align:start position:0%
happening as Dr Cell told us to get on
 
05:34:28.390 --> 05:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
board I won't get on board because
 
05:34:30.868 --> 05:34:30.878 align:start position:0%
patient safety is too important for the
 
05:34:33.708 --> 05:34:33.718 align:start position:0%
for me uh in this facet to just get on
 
05:34:35.190 --> 05:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
board and go with it I don't believe it
 
05:34:37.750 --> 05:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
is an inevitable wave that's coming I do
 
05:34:39.390 --> 05:34:39.400 align:start position:0%
think we have to look at the data and
 
05:34:41.628 --> 05:34:41.638 align:start position:0%
stay away from Hyperbole and anecdotes
 
05:34:43.310 --> 05:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
and just trust the data that's why in
 
05:34:45.270 --> 05:34:45.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I will be available to
 
05:34:47.628 --> 05:34:47.638 align:start position:0%
answer those
 
05:34:51.030 --> 05:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um I do have one
 
05:34:52.390 --> 05:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
question do you know how many
 
05:34:55.150 --> 05:34:55.160 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists there are in New
 
05:34:57.868 --> 05:34:57.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire anybody sure one of my
 
05:35:01.110 --> 05:35:01.120 align:start position:0%
colleagues I thought it was 70 plus 70
 
05:35:02.750 --> 05:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
plus thank
 
05:35:07.948 --> 05:35:07.958 align:start position:0%
you I think I think more important
 
05:35:13.510 --> 05:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
for me um is the damage um that this
 
05:35:17.788 --> 05:35:17.798 align:start position:0%
legislation had done is once
 
05:35:21.070 --> 05:35:21.080 align:start position:0%
complimentary pieces and will do if
 
05:35:23.430 --> 05:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
passed once complimentary pieces in New
 
05:35:26.548 --> 05:35:26.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to help take care of all the
 
05:35:28.868 --> 05:35:28.878 align:start position:0%
vision problems that our Granite Staters
 
05:35:31.190 --> 05:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
have now they are seen as
 
05:35:33.510 --> 05:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
Alternatives uh competitors to each
 
05:35:35.470 --> 05:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
other that relationship between the
 
05:35:37.788 --> 05:35:37.798 align:start position:0%
optometrist and the Opthomologist is so
 
05:35:40.030 --> 05:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
important and legislation like this is
 
05:35:43.350 --> 05:35:43.360 align:start position:0%
fracturing it and patients will suffer
 
05:35:43.360 --> 05:35:44.150 align:start position:0%
fracturing it and patients will suffer
for

05:35:44.150 --> 05:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:35:46.948 --> 05:35:46.958 align:start position:0%
it I I don't want this kind of
 
05:35:48.868 --> 05:35:48.878 align:start position:0%
legislation to pass specifically for
 
05:35:50.670 --> 05:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
that reason I would be the if the
 
05:35:53.230 --> 05:35:53.240 align:start position:0%
training was changed in the optimetric
 
05:35:57.310 --> 05:35:57.320 align:start position:0%
community such that hours of of of laser
 
05:35:58.990 --> 05:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
and surgical training were applied such
 
05:36:00.868 --> 05:36:00.878 align:start position:0%
that minimums were guaranteed such that
 
05:36:03.270 --> 05:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
watch door uh or organizations like the
 
05:36:05.670 --> 05:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
AC gme would come to every Optometric
 
05:36:07.990 --> 05:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
school and ensure that their graduates
 
05:36:09.868 --> 05:36:09.878 align:start position:0%
were uh graduating with minimums and
 
05:36:13.230 --> 05:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
there was a National Standard sign me up
 
05:36:16.910 --> 05:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
let's do it but until that happens it
 
05:36:19.590 --> 05:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
can't be okayed by legislation on the
 
05:36:22.030 --> 05:36:22.040 align:start position:0%
back end this should be a national
 
05:36:24.110 --> 05:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
Grassroots effort to change the way
 
05:36:27.470 --> 05:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
Optometry is taught and practice at the
 
05:36:30.030 --> 05:36:30.040 align:start position:0%
level of the curricula in the schools
 
05:36:32.708 --> 05:36:32.718 align:start position:0%
not with legislation state by
 
05:36:37.070 --> 05:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
state they continue to say what where
 
05:36:39.948 --> 05:36:39.958 align:start position:0%
where if if this legislation causes
 
05:36:43.190 --> 05:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
problems where are where are they we're
 
05:36:46.070 --> 05:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
wondering the same it could be if I
 
05:36:47.750 --> 05:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
would offer that when you're faced with
 
05:36:49.390 --> 05:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
a patient who suffered a complication
 
05:36:52.670 --> 05:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
either delayed diagnosis or
 
05:36:55.190 --> 05:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
misdiagnosis or in in these states where
 
05:36:56.750 --> 05:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
the procedures are allowed complications
 
05:36:58.910 --> 05:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
from the procedure itself the doctor and
 
05:37:01.070 --> 05:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
the patient are not engaged in
 
05:37:04.510 --> 05:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
culpability that's my last concern uh
 
05:37:04.520 --> 05:37:06.510 align:start position:0%
culpability that's my last concern uh
whether

05:37:06.510 --> 05:37:06.520 align:start position:0%
whether
 
05:37:09.548 --> 05:37:09.558 align:start position:0%
uh it's specifically the patient in
 
05:37:10.948 --> 05:37:10.958 align:start position:0%
front of me and the problem that they're
 
05:37:13.670 --> 05:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
presenting with that I'm focused on and
 
05:37:15.190 --> 05:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
culpability is the furthest thing from
 
05:37:17.390 --> 05:37:17.400 align:start position:0%
my mind at that time until I can
 
05:37:20.310 --> 05:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
guarantee the best outcome for my
 
05:37:24.310 --> 05:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
patient now originally from
 
05:37:27.110 --> 05:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan moved here from
 
05:37:30.310 --> 05:37:30.320 align:start position:0%
Missouri I am a granted stator now
 
05:37:32.390 --> 05:37:32.400 align:start position:0%
because I married a girl from Bedford
 
05:37:35.510 --> 05:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
and here I will stay and it I will be in
 
05:37:38.110 --> 05:37:38.120 align:start position:0%
opposition to bills and bills like this
 
05:37:40.190 --> 05:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
that put patients in danger because it's
 
05:37:42.628 --> 05:37:42.638 align:start position:0%
my duty not just for the time that I'm
 
05:37:44.628 --> 05:37:44.638 align:start position:0%
in practice but it it's going to be my
 
05:37:46.390 --> 05:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
legacy to the
 
05:37:48.750 --> 05:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
state I have time for any
 
05:37:52.030 --> 05:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very
 
05:37:54.430 --> 05:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
much all right don't see any questions
 
05:37:57.310 --> 05:37:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:00.270 --> 05:38:00.280 align:start position:0%
moment all right is there anyone else
 
05:38:04.470 --> 05:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:08.788 --> 05:38:08.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:11.510 --> 05:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
no they've already uh we've already
 
05:38:13.628 --> 05:38:13.638 align:start position:0%
gotten a good supply of them in that
 
05:38:15.990 --> 05:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
case I'm closing the public hearing it
 
05:38:18.390 --> 05:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
will be going to subcommittee and it
 
05:38:21.230 --> 05:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
needs to be voted out of this committee
 
05:38:21.240 --> 05:38:36.430 align:start position:0%
needs to be voted out of this committee
by

05:38:36.430 --> 05:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
